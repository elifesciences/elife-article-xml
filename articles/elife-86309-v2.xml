of diabetes, and low body mass index (BMI); however, high levels of circulating adiponectin are also associated with increased mortality in the 60–70 age group. In this study, we aimed to clarify factors associated with circulating high-molecular-weight (cHMW) adiponectin levels and their association with mortality in the very old (85–89 years of age) and centenarians.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>The study included 812 (women: 84.4%) for centenarians and 1498 (women: 51.7%) for the very old. The genomic DNA sequence data were obtained by whole-genome sequencing or DNA microarray-imputation methods. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and multivariate regression analyses were used to evaluate cHMW adiponectin characteristics and associated factors. All-cause mortality was analyzed in three quantile groups of cHMW adiponectin levels using Cox regression.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>The cHMW adiponectin levels were increased significantly beyond 100 years of age, were negatively associated with diabetes prevalence, and were associated with SNVs in <italic>CDH13</italic> (p=2.21 × 10<sup>-22</sup>) and <italic>ADIPOQ</italic> (p=5.72 × 10<sup>-7</sup>). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that genetic variants, BMI, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) were the main factors associated with cHMW adiponectin levels in the very old, whereas the BMI showed no association in centenarians. The hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in the intermediate and high cHMW adiponectin groups in very old men were significantly higher rather than those for all-cause mortality in the low-level cHMW adiponectin group, even after adjustment with BMI. In contrast, the hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were significantly higher for high cHMW adiponectin groups in very old women, but were not significant after adjustment with BMI.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>cHMW adiponectin levels increased with age until centenarians, and the contribution of known major factors associated with cHMW adiponectin levels, including BMI and HDLC, varies with age, suggesting that its physiological significance also varies with age in the oldest old.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This study was supported by

vital role in metabolism, including lipid and glucose metabolism, and occurs in circulation at concentrations of up to 0.05% of total plasma protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Scherer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ye and Scherer, 2013</xref>). Circulating adiponectin forms three major multimer complexes, including a trimer, hexamer, and high-molecular-weight form. Among these forms, circulating high-molecular-weight (cHMW) adiponectin shows more potent biological activity than that of the other two forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pajvani et al., 2003</xref>). Previous studies in the mouse model studies have shown that cHMW adiponectin enhances insulin sensitivity and plasma lipid clearance; high levels of cHMW adiponectin improve the stability of lipid homeostasis and provided systemic tolerance to obesity under normal physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Combs et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qiao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Asterholm and Scherer, 2010</xref>). Adiponectin knock-out mice showed mild or moderate insulin resistance, which is exacerbated by a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kubota et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maeda et al., 2002</xref>). However, adiponectin knock-out mice are viable under regular physiological conditions, indicating that adiponectin is not essential for survival under regular dietary conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kubota et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maeda et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, adiponectin function is considered inconspicuous under normal conditions and should become prominent under physiological stress such as hyperglycemia.</p><p>In humans, adiponectin shows strong negative associations with body mass index (BMI), the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arita et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamczak et al., 2003</xref>). However, high levels of adiponectin have also been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adults in their 60s and 70s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kizer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poehls et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim-Mitsuyama et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2015</xref>). These contradictory findings indicate that environmental and related physiological changes could alter the level and function of adiponectin; therefore, the analysis of adiponectin in adults aged 80 years and older would be essential to elucidate the significance of adiponectin in aging.</p><p>Centenarians are individuals aged 100 years and older and characterized by a low incidence of life-threatening diseases, such as CVD and T2DM. They serve as potential models for successful aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arai et al., 2015</xref>). Previous studies have reported that cHMW adiponectin levels increase with age and, specifically, that centenarians show comparatively high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cnop et al., 2003</xref>). Low BMI may contribute to high adiponectin levels and insulin resistance in older adults ages above 60 years, and transgenic mouse models have shown prolonged health span and median lifespan. However, the physiological significance of high cHMW adiponectin levels in adults aged above 80 years is still unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muratsu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 2022</xref>). To provide evidence for understanding the physiological function and significance of adiponectin in the oldest old, this study aimed to determine the status and factors associated with cHMW adiponectin levels in 2310 adults aged ≥85 years, including 812 centenarians.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study populations</title><p>We used data from four prospective cohort studies of the oldest old in Japan: the Tokyo Centenarian Study (TCS) and Japanese Semi-supercentenarian Study (JSS) for centenarians and the Tokyo Oldest Old Survey on Total Health (TOOTH) and Kawasaki Aging Wellbeing Project (KAWP) for the very old (aged 85–99 years). Recruitment was conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gondo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Takayama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sasaki et al., 2021b</xref>). From the TCS and JSS, 155 participants were excluded due to a lack of cHMW adiponectin level data; thus, 812 centenarians were enrolled (127 men and 685 women with a median age of 105.3 [interquartile range (IQR): 100.9–106.8] and 106.0 years [IQR: 103.9–107.2], respectively). The TOOTH and KAWP surveys are community-based prospective cohort studies of individuals between 85 and 102 years (TOOTH) and 85 and 90 years (KAWP), respectively. Data for 542 (236 men and 306 women) and 1026 (513 men and 513 women) individual medical examinations are included in the TOOTH and KAWP studies, respectively. Of these, 63 individuals from the TOOTH study were excluded because they were older than 90, and 7 individuals from the KAWP study were excluded due to a lack of cHMW adiponectin level data; thus, 1498 individuals were enrolled as the very old (724 men and 774 women with a median age of 86.9 [IQR: 85.9–88.2] and 87.0 years [IQR: 86.0–88.4], respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>All of the KAWP, TOOTH, TCS, and JSS have been managed by the Center for Supercentenarian Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine.

To evaluate the effects of cHMW adiponectin levels on mortality in the very old and centenarians, hazard ratios of all-cause mortality were analyzed using Cox promotional hazards models for three quantiles of cHMW adiponectin levels (i.e., high, intermediate, and low) in 1425 very old (678 men and 747 women) and 545 centenarians (90 men and 455 women) for whom both survival time information and a number of covariates were available. Prior to the analysis, the availability of sufficient samples and events for all-cause mortality were ensured for the survival analysis of the very old and centenarian women and there was no significant difference in the proportional hazards assumption of the cHMW adiponectin level and each of the covariates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). However, the statistical power analysis indicated that there were not sufficient events, and samples were ensured for the centenarian men even if they were divided into two groups.

As a result, the hazard ratios of all-cause mortality for intermediate and high levels of cHMW adiponectin groups in very old men were significantly higher (HR: 1.67 and 2.32) rather than those of the all-cause mortality of the low cHMW adiponectin level group (reference), even after adjustment for BMI (HR: 1.60 and 2.12).

Therefore, we are further elucidating whether the increment of cHMW adiponectin level with age extends into very old and exceptionally old age. Meta-GWAS with cHMW adiponectin levels revealed that the SNVs of two loci containing the promoter regions of <italic>CDH13</italic> and <italic>ADIPOQ</italic> genes were associated with cHMW adiponectin levels. The levels of HDLC were associated with those of cHMW adiponectin both in the very old and centenarians, though the association with BMI was relatively weaker in centenarians. The multivariate regression analysis with factor selection using the LASSO method revealed that genetic variants, BMI, and lipids were major factors associated with cHMW adiponectin level in the very old; here, BMI was not selected as an associated factor in centenarians. The analysis of deviance revealed that the contribution of known factors to cHMW adiponectin levels decreased in centenarian women, suggesting that the major factors in the very old would not be responsible for the age-dependent increase in cHMW adiponectin levels. The high cHMW adiponectin levels in very old men were associated with all-cause mortality independently of BMI; however, no association was observed between the cHMW adiponectin levels and all-cause mortality in very old and centenarian women. Therefore, the contribution of known major factors associated with cHMW adiponectin levels, including BMI and lipid content, varies with age, suggesting that its physiological significance also varies with age in the oldest old.</p><p>The salutary effects of adiponectin on glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, and chronic low-grade inflammation, and the inverse association between the incidence of T2DM and cHMW adiponectin levels are known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kadowaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lindsay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Spranger et al., 2003</xref>). We have previously reported that a low incidence of T2DM is a characteristic of centenarians; therefore, we deduced that the high cHMW adiponectin levels in centenarians would be partially influenced by a low incidence of T2DM. In the present study, the T2DM group showed significantly lower levels of cHMW adiponectin, regardless of the cohort, suggesting the physiological significance of cHMW adiponectin levels in the context of insulin sensitivity and T2DM incidence is consistent across ages.</p><p>We revealed that very old men with high cHMW adiponectin levels show high rates of all-cause mortality, consistent with previous reports for adults in their 60s and 70s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kizer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poehls et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim-Mitsuyama et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, cHMW adiponectin levels were associated with all-cause mortality independently of BMI. Excess weight loss can cause frailty in the oldest old, exacerbating mortality rates and death due to pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Falcone et al., 2012</xref>). Based on these results, we deduced that a combination of high cHMW adiponectin levels and low BMI may exert synergistic effects in the mortality among very old men. We also revealed that high cHMW adiponectin levels were not associated with mortality both in very old and centenarian women. Surprisingly, strength of the association between BMI and cHMW adiponectin level decreased in centenarians. Although the major factors associated with cHMW adiponectin level in centenarians were unknown, these results suggest that the factors associated with cHMW adiponectin levels vary with age, which would also alter the physiological significance of cHMW adiponectin level as it relates to mortality.</p><p>Frailty is an important concept in health maintenance and the process of functional decline in the oldest old. Recently, plasma adiponectin levels have been positively associated with frailty in the oldest old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nagasawa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). In our cohort, most centenarians were classified as frail according to the current frailty criteria, so it is difficult to assess frailty in centenarians. For the very old, only the KAWP, one of the cohorts that included the very old, collected sufficient data to assess frailty. Using these limited data for the very old, we analyzed the distribution of cHMW adiponectin levels in each frailty category and analyzed their association with the revised J-CHS frailty index criteria using multiple regression analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Satake and Arai, 2020</xref>). As a result, we found that cHMW adiponectin levels were significantly associated with frailty, both in very old men and women (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). The cHMW adiponectin level was also significantly associated with frailty in very old women even after adjustment for BMI; however, no significant association was observed in very old men after adjustment by BMI. Thus, cHMW adiponectin levels would be associated with frailty in the very old, especially in women.</p><p>Although cHMW adiponectin levels increased with age, their association with BMI was comparatively lower in centenarians than that in the very old. This raises the question of which cells are responsible for the increased expression of adiponectin with aging. One hypothesis is that the clearance mechanism of adiponectin from the blood may be impaired by reduced kidney function, resulting in an accumulation of cHMW adiponectin. However, we did not observe a significant association between the levels of cHMW adiponectin and plasma cystatin C, one of the kidney function markers. Another hypothesis is that aging would cause ectopic <italic>ADIPOQ</italic> gene expression, increasing cHMW adiponectin levels. Re-analysis of in silico mouse single-cell transcriptomic data revealed that a small number of cells derived from subcutaneous adipose tissue expressed high levels of <italic>ADIPOQ,</italic> including brown, gonadal, mesenteric, and subcutaneous adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tabula Muris Consortium, 2020</xref>). Furthermore, a re-analysis of mouse whole-body single-cell transcriptomic data from 24 tissues during 1–30 months of age revealed that <italic>ADIPOQ</italic> mRNA was rarely expressed in tissues other than the fat tissue, even at advanced ages of 24, 27, and 30 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s8">Figure 5—figure supplement 8</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tabula Muris Consortium, 2020</xref>). These findings indicate that no universal mechanism between humans and mice would exist to induce cHMW adiponectin through ectopic expression of the <italic>ADIPOQ</italic> gene by aging.</p><p>The study had the following limitations: (1) Surveys for centenarians tend to have many missing values due to their limited physical and cognitive function; therefore, multivariate analysis using a series of covariates tends to reduce the number of samples to be analyzed. (2) Although the short survival time of centenarian in this showed no association between cHMW adiponectin level and all-cause mortality in this study, strong factors associated with survival, such as NTproBNP and ALB, tend to be detectable, while weaker factors are more difficult to detect. (3) Cox regression for all-cause mortality in centenarian men and cause-specific mortality in the very old men was statistically underpowered due to the insufficient size of samples and/or events. CVD mortality in very old men showed a trend to be associated with cHMW adiponectin levels, but statistically, twice the number of events or twice the number of total samples are needed to assess this. (4) Analysis of cHMW adiponectin levels and frailty in centenarians is difficult because most centenarians would be classified as frail according to the current frailty criteria. Of the two cohort studies of very old participants, the TOOTH study did not have sufficient data adjusted for the evaluation of J-CHS frailty criteria. Therefore, the association between cHMW adiponectin levels and frailty was analyzed in selected samples derived only from the KAWP study. This was only a cross-sectional analysis, and further analysis would be needed to prove causality. Therefore, these are described only in the Discussion section.</p><p>In this study, we verified the association among cHMW adiponectin level, BMI, and all-cause mortality in the very old and centenarians. Due to changes in the physiological significance of BMI between young and old ages, the appropriate BMI value is expected to vary with age. While a low BMI is recommended at a young age due to the risk of diabetes and metabolic syndrome, a high (though not excessively high) BMI is recommended at a later stage of life to decrease the risk of frailty and mortality. Therefore, the biological significance of cHMW adiponectin levels would also be changed depending on the biological significance of BMI in the aging process. The reasons for the high cHMW adiponectin levels and loss of association with BMI in centenarians remain unknown; however, future research should focus on identifying cells that expressing adiponectin, which should clarify its physiological significance in the oldest old.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>received consulting fees from SanBio Co.Ltd and K Pharma Inc, and participates on the Advisory Board for both SanBio Co.Ltd and K Pharma Inc.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sandra Aleksic (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. We trust that the reviewers' feedback will be helpful to you in preparing the revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Conclusions about survival are not supported by data. Only one adjusted survival analysis is presented (very old men) and in that analysis adiponectin levels were not significantly associated with mortality after adjustment for BMI and other confounders. Other survival analyses are presented as unadjusted KM curves with log-rank tests, frequently with small numbers of participants and with crossing survival curves (questioning the assumption of proportional hazards).</p><p>2) One potentially interesting finding is a possible greater mortality in very old men with low BMI and high adiponectin, compared to other combinations of BMI and adiponectin tertiles, including low BMI and mid and low adiponectin, which suggests that it is possible that some of the association between adiponectin and mortality is independent of the BMI at that time point (literature suggests that mortality association of adiponectin is abolished when adjusted for weight loss and low muscle mass in older adults PMID: 29438496).</p><p>3) There is a substantial unexplained missingness of data. More than two-thirds of the participants in the very old group are missing mortality data and the reason for this was not provided. More than one-half of centenarians are not included in multivariate analysis of predictors of adiponectin levels and the explanation for the missingness is not provided.</p><p>4) There appears to be a missed opportunity to analyze or comment on the prevalence of SNVs associated with adiponectin levels in the centenarians vs. the very old or general background population. Studying centenarians as a phenotype is challenging because one cannot discern whether observed phenotypes are protective (&quot;What got them to centenarian age&quot;), adaptive or maladaptive with regards to aging-related physiologic changes, or an end-of-life phenotype. One exception to this comment is genetic variants that are present in centenarians with different frequencies compared to usual survival populations which can give us an idea about potentially protective (if enriched in centenarians) or detrimental variants (if not present in centenarians) for longevity. It would be interesting to know how the prevalence of identified genetic variants associated with adiponectin in centenarians compares to usual survival populations' prevalence as this could hint if adiponectin is protective or detrimental for exceptional longevity.</p><p>5) Some of the key covariates may need redefining. For instance, the paper describes that diabetes mellitus was defined by the level of A1c, without mention of the use of diabetes medications (a person with A1c of &lt;6.5% might still have diabetes which is treated). BMI categorization should be reconsidered as a metabolic risk in Asian populations that occurs at lower levels of BMI, which is why many researchers and clinicians define overweight and obesity at lower BMI levels in Asian individuals.</p><p>6) What was the significance of taking the age range 85-89 as very old in this study taking in context with lifespan in the Japanese population? Please clarify. Why was it restricted to a 5-year time period rather than 80-89? Was it something to do with the available cohort?</p><p>7) What was the distribution of adiponectin levels in the cohort? Were their outliers present? How were outlier adiponectin levels handled in this study? What was the strategy implemented? Did it have an impact on the study?</p><p>8) Please mention the method used in the estimation of Adiponectin in the manuscript as it is the main component. Though from reference it's known that it is estimated by ELISA. Mention that in the manuscript itself as well as standardization and quality checks carried out.</p><p>9) Is gender distribution in this study representing population structure? How is the gender distribution of centenarians as well as the very old range in Japan?</p><p>10) Have the authors checked the power of the analysis and as well as checked the assumptions of the Cox model?

In this study, Sasaki and colleagues aimed to investigate factors associated with circulating high-molecular weight (cHMW) adiponectin levels and the associations between cHMW levels and mortality, among n=1,498 very old (age 85-89 years, 51.7% women) and n=812 centenarians (age &gt;= 100, 84.4% women) from several study cohorts in Japan. This study design is primarily cross-sectional, with longitudinal measurements of adiponectin in a subset of very old participants and follow-up for mortality in another subset of participants. The study confirmed previously published associations between single nucleotide variants (SNV) in genes CDH13 (T-cadherin) and ADIPOQ (adiponectin gene) with adiponectin levels, and that adiponectin levels increase with age. The study also identified that metabolic factors traditionally associated with greater cHMW adiponectin (higher HDL, lower BMI) while associated with adiponectin in very old, have weaker associations with adiponectin in centenarians, especially centenarian men. They also conclude that high levels of cHMW adiponectin in very old men with low BMI are predictive of mortality, while adiponectin was not a significant mortality predictor in very old women or centenarian men or women.</p><p>The study provides useful data for the field of metabolic aspects of aging and longevity but it could be strengthened and extended by addressing the noted weaknesses.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>– Large cohort of very old and centenarian individuals;</p><p>– Longitudinal measurements of adiponectin levels in a subset of participants confirming the observed cross-sectional age trend showing that adiponectin levels continue to increase into a very old age (included data until the age of 90);</p><p>– A wide range of available covariates;</p><p>– Sex-stratified analyses which address sex as a biological variable;</p><p>– Insightful comments about different physiologic meanings of BMI/adiposity in very old and centenarians (higher BMI protective) vs. younger individuals (higher BMI harmful).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>– Conclusions about survival are not supported by data.

Other survival analyses are presented as unadjusted KM curves with log-rank tests, frequently with small numbers of participants and with crossing survival curves (questioning the assumption of proportional hazards). One potentially interesting finding is a possible greater mortality in very old men with low BMI and high adiponectin, compared to other combinations of BMI and adiponectin tertiles, including low BMI and mid and low adiponectin, which suggests that it is possible that some of the association between adiponectin and mortality is independent of the BMI at that time point (literature suggests that mortality association of adiponectin is abolished when adjusted for weight loss and low muscle mass in older adults PMID: 29438496).</p><p>– There is a substantial unexplained missingness of data.

More than one-half of centenarians are not included in multivariate analysis of predictors of adiponectin levels and the explanation for the missingness is not provided.</p><p>– There appears to be a missed opportunity to analyze or comment on the prevalence of SNVs associated with adiponectin levels in the centenarians vs. very old or general background population. Studying centenarians as a phenotype is challenging because one cannot discern whether observed phenotypes are protective (&quot;What got them to centenarian age&quot;), adaptive or maladaptive with regards to aging-related physiologic changes, or an end-of-life phenotype. One exception to this comment is genetic variants that are present in centenarians with different frequencies compared to usual survival populations which can give us an idea about potentially protective (if enriched in centenarians) or detrimental variants (if not present in centenarians) for longevity. It would be interesting to know how the prevalence of identified genetic variants associated with adiponectin in centenarians compares to usual survival populations' prevalence as this could hint if adiponectin is protective or detrimental for exceptional longevity.</p><p>– Some of the key covariates may need redefining. For instance, the paper describes that diabetes mellitus was defined by the level of A1c, without mention of the use of diabetes medications (a person with A1c of &lt;6.5% might still have diabetes which is treated).

In this paper, authors take a step forward to understand the distribution of adiponectin distribution in very old (85-89 years old) and centenarians. The authors have successfully presented valuable insights into this distribution as well as looked at its impact on mortality influenced by other physiological factors. Interestingly, authors have also investigated genetic variants associated with adiponectin levels in these groups using genome-wide approaches. This has led to the successful identification of genetic variants in CDH13 and ADIPOQ to be associated with adiponectin expression. In very older men, having low BMI and higher adiponectin levels were found to be a risk for mortality but not for very older women as well as in centenarians.</p><p>The positive part of this study is that it provides a picture of adiponectin distribution in these age groups and finds its implications which can be used as a reference study in the field. One concern might be the low sample size in the subgroup analysis where participants were stratified based on adiponectin level and BMI which has to be discussed in the limitation of the study. Another interesting point to look forward to is the impact of age itself in driving outcomes in this study including mortality. In centenarians, more than 99% of participants died in course of the study meaning more than adiponectin, it was complex age-associated multifactorial changes happenings which might be regulating mortality. It would be also interesting to look at the adiponectin levels in the missing age group of 90-100 years in the future.</p><p>The manuscript presents a detailed description of cHMW adiponectin levels in the very old and centenarians. Authors have looked at the impact of other factors influencing adiponectin levels including BMI as well as even ran a genome-wide analysis finding significant variants associated with adiponectin expression. Overall this manuscript is well-planned and provides a comprehensive overview of adiponectin and its influences on the elder population. There are some clarifications required.</p><p>1) Low incidence of Diabetes was reported in the centenarians. Was it because participants with diabetes were filtered out of the population with age? Will that have an effect on the adiponectin level association with diabetes with age?</p><p>2) Participants who were presented with ages between 89-100 were excluded from the analysis. Why are they represented in Figure 1b?</p><p>3) High level of Adiponectin was not associated with mortality in centenarians. Is that mainly because age itself is a risk to death or time to death is very low for adiponectin to have an effect? Also, 99% of participants succumbed to death in course of the study.</p><p>4) What was the mean or median follow-up time in Cox proportional hazard model in various groups?</p><p>5) Was GWAS adjusted for age or just gender? In the methods, its states model was adjusted with gender What other variables were included in the model? If not adjusted with age, why?</p><p>6) The writing has been acceptable throughout the manuscript except for the Abstract. I would like the authors to make the abstract more precise.</p><p>7) Based on adiponectin level grouping has been done into three groups which had again grouped into multiple groups based on BMI. This might be taking the power of the analysis. Is it possible to have two group classifications like &quot;high&quot; level of adiponectin against &quot;rest&quot; or the reverse and then subgrouping based on BMI?</p><p>8) It would be important to highlight a lower number of participants in subgroup analysis. Maybe the lower number of participants influencing the results and maybe it won't be perfect to come up with a precise conclusion.

The KAWP cohort did not have survival information for the very old. However, we recently had access to the survival information, so we re-analyzed the survival analysis against the very old using the Cox proportional hazards method. We have also added information for the proportional hazards assumption (Supplementary Figures 7-8).

To evaluate the effects of cHMW adiponectin levels on mortality in the very old and centenarians, hazard ratios of all-cause mortality were analyzed using Cox promotional hazards models for three quantiles of cHMW adiponectin levels (i.e., high, intermediate, and low) in 1,425 very old (678 men and 747 women) and 545 centenarians (90 men and 455 women) for whom both survival time information and a number of covariates were available. Prior to the analysis, the availability of sufficient samples and events for all-cause mortality were ensured for the survival analysis of the very old and centenarian women and there was no significant difference in the proportional hazards assumption of the cHMW adiponectin level and each of the covariates (Supplementary Figures 7-8). However, statistical power analysis indicated that there were insufficient events and the samples were ensured for the centenarian men even when they were divided into two groups. Within the follow-up periods, 145 (21.3%) men and 101 (13.5%) women died in the very old, whereas 89 (98.9%) men and 542 (99.4%) women died in the centenarians (Figure 5 and Supplementary File 1). As a result, the hazard ratios of all-cause mortality for intermediate and high levels of cHMW adiponectin groups in very old men were significantly higher (HR: 1.67 and 2.32) rather than those of the all-cause mortality of the low cHMW adiponectin level group (reference), even after adjustment for BMI (HR: 1.60 and 2.12). In contrast, the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was significantly higher for the high cHMW adiponectin levels group in very old women was significantly higher (HR: 1.89), but was not significant after adjustment for BMI (HR: 1.41, (Figure 5)). This trend was also observed in the centenarian women.</p><p>To further elucidate the factors associated with mortality, we also analyzed cause-specific mortality associated with cancer, CVD, and pneumonia in the very old (Figure 5—figure supplements 3–5).

This is a very important point and there are few previous reports on this factor. However, frailty analysis for centenarians is difficult because most centenarians would be classified as frail using the current frailty criteria. For the very old, only the KAWP, one of the very old cohorts, collected sufficient data to calculate frailty.</p><p>Therefore, results from previous publications and analyses of selected cohort data in this study have been added to the Discussion section as follows;</p><p>“Frailty is an important concept in health maintenance and the process of functional decline in the oldest old. Recently, serum adiponectin levels have been positively associated with frailty in the oldest old34, 35. In our cohort, most centenarians were classified as frail according to the current frailty criteria, so it is difficult to assess frailty in centenarians. For the very old, only the KAWP, one of the cohorts that included the very old, collected sufficient data to assess frailty. Using these limited data for the very old, we analyzed the distribution of cHMW adiponectin levels in each frailty category and analyzed their association with the revised J-CHS frailty index criteria using multiple regression analysis36. As a result, we found that cHMW adiponectin levels were significantly associated with frailty, both in very old men and women (Supplementary File 12). The cHMW adiponectin level was also significantly associated with frailty in very old women even after adjustment for BMI; however, no significant association was observed in very old men after adjustment by BMI. Thus, cHMW adiponectin levels would be associated with frailty in the very old, especially in women.”</p><p>“(4) The analysis of cHMW adiponectin levels and frailty in centenarians is difficult because most centenarians would be classified as frail according to the current frailty criteria.

Therefore, the association between cHMW adiponectin levels and frailty was analyzed in selected samples derived only from the KAWP study only.

In this study, Sasaki and colleagues aimed to investigate factors associated with circulating high-molecular weight (cHMW) adiponectin levels and the associations between cHMW levels and mortality, among n=1,498 very old (age 85-89 years, 51.7% women) and n=812 centenarians (age &gt;= 100, 84.4% women) from several study cohorts in Japan. This study design is primarily cross-sectional, with longitudinal measurements of adiponectin in a subset of very old participants and follow-up for mortality in another subset of participants. The study confirmed previously published associations between single nucleotide variants (SNV) in genes CDH13 (T-cadherin) and ADIPOQ (adiponectin gene) with adiponectin levels, and that adiponectin levels increase with age. The study also identified that metabolic factors traditionally associated with greater cHMW adiponectin (higher HDL, lower BMI) while associated with adiponectin in very old, have weaker associations with adiponectin in centenarians, especially centenarian men. They also conclude that high levels of cHMW adiponectin in very old men with low BMI are predictive of mortality, while adiponectin was not a significant mortality predictor in very old women or centenarian men or women.</p><p>The study provides useful data for the field of metabolic aspects of aging and longevity but it could be strengthened and extended by addressing the noted weaknesses.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>– Large cohort of very old and centenarian individuals;</p><p>– Longitudinal measurements of adiponectin levels in a subset of participants confirming the observed cross-sectional age trend showing that adiponectin levels continue to increase into a very old age (included data until the age of 90);</p><p>– A wide range of available covariates;</p><p>– Sex-stratified analyses which address sex as a biological variable;</p><p>– Insightful comments about different physiologic meanings of BMI/adiposity in very old and centenarians (higher BMI protective) vs. younger individuals (higher BMI harmful).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>– Conclusions about survival are not supported by data. Only one adjusted survival analysis is presented (very old men) and in that analysis adiponectin levels were not significantly associated with mortality after adjustment for BMI and other confounders. Other survival analyses are presented as unadjusted KM curves with log-rank tests, frequently with small numbers of participants and with crossing survival curves (questioning the assumption of proportional hazards). One potentially interesting finding is a possible greater mortality in very old men with low BMI and high adiponectin, compared to other combinations of BMI and adiponectin tertiles, including low BMI and mid and low adiponectin, which suggests that it is possible that some of the association between adiponectin and mortality is independent of the BMI at that time point (literature suggests that mortality association of adiponectin is abolished when adjusted for weight loss and low muscle mass in older adults PMID: 29438496).</p><p>– There is a substantial unexplained missingness of data. More than two-thirds of the participants in the very old group are missing mortality data and the reason for this was not provided. More than one-half of centenarians are not included in multivariate analysis of predictors of adiponectin levels and the explanation for the missingness is not provided.</p><p>– There appears to be a missed opportunity to analyze or comment on the prevalence of SNVs associated with adiponectin levels in the centenarians vs. very old or general background population. Studying centenarians as a phenotype is challenging because one cannot discern whether observed phenotypes are protective (&quot;What got them to centenarian age&quot;), adaptive or maladaptive with regards to aging-related physiologic changes, or an end-of-life phenotype. One exception to this comment is genetic variants that are present in centenarians with different frequencies compared to usual survival populations which can give us an idea about potentially protective (if enriched in centenarians) or detrimental variants (if not present in centenarians) for longevity. It would be interesting to know how the prevalence of identified genetic variants associated with adiponectin in centenarians compares to usual survival populations' prevalence as this could hint if adiponectin is protective or detrimental for exceptional longevity.</p><p>– Some of the key covariates may need redefining. For instance, the paper describes that diabetes mellitus was defined by the level of A1c, without mention of the use of diabetes medications (a person with A1c of &lt;6.5% might still have diabetes which is treated). BMI categorization should be reconsidered as a metabolic risk in Asian populations that occurs at lower levels of BMI, which is why many researchers and clinicians define overweight and obesity at lower BMI levels in Asian individuals.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>– Consider introducing in the background paragraph that SNVs for adiponectin will be assessed as genetic analysis comes in as a surprise in the next paragraph.</p><p>– Suggest including % male/female sex in the method paragraph.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions.

The following has been inserted:</p><p>“The study had the following limitations: (1) Surveys of centenarian surveys tend to have many missing values due to their limited physical and cognitive function; therefore, multivariate analysis using a series of covariates tends to reduce the number of samples to be analyzed. (2) Although the short survival time of centenarian in this showed no association between cHMW adiponectin level and all-cause mortality in this study, strong factors associated with survival, such as N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) and albumin (ALB), tend to be detectable, while weaker factors are more difficult to detect. (3) Cox regression for all-cause mortality in centenarian men and cause-specific mortality in the very old men was underpowered due to the statistically insufficient size of samples and/or events. CVD mortality in very old men showed a trend to be associated with cHMW adiponectin levels, but statistically, twice the number of events or twice the number of total samples are needed to assess this. (4) Analysis of cHMW adiponectin levels and frailty in centenarians is difficult because most centenarians would be classified as frail according to the current frailty criteria. Of the two cohort studies of very old participants, the TOOTH study did not have sufficient data adjusted for J-CHS frailty criteria. Therefore, the association between cHMW adiponectin levels and frailty was analyzed in selected samples from the KAWP study only. This was only a cross-sectional analysis, and further analysis would be needed to prove causality. Therefore, these are described only in the Discussion section.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Authors mention levels of cystatin C but this was not reported.</p></disp-quote><p>We have supplied cystatin C information in Supplementary Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– As mentioned above, analysis of animal adipose is mentioned in the discussion but not elsewhere (unclear if this was an intended part of the manuscript)</p></disp-quote><p>This analysis was based on the results of another group; therefore, it is not included in the Results section, but only mentioned in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– While the statement that &quot;cHMW adiponectin could be considered a biomarker inversely associated with BMI&quot; is correct, it is not comprehensive, given that high adiponectin is not only a marker of low adiposity but may also be a marker of low muscle mass and weight loss (features of frailty which dramatically increases mortality in older people).</p></disp-quote><p>In view of your comment, we have deleted the discrepant sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods:</p><p>– Please elaborate more on the determination of DM status; was anything other than A1c considered (as noted in Public review), and was there any information about the type of DM?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out.

In this paper, authors take a step forward to understand the distribution of adiponectin distribution in very old (85-89 years old) and centenarians. The authors have successfully presented valuable insights into this distribution as well as looked at its impact on mortality influenced by other physiological factors. Interestingly, authors have also investigated genetic variants associated with adiponectin levels in these groups using genome-wide approaches. This has led to the successful identification of genetic variants in CDH13 and ADIPOQ to be associated with adiponectin expression. In very older men, having low BMI and higher adiponectin levels were found to be a risk for mortality but not for very older women as well as in centenarians.</p><p>The positive part of this study is that it provides a picture of adiponectin distribution in these age groups and finds its implications which can be used as a reference study in the field. One concern might be the low sample size in the subgroup analysis where participants were stratified based on adiponectin level and BMI which has to be discussed in the limitation of the study. Another interesting point to look forward to is the impact of age itself in driving outcomes in this study including mortality. In centenarians, more than 99% of participants died in course of the study meaning more than adiponectin, it was complex age-associated multifactorial changes happenings which might be regulating mortality. It would be also interesting to look at the adiponectin levels in the missing age group of 90-100 years in the future.</p><p>The manuscript presents a detailed description of cHMW adiponectin levels in the very old and centenarians. Authors have looked at the impact of other factors influencing adiponectin levels including BMI as well as even ran a genome-wide analysis finding significant variants associated with adiponectin expression. Overall this manuscript is well-planned and provides a comprehensive overview of adiponectin and its influences on the elder population. There are some clarifications required.</p><p>(1) Low incidence of Diabetes was reported in the centenarians. Was it because participants with diabetes were filtered out of the population with age? Will that have an effect on the adiponectin level association with diabetes with age?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the careful reading. As suggested, this possibility cannot be excluded, so we have added this to the discussion as follows:</p><p>“We have previously reported that a low incidence of T2DM is a characteristic of centenarians; therefore, we deduced that the high cHMW adiponectin levels in centenarians would be partially influenced by a low incidence of T2DM.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Participants who were presented with ages between 89-100 were excluded from the analysis.

Is that mainly because age itself is a risk to death or time to death is very low for adiponectin to have an effect? Also, 99% of participants succumbed to death in course of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide clarity here.

In this study, we aimed to clarify factors associated with circulating high-molecular-weight (cHMW) adiponectin levels and their association with mortality in the very old (85–89 years old) and centenarians.</p><p>Methods: The study included 812 (women: 84.4%) for centenarians and 1,498 (women: 51.7%) for the very old. The genomic DNA sequence data were obtained by whole genome sequencing or DNA microarray-imputation methods. LASSO and multivariate regression analyses were used to evaluate cHMW adiponectin characteristics and associated factors. All-cause mortality was analyzed in three quantile groups of cHMW adiponectin levels using Cox regression.</p><p>Results: The cHMW adiponectin levels were increased significantly beyond 100 years of age, were negatively associated with diabetes prevalence, and were associated with SNVs in CDH13 (p = 2.21 × 10<sup>-22</sup>) and ADIPOQ (p = 5.72 × 10<sup>-7</sup>). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that genetic variants, BMI, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) were the main factors associated with cHMW adiponectin levels in the very old, whereas the BMI showed no association in centenarians. The hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in the intermediate and high cHMW adiponectin groups in very old men were significantly higher rather than those for all-cause mortality in the low level cHMW adiponectin group, even after adjustment with BMI. In contrast, the hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were significantly higher for high cHMW adiponectin groups in very old women, but were not significant after adjustment with BMI.</p><p>Conclusions: cHMW adiponectin levels increased with age until centenarians, and the contribution of known major factors associated with cHMW adiponectin levels, including BMI and HDLC, varies with age, suggesting that its physiological significance also varies with age in the oldest old.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Based on adiponectin level grouping has been done into three groups which had again grouped into multiple groups based on BMI.
