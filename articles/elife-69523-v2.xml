totally understood where the structural and functional abnormalities are consistent/inconsistent across languages. In the current multimodal meta-analysis, we found convergent structural and functional alterations in the left superior temporal gyrus across languages, suggesting a neural signature of DD. We found greater reduction in grey matter volume and brain activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus in morpho-syllabic languages (e.g. Chinese) than in alphabetic languages, and greater reduction in brain activation in the left middle temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus in alphabetic languages than in morpho-syllabic languages. These language differences are explained as consequences of being DD while learning a specific language. In addition, we also found brain regions that showed increased grey matter volume and brain activation, presumably suggesting compensations and brain regions that showed inconsistent alterations in brain structure and function. Our study provides important insights about the etiology of DD from a cross-linguistic perspective with considerations of consistency/inconsistency between structural and functional alterations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dyslexia</kwd><kwd>multimodal meta-analysis</kwd><kwd>alphabetic language</kwd><kwd>morpho-syllabic language</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Fan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010838</institution-id><institution>Guangdong Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GD19CXL05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Fan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China, Key Area Research and Development Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202007030011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Fan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The National Social Science Fund of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21BYY204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Fan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Convergent structural and functional brain deficits associated with dyslexia were found in left superior temporal gyrus across languages, however, language-specific deficits were also identified.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Individuals with developmental dyslexia (DD) encounter difficulty in learning to read even with normal intelligence and adequate educational guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Peterson and Pennington, 2012</xref>). DD affects a large number of individuals across writing systems, and the prevalence is about 5–10% in alphabetic writing systems (e.g. English and German) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Döhla and Heim, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Katusic et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib177">Shaywitz, 1996</xref>) and about 4–7% in morpho-syllabic writing systems (e.g. Chinese and Japanese Kanji) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib190">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib198">Uno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib221">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Multiple deficits have been identified to be associated with DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib170">Ring and Black, 2018</xref>), among which phonological deficit has been well-documented across languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Gu and Bi, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib186">Snowling and Melby-Lervag, 2016</xref>). Individuals with DD show deficient phonological ability including phonological representation, manipulation, and retrieval even when compared to reading-level controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Melby-Lervag et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Parrila et al., 2020</xref>). However, the common phonological deficit may manifest differently in reading behavior depending on the specific requirements of the writing system. For example, phonological deficit in English is associated with lower accuracy in phonological decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Landerl et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib222">Ziegler et al., 2003</xref>), and it is associated with slower reading speed in transparent orthographies with relatively intact accuracy in phonological decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib213">Wimmer and Schurz, 2010</xref>). In Chinese, phonological deficit is associated with a higher rate of semantic errors during character reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib179">Shu et al., 2005</xref>), because children with DD over-rely on the semantic cue in the character during reading due to the inability to use the phonological cue. According to research, 80% of Chinese characters have a semantic radical and a phonetic radical providing semantic cues and phonological cues of the character, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Honorof and Feldman, 2006</xref>).</p><p>At the neurological level, the reading network in the left hemisphere has often been found to show alterations in individuals with DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Pugh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">Richlan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">Richlan, 2014</xref>), including the temporoparietal cortex (TP), the occipitotemporal cortex (OT), and the inferior frontal cortex. The left TP area is further subdivided into the posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG), which is involved in fine phonological analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Petersen and Fiez, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">Richlan, 2012</xref>) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) which is associated with general attention control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">Richlan, 2014</xref>). This TP region tends to show reduced brain activation in individuals with DD in alphabetic languages as demonstrated in a cross-linguistic study of English, Italian, and French (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Paulesu et al., 2001</xref>) and several meta-analysis studies in alphabetic languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Maisog et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Martin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Paulesu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Richlan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Richlan et al., 2011</xref>). The left OT area, including the middle occipital gyrus (MOG), inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and fusiform gyrus, has been consistently found to show reduced activation in individuals with DD across morpho-syllabic and alphabetic languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bolger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Centanni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Chyl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Paz-Alonso et al., 2018</xref>). This region is associated with visuo-orthographic processing during reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Glezer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Glezer et al., 2019</xref>). The left inferior frontal cortex is further subdivided into the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the precentral gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">Richlan, 2014</xref>). The precentral gyrus may relate to compensatory articulatory processes in dyslexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Hancock et al., 2017</xref>), whereas the IFG has been known to be involved in phonological and semantic retrieval, lexical selection and integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Booth et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Booth et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Costafreda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib191">Szatkowska et al., 2000</xref>). However, the nature of dysfunction in the left IFG in individuals with DD remains controversial. Although reduced activation in the left IFG was confirmed by many fMRI studies and meta-analysis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Booth et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">Richlan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib214">Wimmer et al., 2010</xref>), increased activation in the left IFG was also reported in many fMRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Grunling et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Kronbichler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib206">Waldie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib214">Wimmer et al., 2010</xref>). The inconsistent results may be related to task and task difficulty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib206">Waldie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib214">Wimmer et al., 2010</xref>), orthographic transparency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Martin et al., 2016</xref>), and age of participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Chyl et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>There is a sparsity in research investigating whether the deficits associated with DD are language-universal. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Paulesu et al., 2001</xref> found that readers with DD in English, Italian, and French showed similar brain abnormality during an explicit word reading task and an implicit reading task. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Hu et al., 2010</xref> found that Chinese and English children with DD showed language-universal deficits. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Feng et al., 2020</xref> found that children with DD in both Chinese and French showed common reduction of brain activation in the left fusiform gyrus and STG. In summary, meta-analytic studies should make a greater contribution in such a topic by gathering studies from different languages and comparing them.</p><p>Even though language-universal deficits in the brain have been suggested in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Feng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Hu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Paulesu et al., 2001</xref>), language specificity has been demonstrated as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Martin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib181">Siok et al., 2004</xref>). In a meta-analysis study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Martin et al., 2016</xref>), researchers directly compared brain deficits associated with DD between transparent and opaque orthographies and found that functional abnormalities in the brain vary with orthographic depth in alphabetic languages. Specifically, consistent reduction of brain activation was found in a left OT area regardless of orthographic depth, whereas greater reduction was found in the left fusiform gyrus, left TP and left IFG pars orbitalis in transparent orthographies than in opaque orthographies, and greater reduction in the bilateral intraparietal sulcus, left precuneus and left IFG pars triangularis was found in opaque orthographies than in transparent orthographies. In a recent study on Chinese-English bilingual children with DD, researchers also found both language-universal and language-specific deficits for Chinese and English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cao et al., 2020</xref>). These findings suggest that there are both language-universal and language-specific deficits across languages. The language-universal deficits might be related to the causal risk of DD while the language-specific deficits tend to be interpreted as a result of interaction between DD and the specific language system that one studies.</p><p>Alphabetic and morpho-syllabic languages make a contrastive cross-linguistic comparison. As a representative morpho-syllabic language, Chinese character represents a morpheme and a syllable rather than a phoneme, even though a small percent of Chinese characters are logographic. Research on DD in Chinese has revealed different patterns of brain abnormalities from alphabetic languages. Significant alteration in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) or dorsal IFG has been consistently reported in different studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib181">Siok et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib182">Siok et al., 2008</xref>), while the alteration in the left TP areas has been reported in only a few studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Hu et al., 2010</xref>). This might be because the left dorsal IFG plays an essential role in Chinese. It has been found that the left dorsal IFG is more involved in Chinese reading than in English reading, while the left TP is more involved in English reading than in Chinese reading in typical readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bolger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Tan et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, the greater deficit in the left dorsal IFG suggests a Chinese-specific deficit.</p><p>In addition to functional studies, there have also been a large number of studies with a focus on structural alterations associated with DD. Even though brain structural alterations may cause DD, it is equally possible that altered brain structure is a result of being DD, since learning experience shapes brain development. However, only one of these studies has taken language difference into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib180">Silani et al., 2005</xref>). Previous meta-analysis studies on alphabetic languages have found grey matter reduction in the left TP area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Linkersdörfer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">McGrath and Stoodley, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib167">Richlan et al., 2013</xref>) as well as the left OT area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Linkersdörfer et al., 2012</xref>). These three meta-analytic studies echo findings from functional studies by showing abnormal brain structures within the classic reading network in alphabetic languages. In consistent, studies on morpho-syllabic languages have also found grey matter reduction within the classic reading network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Liu et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib182">Siok et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib209">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib216">Xia et al., 2016</xref>). However, there are also studies that found abnormal brain structures outside the classic reading network, for example, in putamen, cerebellum, thalamus, and caudate etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adrian-Ventura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brambati et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Jagger-Rickels et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Jednorog et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib209">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that these regions are also affected in this condition. Taken together, both classic reading regions and other regions have been found to show structural alterations in DD, and the previous inconsistent findings in brain structure might be due to the lack of differentiation in participants’ language. It is important to differentiate language-universal structural alterations as a core deficit which might be related to the cause of DD and language-specific structural alterations as a consequence of being DD in a specific language. Learning a specific language with DD may affect brain development in regions that are specifically important for that language and related functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Mechelli et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>DD is associated with altered brain structure and function, but very few studies have investigated whether brain structural and functional alterations are consistent or inconsistent. In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib182">Siok et al., 2008</xref>, researchers examined both structural and functional alterations in Chinese children with DD, and found reduced GMV and brain activation in the left MFG, which underscores the association between the left MFG and DD in Chinese. Another study located a key region in the left IPL, which showed reduced GMV and activation in English-speaking readers with DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Hoeft et al., 2007</xref>). A recent study, from a developmental perspective, found a dissociation between brain structural development and brain functional development in some brain regions (e.g. left fusiform gyrus) in the context of reading development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib184">Siok et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that learning experience may significantly shape brain function independent of brain structure. However, more research is sorely needed to examine whether there are brain regions that show increased GMV but decreased brain function or vice versa, and to understand the neurocognitive implications of such patterns. Simultaneously considering structural and functional abnormalities with a focus on cross-linguistic comparison would provide a comprehensive perspective to understand the neural mechanisms of DD.</p><p>In this meta-analysis study, we aimed to explore how structural and functional impairment of DD converge or diverge and whether this pattern is similar or different across writing systems. We expected to find brain regions that show decreased brain structure and function, indicating insufficient neuronal resources for certain cognitive computations. For regions that show increased brain structure and function, we believe they develop to an unusually high degree for compensation. For brain regions with increased structure but decreased function or decreased structure and increased function, it may be due to brain structures receiving inhibitory input from other regions. We also expected to find language-universal as well as language-specific neurological abnormalities. For language-universal deficits, we tend to believe that they are related to the cause of DD, while the language-specific deficits tend to be consequences of DD in different languages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Description of the included studies</title><p>For the functional studies, a total of 2728 participants (controls:1370, DD:1358) were included, and the mean age was 16.56 years for controls and 16.26 years for participants with DD.

However, conjunction analysis between morpho-syllabic languages and alphabetic languages did not reveal any overlap.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Convergent structural and functional impairment across writing systems</title><p>Across writing systems, convergent structural and functional deficit was found in the left STG due to reduced GMV and brain activation in both alphabetic languages and morpho-syllabic languages. Further confirmation analysis confirmed that this is a stable deficit across children and adults. This is consistent with previous meta-analysis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Maisog et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">McGrath and Stoodley, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Paulesu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib167">Richlan et al., 2013</xref>). The left STG is a very important component in the language network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Friederici, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Hickok and Poeppel, 2007</xref>) as well a key region in the reading network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Pugh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">Richlan, 2014</xref>). It is involved in phonological representation and phonological processing during both spoken language processing and reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bolger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Enge et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Tan et al., 2005</xref>). Recent research has suggested that proficient reading is characterized by convergence between speech and print at this region regardless of languages, as multivariate brain activity patterns are similar for speech and print at this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Chyl et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, the reading network may develop based on the built-in language circuit, as reading is a skill that humans acquire too late in the course of human evolution to have a brain network dedicated to it. Recently, a growing number of studies have investigated early signs of dyslexia before the onset of reading and found that structural and functional deficits in the left TP area and left inferior frontal cortex appear before reading onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Clark et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Hosseini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Plewko et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Raschle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Raschle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib203">Vandermosten et al., 2019</xref>). It further suggests that DD might be due to early abnormality in the language network. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib185">Skeide et al., 2018</xref> found hypermyelination in the left auditory cortex in readers with DD using ultra-high-field MRI at 7T, and disrupted neural firing induced by hypermyelination in the layer IV of the auditory cortex, which may cause hypoactivation in the left STG. The left STG actually serves as an important hub in the language and reading network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Fernández et al., 2020</xref>), which connects the inferior frontal network and the OT network through a dorsal pathway and a ventral pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Brauer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Cummine et al., 2015</xref>). Disconnection with the left STG has been verified in task-related functional connectivity studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boets et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">Schurz et al., 2015</xref>) and a resting-state functional connectivity study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">Schurz et al., 2015</xref>), as well as in a meta-analysis of DTI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib202">Vandermosten et al., 2012</xref>). Our finding suggests that dyslexia is associated with structural and functional abnormalities of the left STG regardless of language. The evidence suggests that this is a neural signature of DD, which supports the phonological deficit hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib178">Shaywitz et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>However, we failed to find consistent structural and functional deficits in the OT area. The main reason was that there was no structural alteration but only functional reduction at this area. The OT area is a key region for orthographic recognition during visual word processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Glezer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Glezer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Hirshorn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Nobre et al., 1994</xref>) and was reported to be impaired in individuals with DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">McCrory et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">Richlan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib207">Wandell et al., 2012</xref>). The specialization of this region for orthographic processing is developed along with reading acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Brem et al., 2010</xref>), and the dysfunction of the OT area in DD is possibly a result of reading failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Pugh et al., 2000</xref>). A recent meta-analysis of VBM studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">McGrath and Stoodley, 2019</xref>) also failed to detect structural deficit in the OT area, which is consistent with our finding. Taken together, the lack of structural deficits with only hypoactivation at the OT area appears to suggest that the visuo-orthographic deficits at the OT might be a consequence of being DD. In contrast, the left STG which was discussed above, appears to be associated with the cause of DD. Our results provide further support for the phonological deficit hypothesis that phonological deficit is the primary deficit and other deficits may be a result of the phonological deficit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Pugh et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Language differences in structural and functional alterations</title><p>The left dorsal IFG which peaked at (–52, 10, 24) showed greater reduction in both GMV and brain activation in morpho-syllabic languages than in alphabetic languages, suggesting greater impairment in this region in morpho-syllabic languages than in alphabetic languages. This finding is also verified in the confirmation analyses. Previously, many Chinese studies have reported impairment at the dorsal left IFG, for example, reduced brain activation in an auditory rhyming judgment task in children with DD at (–44, 10, 26) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cao et al., 2017</xref>), in a lexical decision task at (–44, 3, 29) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib181">Siok et al., 2004</xref>), in a homophone judgment task at (–55, 5, 22) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib182">Siok et al., 2008</xref>), and in a morphological task at (–36, 8, 26) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>). This left dorsal IFG has been believed to be more involved in Chinese reading than in alphabetic languages, with a peak at the left MFG (–46, 18, 28) as reported in a previous meta-analysis study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Tan et al., 2005</xref>). The dorsal IFG was found to be involved in phonological processing in Chinese reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib215">Wu et al., 2012</xref>), and it is thought to be related to addressed phonology during Chinese character reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Tan et al., 2005</xref>). Our study adds to the literature that by direct comparison, this region does show greater deficit in individuals with DD in morpho-syllabic languages than in alphabetic languages in terms of both brain activation and GMV. This might be due to the fact that healthy Chinese readers have increased GMV and brain activation in the left dorsal IFG than healthy alphabetic readers, because the features of Chinese require greater involvement of this region in reading than alphabetic languages due to the whole-character-to-whole-syllable mapping. Actually, two cross-linguistic studies have argued that different findings of DD in different languages are actually driven by the fact that control readers show language-specific brain activation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Feng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Hu et al., 2010</xref>), and that brain activation in individuals with DD is actually the same across languages. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Hu et al., 2010</xref> found that Chinese control readers showed greater activation in the left IFG, and English control readers showed greater activation in the left superior temporal sulcus; however, children with DD in Chinese and English showed similar brain activation in these two regions. Therefore, readers with DD fail to show language specialization due to their limited reading experience and skills. In summary, this language-specific deficit is believed to be a consequence of being DD in learning morpho-syllabic languages, indicating their inability to accommodate to their own writing system.</p><p>In the direct comparison between alphabetic and morpho-syllabic languages, we also found greater hypoactivation in DD in alphabetic languages than in morpho-syllabic languages in the left MTG, right STG and left fusiform gyrus, which was verified in the well-matched confirmation analysis, suggesting that the language difference should not be due to differences in age, tasks, and number of studies in the two language groups. Our finding is consistent with previous neuroimaging studies that revealed reduced activation associated with DD in the posterior reading network in alphabetic languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Paulesu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">Richlan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib203">Vandermosten et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting deficient orthographic and phonological processing. However, the novelty of the current study is to demonstrate greater severity of deficit in these regions in alphabetic languages than in morpho-syllabic languages. In a previous meta-analysis study of alphabetic languages, it was found that there was greater hypoactivation in the left fusiform gyrus (−40,–42, –16) in shallow orthographies than in deep orthographies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Martin et al., 2016</xref>). The explanation is that this region is associated with bottom-up rapid processing of letters, because it was found that at a proximal region (−38,–50, –16), there was a word length effect for German nonwords in non-impaired readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib175">Schurz et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the left fusiform gyrus has been found to be more involved in English reading than in Chinese reading in typical mature readers with a peak of the effect at (−44,–56, –12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib193">Tan et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, the left fusiform gyrus is important for letter-by-letter orthographic recognition in alphabetic languages, and this explains why we found greater deficit in this region in alphabetic languages than in morpho-syllabic languages. As for the right STG, the previous meta-analysis found greater hypoactivation in deep orthographies than shallow orthographies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Martin et al., 2016</xref>). Together with our finding, it suggests that the right STG might be associated with the inconsistent mapping between graphemes and phonemes in deep orthographic alphabetic languages. In summary, these greater deficits in alphabetic languages than in morpho-syllabic languages might be due to the inability to adapt to the special features of alphabetic languages in individuals with DD.</p><p>For the structural studies, we found greater GMV alterations in morpho-syllabic languages than in alphabetic languages, including greater GMV reduction in the left STG, left MFG, left supramarginal gyrus, left SOG and left insula, as well as greater GMV increase in the right STG and ITG. However, considering the limited number of studies included in the morpho-syllabic language group and inconsistent results with functional studies, the results should be interpreted with caution.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Increased GMV and hyperactivation</title><p>In the multi-modal meta-analysis, we found increased GMV and hyperactivation in participants with DD in the right MTG which was driven by the morpho-syllabic languages. For the functional studies, we also found greater hyperactivation in the right precentral gyrus in morpho-syllabic languages than in alphabetic languages. These alterations might be related to the compensation mechanism of the right hemisphere. As precentral gyri play an important role in articulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Dronkers, 1996</xref>), overactivation in the precentral gyrus is interpreted as an articulation strategy used by individuals with DD to compensate for their deficient phonological processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib178">Shaywitz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib206">Waldie et al., 2013</xref>). The compensation in the right MTG is developed in morpho-syllabic languages presumably due to the tight connection between orthography and semantics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib208">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Substantial evidence has shown that dyslexia was often accompanied by excessive activation of the right hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Kovelman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Kronschnabel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib219">Yang and Tan, 2020</xref>) and reduced left lateralization of the language network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altarelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bloom et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, training studies have also found increased activation in many regions in the right hemisphere in individuals with DD after reading intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barquero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Meyler et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting the compensatory role of the right hemisphere when the left language/reading network is deficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Coslett and Monsul, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib210">Weiller et al., 1995</xref>). However, according to the previous meta-analysis study, different regions showed overactivation in different writing systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Martin et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, the left anterior insula showed greater overactivation in deep orthographies while the left precentral gyrus showed greater overactivation in shallow orthographies in individuals with DD. Taken together, it suggests that different compensatory mechanisms are developed depending on the characteristics of the writing system as well as learning experiences, and the compensation in the right MTG and right precentral gyrus appears to be particularly salient in morpho-syllabic languages. However, it is also possible that the increased GMV and hyperactivation in individuals with DD are due to some fundamental deficits rather than compensation. Further research is needed to understand the nature of these alterations by running brain-behavioral correlation and/or employing longitudinal designs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Divergent structural and functional alterations in DD</title><p>In the multimodal analysis, we also found divergent structural and functional changes related to DD, including the left IPL and left cerebellum where there was increased GMV and hypoactivation and bilateral caudate where there was reduced GMV and hyperactivation in alphabetic languages; There was decreased GMV and hyperactivation in left STG in morpho-syllabic languages. This is in line with a recent study which found a dissociation between the developmental changes of brain structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib184">Siok et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that learning experience may sometimes shape the brain function independent of the brain structure.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>The left IPL</title><p>We found increased GMV and hypoactivation in DD in the left IPL in alphabetic languages. Consistent hypoactivation in the left IPL in DD has been documented in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Maisog et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Martin et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, it was found that the deficit of the left IPL was greater in children than in adults with DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Richlan et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that the functional impairment of the left IPL may gradually recover with development. This may be related to the transfer of the reading circuit from the dorsal pathway to the ventral pathway over development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib220">Younger et al., 2017</xref>). Control children activate the left IPL to a greater degree than control adults because they rely more on the dorsal pathway. Therefore, children with DD show a great reduction in the left IPL in comparison to adults with DD. Alternatively, the left IPL has been found to be deactivated during language tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Meyler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Schulz et al., 2009</xref>), and this is due to the nature of the default mode network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Laird et al., 2009</xref>), which is deactivated during active tasks. Therefore, it might be the case that the increased GMV in individuals with DD increases inhibitory inputs received by the IPL, which results in greater deactivation.</p><p>For structural studies involving the left IPL, the results are inconsistent. The GMV of the left supramarginal gyrus around the posterior part of perisylvian cortex was found to be reduced in individuals with DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Linkersdörfer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">McGrath and Stoodley, 2019</xref>) and it showed a positive correlation with reading accuracy only in normal readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Jednorog et al., 2015</xref>). However, the GMV of the left inferior parietal cortex excluding the supramarginal and the angular was found to increase in individuals with DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">McGrath and Stoodley, 2019</xref>) and a study showed that the volume of the left inferior parietal cortex in control readers was negatively correlated with reading level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Houston et al., 2014</xref>). The IPL in the current study is outside the supramarginal and angular gyrus; therefore, it is consistent with the previous findings that there is increased GMV in individuals with DD.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>The cerebella</title><p>Increased GMV and hypoactivation in DD were also found in the left cerebellum in alphabetic languages; however, in the right cerebellum, we found decreased GMV and hyperactivation. Previously, it was found that the right cerebellum is greater in size than the left cerebellum in healthy controls while the asymmetry is reduced in individuals with DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Kibby et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">Rae et al., 2002</xref>). This is consistent with our finding of increased GMV in the left cerebellum and decreased GMV in the right cerebellum in individuals with DD, suggesting reduced asymmetry in cerebellum.</p><p>The cerebella have been found to play an important role in inner speech, automatization in reading and suppression of overt articulatory movement in silent reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ait Khelifa-Gallois et al., 2015</xref>). Functional abnormality of cerebellum in DD has been reported repeatedly; however, hyperactivation was reported more often in the right cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Hernandez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Kronschnabel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">Richlan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib172">Rumsey et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib200">van Ermingen-Marbach et al., 2013a</xref>), while hypoactivation was reported more often in the left cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Christodoulou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">McCrory et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Olulade et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Reilhac et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib182">Siok et al., 2008</xref>). This is consistent with our finding of hyperactivation in the right cerebellum and hypoactivation in the left cerebellum. Different alteration patterns in the left and right cerebellum suggest that they may play different roles in reading and dyslexia. The right cerebellum has been found to be connected with the left frontal-parietal pathway for phonological processing and with the left frontal-temporal pathway for semantic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alvarez and Fiez, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Gatti et al., 2020</xref>). The left cerebellum, however, is involved in error monitoring during reading unfamiliar non-words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben-Yehudah and Fiez, 2008</xref>), as well as articulation related movement process, since it is activated in reading aloud but not in lexical decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Carreiras et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Richards et al., 2006</xref> argued that the left cerebellum is involved in processing the morphology of word forms, and the right cerebellum is involved in phonological processing. Therefore, hyperactivation in the right cerebellum in readers with DD suggests that they may use it as a compensation for their deficient phonological processing, while hypoactivation in the left cerebellum may suggest reduced error monitoring in readers with DD. The finding of neurological alterations in the cerebellum is consistent with the previous findings of cerebellar deficit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Menghini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib217">Yang et al., 2013</xref>) for which, some researchers argued that impaired articulatory motor control in the cerebellum leads to reading impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Nicolson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib189">Stoodley and Stein, 2011</xref>). It also should be noticed that the cerebellum showed divergent patterns in structural studies and functional studies. Taken together, these results implicate the necessity of considering DD from a broader spectrum of developmental disorders.</p><p>It is still unclear why there is increased GMV but decreased activation in some brain regions. It may be due to the following reasons: (1) increased dendrites receiving more inhibitory input from other neurons; (2) abnormal neuronal migration deactivated the firing of neurons as a result of disrupted local microcircuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Giraud and Ramus, 2013</xref>); (3) weaker input from other regions deactivated the target region and changed the structure of the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib209">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>The caudate</title><p>We also found decreased GMV and hyperactivation in readers with DD in the bilateral caudate in alphabetic languages. Previous studies have observed decreased GMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Jagger-Rickels et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">McGrath and Stoodley, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib192">Tamboer et al., 2015</xref>) and hyperactivation in bilateral caudate in individuals with DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Martin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Olulade et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Pekkola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">Richlan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Richlan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib172">Rumsey et al., 1997</xref>). However, there are also studies that observed different patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cheema et al., 2018</xref>), such as decreased activation in caudate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Perrachione et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the GMV volume of the caudate in individuals with DD was found to be positively correlated with reading performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Pernet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib192">Tamboer et al., 2015</xref>), and the left caudate’s activation was correlated with longer reaction time in word reading only in individuals with DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cheema et al., 2018</xref>). The caudate plays an important role in procedural learning and phonological processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Grahn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib196">Tettamanti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib197">Ullman et al., 2020</xref>). Decreased GMV and increased activation at the bilateral caudate might be caused by reduced dendrites and reduced inhibitory inputs received in individuals with DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Finn et al., 2014</xref>). It may also be due to pre-existing local structural deficit leading to compensatory hyperactivation of the remaining part of the caudate. GMV reduction in basal ganglia was found in many other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Frodl and Skokauskas, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Mous et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Nakao et al., 2011</xref>), autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Nickl-Jockschat et al., 2012</xref>) and major depression disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Husain et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). Altered myelination and neurotransmitters may contribute to the structural and functional alterations related to basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Nord et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib212">Wichmann and DeLong, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found convergent functional and structural alterations in the left STG across different writing systems, suggesting a neural signature of DD, which might be associated with phonological deficit.

Unlike other coordinate-based meta-analysis methods such as Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) or Multilevel peak Kernel density analysis (MKDA), AES-SDM combined the peak coordinates with the statistical parameter maps to increase the sensitivity of the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Radua et al., 2012a</xref>). Data were first preprocessed with the statistical parameter maps and the peak coordinates were convolved with a fully anisotropy un-normalized Gaussian kernel (ɑ = 1) (full width at half maximum = 20 mm) to recreate the effect size map and the corresponding variance map for each study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Radua et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Radua et al., 2014</xref>). Then, a random-effect model was set up to calculate the differences between the DD group and the control group. Five hundred permutations were performed to ensure the stability of the analysis. Finally, the results of the standard meta-analysis were thresholded at peak height of the mean effect size SDM-Z = 1, uncorrected p = 0.005 at the voxel level and 150 voxels at the cluster level, which is stricter than the threshold suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Radua et al., 2012a</xref> (peak height SDM-Z = 1, uncorrected p = 0.005 at the voxel level and 10 voxels at the cluster level) in order to avoid false-positive results and gain enough sensitivity.</p><p>In order to identify differences between the two language groups, we conducted a direct comparison between the alphabetic language group and the morpho-syllabic language group for functional studies and structural studies separately, using SDM linear model function.

The two subgroups were also matched on participants’ age (mean age = 10.95 years for English studies, mean age = 11.40 years for Chinese studies), number of studies and task (visual word tasks). Then, we conducted a direct comparison between the Chinese studies and English studies. The threshold was set at peak height SDM-Z = 1 and voxel level uncorrected p = 0.005 with 150 voxels at the cluster level.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Writing – original draft, Data acquisition, Data acquisition, Data acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Writing – original draft, Data acquisition, Data acquisition, Data acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Writing – original draft, Data acquisition, Data acquisition, Data acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Additional results for the meta-analysis.</title><p>(a) Functional deficits in children with DD in alphabetic languages (b) Structural deficits in children with DD in alphabetic languages (c) Direct comparations between functional studies in alphabetic languages and morpho-syllabic languages for children with DD (d) Direct comparations between structural studies in alphabetic languages and morpho-syllabic languages for children with DD (e) Language differences in functional studies between the two well-matched groups in the confirmation analysis (f) Abnormal brain functions found in the current study that were reported in each functional study of the alphabetic language group (g) Abnormal brain structures found in the current study that were reported in each structural study of the alphabetic group (h) Abnormal brain functions found in the current study that were reported in each functional study of the morpho-syllabic group (i) Abnormal brain structures found in the current study that were reported in each structural study of the morpho-syllabic group.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69523-supp1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Key words used in literature retrieval.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69523-supp2-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69523-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

Convergent and divergent functional and structural changes as well as language-universal and language-specific brain alternations related to dyslexia are reported. The identification of the universal and language-specific neural manifestations of dyslexia is valuable, and it can help diagnose individuals with dyslexia in the given language with higher accuracy and administer effective interventions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Convergent and divergent structural and functional brain abnormalities associated with developmental dyslexia: a cross-linguistic meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Chris Baker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Li Hai Tan (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Hereby are summarized the main essential revisions for the papers from the two reviewers. More detailed revisions and changes are included below in each review:</p><p>1) The meta-analysis pooling all studies/experiments together seem unnecessary and may even harm this study. Thus, Reviewer 2 suggests to carefully think it over.</p><p>2) As mentioned also in Reviewer 2 comments as well, they highly recommend considering the age effect and give a detailed discussion.</p><p>3) The LIFG is a big region. Reviewer 1 and myself consider It would be helpful to more precisely present the findings related to this region, for example, by using the dorsal IFG and the ventral IFG. This will help readers more quickly understand the universality and the specificity of cortical regions across languages.</p><p>4) There are several methodological details that need to be included in the manuscript as outlined in Reviewer 2 comments.</p><p>5) Some additional points need to be discussed in the manuscript or rephrased/removed as detailed in both reviewers' comments. In that sense, the authors should be careful since some statements are out of the scope of this study and can be misleading (see Reviewer 2 comments).</p><p>6) Reviewer 2 gives some suggestions to restructure the information included in the introduction and discussion in order to convey a clearer message since there is too much information included in the introduction.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. For the meta-analysis results, it would be helpful to show the brain maps of functional and structural impairment associated with DD in the main text instead of in supplement. The same for brain regions that had normal structure but altered function. All these brain maps can be added in Figure 2.</p><p>2. The results showing divergent structural and functional alterations are very interesting. In addition to the reasons the authors mentioned in the paper, another possibility is that the brain changes slowly but the reading performance changes rapidly – the quick development of reading skills may lead to a dissociation of structure and function. A recent study by Siok et al., (Cerebral Cortex, 2020) showed this dissociation.</p><p>3. The model by Friederici (2012) is important; it seems to involve the ventral portion of the IFG, not the dorsal portion. The author should be more precise in the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Title</p><p>1. It is unclear what the focus is-convergence and divergence between functional and structural abnormalities or between different languages, or both.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>2. General:</p><p>(a) Given that the main aim of the meta-analysis is to synthesize the previous finding, it is better to summarize the previous studies in the introduction and present detailed explanations in the discussion. In the current version, too many details are presented in the introduction. For example, discussion about the language-specific in neural impairments in dyslexia (p. 5-6, lines 96-128) and the difference between Chinese and alphabetic languages (p. 7-8, lines 129-153).</p><p>(b) There are meta-analysis studies that focus on different aspects, some of which are relevant to the authors' question in this study. Thus, these works should be mentioned, and key findings should be summarized.</p><p>3. p. 3-4, lines 43-59: The authors use phonological deficits as an example to explain the manifestation of the &quot;common&quot; impairments can be influenced by linguistic features. While it is a good example, it is also important to notice that nowadays a large body of evidence support a multi-deficit hypothesis (where the phonological deficit is one of the most common one) and the &quot;neural abnormalities&quot; could be associated with different cognitive deficits.</p><p>4. p. 4, line 60: Richlan updated the model in his 2014 Fronts Hum Neurosci paper.</p><p>5. p. 4, lines 75-77: In Richlan 2014, Fronts Hum Neurosci, the left IFG and preCG have been highlighted with distinct functions. Please also see Hancock et al., 2017, Neur Biobehav Rev.</p><p>6. p. 5, lines 86-87: It is not the number of studies finding language-universal deficits associated with dyslexia is few. In fact, the research investigating this topic is lacking, to which, in my opinion, meta-analysis can contribute.</p><p>7. p. 8, line 154: Before introducing structure MRI studies, it may be better to declare the significance of conducting structural imaging research.</p><p>8. p. 8-9, lines 163-170: First, it may be better to discuss studies in Chinese and alphabetic languages separately. Second, it is true that these regions do not belong to the &quot;three most reported brain regions involved in reading processing.&quot; However, they may also be part of the network recruited for specific reading processes.</p><p>9. p. 9, lines 174-177: It is possible that a brain measure not associated with reading experiences can also manifest to be language-specific. For example, it could be correlated with cognitive processing required by reading in a specific language.</p><p>Methods</p><p>10. To deal with the problem caused by mixing alphabetic and morpho-syllabic languages, besides conducting analysis separately for each category of the writing system, another way is to treat writing system type as modality, i.e., conduct &quot;multi-modal like&quot; analysis.</p><p>11. As for the age effect, focusing on children in the primary analysis could be an option.</p><p>12. Explicitly and clearly list the combinations of the keywords. E.g., &quot;dyslexia&quot; and &quot;fMRI&quot;; &quot;dyslexia&quot; and &quot;PET&quot;; etc.</p><p>13. p. 11, line 212: Can the authors list studies adopting a &quot;volumetric FreeSurfer pipeline&quot;? To my knowledge, such a pipeline is commonly used in investigating subcortical structures.</p><p>14. The threshold for dealing with whole-brain multiple comparisons error. As mentioned by Muller et al., 2018 Neur Biobehav Rev, a formal threshold (e.g., p-voxel &lt; 0.001, FWE corrected p-cluster &lt; 0.05) is recommended even for ES-SDM/AES-SDM.</p><p>Results</p><p>15. p. 19, lines 363-367: Please present more details about the &quot;conjunction&quot; analysis?</p><p>16. p. 19, line 366: What does the peak mean, the center of gravity?</p><p>17. I suggest adding information about whether the specific deficit was observed in each included study.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>18. p. 22, line 417: It is convergence/divergence between functional and structural differences between dyslexia and control, rather than the &quot;relationship.&quot; There is no evidence on whether these deficits are related to each other.</p><p>19. p. 23, lines 440-442: The authors mentioned, &quot;The left STG and the dorsal IFG are two core regions in the language model proposed by Friederici (2012) and by Hickok and Poeppel (2007)&quot;. How about the reading models?</p><p>20. p. 28-29, lines 553-581: The authors interpret the increased GMV and hyper-activation in dyslexia as compensation. However, there might be other possibilities (e.g., it could be another type of deficits in dyslexia). In addition, the authors may discuss what analysis (e.g., brain-behavior correlation, longitudinal design, etc.) can be done further to examine these possibilities.</p><p>21. p. 32, lines 646-648: &quot;… the finding of neurological alterations in the cerebellum supports thee cerebellar deficit hypothesis.&quot; Can the authors discuss what the cerebellar deficit hypothesis claims and how the current findings support them?</p><p>22. p. 33, lines 663: &quot;…, which is consistent with our finding&quot; This is what a meta-analysis does. A better approach could be listing studies that observed and did not observe such a pattern.</p><p>Limitations</p><p>23. Each technique has its strength and weakness, while they can all contribute to depicting the whole picture. The main aim of an fMRI/sMRI/PET meta-analysis is to synthesize existing evidence. Therefore, in my opinion, &quot;the neurophysiology of changes in brain structure and function is unknown&quot; is not a limitation of this study. In synthesizing the previous findings, the authors recreated the statistical maps, which can be more sensitive than other coordinate-based meta-analytic approaches. Even though, analysis with the original statistical maps will be beneficial. These maps can be acquired by requiring the authors of the original studies or downloading from neural data sharing platforms such as Neurovault (https://neurovault.org/). Second, as mentioned before, several factors (age, orthographic depth, fMRI task paradigm, etc.) are not considered in the current analysis. Third, diffusion MRI and resting-state fMRI are important parts of neuroimaging study on dyslexia. Given that these studies have their characteristics in terms of data analysis and result reports (e.g., fiber tracking), as well as a relatively limited number, it is hard to run mete-analysis. Nevertheless, it is informative to include these studies when discussing the current findings and future directions.</p><p>Table</p><p>24.

For ES-SDM/AES-SDM, it says “For ES-SDM, a previous simulation showed that an uncorrected threshold of p=0.005 with a cluster extent of 10 voxels and SDM-Z&gt;1 adequately controlled the probability of detecting an effect by chance, and it is thus recommended (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5918306/#R41">Radua et al., 2012</ext-link>). However, this is again an informal control of the false positive rate and could be too conservative or too liberal in other datasets, it must be understood as an approximation to corrected results.” Therefore, it does not necessarily mean that a more conservative threshold should be used for ES-SDM.

Each technique has its strength and weakness, while they can all contribute to depicting the whole picture. The main aim of an fMRI/sMRI/PET meta-analysis is to synthesize existing evidence. Therefore, in my opinion, &quot;the neurophysiology of changes in brain structure and function is unknown&quot; is not a limitation of this study. In synthesizing the previous findings, the authors recreated the statistical maps, which can be more sensitive than other coordinate-based meta-analytic approaches. Even though, analysis with the original statistical maps will be beneficial. These maps can be acquired by requiring the authors of the original studies or downloading from neural data sharing platforms such as Neurovault (https://neurovault.org/). Second, as mentioned before, several factors (age, orthographic depth, fMRI task paradigm, etc.) are not considered in the current analysis. Third, diffusion MRI and resting-state fMRI are important parts of neuroimaging study on dyslexia. Given that these studies have their characteristics in terms of data analysis and result reports (e.g., fiber tracking), as well as a relatively limited number, it is hard to run mete-analysis. Nevertheless, it is informative to include these studies when discussing the current findings and future directions.</p></disp-quote><p>We deleted “the neurophysiology of changes in brain structure and function is unknown” and added the lack of original statistical maps as a limitation on page 31. Second, we conducted confirmation analysis, and now these factors (age, task, orthographic depth) are taken into account when making conclusions. Third, we added findings from DTI and resting state studies to be more informative on page 20.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Table</p><p>24.
