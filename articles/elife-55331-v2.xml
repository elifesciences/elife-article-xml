to three identified neurosteroid-binding sites in the α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) contributes to neurosteroid allosteric modulation. We found that the potentiating neurosteroid, allopregnanolone, but not its inhibitory 3β-epimer epi-allopregnanolone, binds to the canonical β<sub>3</sub>(+)–α<sub>1</sub>(-) intersubunit site that mediates receptor activation by neurosteroids. In contrast, both allopregnanolone and epi-allopregnanolone bind to intrasubunit sites in the β<sub>3</sub> subunit, promoting receptor desensitization and the α<sub>1</sub> subunit promoting effects that vary between neurosteroids. Two neurosteroid analogues with diazirine moieties replacing the 3-hydroxyl (KK148 and KK150) bind to all three sites, but do not potentiate GABA<sub>A</sub>R currents. KK148 is a desensitizing agent, whereas KK150 is devoid of allosteric activity. These compounds provide potential chemical scaffolds for neurosteroid antagonists. Collectively, these data show that differential occupancy and efficacy at three discrete neurosteroid-binding sites determine whether a neurosteroid has potentiating, inhibitory, or competitive antagonist activity on GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurosteroids</kwd><kwd>gabaa receptor</kwd><kwd>desensitization</kwd><kwd>radioligand binding</kwd><kwd>photoaffinity labeling</kwd><kwd>site-directed mutagenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2R01GM108799-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evers</surname><given-names>Alex S</given-names></name><name><surname>Covey</surname><given-names>Douglas F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5K08GM126336-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Wayland WL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01GM108580-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akk</surname><given-names>Gustav</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013395</institution-id><institution>Taylor Family Institute for Innovative Psychiatric Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Zi-Wei</given-names></name><name><surname>Reichert</surname><given-names>David E</given-names></name><name><surname>Covey</surname><given-names>Douglas F</given-names></name><name><surname>Akk</surname><given-names>Gustav</given-names></name><name><surname>Evers</surname><given-names>Alex S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Differential, state-dependent occupancy of three discrete binding sites on α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors determines whether a specific neurosteroid analogue potentiates or inhibits GABA-elicited currents or competitively antagonizes neurosteroid action.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurosteroids (NS) are endogenous modulators of brain development and function and are important mediators of mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belelli and Lambert, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mitchell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Represa and Ben-Ari, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grobin et al., 2006</xref>).

The principal target of NS is the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA<sub>A</sub>R). NS can either activate or inhibit GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs.

In addition to enhancing channel opening, PAM-NS increase the affinity of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R for orthosteric ligand binding, an effect thought to be mechanistically linked to channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harrison et al., 1987a</xref>).</p><p>GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGIC) composed of two α-subunits (α<sub>1–6</sub>), two β-subunits (β<sub>1–3</sub>) and one additional subunit (γ<sub>1–3</sub>, δ, ε, θ or π) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sigel and Steinmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sieghart, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Olsen and Sieghart, 2008</xref>).

Specifically, the α subunit TMDs are essential to the actions of PAM-NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Laverty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sugasawa et al., 2019</xref>). Mutagenesis studies in α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>2</sub>γ<sub>2</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs have identified several residues in the α<sub>1</sub> subunit, notably Q242 and W246 in TM1, as critical to NS potentiation of GABA-elicited currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hosie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hosie et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Akk et al., 2008</xref>). Crystallographic studies have subsequently shown that, in homo-pentameric chimeric receptors in which the TMDs are derived from either α<sub>1 </sub>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Laverty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) or α<sub>5</sub> subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miller et al., 2017</xref>), the NS 3α,21dihydroxy-5α-pregnan-20-one (3α5α-THDOC), pregnanolone and alphaxalone bind in a cleft between the α subunits, with the C3-hydroxyl substituent of the steroids interacting directly with Q242 in the α subunit (αQ242). PAM-NS activate these chimeric receptors, and their action is blocked by αQ242L and αQ242W mutations. These studies posit a single canonical intersubunit binding site for NS action that is conserved across the six α subunit isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Laverty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>An alternative body of evidence suggests that PAM-NS modulation of GABA<sub>A</sub>R function is mediated by multiple mechanisms and/or binding sites. Site-directed mutagenesis has identified multiple disparate residues on GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs that affect NS-induced activation, suggestive of two NS-binding sites: one site mediating potentiation of GABA responses and the other mediating direct activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hosie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hosie et al., 2009</xref>). Single channel electrophysiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Akk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akk et al., 2004</xref>) as well as studies examining neurosteroid modulation of [<sup>35</sup>S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Evers et al., 2010</xref>), have also identified multiple distinct effects of NS, with various structural analogues producing some or all of these effects, consistent with multiple NS-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hosie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hosie et al., 2009</xref>). Our recent photolabeling studies have confirmed that there are multiple PAM-NS-binding sites on α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to the canonical site at the interface between the TMDs of adjacent subunits (intersubunit site) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Laverty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), we identified NS-binding sites within the α-helical bundles of both the α<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>3</sub> subunits (intrasubunit sites) of α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). 3α5αP binds to all three sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2019</xref>); mutagenesis of these sites suggests that the intersubunit and α<sub>1</sub> intrasubunit sites, but not the β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit site, contribute to 3α5αP PAM activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). A functional effect for NS binding to the β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit site has not been identified.</p><p>The 3α-hydroxyl (3α-OH) group is critical to NS activation of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and 3β-OH NS lack PAM activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). Indeed, many 3β-OH NS are GABA<sub>A</sub>R NAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lundgren et al., 2003</xref>). While molecular docking studies have suggested that the 3β-OH NS epi-pregnanolone (3β5βP) should compete for binding with PAM-NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miller et al., 2017</xref>), 3β-OH NS are non-competitive inhibitors with respect to GABA and 3α-OH NS, indicating that they are unlikely to act at the canonical PAM-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). Steroids with a sulfate rather than a hydroxyl at the 3-carbon are also GABA<sub>A</sub>R NAMs thought to act at sites distinct from GABA<sub>A</sub>R PAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akk et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Seljeset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Park-Chung et al., 1999</xref>). The precise location of this site is unclear, but crystallographic studies have demonstrated a possible binding site between TM3 and TM4 on the intracellular end of the α-subunit TMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Seljeset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Laverty et al., 2017</xref>). While 3β-OH NS and PS both inhibit GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, they likely act via interactions with distinct sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akk et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lundgren et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Seljeset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Laverty et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The goal of the current study was to determine the specific sites underlying the PAM and NAM actions of NS. We hypothesized that various NS analogues preferentially bind to one or more of the three NS-binding sites in the α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub>R, stabilizing distinct conformational states (i.e. resting, open or desensitized). To achieve this goal, we used two endogenous NS, the PAM-NS 3α5αP and the NAM-NS 3β5αP and two NS analogues, KK148 and KK150, in which a diazirine replaced the function-critical 3-OH group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). We examined site-specific NS binding and effects using NS photolabeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sugasawa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Budelier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Budelier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>) and measurements of channel gating and orthosteric ligand binding. The NS lacking a 3α-OH were devoid of PAM-NS activity, but surprisingly, KK148 and 3β5αP enhanced the affinity of [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding. We interpret this finding as evidence that these compounds preferentially bind to and stabilize desensitized receptors, since both open and desensitized GABA<sub>A</sub>R exhibit enhanced orthosteric ligand-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The results show that 3α5αP binds to the canonical β(+)–α(-) intersubunit site, stabilizing the open state of the receptor, whereas the 3-diazirinyl NS (KK148 and KK150) bind to this site but do not promote channel opening, and 3β5αP does not occupy this site. These data indicate that NS binding to the intersubunit sites is largely responsible for PAM activity and that the 3α-OH is critical for NS activation. In contrast, 3α5αP, 3β5αP and the 3-diazirinyl NS all bind to both the α<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit sites. Occupancy of the intrasubunit sites by 3α5αP, 3β5αP and KK148 promotes receptor desensitization. KK150 occupies all three NS-binding sites on α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, but produces minimal functional effect suggesting a possible scaffold for a general NS antagonist. These results shed new light on the mechanisms of NS allosteric modulation of channel function, and demonstrate a novel pharmacology in which related ligands bind to different subsets of functional sites on the same protein, each in a state-dependent manner, with the actions at these sites summating to produce a net physiological effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Distinct patterns of NS potentiation and enhancement of muscimol binding</title><p>The endogenous NS, 3α5αP is known to potentiate GABA-elicited currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and enhance [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding to α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harrison et al., 1987a</xref>).

None of the NS analogues lacking a 3α-OH potentiated GABA-elicited currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>).

KK148 enhanced [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding in intact cells as much or more than in permeabilized cells, indicating that this effect is not a result of selective NS actions on intracellular receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>A second possibility is that 3β5αP and KK148 selectively bind to and stabilize a high-affinity non-conducting state, such as a pre-active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gielen and Corringer, 2018</xref>) or a desensitized conformation of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R. This is expected to result in inhibition of receptor function; however, the magnitude of the effect may be small under the experimental conditions used to generate the traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. To examine the inhibitory effect of these NS analogues, we activated α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub>R with a saturating concentration (1 mM) of GABA and tested the effect of the NS on steady-state currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Germann et al., 2019a</xref>). KK148 and 3β5αP both decreased steady-state currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>), whereas KK150 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To further delineate the electrophysiological effects of these compounds, we focused on 3β5αP, since it is an endogenous NS and we had limited availability of KK148. Co-application of 3β5αP with 1 mM GABA preferentially inhibited steady-state rather than peak currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). While this result is consistent with stabilization of a desensitized state rather than a pre-active state, it is ambiguous because it is possible that the steroid has a slower onset than GABA, thus minimizing the effect on peak current. Additional evidence that 3β-NAM-NS stabilize a desensitized state includes studies examining their effects on inhibitory post-synaptic currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2002</xref>) and single channel currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akk et al., 2001</xref>).

For example, 3β5αP enhances [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding by two-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), whereas it reduces steady-state current by only ~25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To address this difference, we considered that the radioligand binding and electrophysiological assays are performed under different experimental conditions. The radioligand-binding studies are performed using low [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol concentrations to allow for sufficient dynamic range of ligand binding. In contrast, the desensitization experiments are performed at high orthosteric ligand (GABA) concentration to achieve high peak open probability and steady-state receptor desensitization, thus minimizing the number of channels in the resting state. To address the quantitative differences in results from the two assays, we analyzed the electrophysiological data in the framework of the three-state Resting-Open-Desensitized model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Germann et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Germann et al., 2019b</xref>). We assumed that both the open and desensitized states had higher affinity for muscimol than the resting state, and that the affinities were similar and could be treated as equal. We then calculated the predicted occupancy of the high-affinity states (P<sub>open</sub> + P<sub>desensitized</sub>) using parameters derived from the functional responses, to compare to the observed changes in binding. The raw current amplitudes of peak and steady-state responses were converted to units of open probability as described previously in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eaton et al., 2016</xref>), and the probabilities of being in the open (P<sub>open</sub>) or desensitized (P<sub>desensitized</sub>) states were calculated for different experimental conditions (see Materials and methods).</p><p>Application of 1 mM GABA elicited a current response that had a peak P<sub>open</sub> of 0.71 ± 0.25 (mean ± SD; <italic>n</italic> = 16).

Analysis of steady-state currents using the Resting-Open-Desensitized model indicates that the steady-state P<sub>desensitized</sub> is 0.829 in the presence of GABA, and 0.892 in the presence of GABA + steroid. The relatively small increase in the sum of (P<sub>open</sub> + P<sub>desensitized</sub>) (from 0.95 to 0.97) is due to the use of saturating GABA in these experiments.</p><p>To compare the data from the radioligand binding and electrophysiology experiments, we exposed oocytes containing α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to 20 nM muscimol and recorded currents before and after co-application of 3 μM 3β5αP. The percent reduction in steady-state current following 3β5αP exposure was measured and used to estimate the relative probabilities of resting, open and desensitized receptors. The application of 20 nM muscimol elicited a peak response with P<sub>open</sub> of 0.012 ± 0.004 (<italic>n</italic> = 6). The steady-state P<sub>open</sub> was 0.011 ± 0.004. In the same cells, subsequent exposure to 3 µM 3β5αP reduced the steady-state P<sub>open</sub> to 0.009 ± 0.004 (p=0.0174; paired <italic>t</italic>-test). The calculated steady-state P<sub>desensitized</sub> was 0.1001 in the presence of muscimol, and 0.2168 in the presence of muscimol + 3β5αP. Thus, there is a predicted two-fold increase in the sum of (P<sub>open</sub> + P<sub>desensitized</sub>) when the steroid is combined with muscimol, consistent with the doubling of muscimol binding caused by 3β5αP in the [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). While the measured changes in current are small, they are precise because each experiment served as its own control; a steady-state current was achieved during continuous agonist administration and the response to 3β5αP was then measured. Overall, these data indicate that when P<sub>resting</sub> is high (low orthosteric ligand concentration), an agent that stabilizes desensitized receptors may produce a small decrease in steady-state current, but a relatively large increase in the occupancy of desensitized state, at the expense of resting receptors. Conversely, with high orthosteric ligand concentrations (low P<sub>resting</sub>), a desensitizing ligand produces a relatively larger change in steady-state current as open receptors are converted to desensitized receptors with minimal effect on the sum occupancy of high-affinity states.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Binding site selectivity for NS analogues</title><p>To determine whether KK148 and 3β5αP stabilize a desensitized conformation of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R by selectively binding to one or more of the identified NS-binding sites on the GABA<sub>A</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), we first determined which of the identified NS sites they bind.

Product ion (MS2) spectra of the KK148- and KK150-labeled peptides from the α<sub>1</sub> subunit identified the labeled residue as Y415 for both KK148 and KK150 with photolabeling efficiencies of 0.77% and 0.62%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>); Y415 is the same residue labeled by KK123 at the α<sub>1</sub> intrasubunit site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). The KK148 and KK150 labeled peptides in TM4 of the β<sub>3</sub> subunit and corresponding unlabeled peptide were identified by fragmentation spectra as β<sub>3</sub>TM4 I426-N445. These data support labeling of the β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit site by KK148 and KK150. Fragmentation spectra of the peptide-sterol adducts were not adequate to determine the precise labeled residue because of low photolabeling efficiency (0.13% for KK148; 0.19% for KK150, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). No photolabeled peptides were identified in the β<sub>3</sub>(+)–α<sub>1</sub>(-) intersubunit site. This is likely because KK148 and KK150, similar to KK123, utilize an aliphatic diazirine that preferentially labels nucleophilic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sugasawa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Budelier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Das, 2011</xref>); such residues are not present in the intersubunit site.</p><p>We have also shown that KK123 labeling of the α<sub>1</sub> intrasubunit (α<sub>1</sub>Y415) and β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit (β<sub>3</sub>Y442) sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) can be prevented by a 10fold excess of 3α5αP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).

Specifically, 3α5αP enhances [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding through all three sites but predominantly through the intersubunit and α<sub>1</sub> intrasubunit sites, which we have previously shown mediate PAM-NS potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, 3β5αP and KK148 enhance [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding exclusively through the α<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit sites. KK150 antagonizes the effects of KK148 on [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding, presumably via the intrasubunit sites, and antagonizes the effects of 3α5αP, possibly via all three sites.

In receptors with combined mutations in the intersubunit and α<sub>1</sub> intrasubunit sites [i.e. α<sub>1</sub>(Q242L/N408A/Y411F)β<sub>3</sub>], 3α5αP significantly inhibited the steady-state current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>), an effect that was markedly reduced by mutations in the β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit site [α<sub>1</sub>(Q242L)β<sub>3</sub>(Y284F)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). These data suggest that 3α5αP exerts a desensitizing effect by binding to the β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit site and that 3α5αP binding to the α<sub>1</sub> intrasubunit site does not promote desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). Notably, 3α5αP exerted only a modest inhibitory effect in α<sub>1</sub>(Q242L)β<sub>3</sub> receptors in which occupancy of the β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit site should promote inhibition. This may be due to a counterbalancing action at the α<sub>1</sub> intrasubunit site, where 3α5αP binding contributes more to receptor activation as demonstrated by our previous observation that mutations in the α<sub>1</sub> intrasubunit site significantly reduce 3α5αP potentiation of GABA-elicited currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).

We found that the PAM-NS 3α5αP, but not the NAM-NS 3β5αP, binds to the canonical β<sub>3</sub>(+)–α<sub>1</sub>(-) intersubunit site that mediates receptor potentiation, explaining the absence of 3β5αP PAM activity.

Binding to the intrasubunit sites provides a mechanistic explanation for the NAM effects of 3β5αP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). 3α5αP also binds to the β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit site explaining the previously described desensitizing effect of the PAM-NS 3α5αP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haage and Johansson, 1999</xref>) and 3α5α-THDOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhu and Vicini, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bianchi and Macdonald, 2003</xref>). Two synthetic NS with diazirine moieties at C3 (KK148 and KK150) were used to identify NS-binding sites and shown to bind to the intersubunit as well as both intrasubunit sites. Neither of these ligands potentiated agonist-activated GABA<sub>A</sub>R currents, reinforcing the importance of the 3α-OH group and its interaction with α<sub>1</sub>Q242 in PAM actions. KK148 is an efficacious desensitizing agent, acting through the α<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit NS-binding sites. KK150, the 17α-epimer of KK148, binds to all three NS-binding sites, but neither activates nor desensitizes GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, suggesting a potential chemical scaffold for a general NS antagonist. Collectively, these data show that differential occupancy of and efficacy at three discrete NS-binding sites determines whether a NS ligand has PAM, NAM, or potentially NS antagonist activity on GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs.</p><p>The observation that 3β5αP and KK148 enhance orthosteric ligand binding but do not potentiate GABA-elicited currents first suggested that these NAM-NS selectively stabilize a non-conducting state that has high affinity to the orthosteric agonist muscimol. This liganded/closed state could represent a pre-active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gielen and Corringer, 2018</xref>) or a desensitized conformation of the receptor (n.b. there may be multiple desensitized conformations of the receptor, possibly including NS-specific desensitized states). Chang and colleagues have shown that orthosteric ligand affinity (muscimol or GABA) is greater in desensitized and activated (open) GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs than in resting (closed) receptors, with estimated GABA K<sub>d</sub> values of 78.5 μM, 120 nM and 40 nM for the resting, activated and desensitized α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>2</sub>γ<sub>2</sub> receptors respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 2002</xref>). Kinetic models also predict that a pre-active state should have higher affinity for an orthosteric agonist than the resting state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gielen and Corringer, 2018</xref>). To distinguish between stabilization of a pre-active and a desensitized state, we co-applied 3β5αP with a high concentration of GABA. 3β5αP reduced the desensitization time constant but did not reduce peak current amplitude. While this result is consistent with stabilization of a desensitized rather than a pre-active state, it is ambiguous as it could also be explained by NAM-NS having a slower onset of effect than GABA because of slow access of the steroid to its binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2007</xref>). However, this result is supported by studies examining inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in which a NAM-NS can be pre-applied and the GABA concentration step is extremely rapid as well as by single channel studies. In cultured hippocampal neurons, the NAM-NS 3β5β-THDOC significantly reduced IPSCs decay times but had no effect on IPSCs amplitude, consistent with a desensitizing effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). Single channel analyses provide the most definitive distinction between a pre-active and a desensitized state. Desensitization is predicted to shorten single channel clusters without affecting intracluster open or closed time distributions. In contrast, steroid-induced stabilization of a pre-active non-conducting state may be expected to lead to increased mean intracluster closed time. Single-channel studies examining the kinetic effects of the inhibitory steroids pregnenolone sulfate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akk et al., 2001</xref>) or the 3β5αP analogue (3β,5α,17β)−3-hydroxyandrostane-17-carbonitrile (3β5α-ACN) (Akk, G.; unpublished data) have indeed observed reduced mean cluster duration with minimal changes in intracluster open and closed time properties, indicative of the steroids promoting receptor desensitization. The α<sub>1</sub>V256S mutation eliminated the PS-mediated reduction in cluster duration indicating that the mutation prevents PS-mediated desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akk et al., 2001</xref>). 3β-hydroxy steroids act similarly to PS, including exhibiting sensitivity to the α<sub>1</sub>V256S mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). Overall, the preponderance of evidence indicates that 3β-NAM-NS such as 3β5αP inhibit GABA<sub>A</sub>R currents by stabilizing a desensitized state.</p><p>Our experimental and modeling data demonstrate that NAM-NS such as 3β5αP or KK148 enhance orthosteric ligand binding by increasing the population of receptors in a desensitized state. It is, however, unclear if 3β5αP or KK148 can promote transition of resting receptors directly to a desensitized state, thus bypassing channel opening. We propose that in the presence of low concentrations of orthosteric agonists (as in the [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding assays), there is a slow shift of receptors from resting through activated to a desensitized state with minimal change in the population of receptors in the activated state. The slow time course of accumulation of desensitized receptors is illustrated by experiments in which 10 µM 3β5αP is added to membranes that have been fully equilibrated with a low concentration (3 nM) of [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol and binding is measured as a function of time. Enhancement of [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding by 10 µM 3β5αP is slow, with a time constant of 4 min at 4°C (τ = 3.97 ± 0.15 min: mean ± SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, when α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are exposed to long pulses of a high concentration of GABA, KK148- and 3β5αP-induced desensitization is rapid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>), since in these conditions almost all of the receptors are either in an open or desensitized conformation and desensitization is not slowed by the transition from resting to open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jones and Westbrook, 1995</xref>). Thus, the slow enhancement of [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding by 3β5αP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) is likely rate-limited by the transition of receptors to activated then to desensitized states at 3 nM muscimol rather than by 3β5αP binding. These time course experiments are most consistent with a model in which receptors preferentially progress from the resting to active to desensitized states, which are then stabilized by the NAM-NS.</p><p>The selective binding of 3β5αP to a subset of identified NS-binding sites provides an explanation for its NAM activity. 3β5αP stabilizes desensitized receptors by binding to the α<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit sites, but does not activate the receptor because it does not bind to the intersubunit site. This site-selective binding is unexpected for several reasons. First, docking and free energy perturbation calculations in a prior study predicted that 3β5βP binds to the intersubunit site in a similar orientation and with free energies of binding that are equivalent to pregnanolone (3α5βP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miller et al., 2017</xref>). The modeling suggested that 3β5βP does not form a hydrogen bond with αQ242, a possible explanation for its lack of efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miller et al., 2017</xref>). Our docking studies also show similar binding energies and orientations of 3β5αP and 3α5αP binding in the β<sub>3</sub>(+)–α<sub>1</sub>(-) intersubunit site of either a homology model of the α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> receptor or the cryo-EM structure (PDB ID: 6I53) of the α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub>γ<sub>2</sub> receptor in a lipid nanodisc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Laverty et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). We have also shown that binding affinity or docking scores of NS binding to the intersubunit site are not significantly affected by mutations (α<sub>1</sub>Q242L, α<sub>1</sub>Q242W, α<sub>1</sub>W246L) that eliminate NS activation, although binding orientation is altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sugasawa et al., 2019</xref>). These data indicate that NS binding in the intersubunit site is tolerant to significant changes in critical residues and NS ligand structure, and are consistent with our findings that NS analogues, such as KK148 and KK150, can bind to the intersubunit site but have no effect on activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Thus, the peculiar lack of 3β5αP binding to the intersubunit site suggests that either: (1) details in the structure of the intersubunit site in the open conformation that explain the absence of 3β5αP binding are not apparent in current high-resolution structures or; (2) 3β5αP does not bind for other reasons. One plausible explanation is that 3β5αP, like cholesterol, has low chemical activity in the membrane and does not achieve sufficiently available concentration to bind in this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lange and Steck, 2016</xref>). This explanation would require that the chemical activity of 3β5αP differs between the inner and outer leaflets of a plasma membrane (presumably due to membrane lipid asymmetry) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lorent et al., 2020</xref>), since 3β5αP binds to the intrasubunit sites.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Comparison of allopregnanolone and epi-allopregnanolone docking poses within three neurosteroid binding pockets of the modeled α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub>R TMD and the cryo-EM structure of an α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub>γ<sub>2</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub>R (PDB ID: 6I53).</title><p>The two structures were read into UCSF Chimera and mutually aligned using MatchMaker.

In particular, binding of certain NS (3β5αP, KK148) to α<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit sites modulates the open-desensitized equilibrium. Interestingly, lipid binding to intrasubunit pockets in bacterial pLGICs analogous to the α<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit sites in GABA<sub>A</sub>R, also modulates receptor desensitization; docosahexaenoic acid binding to an intrasubunit site in GLIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basak et al., 2017</xref>) and phosphatidylglycerol in ELIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tong et al., 2019</xref>) increase and decrease agonist-induced desensitization, respectively. The combined results of mutational analyses and binding data demonstrate that the effects of various NS analogues are also a consequence of their efficacy at each of the sites they occupy.

Orthosteric agonist (GABA or muscimol) binding shifts the equilibrium towards high-affinity states (open and desensitized). 3α5αP allosterically stabilizes the open state through binding to the β<sub>3</sub>–α<sub>1</sub> intersubunit and α<sub>1</sub> intrasubunit sites and stabilizes the desensitized state through the β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>). In contrast, 3β5αP preferentially stabilizes the desensitized state through binding to both intrasubunit sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). KK148, like 3β5αP, stabilizes the desensitized state by binding to the intrasubunit sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>).

This model predicts that KK148 should act as a competitive antagonist to PAM-NS at the intersubunit site. This model also predicts that KK150 should be a competitive NS antagonist at all three binding sites. Consistent with this prediction, KK150 antagonizes 3α5αP and KK148 enhancement of [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Neurosteroids preferentially stabilize GABA<sub>A</sub>R in different states.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model showing three fundamental conformational states that depict the channel function in the GABA<sub>A</sub>R: a resting state; an open state; and a desensitized state.

At a synapse, GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are transiently exposed to high (mM) concentrations of GABA leading to a channel P<sub>open</sub> approaching one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Farrant and Nusser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feng and Forman, 2018</xref>). GABA is quickly cleared from the synapse leading to rapid deactivation with minimal desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jones and Westbrook, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Overstreet et al., 2000</xref>). In the presence of a PAM-NS, deactivation is slowed, resulting in a prolongation of the IPSC and increased inhibitory current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harrison et al., 1987a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhu and Vicini, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harrison et al., 1987b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chakrabarti et al., 2016</xref>). This effect is largely attributable to stabilization of the open state, presumably by binding to the intersubunit and α<sub>1</sub> intrasubunit binding sites. A second effect has been observed in which the PAM-NS 3α5αP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haage and Johansson, 1999</xref>) and 3α5α-THDOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhu and Vicini, 1997</xref>) prolong the slow component of GABA<sub>A</sub>R desensitization and slow recovery from desensitization. This results in increased late channel openings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhu and Vicini, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jones and Westbrook, 1995</xref>) and IPSC prolongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harrison et al., 1987b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chakrabarti et al., 2016</xref>). When the frequency of synaptic firing is rapid, the desensitizing effect of NS may also contribute to frequency-dependent reduction in IPSC amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhu and Vicini, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jones and Westbrook, 1996</xref>). The desensitizing effect of 3α5αP is predominantly mediated by binding at the β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit site. The balance between stabilization of the open and desensitized channels should be determined by the relative occupancies for the intersubunit site of the active receptor and the β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit site of the desensitized receptor. Computational docking of 3α5αP to these sites indicates modest differences in affinity between the sites with a rank order affinity of: intersubunit &gt; α<sub>1</sub> intrasubunit &gt; β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig11sdata1">Figure 11—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Mutational analysis of the effects of NS on enhancement of [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding also indicates that 3α5αP has a lower affinity to the β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Thus ,binding to the β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit site may serve as a negative feedback mechanism preventing excessive PAM-NS effects on synaptic currents.</p><p>We have identified specific NS-binding sites on α<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>3</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs using photoaffinity labeling, but the structural details of NS interactions with these sites have not yet been elucidated. While several high-resolution structures of αβγ GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in a lipidic environment (nano-discs) with bound orthosteric or allosteric ligands have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Laverty et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Masiulis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2020</xref>), there are no available structures of a heteropentameric GABA<sub>A</sub>R with a bound NS. There are, however, three X-ray structures of homopentameric, chimeric GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs crystallized from detergent, all showing NS bound only in the intersubunit site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Laverty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Since we identified intrasubunit NS-binding sites by photolabeling full-length heteropentameric GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in native membranes, it is possible that either the non-natural ECD-TMD junctions or the detergent environment explain why neurosteroid binding to an intrasubunit site was not observed. However, we have also identified an α<sub>1</sub> intrasubunit NS binding site using a 3α5αP analogue photolabeling reagent in a detergent-solubilized ELIC-α<sub>1</sub> chimeric receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sugasawa et al., 2019</xref>), indicating that NS can bind to this site in a detergent-solubilized chimeric receptor. It is important to note that there are many reasons why a bound NS (or any other ligand) may not be observed in X-ray or cryo-EM structures and that while these methods provide exquisite detail regarding the structure of ligand binding sites, they should not be regarded as a litmus test for the identification of ligand-binding sites. These reasons include: (1) a protein with steroid bound in the intrasubunit site may not form good crystals or may aggregate, precluding single particle analysis. (2) The conformation(s) observed in the X-ray or cryo-EM structure may not be the conformation to which NS preferentially binds in the intrasubunit site. (3) The ECD-TMD junction is the area of the protein that undergoes the most movement with activation and can be the least well-resolved portion of the transmembrane domains. (4) NS have multiple binding orientations and may be more mobile within the intrasubunit site making them more difficult to resolve. It is also important to consider that our analyses of the functional effects of NS binding were performed using α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. While the actions of inhibitory and potentiating NS in αβγ or αβδ receptors are qualitatively similar to those observed in αβ receptors, the trimeric receptors may have one less intrasubunit NS-binding site per pentamer, or an intrasubunit with different NS specificity or effect. Additionally, the presence of a γ-subunit has been shown to alter the conformational symmetry of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Laverty et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>) and may influence NS binding to an intrasubunit site or its functional effects.</p><p>In summary, this study describes a unique NS pharmacology in which different NS analogues selectively bind to subsets of three sites on the α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub>R, with each analogue exhibiting state-dependent binding at a given site. The combination of site-selectivity and state-dependence of binding determines whether a NS analogue is a PAM, a NAM or an antagonist of NS action at the GABA<sub>A</sub>R. It seems likely that other GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit isoforms and heteropentameric subunit combinations will reveal additional NS-binding sites with distinct affinity and state-dependence for various analogues. The identification of potent agonists and antagonists for each of these sites will provide tools for understanding the biological effects of endogenous neurosteroids and potentially for the development of precision neurosteroid therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construct design</title><p>The human α<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>3</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits were subcloned into pcDNA3 for molecular manipulations and cRNA synthesis.

Analysis and prediction of steady-state responses requires an additional parameter, termed Q, that describes the equilibrium between open and desensitized receptors (Q = Open/Desensitized).</p><p>The P<sub>open</sub> of the peak response is expressed as:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>Γ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>and the P<sub>open</sub> of the steady-state response as:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">y</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Q</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">L</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Γ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Γ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo> <mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow> <mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow/></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>[X]is the concentration of agonist present, and other terms are as described above.

In this structure, the cytoplasmic loop was replaced with the sequence SQPARAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jansen et al., 2008</xref>). The pentamer subunits were organized as A α<sub>1</sub>, B β<sub>3</sub>, C α<sub>1</sub>, D β<sub>3</sub>, E β<sub>3</sub>. The α<sub>1</sub> sequence was aligned to the β<sub>3</sub> sequence using the program MUSCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Edgar, 2004</xref>). The pentameric alignment was then used as input for the program Modeller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sali and Blundell, 1993</xref>), using 4COF as the template; a total of 25 models were generated. The best model as evaluated by the DOPE score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shen and Sali, 2006</xref>) was then submitted to the H++ server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biophysics.cs.vt.edu">http://biophysics.cs.vt.edu</ext-link>) to determine charges and optimize hydrogen bonding. The optimized structure was then submitted to the PPM server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://opm.phar.umich.edu/ppm_server">https://opm.phar.umich.edu/ppm_server</ext-link>) for orientation into a lipid membrane. The correctly oriented receptor was then submitted to the CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.charmm-gui.org">http://www.charmm-gui.org</ext-link>) to build the fully solvated, membrane bound system oriented into a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer. The system was fully solvated with 40715 TIP3 water molecules and ionic strength set to 0.15 M KCl. The NAMD input files produced by CHARMM-GUI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2016</xref>) use a seven-step process of gradually loosening constraints in the simulation prior to production runs. A 100 ns molecular dynamics trajectory was then obtained using the CHARMM36 force field and NAMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). The resulting trajectory was then processed using the utility mdtraj (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McGibbon et al., 2015</xref>), to extract a snapshot of the receptor at each nanosecond of time frame. These structures were then mutually aligned by fitting the alpha carbons, providing a set of 100 mutually aligned structures used for docking studies. The docking was performed using AutoDock Vina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Trott and Olson, 2010</xref>) on each of the 100 snapshots in order to capture receptor flexibility. 3α5αP and 3β5αP were prepared by converting the sdf file from PubChem into a PDB file using Open Babel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">O'Boyle et al., 2011</xref>), and Gasteiger charges and free torsion angles were determined by AutoDock Tools. Docking grid boxes were built for the β<sub>3</sub>–α<sub>1</sub> intersubunit, and the α<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit sites with dimensions of 15 × 15 × 15 Ångströms encompassing each binding pocket. Docking was limited to an energy range of 3 kcal from the best docking pose and was limited to a total of 20 unique poses. The docking results for a given site could result in a maximum of 2000 unique poses (20 poses × 100 receptor structures); these were then clustered geometrically using the program DIVCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Meslamani et al., 2009</xref>). The resulting clusters were ranked by Vina score and cluster size, and then visually analyzed. A comparison of proposed NS-binding sites between the modeled α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub>R TMD and the experimentally determined α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub>γ<sub>2</sub> cryo-EM structure PDB ID: 6I53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Laverty et al., 2019</xref>) was performed. The two structures were read into UCSF Chimera and mutually aligned using MatchMaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Meng et al., 2006</xref>). Using the same Vina docking configuration files discussed above, 3α5αP and 3β5αP were then docked into the respective sites of the α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub>γ<sub>2</sub> cryo-EM structure. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig11sdata1">Figure 11—source data 1</xref>; there was very little difference in the results between the modeled α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> and the α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub>γ<sub>2</sub> cryo-EM structure.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Drs.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is 'in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>'. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This report provides significant new information about the mechanisms of neurosteroid enhancement and inhibition of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABA <sub>A</sub>R) function. This study builds on an earlier investigation by the same group (Chen et al., 2019) showing that photoactive NS ligands can bind to three distinct sites on α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> GABA <sub>A</sub>Rs – the canonical intersubunit site at the interface between the transmembrane domains (TMDs) of adjacent subunits and additional intrasubunit sites located within the TMDs of the α and β subunits. In the current study, combining [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol radioligand binding assays, site identification by photoaffinity labeling, and electrophysiological analyses of steroid modulation of wildtype and mutant α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, the authors suggest that the overall functional effect of a given NS molecule is dependent upon which binding sites are targeted, with binding to the intersubunit site causing positive allosteric modulation (PAM), whilst occupancy of the intrasubunit sites appear to promote desensitization and negative allosteric modulation (NAM). Given the physiological significance of neurosteroids, elucidating how these structurally similar compounds can act as positive, negative or null modulators is clearly important.</p><p>Addressing the following essential revisions will strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The electrophysiological data presented (changes in steady state desensitization current magnitudes) is insufficient to conclude that NAM steroids inhibit GABA<sub>A</sub>R function by stabilizing a desensitized state. Additional experiments such as co-application of agonist + NS and monitoring desensitization kinetics would be informative. Measuring the rate of recovery from agonist-induced desensitization in the presence of neurosteroids might also be helpful. While the data presented can be interpreted as changes in desensitization, the authors should discuss that alternative models are also possible.

This implies that divergence in function is dependent upon differential binding/efficacy at these three sites, presumably due to the ligand sitting in each site in a different orientation. While the observation from the [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding experiments suggests that 3α5αP binds to the β<sub>3</sub> intrasubunit site with lower affinity, the data presented in Figure 6B also suggest that binding of 3α5αP to the intersubunit and α<sub>1</sub> intrasubunit sites works synergistically to increase muscimol binding. The reasoning being because with both sites intact, the Emax for muscimol binding is 374%, whereas mutating these sites individually causes similar decreases in Emax (to 159% and 146%). This implies an allosteric interaction between these binding sites, a conclusion which the authors also reach in their previous publication (Chen et al., 2019). This makes interpretation of the effects of mutations in these two sites (and possibly also the β intrasubunit site) difficult to interpret and to use to specifically dissociate a mutations effects on NS actions to binding to one particular site.

Indeed, as Gielen and Corringer (Gielan and Corringer, 2018) emphasize in their highly-detailed and well-researched review article, selective stabilization of a pre-active state can account for faster rate of current decay and lower steady-state current. However, as also pointed out, stabilization of the pre-active state is expected to reduce the peak response to agonist, whereas stabilization of a [post-active] desensitized state is predicted to be without effect on peak response (Figure 10 in Gielen and Corringer, 2018). As requested, we have now included a figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) showing that co-application of saturating GABA (1 mM) with 3β5αP does not reduce peak current amplitude, but does increase the rate of current decay. While this result appears consistent with stabilization of a desensitized state rather than a pre-active state, it is ambiguous because it is possible that the steroid has a slower onset than GABA, thus minimizing the effect on peak current. However, prior studies have also shown that GABA<sub>A</sub>R NAM-NS, such as 3β5β-THDOC (Wang et al., 2002) or pregnenolone sulfate (PS) (Eisenman et al., 2003, PMID: 12938673) do not reduce the peak amplitude of autaptic IPSCs at concentrations where the effect on decay time is evident. Also, as shown by Akk, exposure to PS (Akk et al., 2001) or 3β5α-ACN (unpublished results; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) reduces the mean single-channel cluster duration but does not affect the intracluster open and closed time distributions in steady-state single-channel recordings. This is indicative of NAM-NS-facilitated entry into a long-lived non-conducting state (although not necessarily the &quot;true&quot; desensitized state observed in the continuous presence of the transmitter) without modification of pre-active transitions. All of these points are now incorporated into modified Results and Discussion.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Single channel recordings from HEK-293 cells transfected with α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>2</sub>γ<sub>2</sub> GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and exposed to 50 µM GABA ± 3β5α-ACN.</title><p>The NAM-neurosteroid reduces cluster duration with minimal effects on intracluster closed time distribution.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55331-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Mutant receptors were not assayed for their sensitivities to agonist before measuring effects of neurosteroids.

Moreover, each of the ligands must have preferential affinity/efficacy for specific sites in different conformations (R-A-D). This point is illustrated by the model in Figure 12.</p><p>The data showing that mutations in specific neurosteroid binding sites decrease the effect of the neurosteroid (either enhancement of [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding or inhibition of steady-state current) indicate that neurosteroid binding at that site contributes to the effect. The % inhibition produced by the mutation does not denote the quantitative contribution of that site to the effect and the % effect of mutations in different sites should not be expected to be algebraically additive to the % effect in wild type receptors. In our previous publication (Chen et al., 2019) we proposed that super additivity of % inhibition of allopregnanolone-potentiated currents observed with mutations in the intersubunit and intrasubunit binding sites indicates an allosteric interaction between the two sites. But there are other explanations. The mutational data can be parsimoniously explained by neurosteroids binding and acting independently at each binding site with a non-linear summation of the effects (channel activation, enhanced muscimol binding or enhanced desensitization).</p><p>In its simplest form, our interpretation is based on the application of a two state (Resting-Activated) Monod-Wyman-Changeux concerted transition model to examine the effects of mutations on activation by agonist X. It is assumed that the receptor has two binding sites for X. MT1 (mutant #1) reduces activation through site 1 and MT2 reduces activation through site 2. The effect of each mutation is to independently change <italic>c</italic> (the ratio of the K<sub>d</sub> of X in the active state to its K<sub>d</sub> in the resting state) in one of the two binding sites. As an example, if either mutation increases c (reduces gating efficacy) in its site from 0.01 to 0.3 the following results are predicted: In wild-type receptor, P<sub>o</sub>,peak is 0.91 (simulation done at saturating concentration of X; L=1000). In MT1 (as well as in MT2), P<sub>o</sub>,peak is 0.25. And in the double mutant (MT1 + MT2), P<sub>o</sub>,peak is 0.01. So, either mutation individually elicits a 73% loss of gating, while the combination elicits a 99% loss of gating. Hence, the effects of independently acting mutations are not additive numerically. The same logic applies to the effects of mutations on other NS actions (enhancement of [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding or inhibition of steady state current.) The independence of the intersubunit and α<sub>1</sub> intrasubunit sites is also supported by the data in Figure 6C and D which show that the α<sub>1</sub>Q242L mutation has no effect on modulation of [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding by KK148 or 3β5αP, which do and do not occupy the intersubunit site respectively. If the α<sub>1</sub>Q242L mutation itself or NS occupancy of the intersubunit site allosterically modulates the α<sub>1</sub> intrasubunit site, there should be an effect on modulation of [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The demonstration that steroids apparently enhance [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding affinity without changing the number of sites (Figure 6—figure supplement 1) is in contrast to past reports from multiple labs that [<sup>3</sup>H]muscimol binding (to brain membranes) is characterized by high and low affinity components and that steroids and other GABA<sub>A</sub>R positive allosteric modulators increase the number of high affinity sites with little effect on their binding affinity.

Whether this is based on heterogeneity of receptor subtypes, or multiple states of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R is unresolved.

Whether this is due to recruitment of receptors or conversion of low affinity receptors to high affinity receptors is also unresolved.

There is significant evidence that the inhibition produced by PS represents desensitization. Akk et al., 2001, showed that exposure to PS reduces the mean duration of single-channel cluster by entry into a long-lived non-conducting state (Figure 1 in Akk et al., 2001). This effect was essentially eliminated by the α<sub>1</sub>V256S mutation (Figure 6 in Akk et al., 2001). The effect was termed &quot;block&quot; due to absence of structural evidence for desensitization. In other words, it was, and still is, not possible to distinguish the PS-elicited non-conducting state from the transmitter-elicited non-conducting state (i.e., true desensitization). The intracluster open and closed times were not affected by PS, indicating that PS does not act by stabilizing the pre-active state (as discussed by Gielen and Corringer, 2018, for DHA inhibition of GLIC). The major conclusion by Wang et al., 2002, was that 3β-hydroxy steroids act similarly to PS, including exhibiting sensitivity to the α<sub>1</sub>V256S mutation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Given the expectations that some of the neurosteroids stabilize a desensitized state, do they &quot;fit&quot; in the proposed intrasubunit sites in, for example, one of the published presumed desensitized-state structures of the α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub>γ<sub>2</sub> receptor?</p></disp-quote><p>Docking of 3β5αP and 3α5αP with the cryo-EM structure of a α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub>γ<sub>2</sub> receptor in a lipid nanodisc (6I53) and in a homology model of a α<sub>1</sub>β<sub>3</sub> receptor are now shown in Figure 11.

Our identification of the neurosteroid intrasubunit binding sites was done by photolabeling in native membranes. Either the non-natural ECD-TMD junctions or the binding in detergent are possible reasons that neurosteroid binding to an intrasubunit site was not observed. However, we did photolabel the α<sub>1</sub> intrasubunit site with a 3α5αP analogue photolabeling reagent in a detergent-solubilized α<sub>1</sub>-ELIC chimeric receptor (Sugasawa et al., 2019), indicating that neurosteroids can bind to this site in a detergent-solubilized chimeric receptor. There are many reasons why a ligand may not be observed in X-ray or cryo-EM structures. These reasons include: 1) the protein with steroid bound in the intrasubunit site may not form good crystals or may aggregate, precluding single particle analysis. 2) The conformation observed in the X-ray or cryo-EM structure may not be the conformation to which neurosteroid preferentially binds in the intrasubunit site. 3) The ECD-TMD junction is the area of the protein that undergoes the most movement with activation and can be the least well-resolved portion of the transmembrane domains. 4) Neurosteroids have multiple binding orientations and may be more mobile within the intrasubunit site making them more difficult to resolve.</p></body></sub-article></article>
