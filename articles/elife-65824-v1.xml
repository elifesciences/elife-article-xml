epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are common oncogenic driver events in non-small cell lung cancer. Although the activation of EGFR in normal cells is primarily driven by growth-factor-binding-induced dimerization, mutations on different exons of the kinase domain of the receptor have been found to affect the equilibrium between its active and inactive conformations giving rise to growth-factor-independent kinase activation. Using molecular dynamics simulations combined with enhanced sampling techniques, we compare here the conformational landscape of the monomers and homodimers of the wild-type and mutated forms of EGFR ΔELREA and L858R, as well as of two exon 20 insertions, D770-N771insNPG, and A763-Y764insFQEA. The differences in the conformational energy landscapes are consistent with multiple mechanisms of action including the regulation of the hinge motion, the stabilization of the dimeric interface, and local unfolding transitions. Overall, a combination of different effects is caused by the mutations and leads to the observed aberrant signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>in silico</kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>computational</kwd><kwd>simulations</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>mutations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>EPSRC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Astra Zeneca-EPSRC case studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galdadas</surname><given-names>Ioannis</given-names></name><name><surname>Haider</surname><given-names>Shozeb</given-names></name><name><surname>Gervasio</surname><given-names>Francesco Luigi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004325</institution-id><institution>AstraZeneca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AstraZeneca-EPSRC case studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galdadas</surname><given-names>Ioannis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Computational methods reveal how mutations affect the conformational landscape of the kinase domain of EGFR resulting in abnormal signaling and provide a structural framework for ongoing drug discovery efforts on mutant-specific EGFR inhibition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a cell surface receptor, which regulates cell proliferation and differentiation by phosphorylating downstream signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sigismund et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wee and Wang, 2017</xref>). Its physiological activity is tightly regulated and genetic mutations that lead to its uncontrolled activation have been associated with cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sharma et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sigismund et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, acquired somatic DNA alterations on the gene which encodes EGFR are found in 14–32% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collisson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) and are correlated with adverse prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirsch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sharma et al., 2007</xref>). EGFR in-frame deletions in exon 19 are the most prevalent of EGFR kinase domain mutations accounting for 45% of EGFR mutations in NSCLC, followed by the L858R missense mutation in exon 21, which accounts for approximately 40–45% of EGFR kinase domain mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sharma et al., 2007</xref>). Exon 20 insertions (Ex20Ins) collectively account for the third most common category of EGFR mutations found in NSCLC and are detected in 4–10% of the cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arcila et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yasuda et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with their purported role in the etiology of NSCLC, recent studies have shown that β3-αC ΔELREA, L858R, A763-Y764insFQEA, and D770-N771insNPG mutated EGFR proteins are oncogenic in both cell cultures and transgenic mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ji et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Politi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sordella et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yasuda et al., 2013</xref>). These mutations increase the kinase activity of EGFR and eliminate the dependence of the cancer mutants on EGF binding for activation, leading to stimulation of downstream pro-survival and cell-growth pathways, and consequently conferring oncogenic properties on EGFR. It should be noted though that the different mutations lead to different levels of activation, with ΔELREA-EGFR exhibiting the highest catalytic activity among them (29-fold higher than that for wild-type EGFR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gilmer et al., 2008</xref>), followed by the L858R (23-fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gilmer et al., 2008</xref>), the A763-Y764insFQEA (9-fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yasuda et al., 2013</xref>), and lastly the D770-N771insNPG (5-fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yasuda et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Like other eukaryotic protein kinase domains, the kinase domain of EGFR consists of a smaller N-terminal lobe (N-lobe) and a larger C-terminal lobe (C-lobe), with the ATP-binding site located between them. The N-lobe is composed of five β-strands and a helix referred to as αC-helix, whereas the C-lobe is predominantly helical. A glycine-rich loop located on the N-lobe, also known as the 'P-loop’, extends over the top of the ATP-binding site and along with a number of conserved residues facilitate the coordination of Mg-ATP in the catalytic pocket. Specifically, a conserved lysine (K745) binds to the α- and β-phosphates of ATP, underlying its importance for efficient phosphate transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Honegger et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Robinson et al., 1996</xref>). This lysine is buried deep within the interlobal cleft, where it is stabilized and oriented properly for catalysis by a conserved glutamate (E762) on the αC-helix. When these two amino acids are mutated, the kinase is unable to bind ATP leading to reduced activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Honegger et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jura et al., 2009</xref>). The aspartate (D855) of a conserved Asp–Phe–Gly (DFG) motif found at the N-terminal end of the activation loop (A-loop), is also a key regulatory element as it participates in the binding of the catalytic ion. The direct contact of the αC-helix with the N-terminal region of the activation loop together with the lysine-glutamate ion pair couple the conformations of the αC-helix and A-loop to ATP binding.</p><p>The full length of the A-loop is often unresolved in crystal structures and not visible in NMR spectra, which is indicative of its high flexibility and conformational variability. Broadly speaking, four conformations of the activation loop are seen in available kinase structures: active, Src-like inactive, substrate competitive, and detached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The active conformation of the activation loop, which includes the formation of a β-strand (β9-strand) with residues of the C-lobe, is shared by almost all protein kinases, whereas its inactive conformations vary among different kinases. The Src-like inactive conformation, named after the resemblance of the conformation to the inactive conformations of the Src kinase, is common in many kinases, including Src, Abl, CDK2, and EGFR and involves the formation of a two-turn helix at the N-terminal part of the activation loop. The substrate-competitive conformation, which features an activation loop positioned toward the hinge which shields the substrate-binding site, is adopted by IRK, Abl, Src, and p38 MAP kinases, among others. In the detached conformation, the activation loop assumes an extended conformation and the short αEF-helix is detached from the main body of the kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shan et al., 2013</xref>). This conformation is typically seen in kinase dimers in which the activation loop engages in intermolecular interactions, which may underlie trans-autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pike et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>It has been established that the activation of EGFR is associated with several rearrangements of different structural elements, apart from the ones seen in the activation loop, including that of the αC-helix of the N-lobe of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Endres et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kovacs et al., 2015</xref>). In the active conformation, the αC-helix adopts the so-called αC-in conformation, which is characterized by the full formation of the so-called catalytic spine and the formation of the functionally important KE salt bridge between K745 and E762. The helix also adopts the αC-out conformation in inactive forms of EGFR, in which the αC-helix is displaced, and the KE salt bridge is broken.</p><p>Long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations supported by H/D exchange experiments have identified the presence of a functionally important conformation of EGFR, in which the αC-helix exhibits local disorder (partial unfolding) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shan et al., 2012</xref>). This intrinsically disordered nature of the αC-helix has been postulated to be essential for the regulation of lateral propagation of EGFR signal in the absence of external stimulation through the formation of asymmetric homodimers or higher-order oligomers, which is an essential step for the activation of EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zanetti-Domingues et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, phosphorylation of Y869 has been shown to stabilize the αC-helix, and therefore the region that the receiver EGFR monomer binds to, lowering thus the energy threshold for EGFR multimerization and leading to propagation of the signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The active to inactive transitions of the above described structural elements are fundamental in the regulation of EGFR, and different mutations have been associated with dysregulation of these conformational changes in cancer. To better understand the effect of the most frequently observed and clinically relevant ΔELREA and L858R mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we performed here long-timescale atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and enhanced sampling free energy calculations with a recently developed force field. The chosen force field has been shown to be able to reproduce reliably the dynamics of both well-folded and partially unfolded domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Robustelli et al., 2018</xref>). As most Ex20Ins mutations have been shown to render EGFR resistant to most tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yasuda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ward et al., 2021</xref>), with the exception of the relatively rare A763-Y764insFQEA insertion, we tried to rationalize the behavior of a prototypical Ex20Ins, D770-N771insNPG, and of A763-Y764insFQEA, for which structural and biochemical data is available. The unbiased MD simulations of the isolated monomers and the asymmetric homodimers collectively lasted 36 µs for the WT and the mutant forms (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). As these simulations hinted at slow motions that could not be sampled even by long MD simulations, we also applied enhanced sampling techniques, and in particular, parallel tempering metadynamics (PTmetaD) simulations. PTmetaD simulations allow the exploration of biologically meaningful conformational changes of kinases that take place on time scales longer than those accessible through standard MD simulations and reconstruct the associated free energy landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sutto and Gervasio, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuzmanic et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Active conformation of the somatic mutations on EGFR kinase domain studied here.</title><p>The αC-helix is depicted in cyan, while the A-loop in orange.

However, although the K745-E762 salt bridge was broken, the repositioning of the αC-helix was not sufficient for the A-loop to adopt the characteristic two-turn helix that is found in the Src-like inactive conformation. In fact, the A-loop remained extended throughout the simulations, which suggests the presence of an energy barrier that needs to be crossed for the A-loop to break the β9-strand and form the characteristic two-turn helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sutto and Gervasio, 2013</xref>). This behavior is in line with the known activation mechanism of EGFR according to which dimerization is important for keeping the αC-helix in the αC-in conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shan et al., 2012</xref>) and suggests that the presence of ATP and phosphorylation may also be critical for full stabilization of the active conformation.</p><p>Indeed, our unbiased simulations of the asymmetric WT-EGFR dimer further support the notion that the active conformation is not adopted spontaneously in solution but is promoted by the interactions between the kinase domains in the asymmetric configuration. In particular, we see that the αC-helix is kept in the αC-in conformation predominately on the receiver monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). On the contrary, the αC-helix of the activator monomer is flexible enough to adopt αC-out conformations, similar to the ones the αC-helix adopts in the monomeric form of EGFR. Unlike the behavior of the αC-helix that we see in the asymmetric dimer, in the simulations of the symmetric dimer, in which both monomers are found in the Src-like inactive conformation, the αC-helix of both monomers remains in the αC-out conformations throughout the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>The free energy landscape reconstructed from multiple replica metadynamics simulations shows three main minima.

As expected, in the absence of a ligand or phosphorylation, these minima for the WT-EGFR correspond to inactive-like conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Specifically, the ensemble of conformations that corresponds to the deepest free energy minimum – (CV1, CV2) = (0.6, 0.16) – contains conformations in which the A-loop has adopted a semi-closed conformation that precludes the ATP-binding, while the αC-helix is mostly ordered and has adopted the αC-out conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, basin α1). The conformations in this basin are consistent with crystal structures of the Src-like inactive state (e.g. PDB ID: 2GS7) not only in the backbone arrangement but also in the details of key interactions. In particular, in this ensemble of conformations, the salt bridge of E762 with K745 is broken, and a new one is formed between K745 and D855.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Free energy surface of the WT EGFR as a function of CV1 (distances between K745:E762 and K745:D855) and CV2 (distance from reference Src-like inactive structure).</title><p>Representative structures for free energy minima are depicted in cartoon representation.

Notably, in the most populated state of this basin, the N-terminal region of the αC-helix is unfolded, in accordance with the predicted partially disordered nature of this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shan et al., 2012</xref>). In the other secondary free energy minimum – (CV1, CV2) = (0.6, 0.2) – the N-terminal end of the αC-helix is folded, and the helix has rotated out of the core of the protein, while the A-loop is still relatively unstructured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, basin α3). Although the conformations in this basin resemble a lot the ones seen in the deepest energy minimum, they differ in the fact that the αC-helix points further away from the C-lobe, which results in a slight increase in the interlobal distance seen in the conformations of this basin. Interestingly, reprojection of the free energy with respect to the interlobal distance shows that the WT samples multiple conformations of different N/C separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Together, these two secondary minima may represent metastable states that are important during the transition from the active to the Src-like inactive conformation and reflect the necessary rearrangements for the deactivation to take place, that is unfolding of the N-terminal end of the αC-helix, increase in the interlobal distance and formation of the two turn helix on the A-loop. Despite the fact that the minimum energy path connecting the Src-like inactive to active conformation does not pass through the basin where the N-terminal end of the αC-helix is highly disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>), the 2 kcal/mol energy difference between the deepest minimum and this metastable state suggest that, under physiological conditions, this state should still be accessible.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>L858R stabilizes active-like conformations</title><p>It has been suggested that the mutation of L858 to arginine enhances the kinase activity by shifting the equilibrium toward the active conformation through disruption of the hydrophobic packing of L858 with L747, I759, and L861 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) that is supposed to stabilize the Src-like inactive conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yasuda et al., 2013</xref>). However, our unbiased simulation of the monomeric L858R starting from the Src-like inactive conformation showed that transient, favorable interactions of R858 with D855 and D837 of the DFG and HRD motifs, respectively, and F723 of the P-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) stabilize the Src-like inactive conformation. On the contrary, in our unbiased simulations where L858R started from the active conformation, the side chain of R858 interacted mainly with E762 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The metadynamics simulations of the L858R mutant confirm the results that we obtained with an earlier force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sutto and Gervasio, 2013</xref>). The new free energy surface and the underlying structural ensemble is equivalent to the one obtained with the older force field, which bodes well for the robustness and accuracy of the results. The free energy landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) shows that the deepest basin corresponds to an ensemble of conformations that are very close to the active conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, basin δ1). The positively charged R858 was surrounded by a cluster of negatively charged residues (E758, E762, D837, and D855) and in this ensemble, the side chain of R858 fluctuated between two states in which it interacts with either D837 and D855, or E758 and E762. The interactions of R858 with D837 kept the A-loop in an extended, active-like conformation, in which the β9-strand on the A-loop is present. At the same time, as a result of the favorable interactions of R858 with E758 and E762, the αC-helix exhibited high secondary structure stability as opposed to the disorder seen in the αC-helix of the wild-type. Although the salt bridge of E762 with K745 is never present in this ensemble as is in the fully active conformation, the αC-helix is maintained close to the αC-in conformation, probably due to the interaction of R858 with E762. Overall, the presence of R858 favors the active conformation at the expense of the disordered state that is highly populated in the WT. Stabilization of the αC-helix through a mutation like L858R has been shown to promote EGFR dimerization and downstream signaling, which explains the activating nature of this mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). In a secondary minumum higher in energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, basin δ2), the side chain of R858 is found completely exposed to the solvent, but although the αC-helix is found in the αC-out conformation, the short helix on the A-loop is not formed.

Proline is a residue found commonly in turns and in the case of the D770-N771insNPG, the inserted P772 induces a turn that leads to the formation of a hydrogen bond between the backbone of D770 and the amide of the inserted G773 in the crystal structure. This backbone hydrogen bond orients, in turn, the side chain of D770 such that it forms a salt bridge with R779 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) that is maintained throughout the unbiased simulation initiated from the active conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), while the inserted N771 interacts with R837 of the E-helix. Interestingly, the same salt-bridge interaction is lost after about 300 ns in both replicas of the WT simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and R776 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone of A767 after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Given the different behavior of the mutant and WT, one would expect these interactions to stabilize the αC-in conformation in the mutant, however, the K745-E762 salt bridge breaks almost immediately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the αC-in conformation in which the mutant is found in the crystal structure is probably ligand-induced rather than mutation-induced.</p><p>The unbiased simulation of the D770-N771insNPG insertion that was initiated from the Src-like inactive conformation in the monomeric form suggests that as soon as the inserted triplet adopts an extended conformation where the backbone D770-G773 hydrogen bond is lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), D770 starts interacting only sporadically with R779 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In return, R779 forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of A767 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), similar to the stable interaction seen in the simulations of the WT-EGFR in the Src-like inactive conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Interestingly, R779H has been found to increase the phosphorylation of monomeric EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ruan and Kannan, 2015</xref>), underlying the role of R779 in the regulation of the αC-in and αC-out equilibrium. Our unbiased simulations suggest that the orientation that D770 adopts because of the inserted residues effectively prevents R779 from interacting with A767 that is seen in the αC-out conformation.

The role of this amplification, which is also seen in the A763-Y764insFQEA as it will be discussed later, is not yet clear, but it may be related to the Hsp90 recruitment and/or the binding kinetics of the substrate/inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A763-Y764insFQEA populates active-like states and semi-closed elongated states</title><p>When studied in vitro, the EGFR Ex20Ins variant A763-Y764insFQEA was the only EGFR Ex20Ins-harboring cell line inhibited by erlotinib at concentrations less than 0.1 µM, while other EGFR Ex20Ins, such as the D770-N771insNPG, had a reduced affinity and sensitivity to EGFR TKIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yasuda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirano et al., 2018</xref>). From the homology model of the A763-Y764insFQEA mutant that we built, which was based on the active conformation of the wild-type, it is not immediately clear how the mutation exerts its effect. Mutagenesis studies indicate that this insertion extends the αC-helix toward the N-terminal direction while the glutamic acid that is inserted through the mutation assumes the role of E762 in the WT-EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yasuda et al., 2013</xref>). The insertion leads to the replacement of I759 with alanine that has a shorter side chain. Again, the amino acid at position 759 is involved in hydrophobic interactions around L858 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), which have been speculated to be essential for stabilizing the Src-like inactive state.

On the other hand, in the simulations that we initiated from the active conformation, the A763-Y764insFQEA was the only mutant in which the αC-helix transitioned back to the αC-in conformation several times after it visited the αC-out conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This unique behavior implies that the intrinsic tendency of the A750-N756 segment of the N-terminal of the αC-helix to fold that we see in the simulation may restrict the conformational flexibility of the αC-helix and favor αC-in conformations.</p><p>The deepest minimum in the free energy landscape of A763-Y764insFQEA – (CV1, CV2) = (−0.7, 0.3) – corresponds to an ensemble where the A-loop of the mutant samples semi-closed conformations, but unlike the WT, the αC-helix is stabilized in an αC-in conformation, where the K745-E762 salt bridge is formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, basin γ1).

Interestingly, the A-loop in this ensemble also visited conformations in which the middle section of the A-loop formed a three-turn helix, reminiscent of an extended helix in the A-loop of MPSK1 kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, PDB ID: 2BUJ). This conformation is intriguing because the helix puts Y869, a well-known phosphorylation site of EGFR kinase, in an exposed position along with a group of glutamate residues (E865, E866, E868, and E872), which interact with K754 of the unfolded N-terminal end of the αC-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, basin β1). Interestingly, in a basin between 1 and 2, this conformation that is less populated in basin two becomes dominant and we see Y869 interacting with K754 and E762 with K860 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, basin β4). Moreover, the minimum energy path connecting the Src-like inactive to active conformation passes through this basin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>), which suggests that interactions of the unfolded N-terminal end of the αC-helix, which is now the 3 C loop, with the A-loop in the ΔELREA mutant should be important. This helical conformation of the activation loop might be involved in the phosphorylation of Y869. A similar conformation has been described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shan et al., 2013</xref> as an intermediate state of the active to Src-like inactive transition of the WT.</p><p>The third metastable minimum, slightly higher in energy than the other two, is very broad and consists of a divergent ensemble in which ΔELREA samples a range of conformations most of which are 'substrate-competitive' like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), that is neither the two-turn helix nor the nine strand on the A-loop is stable and the residues of the DFG motif are in the DFG-in orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, basin β3). In particular, in this ensemble, the A-loop points to the opposite direction with respect to the one seen in the active conformation, as seen in many kinases like the inactive conformation of the AuroraA kinase (PDB ID: 2WTV).</p><p>Although the ΔELREA is one of the most frequent mutations in NSCLC, the effect of ΔELREA on the dimerization ability of the ΔELREA-EGFR is poorly understood. Our simulations of the ΔELREA-EGFR in the asymmetric dimer do not show any significant alteration on the interface of the mutant dimer with respect to the WT, apart from the marginal stabilization of the inter-monomeric salt bridges K944-E962 and K752-E958 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We anticipate, however, that suppression of the intrinsic disorder of the αC-helix of the monomeric mutant that we see in all of the explored conformations during the PTmetaD simulations should promote the formation of active asymmetric dimers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In light of the clinical importance of EGFR kinase domain mutations in lung cancer, understanding the unique properties of mutant kinases is crucial to drug development and lung cancer biology and provides a good opportunity to understand better the biophysical mechanisms regulating receptor kinase activation. The design of conformation- and mutation-specific kinase inhibitors to target a diversity of cancer-causing mutations is of paramount importance to achieve the optimal therapeutic outcome for cancer patients and represents an unmet clinical need in precision oncology. A better understanding of how oncogenic mutations affect, at a molecular level, the structure and dynamics of the receptor with respect to the WT may potentially lead to personalized cancer treatment tailored to the genetic profile of each cancer patient. Here, we have presented the effect of four such mutations, namely the L858R, D770-N771insNPG, ΔELREA, and A763-Y764insFQEA, all of which have been shown to increase the catalytic activity of EGFR in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foster et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yasuda et al., 2013</xref>) and continuously signal the pathway, which stimulates cancer cell growth.</p><p>It has been well established that the activation of WT-EGFR is driven by ligand-induced dimerization or multimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zanetti-Domingues et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). In agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sutto and Gervasio, 2013</xref>), we observe that the active conformation of the WT-EGFR, in the absence of phosphorylation and ATP, is energetically unfavorable and infrequently sampled. The absence of a low-energy αC-in active conformation in which the catalytically important KE salt bridge between K745 and E762 is maintained suggests that dimerization is important to stabilize this conformation fully. Indeed, in our unbiased simulations of asymmetric EGFR homodimers, we see that the αC-helix is kept in the αC-in conformation predominately on the receiver monomer both of the WT and of the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Dimerization seems to suppress the intrinsic disorder at the receiver interface stabilizing the active conformation of the receiver kinase, as this is reflected on the increased stability of the KE salt bridge in the receiver kinase, but not in the activator. However, the αC-helix of the receiver is still flexible enough to sample occasionally αC-out conformations in most of the asymmetric dimers, albeit in lower frequency than the monomeric kinase or when it acts as a donor, which suggests that the binding of ATP might still be essential for the αC-helix to be locked fully in the αC-in conformation.</p><p>It should be noted that apart from the dimerization, which is affected by the order-disorder transitions of the C helix, the binding of the substrate and the phosphorylation of the A-loop and the C-terminal segment will also play a role in the relative population of active and inactive conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kovacs et al., 2015</xref>). For instance, the phosphorylation of the A-loop, albeit not strictly necessary to propagate the signal downstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>), affects the flexibility of the loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shan et al., 2012</xref>), further stabilizing the active state and affecting the catalytic efficiency both directly and indirectly.</p><p>We reasoned that a collective motion that might be more directly linked to the steady state catalytic activity might be that of the hinge region, which has been linked to the phosphorylation of the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pucheta-Martínez et al., 2016</xref>), the active to inactive transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shan et al., 2012</xref>), and also the release of the products. The unbiased simulations of the different mutants in the monomeric and homodimeric form show that, the monomer explores more 'open' hinge conformations with respect to the receiver kinase of the dimer, which is in agreement with the activating role of dimerization. Interestingly, two of the mutants (ΔELREA and L858R) explore more 'closed' hinge conformations in the dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>).The same trend is clearly visible in the reprojection of FE with respect to the interlobal distance, where the position of the global minimum follows the same order as the catalytic efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Although we can only speculate about this, it is likely that this compressed kinase seen in ΔELREA and L858R might be linked to slow release of the substrate/ligands.</p><p>In the global minimum of the free energy landscape of the WT-EGFR, the A-loop has adopted a semi-closed conformation that precludes the ATP-binding, and the αC-helix has adopted the αC-out conformation. The N-terminal end of it is partially unfolded in conformations that correspond to local minima, which is in line with the disordered nature of the αC-helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Light scattering and native gel electrophoresis have suggested that, unlike the WT-EGFR, which is found predominately in monomers in solution, the L858R EGFR preferentially forms dimers and oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shan et al., 2012</xref>). Earlier studies have shown that L858R promotes dimerization by suppressing the intrinsic disorder of the αC-helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sutto and Gervasio, 2013</xref>), which is an integral component of the dimerization interface, while it also promotes the active state. Our simulations corroborate this combined mechanism of action. The deepest free energy minimum corresponds to active conformations in which the interaction of R858 with D837 and D855 disfavors the formation of the characteristic two-turn helix on the A-loop of the Src-like inactive conformation, while the interaction of R858 with E758 and E762 represses the disorder in the αC-helix region, thus favoring the formation of asymmetric homodimers.</p><p>In-frame Ex20Ins are a subcategory of EGFR mutations, most of which are found in the αC-β4 loop that connects the αC-helix to the β4-strand of the kinase domain. TKIs (afatinib, lapatinib, neratinib, dacomitinib) targeting Ex20Ins EGFR have been shown to have limited activity in patients with EGFR-Ex20Ins-mutant tumors, with exception of the covalent inhibitor poziotinib, which has been found to demonstrate greater activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yasuda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ruan and Kannan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Robichaux et al., 2018</xref>) and in patient-derived xenograft models of EGFR Ex20Ins mutant NSCLC and in genetically engineered mouse models of NSCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Robichaux et al., 2018</xref>). According to our simulations, we reason that the amplification of the lobe separation that we observed in both the unbiased and PTmetaD simulations could explain the low sensitivity of D770-N771insNPG-EGFR to TKIs, as this motion is expected to affect the residence time of the TKIs in the binding site. Unlike previous suggestions, according to which the inserted residues would prevent the receptor from adopting an αC-out conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>), we sample such conformations, in which though the A-loop is maintained in an extended, active conformation. Interestingly, BDTX-189, a recently developed inhibitor that targets Ex20Ins mutations, exhibited potent tumor growth inhibition and tumor regression in preclinical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hamilton et al., 2020</xref>). The scaffold of BDTX-189 is similar to that of the lapatinib analogue neratinib, which suggests that BDTX-189 probably binds αC-out conformations in accordance with the low energy of such states on the free energy landscape of D770-N771insNPG. It is possible that the mutation decouples the N/C-lobe motions and subsequently the coupling between the αC-helix and the A-loop –a coupling that is important for the transition from the active to the inactive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huse and Kuriyan, 2002</xref>) – and makes the transition to the inactive conformation less favorable.</p><p>Unlike the majority of EGFR Ex20Ins (including the relatively rare D770-N771insNPG), which appear to be relatively insensitive to early EGFR TKI's, recent data show that the A763-Y764insFQEA insertion has greater sensitivity to agents such as gefitinib, erlotinib, and osimertinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yasuda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Floc'h et al., 2018</xref>). Our simulations show that the most stable conformation of the <italic>apo</italic> A763-Y764insFQEA corresponds to an αC-in conformation in which, however, the A-loop is not fully extended as seen in the active conformation. Interestingly, the fully active conformation that is not favorable in the <italic>apo</italic> WT-EGFR, appears as a relatively low energy secondary minimum in the FES of the A763-Y764insFQEA. What is more, after simulation of a homology model of the mutation in the asymmetric dimer, we anticipate the mutation to also promote the formation of such dimers, which would explain the higher activity of A763-Y764insFQEA-EGFR compared to D770-N771insNPG-EGFR. Specifically, the introduced F760 of A763-Y764insFQEA is accommodated in the hydrophobic cleft formed by V952, M949, and K953, while K757 of the receiver kinase in the WT is replaced by D761 in the A763-Y764insFQEA, which can interact with K953 of the activator kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, the introduction of the insertion and the consequent extension of the αC-helix by one turn brings K757 and K754 in such a position that allows them to interact more efficiently with the side chains of E967 of the αI-helix, and of D960 and D958 of the αH-αI loop, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Notably, these interactions cannot not occur in the WT.</p><p>Through PTmetaD simulations, we explored the differences between the conformational landscapes of EGFR Ex20Ins and the WT, L858R, and ΔELREA mutants. Such differences are not evident from the available crystal structures where the residues of the ATP pocket appear to be identical among the different structures. We believe that the conformational ensembles from the PTmetaD simulations of the EGFR Ex20Ins with the more extended conformations that lead to a more open active site can be used to identify novel inhibitors with increased selectivity against the mutant EGFR. We should note that in such drug design efforts, using the appropriate conformation is of great importance. For example, we can already see that targeting the L858R-EGFR with αC-out inhibitors, like lapatinib, would lead to steric clashes that are not present in the pocket of an Ex20Ins EGFR like A763-Y764insFQEA, while inhibitors like gefitinib can be accommodated better in the tighter pocket of L858R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>It has been postulated that the β3-αC deletion forces the αC-helix into the αC-in position promoting the kinase activation and decreasing the sensitivity to αC-out inhibitors, like lapatinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foster et al., 2016</xref>). The free energy landscape of the ΔELREA mutation, however, suggests that this notion needs to be revisited. The most stable conformations of the unphosphorylated monomeric form correspond to minima in which the C-terminal end of the β3-strand unfolds, giving the αC-helix the necessary flexibility to adopt αC-out conformations. However, both the unbiased simulations and the conformations within all the energy basins show that the ΔELREA deletion almost completely suppresses the local disorder at the N-terminal end of the αC-helix region, which in turn is expected to favor the formation of asymmetric dimers that could explain the increased activity of ΔELREA EGFR with respect to the WT. Moreover, simulations of the binding of lapatinib to the WT-EGFR have suggested that the slow kinetics of lapatinib's binding are probably associated with the transition to a conformation in which the αC-helix is partially unfolded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shan et al., 2012</xref>). It is, thus, tempting to speculate that the absence of such intrinsically disordered conformations in the free energy landscape of ΔELREA could explain the decreased sensitivity of ΔELREA-EGFR to lapatinib.</p><p>Our study reveals intricate differences between EGFR mutations, even between mutations that occur within the same exon. In light of the present results, we can rationalize the activation effect of these mutations in an atomic level resolution.

Given the previous success of these three CVs to probe the effect of oncogenic mutations on the free energy landscape of EGFR’s kinase domain, here, we used the same set of contacts for the contact map distance of CV2 and CV3 as the ones used by Sutto et al. for the WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sutto and Gervasio, 2013</xref>). The set of contacts includes only those pairs that are able to discriminate between the two structures, that is, pairs of atoms that describe contacts, which are formed in the active conformation but are broken in the Src-like inactive and vice-versa.</p><p>To further assess whether these contact maps and their adaptation from Sutto et al. were indeed able to describe the transition of interest, prior to the PTmetaD simulations, we ran a set of steered-MD (SMD) simulations, where we steered the active to Src-like inactive transition along the contact map space. In these exploratory SMD simulations, the decrease of the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) with respect to the Src-like inactive conformation when we start from the active conformation and steer toward the Src-like conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) as well as the satisfactory superposition of the final SMD conformation to the Src-like inactive conformation confirmed the adequacy of these contact maps, which were then used in the PTmetaD.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Steered MD simulations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RMSD change with respect to the active and Src-like inactive conformation during the SMD simulation of the A763-Y764insFQEA EGFR.

The ‘hottest’ replica should explore the space fast enough to overcome barriers for the process under investigation, whereas the intermediate replicas are necessarily introduced to bring the system smoothly from the ‘hottest’ ensemble to the ‘coldest’ ensemble. In the parallel tempering scheme that we used, the temperature is exploited to enhance the phase-space exploration within a replica exchange scheme, which ensures the correct sampling of the canonical ensemble for all the replicas. The free energy surface of each mutant was reconstructed by integrating the deposited bias during the simulation of the biologically relevant and lowest-temperature replica (T = 300 K), as required by the metadynamics algorithm.</p><p>To obtain a representative structure of each free energy basin, a clustering of the ensemble of conformations falling within each basin has been performed. The gromos algorithm of the <italic>g_cluster</italic> program from the GROMACS package has been used with the RMSD on the C atoms of the A-loop and the αC-helix residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pan et al., 2014</xref>) on the ensemble of the 300 K replica as the clustering metric with a cutoff of 0.2 nm. In the most populated cluster of each basin, the central structure, that is, the structure with the smallest distance to all of the other members of the cluster, has been picked as representative of the basin.</p><p>To map the position of the equivalent mutant structures on the contact map space of the WT, the distance between the atoms of each contact in the energy minimized structures of each mutant was compared to WT-reference structure and the degree of formation of each contact in the structure R was calculated using the sigmoid function that is described above. Deviation of the position of the atoms that define each contact in each mutant from the position of the equivalent atoms in the WT structure that was used as the reference, results in different positions of the crosses in the contact map space of the WT. On top of that, for the FES plots, the calculated contact-map distances were normalized and, therefore, mutants that explored larger portions of the contact-map space comparatively push the position of crosses further toward zero.</p><p>To trace the minimum energy path that connects the active to Src-like inactive conformation based on the calculated FES we used the MEPSAnd tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marcos-Alcalde et al., 2020</xref>) in a similar way to that described previously to characterize complex paths associated with biomolecular processes, including conformational transitions, and ligand (un)binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berteotti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernetti et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>IG is funded by Astra Zeneca-EPSRC case studentship awarded to FLG and SH. HEC-BioSim (EP/R029407/1), PRACE (Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Project BCV-2019-3-0010) and the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) (Project 280 and S847) are acknowledged for their generous allocation of supercomputer time.</p> </ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>is affiliated with AstraZeneca.

of the wild-type EGFR kinase and a number of oncogenic mutants. It suggests that the effects and the underlying activation mechanisms of these mutations are varied. In particular, it suggests that the Exon20-deletion mutant tends to adopt a more open conformation, which may be a potentially important finding for drug discovery.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structural basis of the effect of activating mutations on the EGF receptor&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors present a metadynamics study comparing the free energy landscape of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and highlight the unique ways by which oncogenic mutations alter EGFR free energy landscape. The work identified a number of intermediate states unique for some of the mutants, which may be exploited in drug discovery. The characterization of one specific mutant, the Exon 20 insertion, is particularly timely, as many EGFR inhibitor drugs are inactive to this mutant, and drug discovery targeting this mutant therefore remains a challenge.</p><p>The reviewers raised a number of important concerns that need to be addressed to make this manuscript suitable for publishing in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should compare the kinetics of inactive-active transition for all four mutants and map the lowest energy path from the inactive to active state. If the change in free energy of transition in these mutants correlate to their known fold-change in catalytic activity, this would provide additional support for their model.</p><p>2) The observation that the Exon 20 mutants furnish a more open active site is perhaps the most direct and interesting result of this study. This should be further explored. For example, the authors can dock small molecules into a representative conformations of L858R and Exon 19 mutants, and into a representative conformation of a Exon 20 mutant, and hopefully show that the top hits of the former do not fare well in the latter and vice versa. This would be extremely informative to drug discovery.</p><p>3) Some of the simulation and analysis details are not described clearly or accurately, notably related to the used important collective variables. The positions of the active and inactive positions in terms of CV space seem to change across different free energy surfaces using the same CVs (See Figure 2-5). The authors need to further describe the CV they chose and explain the rationales behind the choices.</p><p>4) Three collective variables (CVs) were defined in the Methods description: CV1 was the difference between two salt-bridge distances, and CV2 and CV3 were distances in the contact map space with respect to the inactive and active conformations, respectively. Were all three CVs used in running the metadynamics simulations? In the figures and related simulation analysis, only CV1 and CV2 were used and appeared to be wrongly labeled. CV2 and CV3 were defined only related to the A-loop in the Sutto and Gervasio 2013, but described differently in this study. They need to be clarified.</p><p>5) It would help to plot CVs versus time to examine the simulation convergence and replica exchange rates. They also need to be compared with the unbiased simulation results in Figure 1-S2, which may support the authors statement that &quot;these simulations hinted at slow motions that could not be sampled even by long MD simulations&quot;. This can be included in the SI.</p><p>6) The free energy surfaces appear noisy. Why were certain energy minima ignored for more detailed characterization, e.g., ~(0.22, 1.8) and ~(0.5, 2.3) in Figure 5 and a number of others with ~3-4 kcal/mol free energy values?</p><p>7) In Figures 3 and 4 it is confusing to show two different conformations for one single energy minimum. If they are indeed different low energy states, additional CVs may need to be defined with the corresponding new free energy profiles calculated to characterize these conformations. This need to be discussed and clarified.</p><p>8) In Figure 3 for the L858R mutant, why a clear energy minimum was identified in the &quot;active&quot; state in the previous study, but not in the current study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors present a metadynamics study comparing the free energy landscape of four distinct somatic mutations in EGFR and highlight the unique ways by which oncogenic mutations alter EGFR free energy landscape. The conformational landscape of the wild type receptor and EGFR mutants have been extensively studied in previous studies, and while the identification of intermediate states for some of the mutants is interesting, much of what the authors propose mostly validates or reinforces the models already put forward in previous studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study has presented unbiased microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and advanced parallel tempering metadynamics (PTmetaD) simulations to examine conformational free energy landscapes of the wild-type (WT) and four oncogenic mutants of the EGFR kinase domain. Notably, the authors have applied the same techniques to simulate the same WT and L858R mutant of EGFR in a previous study (Sutto and Gervasio, 2013, PNAS). The main difference in the present study is about simulations of three new mutants: D770-N771insNPG, A763-Y764insFQEA and dΔELREA. However, all the studied mutations generally bias the protein towards the active state, i.e., activating mutations. A number of previous publications as cited by the authors have also provided detailed mechanisms into inactivation of the WT EGFR kinase (Shan et al., 2013) and conformational changes in the activating mutant enzyme (Shan et al., 2012). In this context, the present study even with extensive simulations mostly confirms previous work and the new mechanistic insights to advance our understanding of the protein function are limited.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1. This paper has applied extensive unbiased and advanced enhanced sampling simulations to study the EGFR kinase domain, which is critically important for developing cancer treatments.</p><p>2. Free energy profiles can be calculated from particularly the enhanced sampling simulations to characterize conformational dynamics of the WT and mutant EGFR quantitatively.</p><p>3. Distinct conformations have been identified from the free energy profiles for the WT and four mutants of EGFR. It's clear that the mutations will bias the protein towards the activation state, which can help explaining the related previous experimental findings.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. The work is not novel in the sense that the same techniques had been applied on the same WT and L858R mutant EGFR, except that another three different mutations are investigated here.</p><p>2. Some of the simulation and analysis details are not described clearly or accurately, notably related to the used important collective variables.</p><p>3. Apparent discrepancies are found between this study and previous work on the WT and L858R mutant EGFR.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This work expands the group's previous studies that used conformational free-energy calculations to survey the conformational space of EGFR kinase WT and L858R. They apply a more recent force field and show that the observations on L858R are consistent with the previous results, which helps build confidence for this approach. They extend the work to cover Exon 20 insertion EGFR in this study. The quantitative characterization of the conformational landscapes in this work is important. The landscapes of various EGFR mutants together present a rich picture of how seemingly minor mutations can alter the conformational dynamics of EGFR kinase significantly, which is likely the case for many other proteins.</p><p>This work is particularly interesting with respect to drug discovery. An often discussed vision of drug discovery is to tailor drug molecules to selectively bind to the target in its minority but unique conformation to achieve specificity and reduce toxicity. This remains conceptual because the minority conformations are typically difficult to capture by crystal structures. MD simulations often capture such conformations but reliable quantification in terms of free energy is needed to choose a conformation to pursue drug discovery and such quantification remains untrusted. This work stands out in presenting a coherent and detailed quantitative survey. One of the more important results of this work is the characterization of exon 20 EGFR, showing that the insertions &quot;open&quot; the kinase and alter the shape of the active site. This explains why developing exon 20 drug remains unaccomplished and suggests a strategy for drug discovery.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65824.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should compare the kinetics of inactive-active transition for all four mutants and map the lowest energy path from the inactive to active state. If the change in free energy of transition in these mutants correlate to their known fold-change in catalytic activity, this would provide additional support for their model.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we traced the minimum energy path (MEP) that connects the Src-like inactive to active conformation according to the calculated FES for each system studied. The MEP of each system is now given in the SI (Figure 7—figure supplement 3). With the caveat that the projection of a multidimensional FE on one dimension can underestimate the height of the energy barriers, the MEPs confirm that all mutants decrease the energy barrier to sample extended-A-loop active-like conformations.</p><p>Still, it is our understanding that, once the kinase is in an active-like state, a number of other factors affect the catalytic activity, complicating the comparison of these profiles with available experiments (Yasuda et al., 2014, Gilmer et al., 2008).</p><p>Apart from the dimerisation, which is affected by the order-disorder transitions of the aC helix, the binding of the substrate and the phosphorylation of the A-loop and the C-terminal segment will also play a role (Kim et al. Biochemistry, 2012, Kovacs et al., Annu. Rev. Biochem., 2015). For instance, the phosphorylation of the A-loop, albeit not strictly necessary to propagate the signal downstream (Zhang et al., Cell, 2006), affects the flexibility of the loop (Shan et al. Cell., 2012), further stabilising the active state and affecting the catalytic efficiency both directly and indirectly.</p><p>We reasoned that a collective motion that might be more directly linked to the steady state catalytic activity might be the hinge motion. It is linked to the phosphorylation of the substrate (as shown by NMR experiments in Src, Abl and other kinases), the active to inactive transition (Shan et al., PNAS, 2012), and also the release of the products.</p><p>To check whether the mutations have an effect on the hinge motion, we plotted the time series of this distance in the (1ms long) unbiased simulations of the monomer and the new (4ms long) simulations of homodimeric EGFR. We also recalculated the free energy surfaces as a function of the distance between V786 and T903, which has been used in the past as a probe of the kinase’s degree of extension (Shan et al., PNAS, 2012).</p><p>The unbiased simulations of the different mutants in the monomeric and homodimeric form show that, the monomer explores more ‘open’ hinge conformations with respect to the dimer (receiver kinase), which is in agreement with the activating role of dimerization. Interestingly, two of the mutants (ΔΔELREA and L858R) explore more ‘closed’ hinge conformations in the dimer see Figure <italic>7—</italic>figure supplement 4.</p><p>The same trend is clearly visible in the FE plots where the position of the global minimum follows the same order as the catalytic efficiency, with ΔΔELREA-EGFR exhibiting the highest catalytic activity among them (29-fold higher than that for wild-type EGFR) (Gilmer et al., Cancer Res., 2008), followed by the L858R (23-fold) (Gilmer et al., Cancer Res., 2008), theA763-Y764insFQEA (9-fold) (<italic>Yasuda et al., Sci. Trans. Med., 2014</italic>), and lastly the D770-N771insNPG (5-fold) (Yasuda et al., Sci. Trans. Med., 2014). Given the link between the hinge motion and the catalytic activity, we find the agreement observed both in the monomers and in the heterodimers supportive of our model. Although we can only speculate about this, the compressed kinase seen in ΔΔELREA and L858R might be linked to slow release of the substrate/ligands.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The observation that the Exon 20 mutants furnish a more open active site is perhaps the most direct and interesting result of this study. This should be further explored. For example, the authors can dock small molecules into a representative conformations of L858R and Exon 19 mutants, and into a representative conformation of a Exon 20 mutant, and hopefully show that the top hits of the former do not fare well in the latter and vice versa. This would be extremely informative to drug discovery.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their suggestion, and we agree that the observation of possible ‘mutant specific conformations’ associated with these Ex20Ins mutations compared to the wild-type, L858R, and ΔΔELREA conformational landscapes opens the avenue for Ex20Ins selective inhibitors design. Clearly, with a number of the emerging disclosures in this regard, there have been already extensive efforts to find Ex20Ins selective compounds, and we believe the conformational landscape presented here may assist the design of novel drugs.</p><p>Nevertheless, we believe that docking is not the most suitable way to demonstrate this potential as the docking results will depend heavily on the choice of the Ex20Ins, wild-type, L858R, and ΔΔELREA conformer(s) that will be used for the docking calculation. Secondly, it has been shown that compounds, which have the same binding mode in the mutant and wild-type forms, exhibit different affinity levels for the mutant form mainly due to the change of the mutant's affinity against ATP (Yun et al., Cancer Cell, 2008, Carey et al., Cancer Res, 2006). Taking the reviewers' feedback on board, our proposal would be to highlight the importance and impact of selecting the right conformation of EGFR for new drug discovery efforts by adding to the manuscript Figure 7–figure supplement 5.</p><p>Here, the ensemble of conformations from the PTmetaD simulations of the activating mutant L858R in the ααC-in conformation is superimposed with the crystal structures of the WT-EGFR (PDB ID: 2ITY) bound with gefitinib and lapatinib (PDB ID: 1XKK), respectively. The figure shows the improved fitting of gefitinib with respect to lapatinib and the clashes of lapatinib with the mutant protein. In the bottom panel of this figure, we show an ensemble of ααC-out conformations from the PTmetaD simulations of the Ex20Ins mutant, A763-Y764insFQEA, overlayed with the same two ligands. In this case, we see that lapatinib can be accommodated better to the ααC-out pocket, whereas the fit of gefitinib is not as tight.</p><p>We hope that this figure shows the importance of targeting the right conformation of a protein when trying to design mutant specific drugs, and we believe that we will be able to use the Exon 20 conformations in the future to try and identify specific inhibitors for these mutants by applying more sophisticated simulations, like funnel metadynamics, that take into account the flexibility of the protein while a ligand binds. However, such a comprehensive study of the selectivity of different ligands against different mutant variants is beyond the scope of this current work. We have, however, included in the manuscript the following paragraph to explain how this information could be exploited for this goal:</p><p>“Through PTmetaD simulations, we explored the differences between the conformational landscapes of EGFR Ex20Ins and the WT, L858R, and ΔΔELREA mutants. Such differences are not evident from the available crystal structures where the residues of the ATP pocket appear to be identical among the different structures. We believe that the conformational ensembles from the PTmetaD simulations of the EGFR Ex20Ins with the more extended conformations that lead to a more open active site can be used to identify novel inhibitors with increased selectivity against the mutant EGFR. We should note that in such drug design efforts, using the appropriate conformation is of great importance. For example, we can already see that targeting the L858R-EGFR with ααC-out inhibitors, like lapatinib, would lead to steric clashes that are not present in the pocket of an Ex20Ins EGFR like A763-Y764insFQEA, while inhibitors like gefitinib can be accommodated better in the tighter pocket of L858R (Figure 7—figure supplement 5).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some of the simulation and analysis details are not described clearly or accurately, notably related to the used important collective variables. The positions of the active and inactive positions in terms of CV space seem to change across different free energy surfaces using the same CVs (See Figure 2-5). The authors need to further describe the CV they chose and explain the rationales behind the choices.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have expanded the “Metadynamics simulations details – monomeric EGFR” section to include more details on the CVs as well as the rationale behind their choice.</p><p>This specific combination was first used in (Sutto and Gervasio., PNAS, 2013) and subsequently used to explore the conformational energy landscape of other kinases. It emerged after extensive trials, whereby different sets of CVs in combination with parallel tempering were used to explore the inactive-to-active dynamics and vice-versa. The selected combination of contact maps and salt-bridge switches was the most successful in reversibly exploring the opening and closing of the A-loop and the concerted movement of the aC helix and other important elements leading (together with PT) to a converged free energy landscape reconstruction. Subsequently, we successfully used a similar combination to explore the activation of B-Raf (Marino et al., JACS, 2015) and p38a (Kuzmanic et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2017). In our extensive experience, other choices are also effective (such as RMSD-based path collective variables). However, RMSD-based CVs are computationally expensive and severely affect the performance of the molecular dynamics code.</p><p>In the present case we also performed a new set of exploratory steered-MD simulations with the new force field (now shown in Figure 7) and the contact map-based CVs used by Sutto and Gevasio, which confirmed that the chosen set could drive the active conformation to Src-like inactive one. When a set of CVs is able to explore all the relevant conformations in a steered MD it usually leads to a converged FES in combination with the expensive parallel-tempering metadynamics approach.</p><p>A contact map was applied to monitor the distances between pairs of key representative atoms, which together are supposed to drive the transition from the active to the Src-like inactive conformation and vice-versa. As mentioned in the Methods section, here, we adapted the same pairs defined by Sutto and Gervasio, in which the most consistent contacts between equilibrated WT-active and Src-like inactive structures were selected and included, among others, salt-bridge contacts involving residues of the A-loop.</p><p>The position of the active and Src-like inactive conformations (yellow and black crosses, respectively) change indeed across the different FES plots as in these plots, we map the active and Src-like inactive conformations of each mutant on the contact map space of the WT. The change in the position of the crosses in the plots results from the way the contact maps are defined and calculated. In particular, for the definition of the contact map space a reference structure is used (termed R<sub>inactive</sub> and R<sub>active</sub> in the CV2 and CV3 definitions) and the distance between the atoms that are involved in each contact is included in the contact map definition. Here, the reference structures are the WT-active and WT-Src-like inactive conformations. To map the position of the equivalent mutant structures on the contact map space of the WT, the distance between the atoms of each contact in the energy minimised structures of each mutant was compared to WT-reference structure and the degree of formation of each contact in the structure R was calculated using the sigmoid function that is described in the Methods section. Deviation of the position of the atoms that define each contact in each mutant from the position of the equivalent atoms in the WT structure that was used as the reference results in different positions of the crosses in the contact map space of the WT. In addition, for the FES plots, the calculated contact-map distances were normalised and, therefore, mutants that explored larger portions of the contact-map space comparatively push the position of crosses further towards zero.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Three collective variables (CVs) were defined in the Methods description: CV1 was the difference between two salt-bridge distances, and CV2 and CV3 were distances in the contact map space with respect to the inactive and active conformations, respectively. Were all three CVs used in running the metadynamics simulations? In the figures and related simulation analysis, only CV1 and CV2 were used and appeared to be wrongly labeled. CV2 and CV3 were defined only related to the A-loop in the Sutto and Gervasio 2013, but described differently in this study. They need to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>The labels of the CVs in the figures of the main text have been corrected and are now in accordance with their definition in the “Material and Methods” section. As we discuss in the reviewers’ comment 3, all three CVs were biased during the PTmetaD run (now clarified in the “Material and Methods” section).</p><p>Sutto and Gervasio defined a “set of 293 regular contacts to which they added 11 salt-bridge contacts involving residues of the A-loop and formed either in the active or in the inactive conformations weighting them 3 times more than a regular contact”. As we describe in the “Material and Methods” section, here, we used the exact same set of contacts as the one Sutto and Gervasio did and adapted the atom numbers for the mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It would help to plot CVs versus time to examine the simulation convergence and replica exchange rates. They also need to be compared with the unbiased simulation results in Figure 1-S2, which may support the authors statement that &quot;these simulations hinted at slow motions that could not be sampled even by long MD simulations&quot;. This can be included in the SI.</p></disp-quote><p>To assess the convergence of a metadynamics simulation, one can calculate the estimate of the free energy as a function of the simulation time. At convergence, the reconstructed profiles should be similar to one another and to a “time-independent” reconstruction. Moreover, as the PTmetaD simulation progresses and the added bias grows, the system should be able to escape the local minimum that is trapped to at the beginning and explore a new region of the phase space in all of the replicas. Following the progression of the predefined CVs over time, one can assess whether the system gets stuck to any specific region of the CV phase space. In <italic>Figure 7—figure supplement 1</italic> we report the time series of the three CVs that were biased during the PTmetaD simulation and the estimate of the free energy as a function of time during the simulation for one of the mutants (ΔΔELREA), but similar behaviour was observed for the rest of the studied systems.</p><p>During the unbiased simulations, the systems explored a very limited portion of the contact map space (CV2, CV3). Even the simulations that were initiated from the active conformation in which the kinase is more flexible and samples a bigger portion of the contact map and distance space (CV1) (see Figure 7—figure supplement 2), do not lead to a transition from the active to the Src-like inactive. This highlights the necessity to use enhanced sampling techniques when the computational cost of very long unbiased simulations, like the ones reported by Shan et al. (<italic>PNAS, 2013</italic>), are not feasible.</p><p>Regarding the replica exchange rate, given the high temperature gap we used to aid the convergence of the simulations in a reasonable computational cost, we run the PTmetaD simulations in the well-tempered ensemble. As we describe in the Methods section, in a preliminary run, we biased the potential energy so that to increase its fluctuation and reach a target exchange rate between neighbouring replicas of 15%. The deposited Gaussians from this run were loaded in the PTmetaD to maintain this exchange rate between the replicas (clarified now in the Methods section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The free energy surfaces appear noisy. Why were certain energy minima ignored for more detailed characterization, e.g., ~(0.22, 1.8) and ~(0.5, 2.3) in Figure 5 and a number of others with ~3-4 kcal/mol free energy values?</p></disp-quote><p>Given the high number of degrees of freedom of proteins, during a metaD run, a protein samples many conformations leading to free energy surfaces with more basins than what one sees in simpler systems. Given the fact that contact maps are usually CVs that are more adequate to distinguish conformations separated by relatively large conformational changes (e.g. active vs inactive transitions), basins that are close to each other in the contact map space are expected to correspond to ensemble of conformations that are structurally similar to one another. An example of this is the ensemble of conformations that corresponds to basins α1 and α3 (Figure 2), where, as discussed in the text, the conformations in the two basins differ mainly in the interlobal distance. Exhaustive characterisation of all the visited states is beyond the scope of this work, as here we tried to find general trends and characterise dominant metastable states.</p><p>It is true though that under physiological conditions EGFR could access conformations separated by 3-4 kcal/mol energy barriers and, therefore, we have now included some discussion on the ensemble of conformations that corresponds to basin γ4 in the FES of A763-Y764insFQEA, which also shows up to be important through the MEP analysis, as well as of basin β4 in the FES of ΔΔELREA, from which again the MEP passes through. Lastly, we have now characterised the secondary basins in the FES of L858R (basin δ2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figures 3 and 4 it is confusing to show two different conformations for one single energy minimum. If they are indeed different low energy states, additional CVs may need to be defined with the corresponding new free energy profiles calculated to characterize these conformations. This need to be discussed and clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the CVs that we used to bias the transition from the active to the Src-like inactive and vice-versa are able to distinguish states separated by large conformational changes, in many cases they do allow us to readily distinguish subtly different conformations within the same macro-ensembles due to their degenerative nature. Therefore, we had to undertake a series of local analyses of the conformations within the basins using different features to cluster the ensemble of conformations that fall in each basin, which are more sensitive to subtle conformational changes. In particular, as we describe in the Methods section, we used the RMSD on the Cα atoms of the A-loop and the ααC-helix residues, similar to what Pan et al. (JCTC, 2014) have used, to cluster the conformations within each basin.</p><p>In the case of the D770-N771insNPG, however, projection of the FE in the (CV1, CV3) space separates the two dominant conformations that fall together in the same basin in the (CV1, CV2) projection of the FE. As these conformations fall in the same basin in the (CV1, CV2) space and, therefore, are iso-energetic in that space, in the (CV1, CV3) space, they are also iso-energetic despite the separation. The reason behind the separation is probably the big difference in the helical content of the ααC-helix in the two conformation, which is captured better by CV3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In Figure 3 for the L858R mutant, why a clear energy minimum was identified in the &quot;active&quot; state in the previous study, but not in the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous study, the deepest minimum of L858R corresponded to an ensemble of conformations which are in between the active and inactive conformation (semi-closed), while L858R was also found to populate active like conformations albeit there is a thermodynamic penalty (2–4 kcal/mol) with respect to the semi-closed state.</p><p>The use of a different force field in this study compared to the one used by Sutto and Gervasio (a99SB-disp compared to Amber99SB*-ILDN), has led to the inversion of the population of the conformations in the two basins identified in the previous study. Here, active-like conformations are the most stable while the semi-closed ones are 2-3 kcal/mol higher in energy. Force field dependent stabilisation of different conformations is a known problem of MD simulations but as can be seen from the superposition of the sampled states in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, the results are qualitatively very close.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65824-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this context, the present study even with extensive simulations mostly confirms previous work and the new mechanistic insights to advance our understanding of the protein function are limited.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern of reviewer #2 about the novelty of our study. Still, the new biomedically relevant mutants that we studied here considerably expand our understanding of the repertoire of different effects that mutants can leverage to disrupt the regulation of kinases. While in previous papers we and others mostly focussed on the effect of single point mutations on open-to-close A-loop transition and indirectly we addressed the question of dimer stability, here we address more directly the question of dimerisation and the effect of chaperones on a set of mutants that, also due to their nature, have been reported to affect these regulatory mechanisms.</p><p>To this end, in the revised manuscript we report on new simulations of the asymmetric homodimers of the WT and mutant forms. To our knowledge, such simulations haven’t been reported before for the ΔΔELREA, D770-N771insNPG, and A763-Y764insFQEA mutants, probably due to the lack of structural data regarding their corresponding dimers. The results of these simulations further support our findings coming from the monomeric simulations according to which all mutations but the D770-N771insNPG are expected to stabilise the dimeric interface of the mutants and enhance the mutants dimerisation propensity.</p><p>Finally, the use of a more recent force-field, which has been shown to be significantly more accurate in describing partially unfolded conformations is also an important aspect of this study. The fact that the free energy landscape of the WT kinase and of the L858R mutant are in agreement with the ones previously calculated with a different force fields is indeed reassuring, but by no means it was a given. Moreover, the more balanced nature of the force field used should describe the ensemble of states explored by the A-loop more accurately as well as better capture the order-to-disorder transitions of the αC helix. This is particular important in the case of the insertion and deletion mutations.</p></body></sub-article></article>
