cytoskeleton of various cell types. However, the specific contribution of MRTF–SRF in hair cells remains unknown. In this study, we showed that hair cell-specific deletion of <italic>Srf</italic> or <italic>Mrtfb</italic>, but not <italic>Mrtf</italic>a, leads to similar defects in the development of stereocilia dimensions and the maintenance of cuticular plate integrity. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based hair cell RNA-Seq analysis to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of the changes observed in <italic>Srf</italic> and <italic>Mrtfb</italic> mutants, respectively. Interestingly, the transcriptome analysis revealed distinct profiles of genes regulated by <italic>Srf</italic> and <italic>Mrtfb</italic>, suggesting different transcriptional regulation mechanisms of actin cytoskeleton activities mediated by <italic>Srf</italic> and <italic>Mrtfb</italic>. Exogenous delivery of calponin 2 using Adeno-associated virus transduction in <italic>Srf</italic> mutants partially rescued the impairments of stereocilia dimensions and the F-actin intensity of cuticular plate, suggesting the involvement of <italic>Cnn2</italic>, as an <italic>Srf</italic> downstream target, in regulating the hair bundle morphology and cuticular plate actin cytoskeleton organization. Our study uncovers, for the first time, the unexpected differential transcriptional regulation of actin cytoskeleton mediated by <italic>Srf</italic> and <italic>Mrtfb</italic> in hair cells, and also demonstrates the critical role of SRF–CNN2 in modulating actin dynamics of the stereocilia and cuticular plate, providing new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying hair cell development and maintenance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inner ear</kwd><kwd>cochlea</kwd><kwd>hair cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82000975</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Ting-Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008233</institution-id><institution>School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JYZZ057</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Ting-Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100020737</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Key Laboratory of Translational Medicine on Ear and Nose Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14DZ2260300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Hao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003399</institution-id><institution>Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21JC1404000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Hao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81970872</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Hao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In hair cells, the development and maintenance of the F-actin-enriched stereocilia and cuticular plates are differentially regulated by transcription factors SRF and MRTFB, and SRF–CNN2 is required for modulating actin dynamics of the stereocilia and cuticular plate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The actin cytoskeleton constitutes the structural basis of all features required for hair cell mechanoreceptor function, including the hair bundle and the cuticular plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drummond et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Furness et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tilney et al., 1989</xref>). Actin-based stereocilia form rows of staircase-like structures with precise control of length and diameter on the apical surface of hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tilney et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaltenbach et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krey et al., 2020</xref>). Proper development of stereocilia dimensions determines the mechanical response of hair bundles to sound stimuli or head motions. The cuticular plate consists of a dense network of actin filaments crosslinked by actin-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeRosier and Tilney, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mahendrasingam et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pollock and McDermott, 2015</xref>), providing a mechanical foundation and rigidity for the stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furness et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Self et al., 1998</xref>). Disruption of the F-actin mesh integrity of cuticular plate results in hearing impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Du et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Understanding how the hair cell governs its actin cytoskeleton is thus critical for understanding the development, function, and maintenance of the hair bundle and the cuticular plate. Substantial emerging evidence has revealed many genes indispensable for stereocilia elongation and widening, including actin crosslinkers, capping proteins, and myosins. Similarly, the complex cytoskeletal structure of cuticular plate is regulated by actins and actin crosslinkers. However, the general molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in stereocilia and cuticular plate remains poorly understood.</p><p>Serum response factor (SRF) is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that belongs to the MADS-box protein family. SRF activates the expression of target genes mainly through two disparate cofactors, TCFs (ternary complex factors) and MRTFs (myocardin-related transcription factors). These two families of cofactors compete for a common binding site of SRF, enabling <italic>Srf</italic> to direct the expression of different sets of target genes. <italic>Srf</italic> directly regulates immediate early genes mostly associated with cell proliferation, signaling, and transcription in coordination with TCFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shaw et al., 1989</xref>). Three MRTFs, including the cardiovascular system-specific expressed member Myocardin, and widely expressed MRTFA and MRTFB, are known to interact with SRF. The MRTF–SRF pathway has been extensively studied genetically in many systems, and it drives a large number of genes involved in actin cytoskeletal activities, contractility, and muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Olson and Nordheim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Posern and Treisman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Phenotypically, inactivation of <italic>Srf</italic> or <italic>Mrtf</italic>s often exhibits similar impairments. Conditional brain <italic>Mrtfa/b</italic> double-knockout mice show abnormalities in neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth that recapitulated the defects reported for brain-specific deletion of <italic>Srf</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Knöll et al., 2006</xref>). Podocyte-specific loss of both <italic>Mrtf</italic>s mimics the <italic>Srf</italic> deficiency phenotype in the maintenance of podocyte structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). During hematopoietic development, inactivation of either <italic>Srf</italic> or both <italic>Mrtf</italic>s in HSC progenitor cells leads to defects in their colonization of the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costello et al., 2015</xref>). However, there is also evidence showing that MRTFs can act as cofactor of transcriptional factors other than SRF and impact on the expression of genes involved in actin cytoskeletal activity, such as cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xing et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Some well-known proteins encoded by MRTF–SRF target genes related to actin cytoskeleton in other cell types are essential for hair cell actin-based cytoskeleton structure. For example, structure components of F-actin, ACTB, and ACTG1, are required for stereocilia maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belyantseva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perrin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perrin et al., 2010</xref>). F-actin severing protein CFL1 functions in stereocilia dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGrath et al., 2021</xref>), and actin-binding protein gelsolin is crucial for maintaining the cohesion of the hair bundle structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Olt et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is unclear whether MRTF–SRF-mediated transcriptional regulation is required for hair cell actin-based cytoskeleton structure and function.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that in hair cells, both <italic>Srf</italic> and <italic>Mrtfb</italic>, but not <italic>Mrtfa</italic>, are necessary for the development and maintenance of actin-based cytoskeleton structures, such as the hair bundle and the cuticular plate. The specific deletion of <italic>Srf</italic> in hair cells resulted in a significant reduction in stereocilia length and diameter, as well as a decrease in F-actin intensity in the cuticular plate. In the absence of <italic>Mrtfb</italic>, we observed alterations in stereocilia dimensions and a loss of cuticular plate integrity, which are similar but less severe than those observed in <italic>Srf</italic> mutants. Furthermore, <italic>Mrtfb</italic> cKO mice developed early-onset hearing loss, in addition to the impairments in the hair bundle and cuticular plate. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis revealed distinct molecular consequences of <italic>Srf</italic> or <italic>Mrtfb</italic> deficiency in hair cell transcriptome, indicating that <italic>Mtrfb</italic> may function in an <italic>Srf</italic>-independent manner. Finally, we identified the actin-binding protein CNN2 as a downstream effector of <italic>Srf</italic> that is involved in regulating stereocilia dimensions and the organization of the F-actin network in the cuticular plate. These findings highlight the critical role of <italic>Srf</italic> and <italic>Mrtfb</italic> in the development and maintenance of hair cells, and shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying actin cytoskeleton regulation in these cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Srf</italic> cKO mice have defects in the cuticular plate</title><p>As previously described, deficiency of the transcription factor <italic>Srf</italic> (<italic>Srf</italic> <sup>−/−</sup>) causes embryonic lethality due to severe gastrulation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arsenian et al., 1998</xref>). To circumvent this limitation, we utilized mice expressing the recombinase Cre under the control of <italic>Atoh1</italic> promoter, permitting deletion of floxed <italic>Srf</italic> in hair cells. Offspring with the <italic>Srf <sup>fl/fl</sup>; Atoh1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> genotype (hereafter referred to as <italic>Srf</italic> cKO) was born at normal mendelian ratios, but displayed reduced body weight and a relatively weak appearance, and mostly died in the third postnatal week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), potentially due to <italic>Atoh1-Cre</italic> recombinase activity in the intestine and the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shroyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti et al., 2005</xref>). However, gross morphology of the inner ear was not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Immunocytochemistry confirmed that SRF was detectable in all cell types of the organ of Corti at E16 (data not shown). To validate hair cell-specific knockout of <italic>Srf</italic>, we confirmed that SRF protein expression became undetectable at P0 in hair cells but not in supporting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We further confirmed that <italic>Srf</italic> mRNA level in hair cells isolated from <italic>Srf</italic> cKO pups was significantly reduced compared to control hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>Upon closer inspection, we found that the cuticular plate of inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs) from <italic>Srf</italic> cKO mice displayed a significant reduction in the amount of F-actin as indicated by phalloidin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). LMO7, an actin-binding protein important for F-actin network organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Du et al., 2019</xref>), displayed a more punctate distribution in the cuticular plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also examined the rootlets, which are composed of tightly packed actin filaments and form the stereocilia insertion sites into the cuticular plate. The rootlets are wrapped with TRIOBP, an actin-bundling protein that is an essential component of the rootlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kitajiri et al., 2010</xref>). Although the spatial organization of the rootlets appeared normal, the length of TRIOBP-positive rootlets was significantly reduced in <italic>Srf</italic> cKO mice, along with the intensity of TRIOBP staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). Interestingly, the deficit in the integrity of the cuticular plate F-actin mesh accompanied by shortened rootlets also appeared in <italic>Lmo7</italic>-deficient mice as described in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Du et al., 2019</xref>). This similarity suggests that F-actin network in the cuticular plate is critical for the proper formation of the rootlets, although the causal connection between them remains unknown. To further investigate the F-actin meshwork abnormalities in the cuticular plate, we quantified the volume of the phalloidin-labeled cuticular plates after 3D reconstruction using Imaris software and also conducted an ultrastructural analysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results of the cuticular plate volume (CP volume) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref>) were consistent with the relative F-actin fluorescence intensity change of the cuticular plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). The TEM results demonstrated that the cuticular plates in <italic>Srf</italic> cKO mice were markedly thinner compared to control in IHCs at P10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Although TEM images did not indicate an obvious reduction in the thickness of F-actin meshwork in P10 <italic>Srf</italic> cKO OHCs, the vesicle-like structures were often seen in the cuticular plate of the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). The significant reduction of F-actin intensity indicating by phalloidin staining in <italic>Srf</italic> cKO OHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) may partially be caused by the vesicle-like structures occupation in the cuticular plate. The deformation of the overlying plasma membrane above the cuticular plate of OHCs were also revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, as indicated by arrows).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Srf</italic> cKO mice have defects in the cuticular plate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Reduced phalloidin staining in the cuticular plates of <italic>Srf</italic> cKO hair cells (HCs) at P10.

We used phalloidin staining to visualize actin core of stereocilia and measured the length of stereocilia. At P5, the staircase-like architecture of <italic>Srf</italic> cKO hair bundles developed well, but the length of row 1 (the longest row) IHC stereocilia was slightly reduced, which worsened by P10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). SEM further revealed that the length of row 1 IHC, the length of row 1 OHC, and the width of row 1 IHC stereocilia were significantly reduced in mutants at P10, but no statistical difference was found for the width of row 1 OHC stereocilia yet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). In rare cases, a few cochleae of <italic>Srf</italic> cKO mice survived past 2 weeks and were harvested at P15 and P24.

At P15, numerous microvilli still persisted in <italic>Srf</italic> cKO IHCs, indicating a lack of mature hair bundle characteristics, but this was not the case for <italic>Srf</italic> cKO OHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref>). The kinocilium, a microtubule-based cilium that is essential for the polarity of the developing hair bundle, degenerates in mouse cochlear hair cells from base to apex at P8 and disappears completely around P12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haag et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leibovici et al., 2005</xref>). Confocal microscopy images showed that more kinocilia remained in <italic>Srf</italic> cKO IHCs compared to the controls at P10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Presumably, this also indicates that <italic>Srf</italic> cKO hair cells were developmentally less mature, although the physiological significance of kinocilia degeneration is still unclear. We conclude that SRF is required for the development as well as the maintenance of the F-actin-enriched hair bundle and the cuticular plate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Altered expression pattern of proteins required for stereocilia dimensions in <italic>Srf</italic> cKO</title><p>Given that the stereocilia dimensions were affected in <italic>Srf</italic> cKO hair bundle, we quantified the localization of several key proteins known to be critical for hair bundle development. ESPN1, an isoform of ESPN, which is an actin-binding and bundling protein, is required for the elongation of hair cell stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ebrahim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rzadzinska et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salles et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, EPS8 and GNAI3, which are components of the row 1 complex, are essential for controlling the elongation of the tallest row of stereocilia during hair bundle morphological development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tarchini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zampini et al., 2011</xref>). Using immunofluorescence, we quantified the tip signal of these proteins in row 1 stereocilia at P4 and P10. The dramatic decreases of the relative row 1 tip fluorescence signal intensity for ESPN1 and EPS8, but not GNAI3, started since P4 in <italic>Srf</italic> cKO IHCs. The decrease of GNAI3 in <italic>Srf</italic> cKO IHCs was observed soon after at P10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–F</xref>). In addition to the reduced row 1 tip localization of ESPN1, EPS8, and GNAI3, the irregular labeling in different stereocilia of the same row were also observed in these tested proteins in <italic>Srf</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref>). Meanwhile, the row 2 tip signals of ESPN1, EPS8, and GNAI3 were partially maintained in <italic>Srf</italic> cKO IHCs compared to controls, although the expression of EPS8 and GNAI3 were abundant in row 1 tip and absent in row 2 tip in controls at P10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J–L</xref>). These data suggested that, initially, all the tested proteins responsible for stereocilia elongation were not efficiently targeting to row 1 stereocilia tips in <italic>Srf</italic> cKO mice. During stereocilia development, the distribution of EPS8 and GNAI3 between rows 1 and 2 stereocilia were also affected. We also quantified the relative fluorescence signals of FSCN2, an abundantly expressed actin-crosslinking protein in stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perrin et al., 2013</xref>), within the stereocilia shaft. The fluorescence levels were significantly reduced by 20% in <italic>Srf</italic> cKO IHCs at P10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M, N</xref>).

Specifically, a notable decrease in F-actin intensity was observed in the cuticular plate of <italic>Mrtfb</italic> cKO OHCs, with a trend toward reduced F-actin intensity noted in the cuticular plate of <italic>Mrtfb</italic> cKO IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). Additionally, the length of TRIOBP-positive rootlets was reduced in the mutants, despite no observed changes in TRIOBP staining intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). The results of the CP volume in the control and <italic>Mrtfb</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>) were consistent with the relative F-actin fluorescence intensity change of the cuticular plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). Using TEM analysis, the results demonstrated that the cuticular plates in <italic>Mrtfb</italic> cKO mice were markedly thinner compared to control in OHCs at P10. The vesicle-like structures occupation in the cuticular plate were also observed in the mutants. The reduction of the cuticular plate thickness in <italic>Mrtfb</italic> cKO mice was more pronounced at P26. For IHCs, a decrease of the cuticular plate thickness in <italic>Mrtfb</italic> cKO was observed until P26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H</xref>). Immunocytochemistry was then used to examine hair bundle morphology at various developmental stages, from early postnatal to adult mice. At P5, no difference in row 1 IHC stereocilia length was observed between the control and <italic>Mrtfb</italic> cKO mice. However, the length of row 1 IHC stereocilia was significantly reduced at P10 and P26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). While the staircase-like architecture of <italic>Mrtfb</italic> cKO OHC hair bundles formed adequately at P10, they progressively degenerated throughout development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This reduction in stereocilia length and width was further confirmed through scanning electron microscope analysis of stereocilia morphologies at P10 and P42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–H</xref>). Specifically, a slight reduction in stereocilia width was observed in OHCs, with the length of stereocilia remaining intact in mutants at P10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, E</xref>). However, by P42, the stereocilia of OHCs had severely degenerated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

However, the mechanisms of transcriptional controlling of actin cytoskeleton genes in hair cells are not yet well understood. The MRTF–SRF axis is a key signaling pathway that regulates the expression of genes participating in actin cytoskeleton activities, and has been studied extensively in a broad range of tissues and cell types. In this study, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, we investigated the importance of <italic>Srf</italic> and <italic>Mrtf</italic>s in hair cell actin-based structures by targeted inactivation of <italic>Srf</italic>, <italic>Mrtfa</italic> and <italic>Mrtfb</italic>, respectively. Our results showed that both <italic>Srf</italic> and <italic>Mrtfb</italic> are indispensable for the proper development of stereocilia dimensions, represented by the altered expression patterns of key stereocilia tip proteins in mutants, and maintaining the integrity of the cuticular plates. As expected, <italic>Srf</italic> and <italic>Mrtfb</italic> cKO hair cells exhibited a phenotypic similarity in reduced length and width of the stereocilia, and less dense F-actin network of the cuticular plate, suggesting a potential contribution of the MRTFBSRF axis to overlapping phenotypes. However, RNA-sequencing of hair cells and functional clustering analysis of down-regulated DEGs revealed unanticipatedly distinct profiles of genes regulated by <italic>Srf</italic> and <italic>Mrtfb</italic>, highly suggesting different transcriptional regulation mechanisms of actin cytoskeleton mediated by <italic>Srf</italic> and <italic>Mrtfb</italic>. Based on DEGs analysis, we further provided evidence suggesting the involvement of <italic>Cnn2</italic>, one of the <italic>Srf</italic> downstream targets, in regulating the hair bundle morphology and cuticular plate F-actin network organization. Notably, FACS-based RNA-sequencing is a powerful approach to resolve molecular differences in specific cell types between control and mutants, enabling the identification of functionally important genes for hair cells that have not been identified by genetics, such as actin cytoskeleton genes that express ubiquitously, but act essential roles in actin-based cytoskeleton structures of hair cells.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>An illustration model of differential regulation of actin cytoskeleton mediated by SRF and MRTFB in hair cells.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90155-fig10-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Recently, emerging evidence suggests that MRTFs can also direct transcription of genes involved in multiple aspects of cell migration by cooperating with other transcription factors besides <italic>Srf</italic>. For example, the interaction between MRTFA and STAT3 promotes the migration of breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xing et al., 2015</xref>), and the crosstalk of MRTF-YAP is required for cancer cell migration and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Mrtf</italic>s can promote transcription of genes via its own SAP domain, as shown in Irem Gurbuz’s study that <italic>Mrtfa</italic> stimulates a breast cancer-specific set of genes involved in cell proliferation and cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gurbuz et al., 2014</xref>). Actin-binding proteins profilin isoforms <italic>Pfn1</italic> and <italic>Pfn2</italic> are also regulated by <italic>Mrtf</italic>s utilizing SAP domain-mediated transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joy et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, hair cell-specific deletion of <italic>Mrtfb</italic> yielded a <italic>Srf-</italic>like phenotype outwardly, such as defects in the stereocilia dimensions and the cuticular plate integrity, but the lack of <italic>Srf</italic> or lack of <italic>Mrtfb</italic> had differential effects on hair cell transcriptome. These results highlight the complexity and context- specific regulation of actin cytoskeleton activities mediated by <italic>Srf</italic> and <italic>Mrtf</italic>s, and shed light on the potential of <italic>Mrtfb</italic> to regulate actin cytoskeleton in an <italic>Srf</italic>-independent manner. We summarized recent studies and screened the reported genes potentially regulated by <italic>Mrtf</italic>s in an <italic>Srf</italic>-independent mode (SAP, STAT3, or YAP dependent) in our hair cell RNA-sequencing dataset. Only <italic>Nox4</italic> and <italic>Kif14</italic> showed significantly differential expression in <italic>Mrtfb</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and the reduction of <italic>Kif14</italic> was also confirmed by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). It is appealing to further investigate the mechanisms underlying <italic>Mrtfb</italic>-mediated regulation, as well as the interaction between <italic>Mrtfb</italic> and its transcription factors in the context of hair cell.</p><p>As previously noted, hair cells lacking <italic>Srf</italic> or <italic>Mrtfb</italic> displayed some common features such as decreased stereocilia length and width, and a less dense meshwork of F-actin forming the cuticular plate.However, the impairments were more severe in <italic>Srf</italic>-deficient hair cells compared to <italic>Mrtfb</italic> mutants, which showed significantly delayed microvillar regression and kinocilium degeneration. Analysis of DEGs revealed a reduction in <italic>Egr1</italic>, an immediate early gene and well-known transcriptional target of <italic>Srf</italic>, in <italic>Srf</italic> cKO hair cells. Various studies have established <italic>Egr1</italic> as a regulator of hematopoietic cell differentiation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kulkarni, 2022</xref>). <italic>Ctgf</italic> which was also significantly reduced in <italic>Srf</italic> cKO hair cells, was found to be enriched in cell growth-associated GO terms.

These findings suggest that hair cell maturation may be affected by <italic>Srf</italic> deficiency, and delayed maturation may contribute to more severe defects in the actin cytoskeleton organization of stereocilia and cuticular plate, as well as microvillar regression and kinocilium degeneration.</p><p>In this study, an AAV vector containing wild-type <italic>Cnn2</italic> cDNA was generated and injected into the cochleae of early postnatal <italic>Srf</italic> cKO mice. Immunofluorescence staining revealed a much stronger CNN2 signal, primarily restricted to the cuticular plate and the tips of stereocilia, unlike endogenous CNN2 expression in age-matched control mice injected with Anc80L65-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E, F</xref>). Upon Anc80L65-Cnn2 injection, the raised apical plasma membrane of cuticular plate was barely seen in <italic>Srf</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In terms of F-actin intensity of the cuticular plate, <italic>Srf</italic> cKO hair cells appeared to be fully restored by <italic>Cnn2</italic> delivery, with even stronger F-actin intensity compared to control. However, hair cell stereocilia dimensions defects were only partially restored.</p><p>The partial rescue of stereocilia dimensions observed upon AAV-mediated delivery of <italic>Cnn2</italic> in <italic>Srf</italic> cKO mice could be attributed to several reasons. Firstly, immunofluorescence staining results indicated a transient expression pattern of CNN2 during stereocilia development. The CNN2 staining can be detected as early as P0, and it began to accumulate at row 1 tip, reaching a peak at P6, then decreased at P10. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Alterations in CNN2 expression levels were also observed in the cuticular plate of P6 and P11 hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B, F</xref>), suggesting a critical window of gene delivery for successful recovery of stereocilia dimensions. Recent advances in utero gene transfer to the inner ears have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gubbels et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miwa et al., 2013</xref>), especially AAV-mediated prenatal gene transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedrosian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2020</xref>), indicating the potential use of this approach to initiate the <italic>Cnn2</italic> overexpression earlier during stereocilia development. Secondly, <italic>Cnn2</italic> has been reported to regulate cell motility differently in various cell types and biological processes. For example, the macrophages of <italic>Cnn2</italic> knockout mice showed faster migration than that of control mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2008</xref>). In Tang’s in vitro study, human umbilical vein endothelial cell migration was enhanced by <italic>Cnn2</italic> overexpression and inhibited by <italic>Cnn2</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tang et al., 2006</xref>). These discrepancies suggested that the precise level of <italic>Cnn2</italic> expression required for maintaining actin cytoskeleton activities, such as cell migration, might also apply in hair bundle development and warrants further investigation. Thirdly, our differential gene expression analysis identified 79 down-regulated genes in <italic>Srf</italic> cKO hair cells, including <italic>Cnn2</italic>. Using the Gene Transcription Regulation Database (GTRD, v20.06), we extracted publicly available mouse ChIP-seq experiments information on <italic>Srf</italic> (Q9JM73), and screened the regions [−1000,+100] bp around the transcriptional start site of each gene on the list of 79 down-regulated <italic>Srf</italic> targets for <italic>Srf</italic>-binding sites (data not shown). Except for <italic>Cnn2</italic>, which had the most <italic>Srf</italic>-binding sites, several candidate target genes implicated in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton, such as <italic>Lsp1</italic> and <italic>Zyxin</italic>, were also identified. The leukocyte-specific protein 1, <italic>Lsp1</italic> is found in several cells types, such as neutrophils and endothelial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2005</xref>), and interacts with F-actin through villin headpiece-like sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klein et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>). Further evidence suggests its function in regulating actin cytoskeleton remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maxeiner et al., 2015</xref>). The LIM-domain protein ZYXIN has been reported to regulate actin polymerization and play an important role in the organization of actin cytoskeleton. These findings suggest that the precise control of stereocilia dimensions and F-actin network integrity of cuticular plate might be governed by multiple candidate genes cooperatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fradelizi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>It was surprising that late embryonic deletion of SRF, which is considered a master regulator of the actin cytoskeletal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miano et al., 2007</xref>), only mildly affected hair cell development. Instead, based on the observed rapid postnatal degeneration of the stereocilia and cuticular plate, it appears that SRF is equally or more important for the maintenance of the hair cell’s F-actin structures. We believe that this finding is important, as it will provide the foundation for future research on the role of SRF and its downstream components in the long-term maintenance of the hair bundle, with potential implications for progressive types of hearing loss.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Experimental mice were housed with a 12:12hr light:dark cycle in standard laboratory cage in a temperature and humidity-controlled vivarium.

For measurements of stereocilia length visualized by phalloidin staining, tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 12–24 hr at 4°C. After dissection, tissues were permeabilized in blocking buffer for 1 hr at room temperature, and then incubated with phalloidin-Alexa 488 (Invitrogen) in blocking buffer for 3–4 hr at room temperature. Samples were imaged using Zeiss LSM880 and Leica SP8 confocal microscopes.</p><p>For the analysis of the phalloidin reactivity in the cuticular plates, hair cells containing upright hair bundles were used for statistics. summed Z-projections were made that included the whole cuticular plate. Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected using circles that encompassed the center area of the cuticular plate. ROIs were measured using ImageJ Fiji’s Measure function and measurements were also made outside the hair cells and sensory epithelium to determine the background. The phalloidin reactivity in one cuticular plate was (area) * (mean gray value), minus background signal. The phalloidin reactivity measurement method was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Du et al., 2019</xref>). The measurement of cuticular plate volume was performed using Imaris version 9.9.0 (Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, UK) by manually selecting the area at the top of the cuticular plate where the phalloidin stain begins to appear until disappears at the bottom for 3D reconstruction.</p><p>For the analysis of the length of stereocilia, images containing upright hair bundles were selected for generating x–z reslices of stereocilia using ImageJ Fiji’s Reslice function. Reslices with views of central row 1 stereocilia in bundles were chosen. A vertical line from the top of a stereocilium to the point of insertion in the cuticular plate was drawn to measure a single stereocilium length. Stereocilia of HCs in the same region of the middle turn (20–24 kHz) and the basal turn (32–36 kHz) were measured.</p><p>For the analysis of the row 1 tip signal intensity of tip proteins, isolated Z-projections were made for row 1 tips and ROIs were selected at the top 1–2 μm of each tip using circles. ROIs covered most of each tip and 10 or more row 1 tips per hair bundle were measured using ImageJ Fiji’s Measure function. Measurements were also made outside the hair cells and sensory epithelium to determine the background. The tip signal intensity in a tip was (area) * (mean gray value) * (number of stacks used for the average projection), minus the total background signal. The tip signal intensity below the background was assigned a value of 0 for data calculation. For each protein staining, two to three images were acquired from 1 to 2 mice for each genotype at different ages per experiment, and experiments were repeated at least twice. Stereocilia length and tip signal intensity measurement methods have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krey et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The following antibodies were used in this study: rabbit anti-Myo7a (111501, Proteus BioSciences), rabbit anti-Srf (16821-1-AP, Proteintech), mouse anti-Lmo7 (B-7, sc-376807, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-Triobp (16124-1-AP, Proteintech), mouse anti-Mrtfa (G-7, sc-398675, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-MKL2/Mrtfb (CL1546, MA5-24628, Thermo Fisher Scientific), mouse anti-Espn (611656, BD Biosciences), mouse anti-Eps8 (610143, BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-Gnai3 (G4040-1VL, Sigma-Aldrich), goat anti-Fscn2 (EB08002, Everest Biotech), rabbit anti-Prestin (EPR22715-53,ab242128, abcam), mouse anti-Ctbp2 (612044, BD Biosciences), mouse anti-glutamate receptor (556341, BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (ACC-005, Alomone Labs), mouse anti- Acetylated tubulin (T6793-100UL, Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-Ctgf (E-5, sc-365970, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-CD45 (AF114，R&amp;D Systems), mouse anti-beta Actin (AC-15, ab6277, abcam), and rabbit anti-Cnn2 (21073-1-AP, Proteintech).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Scanning electron microscopy</title><p>Adult mice were anesthetized and perfused intracardially with 2.5% glutaraldehyde + 2% paraformaldehyde. The cochleae were dissected and perfused through the round window with the fixative (2.5% glutaraldehyde, in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, with 3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). Cochleae were then incubated in fixative overnight at 4°C. For neonatal mice, the samples were dissected and treated with fixative immediately. The cochleae were decalcified with 4.13% EDTA for several days at room temperature, and then further dissected to expose the sensory epithelium. Samples were post-fixed according to the thiocarbohydrazide-osmium protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davies and Forge, 1987</xref>). Briefly, samples were incubated in 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> for 1 hr, washed in distilled water, and then incubated in 1% thiocarbohydrazide for 20 min. This incubation process was repeated twice followed by incubation again in 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> for half an hour. Samples were then processed to dehydration with graded ethanol, critical-point dry and mounting on stubs. After sputter coating with platinum using Quorum Q150T ES, they were imaged on a Zeiss GeminiSEM 300 using the secondary electron detector. To determine the length of individual stereocilia in the highest row of a hair bundle, we obtained stereopairs scanning electron micrographs of the same hair bundle. The stereopairs of images were captured with 10° of tilt. The stereocilia length was quantified using previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thiede et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vélez-Ortega et al., 2017</xref>). The widest part of a single stereocilium was measured as stereocilium width. Hair bundles of HCs in the basal turn (30–32 kHz) were selected for SEM imaging and data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Transmission electron microscopy</title><p>Adult mice were anesthetized and perfused intracardially with 2.5% glutaraldehyde + 2% paraformaldehyde.

The measurements were performed in a sound-attenuating chamber (Shanghai Shino Acoustic Equipment Co., Ltd). Animals were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of zoletil (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg), and then kept on a heating pad (Homeothermic Monitoring System, Harvard Apparatus). ABRs were recorded by three subdermal needle electrodes. The active electrode was placed at the vertex of the skull, the reference electrode over the mastoid area of the right ear and the ground electrode on the shoulder of the left side. The free-field sound stimuli were delivered using a speaker (MF1, Tucker-Davis Technologies, Inc, Alachua, FL, USA) placed in front of the vertex of animal about 10 cm. Sound signals were generated by an acoustic stimulation system (Tucker-Davis Technologies), and data were acquired with the software BioSigRZ (Tucker-Davis Technologies). Responses were amplified ×5000 and filtered at 0.03–5 kHz, and thresholds were measured at 5.6, 8, 11.3, 16, 22.6, and 32 kHz. Stimulus intensity was decreased in 5 dB steps until two response waveforms could no longer be identified. Hearing threshold was defined as the lowest sound pressure level that elicited an appropriate ABR response.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Distortion product otoacoustic emissions</title><p>DPOAE was recorded at P26 and P42. Mice were anesthetized and kept on a heating pad. Two EC1 electrostatic speakers driven by Tucker-Davis Technologies (TDT) RZ6 system through separate channels generated two stimulus frequencies (<italic>f</italic>1 and <italic>f</italic>2). The speakers were connected to the right ear of animals using a close-field component. DPOAE recordings were collected with constant <italic>f</italic>2 frequencies from 5 to 32 kHz, with <italic>f</italic>1 swept with the frequency ratio of <italic>f</italic>2/<italic>f</italic>1 constant at 1.2. The level of L1 was equal to L2. L2 was swept in 5 dB increments from 20 to 80 dB SPL for each frequency. The acoustic waveform was collected using BioSigRZ software. DPOAE threshold was defined as the L2 producing a DPOAE that exceeded the mean noise floor by at least 3 dB. For each frequency, the mean noise floor intensity was under 0 dB SPL.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Hair cell counts</title><p>Mice were killed after ABR and DPOAE tests at P26 and P42. Cochleae were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hr and decalcified for 2 days in EDTA solution. Apical, middle, and basal turns of the cochlear sensory epithelium were dissected. The presence of hair cells was labeled with MYO7A immunoreactivity. Confocal microscopy images were analyzed using ImageJ. Hair cells were counted in at least 200 μm widths of the apical turn (8–11 kHz), middle turn (20–24 kHz), and basal turn (32–34 kHz) in each cochlear sensory epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Whole-cell patch-clamp recording</title><p>All the patch-clamp experiments were performed at room temperature. The cochleae explants were dissected out from P18 mice.

The intracellular solution was the same as extracellular solution, except for the addition of 10 mM Ethylene-bis(oxyethylenenitrilo)tetraacetic acid (EGTA). The recording site corresponds to the 8–11 kHz region. For data collection, an axon 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used. Continuous high resolution (2.56 ms sampling) two-sine stimulus protocol (10 mV peak at both 390.6 and 781.2 Hz) superimposed onto a 300-ms voltage ramp (from+160 to −160 mV) was used for nonlinear capacitance measurement.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors are expected to provide a mechanistic interpretation of the effects of Srf and Mrtfb deficiencies on the actin cytoskeleton of the hair bundle and cuticular plate. Without a testable working hypothesis, the takeaway of the work for a better understanding of hair-bundle development and maintenance remains unclear.</p><p>2. The reviewers have both expressed some concerns about data analysis based on fluorescent staining and provided a number of suggestions. They ought to be all addressed with care in the revised manuscript.</p><p>3. Adding TEM data to discuss F-actin organization would be a strong asset, although we recognize those experiments may be difficult to perform within a few months.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript provides a lot of data of relatively high quality. Yet, my major question after reading it: &quot;And what?&quot; These transcription factors are expected to affect hair cell formation, anyway. In fact, the effect of their deletion is surprisingly minor, suggesting that they are not the major players in the regulation of the hair cell cytoskeleton. It would be interesting to find a mechanism that would explain exactly how Srf and Mrtfb contribute to the stereocilia formation. Obviously, it is hard to talk about a specific mechanism for a transcription factor that regulates hundreds of genes. Yet, the effects of Srf and Mrtfb on the distribution of essential proteins between the stereocilia rows in the same bundle seems to be fundamentally different (Figure 2 vs Figure 4). Perhaps, quantification of these between-the-row differences following Barr-Gillespie's group is a &quot;low-hanging&quot; fruit that may bring you to a mechanistic model.</p><p>More specific comments:</p><p>Line 112: Correct to &quot;…became undetectable at P0 in hair cells but not in supporting cells&quot;.</p><p>Figure 1G,H-M: It would be helpful to make these panels self-explanatory by adding subtitles like &quot;fluorescence-based&quot; or &quot;SEM-based&quot; measurements. Also, clear labeling of the age of the cells on SEM images and quantification panels J and M would be helpful.</p><p>Figure 7: The whole Panel F is confusing since it does not show any stereocilia tip localization of CNN2. Likewise, the bottom images in panel E are also confusing. Please, correct the figure legend to state clearly that ALL images in panel F were taken at the level of the cuticular plate and the bottom images in panel E were also taken at the level below stereocilia.</p><p>Line 521: Please, describe the details of &quot;thiocarbohydrazide-osmium protocol&quot;, many labs use different versions of this protocol.</p><p>Literature cited in the Methods section seems to be missing in the list of references.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 79. Change to &quot;…severing protein gelsolin…&quot;</p><p>Line 108. Maybe due to expression in the brain too.</p><p>Line 114. Figure 6 reference out of order.</p><p>Line 116. How was the cuticular plate phalloidin labeling done? Was the whole CP volume integrated or was an x-y slice used?</p><p>Line 118. What do you mean by &quot;abnormal distribution&quot;?</p><p>Line 119. In Figure 1 and other figures-some of the lettering is too small.</p><p>Line 129. I don't think &quot;curly&quot; is a particularly good descriptive word for this phenomenon.</p><p>Line 141. Please label J and M with age and location.</p><p>Line 151. Kinocilia is plural, so &quot;kinocilium&quot; is the proper word to use in this sentence.</p><p>Line 161. Remove &quot;The&quot; before ESPN1.</p><p>Line 192. Mostly reduced? This result suggests that the antibodies are not highly specific.</p><p>Line 198. What is the &quot;Mrtfa group&quot;?</p><p>Line 221.

We have conducted additional experiments to address most of the concerns. In the revised manuscript, we have put more efforts on (1) interpreting the mechanistic understanding of the SRF and MRTFB in the hair cell (the revised Figures 3, 6 and 10), (2) describing the procedure of image quantification and analyses (the Materials and methods-Immunocytochemistry) and (3) conducting TEM analysis to examine directly the defects of F-actin organization of the cuticular plate in the mutants (the revised Figures 1 and 4). In the revised version, changes to our manuscript were all highlighted by using red colored text in the paper. Please find below a point-by-point address of the critique points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This manuscript provides a lot of data of relatively high quality. Yet, my major question after reading it: &quot;And what?&quot; These transcription factors are expected to affect hair cell formation, anyway. In fact, the effect of their deletion is surprisingly minor, suggesting that they are not the major players in the regulation of the hair cell cytoskeleton. It would be interesting to find a mechanism that would explain exactly how Srf and Mrtfb contribute to the stereocilia formation. Obviously, it is hard to talk about a specific mechanism for a transcription factor that regulates hundreds of genes. Yet, the effects of Srf and Mrtfb on the distribution of essential proteins between the stereocilia rows in the same bundle seems to be fundamentally different (Figure 2 vs Figure 4). Perhaps, quantification of these between-the-row differences following Barr-Gillespie's group is a &quot;low-hanging&quot; fruit that may bring you to a mechanistic model.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer mentioned, it is difficult to figure out which gene is the key player among hundreds of downstream targets of SRF or MRTFB. Our efforts in this revised manuscript focused on indepth comparisons of stereocilia tip proteins’ localization pattern among control, <italic>Srf</italic> cKO and <italic>Mrtfb</italic> cKO during stereocilia development. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we performed ESPN1, EPS8 and GNAI3 staining on the control and the mutant’s hair cells at P4, P10 and P15. The expression level, the row-specific distribution and the irregular labeling of tip proteins were analyzed and plotted in the revised Figure 3 and Figure 6. The results indicated that during stereocilia development, the effects of SRF and MRTFB on tip proteins’ localization patterns were fundamentally different, which were highly consistent with the severity of the morphological defects of stereocilia dimensions in <italic>Srf</italic> cKO and <italic>Mrtfb</italic> cKO hair cells.</p><p>We summarized the functional consequences among the control, <italic>Srf</italic> cKO and <italic>Mrtfb</italic> cKO mice in revised Figure 10 as working model, including the localization pattern of tip proteins during stereocilia development, represented by EPS8, as well as the morphological defects of stereocilia dimensions and cuticular plate.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s surprise that late embryonic deletion of SRF, supposedly a master regulator of the actin cytoskeletal network, had such mild effects on the development of the hair cell, a cell type with uniquely prominent F-actin-based structures. Instead, our data suggests that SRF is more important for the maintenance of the hair cell’s F-actin structures, based on the rapid postnatal degeneration of the stereocilia and cuticular plate. We believe that this finding is important, as it will provide the foundation for future research on the role of SRF and its downstream components in the long-term maintenance of the hair bundle, with potential implications for understanding age-related hearing loss. We believe that this is a reasonable and meaningful extrapolation of our data, thus included a sentence elaborating on this notion at the end of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More specific comments:</p><p>Line 112: Correct to &quot;…became undetectable at P0 in hair cells but not in supporting cells&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1G,H-M: It would be helpful to make these panels self-explanatory by adding subtitles like &quot;fluorescence-based&quot; or &quot;SEM-based&quot; measurements.
