Despite wide availability, to date there are no reports of AMS action on glycine receptors, perhaps because AMS is unstable at physiological pH. Here, we show that at pH 5, AMS is an efficacious agonist, eliciting in zebrafish α1 glycine receptors a maximum single-channel open probability of 0.85, much greater than that of β-alanine (0.54) or taurine (0.12), and second only to that of glycine itself (0.96). Thermodynamic cycle analysis of the efficacy of these closely related agonists shows supra-additive interaction between changes in the length of the agonist molecule and the size of the anionic moiety. Single particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of AMS-bound glycine receptors show that the AMS-bound agonist pocket is as compact as with glycine, and three-dimensional classification demonstrates that the channel populates the open and the desensitized states, like glycine, but not the closed intermediate state associated with the weaker partial agonists, β-alanine and taurine. Because AMS is on the cusp between full and partial agonists, it provides a new tool to help us understand agonist action in the pentameric superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glycine receptors</kwd><kwd>agonists</kwd><kwd>single channel recording</kwd><kwd>cryoEM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project grant MR/R009074/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sivilotti</surname><given-names>Lucia G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM100400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gouaux</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The sulfonate analog of glycine is very efficacious in activating glycine channels and causes conformational changes in this pentameric ligand-gated channel that are similar to those produced by glycine itself.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The glycine receptor (GlyR), a member of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel superfamily, is an anion-permeable channel that mediates fast synaptic inhibition in caudal areas of the central nervous system, particularly in the spinal cord. Studies of the GlyR have been instrumental in illuminating structure-function relationships and the molecular activation mechanism in the pentameric superfamily of receptors, because GlyR is well-suited both to single-channel recording to quantify detailed activation mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burzomato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lape et al., 2008</xref>) and to high-resolution structural investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Du et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We have recently shown that the degree of contraction induced by the agonist binding in the orthosteric neurotransmitter site is important in determining the efficacy with which agonists open this channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the smallest agonist, the natural transmitter glycine, is the most efficacious agonist and when the channel is fully occupied by glycine, only open and desensitized structures can be detected. In single-channel recordings, a glycine-bound channel is either desensitized or open for more than 95% of the time and we shall refer to glycine as a full agonist. Larger compounds are weaker as agonists (e.g., partial agonists), and in their presence a third structural state is seen, an intermediate state where the binding site has closed on the agonist, but the pore is still in the resting closed conformation. A particularly well-characterized partial agonist is taurine, which produces approximately half of the maximum open probability response seen with glycine. Taurine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) has a bulkier anionic moiety than glycine (sulfonate instead of carboxylate) and has one additional methylene group separating the amino and anionic entities, respectively. As we inspected the structure of agonist-occupied GlyR binding sites, we wondered which of these two features was most important for determining agonist efficacy. We already knew that β-alanine, the carboxylate homolog of taurine, is less efficacious than glycine, but more efficacious than taurine. This strongly suggests that a structure intermediate between glycine and taurine, aminomethane sulfonic acid (AMS), should also be an agonist, and probably more efficacious than taurine. Surprisingly, we found only one study in the literature with data on AMS. In 1973, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Young and Snyder, 1973</xref>) reported that AMS displaced the binding of radioactive strychnine, a competitive antagonist of GlyR, but had no agonist effects when applied by iontophoresis onto native GlyRs in spinal cord neurons.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>AMS is a highly efficacious agonist on zebrafish α1 GlyR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structures of glycine, β-alanine, AMS, and taurine.

At acidic pH, GlyR gating is diminished, and taurine becomes a weaker agonist, whereas the maximum open probability elicited by glycine remains very high. Under these conditions, AMS is a strong agonist, more efficacious than β-alanine and almost as efficacious as glycine. Single particle cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structures of the AMS-bound GlyRs have features similar to those we reported for the GlyR bound to the most efficacious of the agonists, glycine, in that they populate only the open and the desensitized states, and have a compact agonist binding pocket. While the instability of AMS at neutral pH limits its general usefulness as an agonist, its efficacy provides a new tool to test hypotheses for the structural correlates of agonist action in pentameric ligand-gated channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In the initial experiments, we dissolved AMS in a pH 7.4 solution and tested by whole-cell recording its effect at 100 mM on α1 GlyRs expressed in HEK 293 cells. Currents elicited by AMS were found to be inconsistent in amplitude over time. We also found that the pH of AMS solutions was unstable, drifting in a matter of few minutes. We hypothesized that this drift reflected AMS instability and decomposition at neutral pH. We then tried dissolving the compound in acidic solutions and found that at pH 5, 100 mM AMS solutions were stable, and remained within 0.1 of a unit of the initial pH for almost an hour, enough time to test their effect on GlyRs.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>AMS is a highly efficacious GlyR agonist at acidic pH</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows whole-cell recordings of the responses of zebrafish α1 GlyR expressed in HEK 293 cells to U-tube applications of glycine, β-alanine, AMS, or taurine at pH 5.

We had previously noted a similar possible interaction between loop B S174 and the amino group of another partial agonist, GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Considering that the interactions with the (−) subunit are similar for the two groups of agonists, full and partial, it is tempting to speculate that the difference in the amino group interactions on the principal side may contribute to the difference in their efficacy.</p><p>Our previous structural studies showed that agonist efficacy is correlated with the degree of contraction of the binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Because AMS is nearly as efficacious as glycine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), we expect it to produce a contraction of the binding pocket similar to that caused by glycine. The volumes of glycine, AMS, and taurine binding pockets are 130 Å<sup>3</sup>, 125 Å<sup>3</sup>, and 151 Å<sup>3</sup>, respectively, showing that the binding pocket, when bound with AMS or glycine, takes up a conformation that is more compact than that seen with the partial agonist taurine. By overlapping the binding pockets, we found that, in the glycine-bound site, the movement of loops B and C brings them closer to the ECD-TMD interface than in the AMS- and taurine-bound sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which may be one reason for the higher efficacy of glycine.</p><p>The perturbation introduced by the agonist in the binding site spreads to the pore by eliciting conformational changes at the ECD-TMD interface, which can be detected when we compare the apo and open states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yu et al., 2021</xref>).

Indeed, prior studies have shown that AMS is unstable and decomposes to formaldehyde and sulfur dioxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frankel and Moses, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Moe et al., 1981</xref>). The mechanism of decomposition of AMS and other α amino sulfonic acids is thought to require the availability of the electron pair of the unprotonated amino group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Moe et al., 1981</xref>). This implies that AMS should be maximally stable when the amino group is protonated and the compound is a zwitterion. The amino group on AMS is not very basic, with a pKa value of 5.75 (cf. 9.06 and 9.78 for the amino groups of taurine and glycine, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benoit et al., 1988</xref>). At physiological pH, only 2% of AMS is expected to be in the stable zwitterion form. Full protonation requires pH values too acidic to be compatible with stable electrophysiological recordings. We opted to test AMS at a compromise pH of 5, where 85% of this compound is a zwitterion. In order to ensure cell health, we kept cells at neutral pH and switched them to pH 5 only during agonist application. In the structural studies, particular care was taken to freeze the grids as quickly as possible after mixing agonists and receptors and our analysis showed density features consistent with undegraded AMS molecules. We were rewarded in these experimental choices by our demonstration that AMS is an efficacious agonist at both functional and structural levels.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>AMS behaves structurally as a highly efficacious agonist</title><p>Our whole-cell and single-channel recordings demonstrated AMS is an efficacious agonist, which produces a mean maximum <italic>Popen</italic> of 0.85 (cf. 0.96 for glycine) and is clearly more efficacious than β-alanine, which until now was considered the second most efficacious agonist of GlyRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ivica et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Cryo-EM structural analysis of AMS-bound GlyRs detected all the structural features that we have associated with the high efficacy of glycine. The partial agonist-bound closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yu et al., 2021</xref>) is absent from both the AMS-bound and glycine-bound GlyRs. Indeed, our data show that, for the AMS-bound receptor, 94.3% and 3.4% of the particles are in open and desensitized state classes, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), consistent with the notion that the particle fractions for desensitized states are much smaller than open states when the receptor is isolated via SMA, compared to when it is incorporated into nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Further confirmation comes from inspecting the agonist binding site. The most obvious feature is that the binding pocket is as compact when bound to AMS as with glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). The measurements for the glycine-bound and AMS-bound pockets are almost identical, and both are more compact than those obtained with the partial agonist taurine. Interestingly, the potency of AMS is low, as its EC<sub>50</sub> is about tenfold higher than that of glycine, and similar to the EC<sub>50</sub> of taurine. Thus, even though AMS has an additional oxygen for the formation of another hydrogen bond, it must bind with much lower affinity than glycine, underscoring the lack of correlation between efficacy and affinity of these agonists.</p><p>Both AMS and glycine form multiple interactions with the (+) and (−) subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These interactions are similar but not identical for partial and full agonists, and we were able to observe some differences. For instance, the interaction between loop B S174 and the agonist amino group, which was observed for partial agonist taurine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yu et al., 2021</xref>), was not seen with either AMS and glycine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>) probably because these molecules are shorter. It is tempting to speculate that this additional interaction may limit the movement of loop B, a domain whose conformation has a close relationship with the ECD-TMD interface. This limitation in movement may contribute to the low efficacy of taurine and GABA.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Glycine has uniquely high efficacy</title><p>The natural agonist of GlyRs, the neurotransmitter glycine, remains the most efficacious agonist. It has generally been thought that this is simply due to glycine being the smallest molecule, but our discovery of the agonist effects of AMS allowed us to consider this question in greater detail, examining the effects of making the agonist longer or changing its anionic moiety from a carboxylate to a larger sulfonate group. In our functional work, we characterized a panel of four agonists, chosen on the basis of their related structures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> shows how swapping the carboxylate group with sulfonate (vertical arrows) in glycine and β-alanine produces AMS and taurine, respectively, whereas lengthening the carbon chain by one methylene (horizontal arrows) in glycine and AMS produces β-alanine and taurine, respectively.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Thermodynamic cycle for the four GlyR agonists functionally characterized, showing their structure and example sweeps of the single-channel activity they elicit.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79148-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> shows how both changes in structure decrease agonist efficacy. Of the two structure modifications we tested, lengthening the distance between the two charges on these amino acids causes the greater decrease in efficacy. The example clusters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> show that the median maximum open probability decreases from 0.98 to 0.57 (glycine to β-alanine, corresponding to a decrease in E<sub>eff</sub> from 40.7 to 1.30) and from 0.93 to 0.06 (AMS to taurine, corresponding to a decrease in E<sub>eff</sub> from 13.5 to 0.06). It is worth noting that further lengthening β-alanine by one methylene produces GABA, a weak partial agonist.</p><p>Increasing the size of the negatively charged group from carboxylate to sulfonate had a modest effect for the shorter agonists, and the overall efficacy of glycine was decreased by less than twofold with the change to AMS. The effect of this swap is greater on the longer agonists. This can better be examined by thermodynamic cycle analysis of the free energy changes associated with gating for the four related agonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These values can be obtained from our estimates of overall efficacy yielded by single-channel measurements of maximum open probability. In the thermodynamic cycle analysis of the free energy values that underlie gating, we found that there is marked coupling between the effects of the two changes in agonist structure, with an estimated coupling energy of 1.03±0.2 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This means that the combined effect is more than we would anticipate by the linear sum of the effects of each change. In other words, taurine is less efficacious than we would predict. Conversely, glycine is more efficacious than we would expect it to be, given that it is a shorter taurine, where the sulfonate is replaced by a carboxylate.</p><p>Our previous work has shown that the much greater efficacy of glycine compared with taurine or GABA is associated with a tighter conformation of the binding pocket bound to glycine. Our new data show that AMS is almost as full an agonist as glycine and that the binding pocket bound to AMS is as compact as with glycine, at the resolution of our data. However, the structural correlates for the small difference in efficacy between AMS and glycine have so far proven elusive and may require further structural studies, at higher resolution.</p><p>In conclusion, our electrophysiological and cryo-EM experiments demonstrate that AMS is an agonist with high efficacy, greater than that of β-alanine and second only to that of glycine. The availability of AMS as a new tool is particularly useful, because structural changes with activation are relatively small in channels of this superfamily, and the differences between agonists of different efficacy are subtle.

The culture medium was Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco, 41966029) supplemented with 10% v/v heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Gibco). Cell aliquots were frozen from the third passaging since the purchase batch. For experiments, an aliquot was thawed and then passaged up to 25 times, every 2–3 days after reaching 70–80% confluence.</p><p>For transfection, cells were plated on 13 mm poly-L-lysine glass coverslips, placed inside 35 mm cell culture dishes containing 2 ml growth medium. The transfection was performed with the calcium phosphate precipitation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Groot-Kormelink et al., 2002</xref>). The total amount of DNA per coverslip was 3 µg. The DNA mixture contained 2% plasmid coding for zebrafish α1 GlyR (Uniprot accession number O93430), 20% plasmid coding for the enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) and 78% of ‘empty’ pcDNA3 plasmid. The empty plasmid was introduced to optimize the level of receptor expression and the eGFP to identify the transfected cells. After 4–8 hr, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh growth medium. Electrophysiological recordings were performed 24–48 hr after transfection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Whole-cell recordings</title><p>Recording pipettes were pulled with a P-97 horizontal puller (Sutter Instruments), using thick-walled borosilicate capillaries (GC150F-7.5; Harvard Apparatus, UK). The tips were fire-polished with a microforger (Narishige, Japan) to a resistance of 3–5 MΩ. Currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices), prefiltered with the amplifier’s built in 5 kHz low-pass Bessel filter and sampled at 20 kHz with Digidata 1550B digitizer (Molecular Devices) to a computer hard drive with Clampex 10.7 software (Molecular Devices). Currents were recorded at a nominal –40 mV holding potential (–50 mV if corrected for liquid junction potential). Access resistance was never higher than 8 MΩ and was compensated by 60–80%, with a maximum voltage error of 10 mV. For the figures, current traces were filtered with an additional 1 kHz low pass Gaussian filter in Clampfit 10.7.</p><p>The bath extracellular solution contained (in mM): 112.7 NaCl, 20 sodium gluconate, 2 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 tetraethylammonium Cl (TEACl), 30 glucose, and 10 HEPES; the pH was adjusted with NaOH to 7.4.</p><p>Agonist solutions were freshly prepared in pH 5 extracellular solution. For this solution, the 10 mM HEPES buffer was replaced with 6.7 mM sodium acetate and 3.3 mM acetic acid.</p><p>The intracellular solution contained (in mM): 101.1 potassium gluconate, 11 EGTA, 6 KCl, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 TEACl, 2 MgATP, 10 HEPES, and 40 sucrose; the pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH.</p><p>Agonists were applied to a cell with a custom-made U-tube. The speed of agonist application was determined by positioning the recording pipette just above the cell and measuring the 20–80% rise time of the current evoked by U-tube application of diluted bath solution (50%) to the recording pipette. Rise time was typically 2 ms (the U-tube tool was discarded if rise time was slower than 20 ms).</p><p>Agonist was applied every 30 s including application of a saturating concentration of 100 mM glycine every 3–4 applications to monitor current rundown. If the rundown was more than 30%, the cell was discarded from analysis. A full dose-response curve was obtained in each cell, and the responses measured with Clampfit 10.7 were fitted with the Hill equation with custom-made <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/DCPROGS/CVFIT/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha">software</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lape, 2020a</xref>). The parameters of the dose response fits obtained from n cells (EC<sub>50</sub>, Imax, and nH) are reported as mean ± SD.

In order to minimize electrical noise, pipette tips were coated with Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning, Dow Silicones, UK). Cell-attached single-channel currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200B in patch configuration with a gain set to 500. The built-in low pass Bessel filter was set to 10 kHz and holding voltage was +100 mV. Single-channel currents were sampled at 100 kHz with a Digidata 1440 digitizer. For analysis, currents were additionally filtered with a 3 kHz low pass Gaussian filter and resampled to 33.3 kHz with Clampfit 10.7 software. In the recording pipette, agonists were dissolved in the pH 5 extracellular solution. Openings of GlyR in the presence of high agonist concentrations appear as clusters of openings, namely stretches of high open probability activity separated by long desensitized closed times that are not concentration dependent. We measured open probability with Clampfit 10.7 in clusters that had no double openings and were at least 100 ms long. Openings and closing events within the cluster were idealized with a threshold crossing method and cluster open probability was obtained as the ratio between the total open time and the duration of the cluster.

After the extraction of particles, two rounds of 3D classification were performed by cryoSparc to remove the junk particles. One round of heterogeneous refinement with six classes was performed. Two classes with GlyR features containing 449,976 particles were selected. A second round of the heterogeneous refinement with four classes was performed and one class with good TMD features containing 283,117 particles was chosen. This was followed by a round of non-uniform refinement performed in cryoSparc. These good particles were then exported to Relion 3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>) for one round of 3D classification. During the 3D classification in Relion 3.1, the particle alignment was closed and the data set was separated into eight classes with the T value of 20. The 3D classes with good TMD are selected for the subsequent 3D reconstruction. The final maps were generated by a direct reconstruction using Relion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>). The final FSC curves and local resolution maps were estimated by cryoSparc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>). All maps are sharpened by LocScale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jakobi et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Model building</title><p>The model building commenced with the replacement of the ligand derived from the prior GlyR structures bound with taurine. The initial models for AMS-bound open, desensitized, and expanded-open states were taurine-bound open, desensitized, and expanded-open, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). The procedure to build each of the three AMS-bound states was the same. Take AMS-bound open state for example: the taurine-bound open state was first rigid-body fitted to the corresponding map using UCSF Chimera software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>) was used to replace the ligand taurine with AMS. The structure was then manually adjusted in Coot followed by a round of Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonine et al., 2018</xref>) refinement. The map to model cross-correlation values between the final model and map was 0.78, 0.84, and 0.81 for open, desensitized, and expanded-open states, respectively.</p><p>Note that our numbering of residues of the zebrafish GlyR α1 subunit includes the signal peptide which is predicted to be 16 residues.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Statistics for 3D reconstruction and model refinement.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-79148-supp1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-79148-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The coordinates and volumes for the cryo-EM data have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank under accession codes EMD-26316, EMD-26315, and EMD-26317.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Marcel P Goldschen-Ohm as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another; please address all of the reviewer comments below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. lines 234-240, 290-292 – The differences in the binding site structures between glycine, AMS, and taurine in Figure 5D, E appear to be incredibly small with respect to the resolution of the structural models. I am skeptical about all of the conclusions that the authors draw in this section about taurine not producing as compact a binding site as glycine or AMS and glycine shifting loops B and C closer to the TMD. Based on the model resolutions, wouldn't it be more apt to conclude that there are no obvious differences in binding site compactness, etc.? If the authors disagree, could you please offer some additional explanation as to why the very small differences (which the authors refer to as &quot;subtle&quot;) should be considered sufficiently well resolved to be meaningful? Perhaps densities can be used to make an argument here?

The relative lack of a desensitized conformation in the SMA-extracted glycine receptor particles as compared to what would be expected based on functional data should be discussed.

In Figure 3—figure supplement 2, it is clear that the open, desensitized, and expanded-open clusters were selected based on their similarity to previously identified structures.

The authors write (lines 60-62) that the binding of high efficacy agonists like glycine leads to channels adopting either open or desensitized states, while binding of partial agonists results in an additional third (intermediate) state that represents agonist-bound closed conformations of the channel. This isn't really true, however, or is an oversimplification that could be confusing to the reader. If a maximally-effective concentration of glycine has a Po of 0.96, there clearly are brief transitions to glycine-bound closed states of the channel. Wouldn't it be more accurate to state that as agonist efficacy increases, the duration of ligand-bound closed states decreases? Also, what about when low (non-saturating) concentrations of glycine are used? Would one still expect the two states the authors mention?</p><p>2. In Figure 4D, the AMS_Open and Taurine_Open lines look more similar to one another (except when the distance along the pore axis &gt;30A) than they do with the Glycine_Open line. Also, the taurine and AMS open lines both look markedly different from the glycine line between 10 and 18 angstroms along the pore axis. What is the significance of this?</p><p>3. The single channel data obtained using 100 mM taurine assumes that this concentration is truly maximally-effective. Is this the case? If it is not, could that explain the statement on line 336 that &quot;…taurine is less efficacious than we would predict.&quot;?</p><p>4. Line 320. How do max Po values of 0.96 and 0.54 yield Eeff values of 60 and 3.8 from the equation Po = Eeff/(1 + Eeff)? Shouldn't they be closer to 24 and 1.2? The same question applies to AMS and taurine on line 321.</p><p>5. Do the authors have any thoughts on why the Po, and thus efficacy, of β-alanine and especially taurine went up relative to glycine as the pH was raised from 5 to 7.4 (Table 2)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79148.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. lines 234-240, 290-292 – The differences in the binding site structures between glycine, AMS, and taurine in Figure 5D, E appear to be incredibly small with respect to the resolution of the structural models.

We agree that the conformation of the binding sites showing in Figure 5E is similar for glycine, AMS, and taurine. Considering the conformational changes of the binding pockets involves a collection of multiple residues, the binding pocket volume can thus more clearly reflect differences in conformations between the different agonists. The volumes of the glycine, AMS and taurine binding pockets are 130, 125 and 151 Å<sup>3</sup> respectively. These measurements show that the taurine binding pockets are larger than glycine and AMS binding pockets, consistent with the notion that taurine is not producing as compact a binding pocket as glycine and AMS. The text in Lines 239 and following is revised to read “The volume of glycine, AMS and taurine binding pockets are 130, 125 and 151 Å<sup>3</sup> respectively, showing that the binding pocket, when bound with AMS or glycine, takes up a conformation that is more compact than that seen with the partial agonist taurine”.</p><p>For the ECD-TMD interface, we agree that the measurements for ECD-TMD interface are similar. We revised the text in Lines 267 and following to read “We found that the ECD-TMD interface are overall similar between glycine, AMS and taurine (Figure 6A-B), as indicated by the distances between the centers of mass of the secondary structure elements.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. lines 177, 237, 251 – related to above, please define what &quot;subtle&quot; means.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with the reviewer’s comments above.

The criteria by which we discarded the ‘bad’ 3D classes generated in Relion were based on TMD features. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, the classes with weak and disconnected TMD were discarded. More details about the 3D classification are added in the Image processing part of the methods section to read “After the extraction of particles, two rounds of 3D classification were performed by cryoSparc to remove the junk particles. One round of heterogeneous refinement with 6 classes was performed. Two classes with GlyR features containing 449,976 particles were selected. A second round of the heterogeneous refinement with 4 classes was performed and one class with good TMD features containing 283,117 particles was chosen. This was followed by a round of non-uniform refinement performed in cryoSparc. These good particles were then exported to Relion 3.1 (Zivanov et al. 2018) for one round of 3D classification. During the 3D classification in Relion 3.1, the particle alignment was closed and the data set was separated into 8 classes with the T value of 20. The 3D classes with good TMD are selected for the subsequent 3D reconstruction.”</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79148-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. line 342 – extra &quot;that&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

It is therefore possible that the additional shut state seen with partial agonists would be structurally detectable at low glycine, but the relation between structural and functional data is only semi quantitative, and we’d rather keep these considerations for further work, as they are too speculative for this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

What is the significance of this?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that AMS_Open and Taurine_Open lines are similar to each other, underscoring the notion that nearly full and partial agonists result in opening of the ion channel to similar open conformations.</p><p>We also agree that the Glycine_Open line looks different between 10 and 18 Å. The differences occur at the 9’L (L277), which functions as the constriction point in the Apo and partial agonist bound closed states (Yu et al., 2021, Cell). Upon activation, the side chain of 9’L rotates and the channel opens. While the density of the 9’L becomes weaker at the end of the side chain, the density for the Cα and Cβ are strong and, when we lower the contour level, we can visualize the entire side chain. As a result, we believe that the ion channel radii, as defined by the position of the 9’L side chain, are different. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, we show models and maps, where the maps are all contoured at 4.9σ. While the overall open state conformations of the ion channel are similar between AMS, taurine and glycine, in the glycine bound state there are subtle differences in the conformation of the open state, most notably at 9’L. At present, however, we do not fully understand the molecular mechanism underpinning this difference and await further studies, such as long timescale molecular dynamics simulations.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79148-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Given that these agonists do not block the channel (contrast with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors), using a supramaximal concentration was not a concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Line 320. How do max Po values of 0.96 and 0.54 yield Eeff values of 60 and 3.8 from the equation Po = Eeff/(1 + Eeff)? Shouldn't they be closer to 24 and 1.2? The same question applies to AMS and taurine on line 321.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript, the Eeff values were calculated from the Popen values as follows: each cluster (longer than 100 ms and with no double openings) gave one Popen and one Eeff value. In the text we then quoted the mean Eeff values for the different agonists.</p><p>However, the relation of Eeff to Popen is non-linear, and neither the Popen nor the Eeff values are normally distributed, and this causes the discrepancy spotted by the referee. In our original analysis we had taken into account by reporting both mean and median values of Popen (Table 2) and by using non-parametric statistical tests. However, we had cited mean Eeff values in the text and in the calculations. We have revised this to use the median Popen to calculate Eeff and the energy values in the cycle– the conclusions of the paper are not changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
