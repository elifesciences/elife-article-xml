Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) plays an important role in Histone 3 Lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3)-dependent imprinting, loss of which leads to growth and developmental changes in mouse offspring. In this study, we show that offspring from mouse oocytes lacking the PRC2 protein Embryonic Ectoderm Development (EED) were initially developmentally delayed, characterised by low blastocyst cell counts and substantial growth delay in mid-gestation embryos. This initial developmental delay was resolved as offspring underwent accelerated fetal development and growth in late gestation resulting in offspring that were similar stage and weight to controls at birth. The accelerated development and growth in offspring from <italic>Eed</italic>-null oocytes was associated with remodelling of the placenta, which involved an increase in fetal and maternal tissue size, conspicuous expansion of the glycogen-enriched cell population, and delayed parturition. Despite placental remodelling and accelerated offspring fetal growth and development, placental efficiency, and fetal blood glucose levels were low, and the fetal blood metabolome was unchanged. Moreover, while expression of the H3K27me3-imprinted gene and amino acid transporter <italic>Slc38a4</italic> was increased, fetal blood levels of individual amino acids were similar to controls, indicating that placental amino acid transport was not enhanced. Genome-wide analyses identified extensive transcriptional dysregulation and DNA methylation changes in affected placentas, including a range of imprinted and non-imprinted genes. Together, while deletion of <italic>Eed</italic> in growing oocytes resulted in fetal growth and developmental delay and placental hyperplasia, our data indicate a remarkable capacity for offspring fetal growth to be normalised despite inefficient placental function and the loss of H3K27me3-dependent genomic imprinting.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>oocyte</kwd><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>inheritance</kwd><kwd>placenta</kwd><kwd>fetal growth</kwd><kwd>polycomb</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT1144966</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Western</surname><given-names>Patrick S</given-names></name><name><surname>Gardner</surname><given-names>David K</given-names></name><name><surname>van den Buuse</surname><given-names>Maarten</given-names></name><name><surname>Adelson</surname><given-names>David L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT1144887</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Western</surname><given-names>Patrick S</given-names></name><name><surname>Gardner</surname><given-names>David K</given-names></name><name><surname>Adelson</surname><given-names>David L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT2021247</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Western</surname><given-names>Patrick S</given-names></name><name><surname>Adelson</surname><given-names>David L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100015539</institution-id><institution>Australian Government</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Training Program Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jarred</surname><given-names>Ellen G</given-names></name><name><surname>Oberin</surname><given-names>Ruby</given-names></name><name><surname>Petautschnig</surname><given-names>Sigrid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Growth-delayed offspring generated from eggs that lacked normal epigenetic programming exhibited a remarkable capacity to undergo late gestational fetal growth recovery, despite inefficient placental function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epigenetic mechanisms orchestrate tissue development, body patterning, and growth by regulating chromatin accessibility and expression of developmental genes in embryonic and extraembryonic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maccani and Marsit, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). H3K27me3 is a repressive epigenetic modification catalysed by PRC2, which is composed of the core components, EED, EZH1/2, SUZ12, and RBBP4/7, all of which are essential for histone methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pasini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faust et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Carroll et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glancy et al., 2021</xref>).

In contrast to growth restriction, another study found that postnatal offspring were overgrown following deletion of <italic>Eed</italic> in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prokopuk et al., 2018</xref>).

While fetuses derived from <italic>Eed</italic>-null oocytes were initially developmentally delayed and growth restricted, they underwent accelerated growth and development facilitating the birth of pups at normal weight from pregnancies of normal gestational length. Moreover, remedial fetal growth occurred in the presence of placental hyperplasia, reduced placental efficiency, low fetal blood glucose, and normal fetal blood amino acid and metabolite levels. Together, this work reveals a complicated offspring growth trajectory that involved in utero resolution of fetal growth restriction and developmental delay, followed by perinatal overgrowth, despite the loss of H3K27me3-dependent imprinting caused by <italic>Eed</italic> deletion in oocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of maternal EED compromised mid-gestation survival in offspring</title><p>Previous studies demonstrated that deletion of <italic>Eed</italic> in oocytes resulted in contradictory findings of early embryonic developmental delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Inoue et al., 2018</xref>) and early postnatal offspring overgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prokopuk et al., 2018</xref>).

HET-hom offspring were significantly lighter than HET-het, WT-het, and WT-wt controls at E12.5, E14.5, E17.5, and E18.5, but by P0 and P3 HET-hom offspring were heavier than isogenic HET-het controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–H</xref>). However, by monitoring plug date and delivery day, we also observed that gestational length was extended in 60% of pregnancies from <italic>Eed-</italic>hom oocytes. Of 23 litters, 9 (40%) were born on E19.5, 7 (30%) were born on E20.5, and 7 (30%) were born on E21.5. While all pups born on E19.5 survived, 30% and 67% of offspring from pregnancies extended by one or two days respectively, were found dead. In contrast, although one litter from an <italic>Eed-</italic>het pregnancy was delivered on E20.5, 23 (9 wt and 14 het) were delivered on E19.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).</p><p>To determine if the extended gestational length of pregnancies from <italic>Eed-</italic>hom oocytes affected HET-hom offspring weight, we examined pup weight in pregnancies delivered on E19.5 only. This revealed that HET-hom offspring delivered on E19.5 were similar in weight and developmental stage to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Moreover, comparison of data for all surviving HET-hom pups delivered on E19.5-E21.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) with those only born on E19.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>) revealed that increased gestational length contributed to the overall increased pup weight of the population at P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). However, ratios of HET-hom fetal weight over WT-wt, WT-het, or HET-het fetal weight at E12.5, E14.5, E17.5, E18.5, and E19.5 (excluding litters of extended gestational length) revealed that the weight deficit in HET-hom was resolved between E14.5 and birth on E19.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Moreover, with the exception of the modest weight deficit, E18.5 HET-hom offspring were indistinguishable from controls at the gross morphological level. Together, these data demonstrate that the gross morphological delay and the fetal weight deficit in HET-hom offspring was resolved by E19.5 and that this occurred independently of litter size. In addition, by P3 HET-hom offspring were heavier than controls. As the overgrown HET-hom offspring in the P3 weight cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) included litters born at E19.5 E20.5 and E21.5, both postnatal offspring growth and extended gestation presumably contributed to the overgrowth phenotype.</p><p>We also observed increased fetal resorptions and fetal death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), raising the possibility that the reduced number of fetuses/pregnancy might result in greater maternal support per fetus leading to normalisation of pup weight at E19.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prokopuk et al., 2018</xref>). However, there was no difference in pup weight from <italic>Eed-</italic>hom and control litters that contained 5–7 pups and were born on E19.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), indicating that resolution of fetal growth restriction in utero was at least partly independent of litter size, a finding consistent with our earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prokopuk et al., 2018</xref>). Combined, while HET-hom offspring were initially developmentally delayed and under-weight compared to their isogenic heterozygous counterparts and wild-type controls, HET-hom offspring weight was normalised by birth, and pups were overgrown by P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and K</xref>), an outcome facilitated by fetal growth recovery and extended gestation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Oocyte-specific loss of EED results in placental hyperplasia and reduced placental efficiency</title><p>To understand whether the normalisation of HET-hom fetal weight might be related to changes in placental development, we collected and weighed E12.5, E14.5, E17.5, and E18.5 placentas from HET-hom, HET-het, WT-het, and WT-wt offspring. At E12.5 placental weights were consistent across all genotypes, but at E14.5 HET-hom placentas were slightly heavier than HET-het controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). By E17.5 HET-hom placentas were 58% heavier than HET-het controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and at E18.5 HET-hom placentas were 24% heavier than HET-het placentas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These changes were reflected in differing HET-hom and HET-het placental growth rates over time with HET-hom placenta growth rates 0.79 and 1.81 times greater than HET-het placentas between E12.5 and E14.5 and E14.5 and E17.5, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). Comparison of HET-hom placental to fetal weights revealed that placental growth preceded late-gestational fetal growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). The HET-hom fetal growth rate was slightly lower than HET-het offspring between E12.5 and E14.5, similar between E14.5 and E18.5, but was greater between E18.5 and E19.5 so that HET-hom pups were of equivalent weight to controls at birth on E19.5 (excluding litters with extended gestation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C–F, J</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E and G</xref>).

Together, while the whole HET-hom placenta was larger than controls, the fetally-derived junctional zone was disproportionately expanded and there were significantly more PAS-stained glycogen-enriched cells in midline sections of HET-hom placentas compared to all other genotypes.</p><p>As glycogen can be converted to glucose, to determine whether the greater number of glycogen-enriched cells might impact glucose levels in HET-hom offspring, we measured blood glucose levels at E17.5 and E18.5, just prior to parturition. Fetal blood glucose level was initially relatively low and similar in all genotypes at E17.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>), but increased significantly in WT-wt, HET-wt, and HET-het controls by E18.5. However, the fetal blood glucose level in HET-hom offspring did not increase between E17.5 and E18.5 and were lower than controls at E18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). This indicated that increased circulating glucose was unlikely to explain the accelerated HET-hom fetal growth observed during late gestation.</p><p>To determine whether increased fetal capillary area within the labyrinth might underlie a greater potential for maternal-fetal nutrient exchange we performed IF for CD31 (PECAM-1). Sections taken from the middle of each placenta were stained and the total labyrinth area, labyrinth/placental ratio, and fetal capillary/labyrinth ratio were quantified in WT-wt, HET-het, and HET-hom placentas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). In this analysis the labyrinth was defined by the CD31-positive capillary enriched region for each genotype and the total labyrinth area was defined as capillary area plus the total space outside the capillaries. The capillary area was defined as the total CD31 positive area plus the unstained space inside the capillaries. HALO analysis revealed a reduction in overall labyrinth area in both HET-het and HET-hom placentas compared to WT-wt controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating that heterozygosity for <italic>Eed</italic> reduced labyrinth size in the placenta. However, when total placental size was taken into account, the labyrinth/placental ratio was decreased only in HET-hom placentas compared to WT-wt and HET-het controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Moreover, while the capillary area to labyrinth area ratio was unchanged in HET-hom placentas compared to WT-wt controls, this ratio was reduced in HET-hom compared to HET-het placentas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Together, these data indicate that the area available for maternal-fetal nutrient transfer in the labyrinth of HET-hom placentas was either unaffected or decreased compared to controls.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Labyrinth area and capillary/labyrinth ratios were reduced in offspring from <italic>Embryonic ectoderm development</italic> (<italic>Eed)</italic>-null oocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescent analysis of male and female E17.5 placental sections through the middle of <italic>Eed</italic> WT-wt, HET-het and HET-hom placentas using CD31 to detect placental vasculature and DAPI to stain cell nuclei.

To determine whether altered placental function changed fetal blood amino acid levels and/or fetal or maternal metabolomic state, we collected blood samples from male and female E17.5 WT-wt, HET-het, and HET-hom fetal offspring and their mothers and assessed 356 metabolites using mass spectrometry. One hundred and sixty metabolites were detected across the sample sets. Principal component analysis revealed three separate clusters corresponding to maternal and fetal blood samples and 19 pooled biological quality control samples (PBQCs: included to ensure data reproducibility), demonstrating sensitivity to detect metabolic differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The maternal samples clustered separately from the fetal samples, revealing clear metabolic differences between the fetal and maternal bloods.

In this study similar outcomes were caused by deleting <italic>Eed</italic> in the oocyte, resulting in the production of isogenic HET-hom offspring that are epigenetically different to HET-het controls. Initially, offspring were characterised by embryonic and fetal developmental delay, but this was resolved late in gestation. Despite lower placental efficiency indicated by fetal/placental weight ratio, low fetal glucose levels, and unaffected amino acid and metabolomic profiles in late gestation fetal and maternal serum, HET-hom offspring underwent a period of late fetal growth recovery and early postnatal overgrowth. Although placental transcription and DNA methylation was altered at important H3K27me3-imprinted genes and some classically imprinted genes, transcription and DNA methylation were also altered at many non-imprinted sites. In addition, several X-linked genes that have been associated with placental development and function were transcriptionally increased, but we found no evidence for widespread dysregulation of X-inactivation in late-stage placentas. While the underlying cause remains unclear, our data indicate that fetal growth is normalised in HET-hom offspring in the absence of any obvious increase in nutritional support from the placenta and that loss of EED in oocytes causes programming effects on the fetus that are unlikely to be explained by loss of only H3K37me3-dependent imprinting or increased maternal <italic>Xist</italic>.</p><p>A previous study reported that blastocysts from <italic>Eed-</italic>null oocytes formed at normal rates and were not affected by increased cell death, indicating normal pre-implantation development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Inoue et al., 2018</xref>). However, we found that while preimplantation development progressed at similar rates in embryos from <italic>Eed</italic> wild-type and <italic>Eed</italic>-null oocytes, blastocysts derived from <italic>Eed-</italic>null oocytes contained low cell numbers, primarily due to fewer inner cell mass cells. This deficit may be due to low cell proliferation during pre-implantation development caused by loss of EED-dependent oocyte programming or to loss of maternal EED supplied in the mature oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Inoue et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Inoue et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jarred et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erhardt et al., 2003</xref>). While the latter is consistent with the established role of PRC2 in driving cell division in stem cells and other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bracken et al., 2003</xref>), other EED-dependent effects in the oocyte may also contribute.</p><p>Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matoba et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matoba et al., 2022</xref>), later development of offspring generated from oocytes lacking EED was characterised by developmental delay of the fetus and placental hyperplasia. Placental hyperplasia results from loss of H3K27me3 imprinting in SCNT and from maternal deletion of <italic>Eed</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matoba et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matoba et al., 2022</xref>), demonstrating a common impact on placental development in both models. Moreover, comparison of our data with SCNT offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matoba et al., 2018</xref>) indicated that fetal growth restriction and subsequent fetal growth recovery occur in <italic>Eed-</italic>null oocyte and SCNT-derived offspring, and that this phenotype was resolved during pregnancy. While both models involve loss of H3K27me3-dependent imprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Inoue et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xie et al., 2022</xref>), the HET-hom offspring in this study were derived from oocytes that lacked maternal <italic>Eed/</italic>EED (RNA or protein) and SCNT embryos were derived from wild-type enucleated oocytes that presumably contained maternal PRC2. Therefore, while the lack of maternal EED could explain the lower number of cells observed in <italic>Eed</italic> HET-hom preimplantation offspring, this is less likely in SCNT embryos. However, early development of SCNT embryos is restricted by the low efficiency of oocyte-driven reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matoba et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2013</xref>), and comparison of the earliest stages of development between these models is challenging. Despite this, growth and developmental delay appear to be resolved late in gestation in both models without correction of H3K27me3-imprinting, indicating a level of plasticity that permits delivery of fully grown pups. Even though prolonged gestation decreased pup survival in the <italic>Eed</italic> model, an interesting conjecture may be that an unknown sensing mechanism in these growth-restricted pregnancies supports adaptation(s) that lead to late fetal growth and extended gestation, favouring the delivery of viable pups. While speculative, such a mechanism could involve epigenetic adaptation during early or late development and/or altered epigenetic control of imprinted or non-imprinted genes in the placenta and/or fetus.</p><p>Placental hyperplasia in HET-hom offspring was characterised by an increased number of glycogen-enriched cells and increased junctional zone and decidua area occupied by glycogen-enriched cells and non-glycogen cells. While increased size was observed particularly in the fetally-derived junctional zone, the maternal side of the placenta also became larger, perhaps facilitating overall tissue balance in the placenta in response to the hyperplastic junctional zone. The number of glycogen-enriched trophoblasts usually peaks at E16.5 and declines by approximately 60% by E18.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tunster et al., 2020</xref>), potentially releasing glycogen stores to the mother and/or fetus. Consistent with this, fetal blood glucose levels increased between E17.5 and E18.5 in WT-wt, WT-het, and HET-het control offspring. However, despite the increased numbers of glycogen-enriched cells in HET-hom placentas, fetal blood glucose levels did not significantly increase in HET-hom offspring. Moreover, the decreased fetal/placental weight ratio observed in HET-hom offspring suggested decreased placental efficiency and we did not observe any increase in labyrinth area, or the fetal labyrinth/placenta or capillary/labyrinth ratios, suggesting that the area devoted to maternal-fetal nutrient exchange was not substantially affected. Consistent with this, we found no change in levels of fetal blood amino acids or other metabolites, also suggesting that placental function was not obviously enhanced. Together, increased maternal-fetal placental exchange, glucose, or amino acid supply seem unlikely to explain the ability of substantially growth-restricted HET-hom offspring to attain normal weight by birth, indicating that unknown mechanism(s) contribute.</p><p>In addition to facilitating increased glucose release and fetal growth, glycogen-producing trophoblasts are considered to inhibit the release of placental factors such as oxytocin and prolactins, which prepare the pregnancy for parturition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, one possibility may be that the increased glycogen cell number in late-gestation HET-hom placentas inhibits the release of oxytocin, prolactins, or other hormones, causing the delay in parturition observed in 60% of the pregnancies from <italic>Eed-</italic>hom oocytes. Moreover, while extended gestation may also allow additional time for growth delay to resolve, HET-hom pup mortality increased in pregnancies extended by one or two days, indicating that there is a substantial cost for lengthening pregnancy in this model.</p><p>As well as morphological alterations observed in HET-hom placentas, we found extensive transcriptional dysregulation with 2083 DEGs identified between HET-hom and HET-het placentas. Consistent with the increased size of fetal and maternal tissues in HET-hom placentas, comparison of these DEGs with single-cell data from E14.5 normal placentas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2018</xref>) indicated that altered gene expression was not restricted to genes normally expressed in a single region of the HET-hom placenta, but affected fetal and maternal layers. While one might expect oocyte-specific loss of EED to affect only fetally-derived placental tissue, this ignores the possibility that increased size of the maternal tissue may occur in response to hyperplasia in the fetally-derived layers. Indeed, it seems plausible that the placenta may not properly support late fetal growth without remodelling maternally-derived placental tissue and inducing associated transcriptional change.</p><p>Another study demonstrated that loss of H3K27me3 imprinting of <italic>Xist</italic> contributes to the fetal developmental delay and male-biased fetal death of offspring derived from <italic>Eed</italic>-null oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matoba et al., 2022</xref>). Oocyte-specific deletion of both <italic>Xist</italic> and <italic>Eed</italic> increased survival from approximately 3–6 pups/litter, but a significant deficit in litter size remained compared to the average of ~8.5 pups in wild-type control litters. Moreover, while <italic>Xist/Eed</italic> maternal double deletion improved fetal body weight, it remained marginally, but significantly lower than wild-type control. Therefore, while deletion of maternal <italic>Xist</italic> rescued male-biased fetal death observed as a result of <italic>Eed</italic> deletion in oocytes, it did not completely restore offspring growth or survival, demonstrating that other mechanisms contribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matoba et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, the fetal growth recovery of HET-hom offspring described in our study cannot be explained by loss of <italic>Xist</italic>, indicating that the mechanism involved in the late gestational resolution of HET-hom fetal growth and development remains unresolved.</p><p>The DEGs identified in HET-hom hyperplastic placentas included increased expression of H3K27me3 imprinted genes <italic>Slc38a4, Sfmbt2, Gab1, and Smoc1,</italic> nine classically imprinted genes, X-linked genes including <italic>Plac1</italic>, <italic>Wdr1,</italic> and <italic>Ldoc1</italic> and many bi-allelically expressed autosomal genes. Consistent with increased <italic>Plac1</italic> transcription<italic>,</italic> immunohistochemistry confirmed that PLAC1 expression was increased in junctional zone cells in HET-hom placentas. However, rather than increased expression, deletion of <italic>Plac1</italic> has been associated with male-biased lethality and a similar placental phenotype to that observed in HET-hom offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jackman et al., 2012</xref>). Notwithstanding this difference, it seems likely that placental hyperplasia in HET-hom offspring could involve <italic>Plac1</italic>, <italic>Wdr1, Ldoc1,</italic> and/or autosomal genes<italic>,</italic> perhaps in conjunction with <italic>Slc38a4</italic> or <italic>Sfmbt2/C2MC</italic>, which clearly contribute to placental hyperplasia caused by loss of EED in the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matoba et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of HET-hom with HET-het placentas using RRBS identified 81 DMRs, including H3K27me3 imprinted loci <italic>Sfmbt2/C2MC</italic> and <italic>Mbnl2</italic>, five classically imprinted loci and 74 non-imprinted loci, indicating that loss of EED in oocytes affects epigenetic status at both imprinted and non-imprinted genes. However, while HET-hom and HET-het offspring are isogenic and these data demonstrate that DNA methylation changes occur in the placenta as a result of deletion of <italic>Eed</italic> in oocytes, it is unclear that this is a direct effect. Moreover, as we observed 27 DMRs between HET-het and WT-wt placentas heterozygosity for <italic>Eed</italic> may also contribute, although only four differentially expressed genes, including <italic>Eed,</italic> were identified in the same comparison. This supports the idea that perturbation of H3K27me3 in the oocyte leads to altered DNA methylation and transcription of imprinted and non-imprinted genes that are influential in placental function and embryo growth. However, further work is required to determine the extent to which epigenetic changes in the oocyte directly affect embryo and placental development in offspring.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that loss of PRC2 function in the oocyte results initially in embryonic developmental delay and fetal growth restriction, followed by placental hyperplasia and late fetal growth that results in normalisation of offspring weight at birth and perinatal overgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Moreover, it appears that offspring derived from either <italic>Eed</italic>-null oocytes or by SCNT have an innate ability to correct fetal growth restriction during the late stages of pregnancy despite maternally inherited impacts mediated by <italic>Xist</italic> or H3K27me3-dependent imprinting. In offspring from <italic>Eed</italic>-null oocytes normalisation of fetal growth occurs despite low placental efficiency and in the absence of enhanced glucose, amino acid, and metabolite levels, indicating that unknown mechanisms contribute. Together, this work reveals that altered PRC2-dependent programming in the oocyte elicits a complex intrauterine response that supports compensatory fetal growth despite apparently negative impacts on placental development and function. As fetal growth restriction and fetal catch-up growth have been linked with negative health outcomes later in life, including metabolic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singhal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Singhal and Lucas, 2004</xref>), this model may provide opportunities for understanding the physiological basis of such outcomes.

Deletion of <italic>Eed</italic> in oocyte results in loss of maternal H3K27me3 and PRC2, early growth restriction, followed by placental hyperplasia and late gestation fetal catch-up growth, outcomes consistent with loss of H3K27me3-dependent imprinting observed in SCNT offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matoba et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inoue et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2020</xref>).

Adaptor and low-quality sequences in raw sequencing reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>) (v0.39) with the following parameters: LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:20. Clean reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome (GRCm38) using STAR (v2.7.5c) with the following settings: outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.03 <monospace>--alignIntronMax</monospace> 10000. Raw counts for mouse reference genes (ensembl-release-101) were calculated using STAR (v2.7.5c) with parameter ‘--quantMode GeneCounts’ simultaneously when doing the genome mapping. Differential gene expression analysis was carried out using the R package ‘limma’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>) with ‘treat’ function and parameter ‘lfc = log(1.1).’ Statistically significantly differentially expressed genes were identified using ‘FDR &lt;0.05.’ Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for significantly differentially expressed genes was carried out using The Database for Annotation, Visualisation, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) with the following settings: GO term level 3, minimum gene count 5, and FDR &lt;0.05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dennis et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Placental reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS)</title><p>5 WT-wt, 5 HET-het, and 6 HET-hom placentas from female E17.5 mice were chosen for RRBS. DNA was extracted from a quarter of each placenta with a Qiagen DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit and eluted in AE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 mM EDTA). 4–13 μg of DNA was sent to CD Genomics (NY, USA) and underwent sodium bisulphite conversion, library preparation, and Illumina PE150 sequencing at 10 Gb raw data per sample. Sequence analyses were performed on the Galaxy Australia Bioinformatics Platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://usegalaxy.org.au/">https://usegalaxy.org.au/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afgan et al., 2022</xref>). Sequence files were aligned to the GRC39 (mm39) mouse genome with BWA-meth. Per-base CpG methylation metrics were extracted with MethylDackel with the output limited to CpG sites with a minimum of five reads coverage with output presented as CpG methylation fractions. Differentially methylated CpG-rich regions (DMRs) between the groups were identified with Metilene with settings of a minimum of 10 CpGs per DMR and a minimum of 10% methylation difference between groups. Statistically significant DMRs which were below the threshold of Bonferroni adjusted p-value of q&lt;0.05 were examined further. DMR regions were visualised and nearby genes and orthologous genome regions identified with the UCSC Genome Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/">https://genome.ucsc.edu/</ext-link> with Table Browser and LiftOver tools) or Ensemble Biomart (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://asia.ensembl.org/info/data/biomart/index.html">https://asia.ensembl.org/info/data/biomart/index.html</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Metabolomics</title><p>E17.5 fetuses were isolated from pregnant females and decapitated on ice. ~50 ul of blood was collected from each fetus using a pipette and transferred into tubes containing 2 ul 0.5 M EDTA. collected by centrifugation and frozen at –80 C before metabolic analysis. Cardiac blood and serum samples were also collected from the mothers of each litter using the same approach. In addition, a spot of blood collected in the same way from each fetus and mother was directly applied to an Accu-Check Blood Glucose Test Strips and glucose concentration quantified using an Accu-Check Monitor. Mass spectrometry was performed on 10 ul of serum by Metabolomics Australia and included targeted profiling of 356 metabolites using the Shimadzu GCMS 8050 system. 1 ul of each sample was injected and analysed using internal standards <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>, <sup>15</sup>N<sub>1</sub> Valine, and <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub> Sorbitol. 85 samples and 19 pooled blood quality controls (PBQCs) were analysed, with PBQCs used to ensure technical consistency of the instrument and sample quantifications. Samples were analysed in randomised order, with a PBQC run after every five samples. 160 metabolites were detected with 85% resulting in a coefficient of variation of &lt;30%. Data was analysed using Metaboanalyst 5.0 to assess data quality and multivariate analyses were used to generate principal component analyses, heatmap, and volcano plots. Statistical differences between samples were assessed using an FDR &lt;0.05 to ensure differences detected with 95% confidence after multiple comparisons correction.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal work was undertaken in accordance with Monash University Animal Ethics Committee (AEC) approvals issued by Monash University and Hudson Institute Animal Ethics Committees (AEC), approval numbers MMCB/2018/16 and MMCB/2020/37.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of genomic and metabolomic data collected from offspring generated from Eed wild-type (<italic>Eed</italic>-wt), Eed heterozygous (<italic>Eed</italic>-het), and Eed homozygous (<italic>Eed</italic>-hom) oocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Eed</italic> Placenta differentially expressed genes (DEGs) - List of significant <italic>Eed</italic> female Placenta DEGs (HET-hom vs HET-het; false discovery rate, FDR &lt;0.05; 2083 DEGs) (<bold>B</bold>) Differential Gene Expression Analysis Male HET<italic>-</italic>hom Placenta vs HET-het Placenta (No FDR; p&lt;0.05) (<bold>C</bold>) Differential Gene Expression Analysis Female HET-hom vs HET-het Placenta (No FDR; p&lt;0.05) (<bold>D</bold>) Genes Commonly Differentially Expressed in Male and Female HET-hom vs HET-het Placenta (No FDR; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) (<bold>E</bold>) <italic>Eed</italic> Placenta DEGs vs E14.5 single-cell RNA-seq: Comparison of <italic>Eed</italic> Placenta DEGs list with published single-cell RNA-seq data from E14.5 C57BL/6 placentas (<bold>F</bold>) <italic>Eed</italic> Placenta DEGs vs Imprinted genes: Comparison of <italic>Eed</italic> Placenta DEGs vs Mouse Imprinted genes (<bold>G</bold>) <italic>Eed</italic> Placenta DEG relative enrichment per chromosome (<bold>H</bold>) <italic>Eed</italic> Placental DMRs HET-het vs HET-hom: List of significant <italic>Eed</italic> female placenta differentially methylated regions (FDR/q&lt;0.05).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Marika Charalambous (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>The three reviewers recognized the merit of the work and its potential for reconciling previously conflicting results about the role of maternally inherited H3K27me3 on a growth trajectory. However, they also shared strong concerns about the interpretation of the data and in particular, the existence of a placenta-dependent catch-up phase. Additionally, it was not formally demonstrated that H3K27me3 patterns are altered in the placenta of embryos derived from EED-null oocytes, making it difficult to understand direct and indirect gene expression changes.</p><p>Please find below four points that require necessary revision. In addition, answer the individual comments of the reviewers in a detailed rebuttal letter and tone down or revise conclusions in your text accordingly.</p><p>1. Provide a more in-depth characterization of the placenta phenotype. Please first revise placental efficiency measurements as stated by Reviewer #3. Then, are there some sex-specific differences in placental alterations (considering that the placental transcriptome is differentially affected in males and females from EedKO oocytes)? Is the effect limited to the junctional zone only, and in particular to glycogen cells? The increase in the endocrine compartment may have been emphasized by the chosen methodology. Improved calculation of the different layers, within the same gestational age (E17.5) is required.</p><p>2. Whether the catch-up phase may be due to placental compensation prior to birth requires better support, especially in face of the increased gestational length and different post-coitum days of birth between mutants and WT. So far, enhanced growth is reported to happen between E17.5 and P3. The catch-up phase may equally happen prior to birth, in link with a potential placental role, or after birth, in relation to increased feeding, for example. It is really necessary to document when the catch-up phase occurs relative to birth. A measure at E19.5 was done but is only presented in Sup material: there, there is no difference between WT and mutants, which would suggest that extended gestation itself may lead to overgrowth. Please be clearer and report data in post-coitum days rather than postnatal days for WT and mutants, and add additional time points if necessary. Also, there seems to be no former evidence that placentomegaly can enhance fetal growth, and there could equally be an intrinsic fetal contribution to the phenotype.</p><p>3. Provide more clarity in the methods section, as descriptions are currently too limited to allow a proper understanding of the work carried out.</p><p>4. To claim potential epigenetic programming of placental phenotype and gene expression via Polycomb-dependent mechanisms, H3K27me3 mapping (ChIP-seq or CUT&amp;RUN) would be required. This should be performed on placental samples at the stage when RNA-seq was done. Correlation analyses between gene expression and H3K27me3 changes (if any) are needed. It would be also interesting to compare with H3K27me3 patterns present in the oocyte (for which ChIP-seq data are publicly available).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this current version, the weaknesses of the paper far outweigh the strengths. I believe further investigations are needed to improve the manuscript, in particular by validating several of the claims and conclusions. Accordingly, the authors are encouraged to consider the following (please see the justification for most of these under 'specific points'):</p><p>a) Provide a more in-depth characterization of the placenta hyperplasia phenotype to answer unequivocally the following questions:</p><p>- Is the surface area for nutrient transport increased in hom mutants vs het mutants? Suggested type of experiments – stereological measurements of the labyrinthine layer looking at fetal capillaries, maternal blood spaces, trophoblast area, and interhemal membrane thickness (a thinner membrane might indicate increased diffusion of nutrients). (Note: The need for these experiments depends on the outcome of other preliminary measurements such as volume calculations as suggested in specific points)</p><p>- Is transplacental flux increased in the hyperplastic placentas? This can be done by placental transfer assays with radiolabelled isotopes (glucose; amino acids – e.g. MeAIB; markers of diffusion such as mannitol injected to the maternal tail vein). Measuring amino-acid concentrations in fetal plasma and fetal/maternal glucose gradients would also help to provide evidence that the placenta expansion is indeed responsible for fetal catch-up growth.</p><p>- Is the junctional zone hyperplasia restricted to glycogen cells? Measuring the area occupied by spongiotrophoblasts would answer this question and add value to the paper.</p><p>- Is there evidence for sexual dimorphism related to the placenta hyperplasia phenotype? The authors did a transcriptomic analysis on male and female placentas and found very few changes in male placentas but widespread alterations in female placentas. It will be important to show that male and female placentas are hyperplastic to the same degree, so providing weights and crude histology for male vs female placentas is suggested.</p><p>- Do hyperplastic placentas show dysregulated epigenetic marking? Given that the gist of the paper is to show oocyte epigenetic programming impacting placental development, it would be important to show if there is an association with altered epigenetic marking, H3K27me3/DNA methylation (e.g. global levels, or on target genes thought to cause hyperplasia)</p><p>b) Provide alternative explanations and increase critical appraisal of data</p><p>- Why is the impact of oocyte epigenetic programming on fetal organs dismissed? It is possible that fetal organs become hyperplasic after the placenta at E17.5 and that epigenetic de-regulation also affects fetal organs? In that regard, is there evidence for disproportionate organ growth at P0 and P3?</p><p>- Could fetal and postnatal overgrowth be a secondary outcome of the increased gestational length, and therefore unrelated to placental hyperplasia and hypothetical increase in nutrient supply? It would help to show the fetal and placental weights, as well as P0 body weights, of the litters with normal gestational length vs +1 day, +2 days. If the effect on fetal catch-up growth is driven by placental hyperplasia it might be expected that offspring with normal gestational length are indistinguishable in weight from those with increased gestation length. A stratification of the weight data by gestational length and sex would clarify some of these issues.</p><p>Specific points</p><p>Data presented in Figure 4B-E shows that the junctional zone (Jz) is disproportionately bigger at E17.5 in Homozygous mutants in relation to the labyrinth (Lz) and maternal decidua, compared to control genotypes. Figure Supp Figure 3G suggests that the labyrinth may also show evidence of hyperplasia when comparing het vs hom as Lz raw area is increased but this is not the case when compared to wt (wt-het) controls. Therefore, the question of whether the phenotype is restricted to the Jz, and the glycogen cells, in particular, remains unresolved and requires more in-depth investigations by calculating volumes of the different layers, adding Jz to Lz ratios as graphs, and depending on the results then proceed with further stereological measurements within the Lz to confirm hyperplasia of this layer.</p><p>Please explain why only two groups were compared for the data that generated Figure 1B-F, why 3 groups were used in Figure 1G, and then for most of the remaining figures comparisons with 4 groups were made.</p><p>Figure 1A (bottom panel F1) – where is the evidence that WT-wt and WT-het are epigenetically different? Moreover, this study does not directly show that HET-het and HET-hom are epigenetically different, and as such a reference to those studies should be provided next to 'epigenetically different' text in panels.</p><p>Figure 1C- The variability of the data is quite considerable (4- 5 fold) but yet the error bars are rather small for those to represent SD. Could a mistake have been made and these represent SEM instead? If yes, please check carefully all other figures and figure legends. In general, it is good practice that the primary data for each figure panel, when appropriate, is provided as supplementary data.</p><p>Figure 3 (g-i) – the graph shows placental to fetal weight ratios, which does not match the text on the Y axis (i.e. body weight/placental weight). Most importantly, the graph should show fetal to placenta (F/P) ratios (and not P/F as shown)</p><p>Figure 4G – It is important to establish the extent to which the defect is limited to glycogen cells, i.e. are the number or area occupied by spongiotrophoblasts also affected (this can be done with staining for Tpbpa)? A new graph with this information should be added to this figure.</p><p>Figure 5 – I find these calculations (D-I) potentially misleading as these only contain a subset of all the potential E17.5 DEGs. I am of the opinion that this data does not merit being in the main figure and should be interpreted with caution. Instead in the main figure, it is more important to present the top DEG genes and validations by QPCR in independent samples of those and the key genes that are thought to contribute to hyperplasia. Epigenetic analysis for these selected genes, could/should be added to improve the paper in line with providing further novelty.</p><p>Line 116 – specify the blastocyst stage: all hatched blastocysts?</p><p>Line 125 – Measuring cell proliferation would confirm the findings and add value to the paper,</p><p>Line 131 – how does Figure 1D relate to Figure 1G? i.e. this is confusing – in vitro data suggests loss of blastocyst numbers but there is no difference in the number of implantation sites in vivo. please clarify in the main text.</p><p>Line 148 – please rephrase, it gives the impression that extra-embryonic tissues are lighter, but these were not measured in isolation.</p><p>Line 166 (and throughout the text) – placental efficiency is not enhanced but instead decreased. The definition of placental efficiency is 'gram of fetus produced by gram of placenta' – if Hom placentas are overgrown from E14.5 onwards and fetuses growth restricted at least until E17.5, how can this be evidence of increased placenta efficiency if fewer grams of fetus are being produced per gram of placenta?</p><p>The authors would also require a later time point between E17.5 and E19.5 if they want to validate any transient rise in placental 'efficiency' – that data is missing in the current version. In any case, it seems clear to me that placentae up to and including E17.5 are not more efficient.</p><p>Lines 189-190 – How prevalent are the spongiotrophoblast abnormal 'projections' compared to controls? Also, Figure 3J seems redundant with Figure 4A. What is the added value of 3J?</p><p>Line 198 – specify if these are midline sections (this could be in Materials and methods).</p><p>Line 207 – Where is the evidence that the overall cross-sectional area of the Labyrinth in hom-placentas is higher compared to other genotypes? At E14.5 that is not the case and at E17.5 it does not seem to be different from WTs (wt and het; as shown in Supp Figure 3G). Further analyses are thus required. This is an important point because if the Lz layer turns out not to be increased over wild-type there is no structural basis to substantiate the claim that the hyperplastic placentas are primary determinants of the catch-up growth (and also having in mind that there is no established role for glycogen stores in the placenta in determining fetal growth).</p><p>Line 208 – Should read Supp Figure 3 (E-H)?</p><p>Lines 217-220 – this is pure speculation, better suited for discussion and limitations of the study. There is no attempt in this paper to link the increased glycogen storage with glucose handling and altered metabolic profile.</p><p>Line 227 – please provide an estimate of 'total' neonatal lethality (i.e. including gestation lengths of +1 day, + 2 days, + normal length).</p><p>Lines 240-141 – I can't follow the rationale for this. Are male placentas hyperplastic to the same extent as females? One possibility to explain the lack of transcriptomic changes is that they are not? Why not perform QPCR in a number of male placentas for those genes thought to contribute to the hyperplasic phenotype (e.g. Slc38a4, Peg 3, Sfmbt2, etc) to help rule out the issues that were raised?</p><p>Lines 271-273 – as stated before, this comparison is an indirect one and only holds strictly true if comparing layers within the same gestational age at E17.5 (not against E14.5).</p><p>Lines 281-282 and Supp table 2 – please also provide the number of 'robust' imprinting, i.e. those genes that have been unequivocally shown to be imprinted, and highlight those in Supp table 2. References should also be provided in Supp Table 2. so that the reader can check for the imprinting status of the genes. For example, Slc38a1 is annotated as an imprinted gene – where is the evidence for this and is it strong enough to be credible?</p><p>Line 850 (RE: legend to Figure 1e) – please specify the stage of the embryos.</p><p>Line 859 (RE: legend to Figure 2a)- how many embryos were analysed?</p><p>Figure 6B, C and Supp Figure 5 – please add statistical indicators of variability to graphs</p><p>Supp Figure 2D – can't find an entry for this figure in the main text?</p><p>Materials and methods</p><p>The description of the methods is not detailed enough, e.g.:</p><p>Cell allocation experiments – how was the counting/i.e.segmentation of the cells done?; please provide further details on the Propidium Iodide procedure including how the staining leaves the ICM unlabelled – is this related to the timing of staining?</p><p>Placental histology and area/proportion measurements of layers – how many cross-sections were analysed per placenta? Were these midline? Did they represent different locations within the placenta?</p><p>What is meant by raw area? Would the total area be a better description? How was the 'raw' area calculated, for example in the cases where there are significant spongiotrophoblast projections into the labyrinth?</p><p>Weight measurements – please specify that these correspond to wet weights in material and methods; Use more specific terminology throughout the manuscript – consider replacing 'offspring weight' or 'body weight' with 'fetal weight' where appropriate.</p><p>Typos – should read labyrinth instead of Labryinth (Figure 4D); epigenetically instead of epigentically (Figure 1A).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall this is a thorough assessment of the fetal growth and placental characteristics of this highly novel model in which the role of Eed in the oocyte is experimentally distinguished. The experimental plan is highly innovative and clever. Considerable new information is presented. My main concern is the interpretation of the data presented. The authors strongly conclude that this is a model of late fetal growth catch-up driven by placental hyperplasia. While this may be the case, for the reasons given, there are other interpretations. For example, a different interpretation is that the observed placental changes prolong gestation allowing for longer development in utero.</p><p>Line 69 &quot;several genes&quot;. Could the authors name the relevant genes?</p><p>Line 71 &quot;We proposed that loss of EED in the oocyte sets up a developmental trajectory that involves initial fetal growth restriction that is resolved by placentally driven catch-up growth&quot;, &quot;proposed&quot; suggests that the authors have previously made this hypothesis but there is no reference. More importantly, fetal growth is intrinsically determined. This means that the fetus has the genetic potential to reach a certain size. Fetuses that do not reach their genetic potential are considered extrinsically growth restricted. This may be due to placental insufficiency or reduced maternal nutrient availability ie catch-up growth cannot be &quot;placentally-driven&quot;. Rather, the placenta is able to support the catch-up growth of the fetus.</p><p>Line 162 &quot;they underwent rapid catch-up growth between E17.5 and birth and were overgrown by P3&quot; P0 is the day of birth – were the pups fed or unfed when weighed? If possible, it might be worth separating fed and unfed to ask whether there is a difference in their relative weights ie is catch-up postnatal due to feeding or prenatal due to increased placental capacity late in gestation? The numbers may not be sufficient or fed status may not be available but it is important to make this distinction given the authors' conclusion that catch-up is all about the placenta. As mentioned later in the Results section, gestation is longer which could also account for the &quot;catch-up&quot;.</p><p>Line 165 &quot;and enhanced placental efficiency&quot;.</p><p>Without knowing precisely when catch-up occurred and without any functional data, it is not possible to conclude that there is &quot;enhanced placental efficiency&quot;. Please remove or rephrase.</p><p>Line 183 &quot;To further investigate the relationship between placental function&quot;.</p><p>The authors are not experimentally determining function. Please rephrase.</p><p>Line 184 &quot;placental weight ratio, which is indicative of placental efficiency (30)&quot;.</p><p>Although the term &quot;placental efficiency&quot; is used in the literature, it is not really meaningful. There are plenty of examples where the placenta is overgrown but fetal growth is still restricted – for example when the placenta is overgrowth but disorganised or where placental overgrowth is sequestering nutrients. The authors should refer only to the F:P ratios in their Results section and then discuss the possibility of increased placental efficiency underlying their observed catch-up growth. As previously stated, without weight data from either very late in gestation or from unfed pups, it is not possible to conclude the catch-up is due to the placental changes.</p><p>Line 199 &quot;19% increase in HET-hom placental area'.</p><p>Be clear here what is meant by &quot;placental area&quot;. Midline section of the whole placenta?</p><p>Line 217 &quot;As placental glycogen is converted to glucose to support fetal growth, the increased glycogen cell number in HET-hom placentas is consistent with a greater glucose requirement in the late gestational fetal catch-up growth observed in the HET-hom offspring.&quot;</p><p>Although it seems intuitive that placental glycogen is used to support fetal growth, this has not been demonstrated experimentally in any study. It is possible these stores are for the dam in support of parturition or possibly to support placental hormone production. This sentence should be rephrased. In addition, the Results section should report results rather than inferring what the results might mean.</p><p>Line 223 &quot;Consistent with this and the greater numbers of glycogen enriched cells in HET-hom placentas, gestational length was extended by 1 day&quot;.</p><p>Why &quot;consistent with&quot;? ie why would &quot;supporting support the production of hormones that promote parturition&quot; result in a longer gestation? It has been shown that an expanded junctional zone is associated with a longer gestation but not that the presumed increase in placental hormones prolongs gestation.</p><p>Line 223 &quot;gestational length was extended by 1 day&quot;.</p><p>Could the weight gain reported at P0 simply reflect the fact that gestation is longer in the HET-hom model?</p><p>Line 229 and elsewhere &quot;fetal catch-up growth&quot;.</p><p>The authors need to be cautious in concluding that there is fetal catch-up growth as this has not been demonstrated.</p><p>Line 235 &quot;we analysed male and female placental tissue from HET-hom, HET-het and WT-wt offspring&quot; and &quot;Surprisingly&quot;.</p><p>The authors should be commended for recognising sexual dimorphism in the placenta. Were any differences in placental regions or fetal/placental weights detected between males and females at any stage? The absence of substantial differences in gene expression would only be surprising if the authors show a similar placental HET-hom phenotype for males and females</p><p>Line 271 &quot;Of the Eed junctional zone DEGs the majority (86.1%) were upregulated, whereas a large proportion of Eed labyrinth DEGs and Eed decidua DEGs were downregulated&quot;</p><p>As the placental phenotype involves an expansion of the junctional zone, it is to be expected that Jz-expressed genes will be expressed at overall higher levels and Lz at lower levels simply as a consequence of the relative changes in the number of cells expressing these genes ie there is no &quot;upregulation&quot; or &quot;down-regulation&quot;. Please rephrase. The authors do acknowledge that the gene changes are consistent with the relative changes in the proportion of these regions in their last sentence but it is still important to avoid active terms such as upregulation/downregulation.</p><p>Line 292 &quot;nine were commonly dysregulated.</p><p>Do the authors mean that the direction of aberrant expression was the same? i.e. expressed at higher levels in both scenarios?</p><p>Line 300 &quot;dysregulation detected in Eed HET-hom placenta.</p><p>Rephrase as &quot;some of the gene expression differences detected in female Eed HET-hom placenta.</p><p>Line 308 &quot;similar placental phenotypes&quot;.</p><p>Loss of expression of Plac1 results in Jz overgrowth. Both overexpression and loss of expression of Ascl2 result in a decreased Jz. The term &quot;similar phenotypes&quot; should be removed here and instead simply state that a number of imprinted genes have been genetically demonstrated to regulate Jz development.</p><p>Line 322 &quot;and inter-related fetal and placental growth trajectories</p><p>Inter-related – what is implied by this term?</p><p>Line 332 &quot;indicating a role for the placenta in responding to fetal growth restriction to drive offspring catch-up growth prior to birth&quot;.</p><p>This cannot be concluded from the data presented. The authors have not shown that the placenta is responding. Critically, the authors have not definitively shown catch-up prior to birth.</p><p>Line 333 &quot;placental efficiency increased late in gestation.</p><p>F:P ratio is not a true indicator of placental efficiency. If the authors were to show fetal growth catch-up in utero, the change in F;P ratio would be &quot;consistent with&quot; increased placental efficiency.</p><p>Line 338 &quot;growth restriction can be corrected by placental expansion at later stages&quot;.</p><p>It may be true that fetal growth restriction as a consequence of placental insufficiency can be corrected by placental expansion but there are plenty of examples where the opposite is true ie overgrowth of the placenta alongside fetal growth restriction.</p><p>Line 373 &quot;this was resolved by birth&quot;.</p><p>Again, not quite demonstrated by the data presented particularly given the increased length of gestation.</p><p>Line 394 &quot;the maternal side of the placenta also expands to accommodate greater placental function&quot;.</p><p>Again, not experimentally demonstrated. It may be the case that changes in the trophoblast lineages/placental hormone production drive increased decidualisation – not quite the same thing.</p><p>Line 400 &quot;sustained high levels of glycogen stores in the E17.5 placentas of HET-hom offspring increase glycogen release to the embryo and drive rapid growth catch-up growth.&quot;</p><p>Firstly, the authors have not measured placental glycogen stores biochemically. More importantly, the term &quot;drive&quot; is over-interpreting the data presented.</p><p>Line 413 &quot;It may be that the increased number of glycogen cells remaining in the late-gestation HET-hom placenta delays late gestational hormonal release from the placenta and prolongs pregnancy. Consistent with this, extended gestational length occurred in about two-thirds of the pregnancies from Eed-hom oocytes.&quot;</p><p>Here the authors are retrofitting their data. It may be the case that prolonged gestation might be explained by delays in hormone release but how the increased number of glycogen cells would lead to such a result is not clear at all.</p><p>Line 416 &quot;with no apparent birthing difficulties for the mothers&quot;.</p><p>Did the authors observe or video the births? If not, they cannot conclude there were no birth difficulties. This would be possible if, for example, all the pups were observed to be viable immediately after the birth and subsequently died. Is there any data on whether the pups that died were fed or unfed?</p><p>Line 471 &quot;fetal catch-up growth&quot;.</p><p>Again, not proven.</p><p>Discussion generally</p><p>The reduced number of males is of interest. Nothing in the discussion?</p><p>Line 534 &quot;Junctional zone, labyrinth and decidual area&quot;.</p><p>Area or mid-line area? Please clarify in Materials and methods.</p><p>Line 516 Were males removed during the day – specify in Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Methods – more clarity is requested in this section, descriptions are often very brief.</p><p>1) Placental CSA and cell proportions – how were the sections chosen or was the placental half exhaustively sectioned and then cell counts performed? The proportions of cells in the lateral part of the placenta are different from those at the midline – authors should describe their method in more detail including the location of sections chosen. How was GlyT cell number estimated and what are the units?</p><p>2) Presentation of the placental proportion data – there is clearly an expansion of all of the placental zones, but a proportionate increase in the JZ. In terms of the interpretation of the data, this is important. Because the LZ is increased in size then there is an increased exchange volume between mother and offspring. Can the JZ expansion be accounted for by the increase in GlyT cells alone?</p><p>3) How are cells in placental zones deduced from sc-RNAseq data – this section needs more detail.</p><p>4) RNAseq – how was the list of imprinted genes derived (there seems like a lot)? Is there functional enrichment for imprinted genes in their DEG list?</p><p>5) How was cell viability performed in the live tracking experiment (Figure 1D)?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Fetal growth delay caused by loss of non-canonical imprinting is resolved late in pregnancy and culminates in offspring overgrowth&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Adèle Marston (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues raised by reviewer 2 that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>In particular, the point about normalization of fetal growth in mutants being a consequence of longer gestation period or the proposed intra-uterine catch-up growth has not been adequately addressed.

There are considerable differences in gene expression between EED-mutant and control placentas. This would be expected since the cell proportions are very different. The transcriptional data does not provide much additional explanatory power, at least as currently presented.</p><p>3) Offspring undergo accelerated development and growth in late gestation.</p><p>Evidence for this claim is incomplete. I remain unconvinced that the normalisation in size between Het-hom and control offspring on the day of birth does not reflect a difference in the length of gestation. All embryo weights up to e18.5 show growth restriction in the mutants (Figure 2B-F). It is only in post-natal animals that normalisation is observed.</p><p>As far as I can tell from the methods, the estimation of gestation length is based on the observation of a copulation plug on the morning following a mating. It is not clear if animals were separated in between mating days and what time they were set up. In addition, the time of birth was not recorded. Therefore, gestational length could reflect an interval of up to 24 hours. This is unlikely since mice usually mate at the beginning of the dark cycle and give birth at the end of it. However, without monitoring the time of birth there could be a significant delay in parturition in the mutant pregnancies that could still account for the small amount of 'growth recovery' observed in this study. Without a more thorough study of birth timing, I don't feel that the authors can hang the major conclusions of their paper on the single finding that the P0 weights are similar between genotypes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81875.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>The three reviewers recognized the merit of the work and its potential for reconciling previously conflicting results about the role of maternally inherited H3K27me3 on a growth trajectory. However, they also shared strong concerns about the interpretation of the data and in particular, the existence of a placenta-dependent catch-up phase. Additionally, it was not formally demonstrated that H3K27me3 patterns are altered in the placenta of embryos derived from EED-null oocytes, making it difficult to understand direct and indirect gene expression changes.</p><p>Please find below four points that require necessary revision. In addition, answer the individual comments of the reviewers in a detailed rebuttal letter and tone down or revise conclusions in your text accordingly.</p><p>1. Provide a more in-depth characterization of the placenta phenotype. Please first revise placental efficiency measurements as stated by Reviewer #3. Then, are there some sex-specific differences in placental alterations (considering that the placental transcriptome is differentially affected in males and females from EedKO oocytes)? Is the effect limited to the junctional zone only, and in particular to glycogen cells? The increase in the endocrine compartment may have been emphasized by the chosen methodology. Improved calculation of the different layers, within the same gestational age (E17.5) is required.</p><p>2. Whether the catch-up phase may be due to placental compensation prior to birth requires better support, especially in face of the increased gestational length and different post-coitum days of birth between mutants and WT. So far, enhanced growth is reported to happen between E17.5 and P3. The catch-up phase may equally happen prior to birth, in link with a potential placental role, or after birth, in relation to increased feeding, for example. It is really necessary to document when the catch-up phase occurs relative to birth. A measure at E19.5 was done but is only presented in Sup material: there, there is no difference between WT and mutants, which would suggest that extended gestation itself may lead to overgrowth. Please be clearer and report data in post-coitum days rather than postnatal days for WT and mutants, and add additional time points if necessary. Also, there seems to be no former evidence that placentomegaly can enhance fetal growth, and there could equally be an intrinsic fetal contribution to the phenotype.</p><p>3. Provide more clarity in the methods section, as descriptions are currently too limited to allow a proper understanding of the work carried out.</p><p>4. To claim potential epigenetic programming of placental phenotype and gene expression via Polycomb-dependent mechanisms, H3K27me3 mapping (ChIP-seq or CUT&amp;RUN) would be required. This should be performed on placental samples at the stage when RNA-seq was done. Correlation analyses between gene expression and H3K27me3 changes (if any) are needed. It would be also interesting to compare with H3K27me3 patterns present in the oocyte (for which ChIP-seq data are publicly available).</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the Reviewer’s comments, we have significantly rewritten our manuscript and have added substantially more data to the study. These data include new analyses of glucose, amino acid and metabolite levels in fetal and maternal blood samples, more highly resolved fetal growth analyses, and a more detailed study of the hyperplastic placenta including IF analyses of labyrinth and capillary areas and ratios. We have also added analyses of placental DNA methylation state in offspring from oocytes lacking EED, which reveal a range of DNA methylation changes at imprinted and non-imprinted genes in <italic>HET-hom</italic> offspring compared to <italic>HET-het</italic> or <italic>WT-wt</italic> controls. We have also re-titled the manuscript to better reflect the findings of our revised study.</p><p>Intergenerational epigenetic inheritance in mammals remains poorly understood, particularly with respect to the contributions of histone modifications. To understand the consequences of disrupting these mechanisms, there remains a significant need for more information on the phenotypic and physiological consequences of perturbed epigenetic inheritance in pre- and post-implantation embryos and postnatal life. Our study extends understanding of intergenerational epigenetic inheritance by providing novel insights into the phenotypic and physiological consequences of failed EED-dependent programming in oocytes. This is particularly important considering that the developmental trajectory experienced by the embryo and fetus can have life-long impacts on health.</p><p>Our study was first submitted to an alternative journal in January 2022, but we were unsatisfied with the Reviewer’s comments and elected to transfer our manuscript to the open process <italic>eLife</italic> provides. During this time Matoba <italic>et al.,</italic> published a paper which demonstrated that deleting <italic>Slc38a4</italic> or <italic>C2MC,</italic> a micro-RNA cluster embedded within <italic>Sfmbt2,</italic> was able to rescue placental hyperplasia in offspring generated from oocytes lacking EED (Matoba <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022 <italic>Genes and Development</italic>). This study also revealed that deletion of both <italic>Eed</italic> and <italic>Xist</italic> in oocytes corrected male-biased lethality in <italic>HET-hom</italic> offspring, but only partially normalised litter size and offspring weight. While the outcomes reported by Matoba <italic>et al.,</italic> are highly informative, the rescue provided by maternal <italic>Xist</italic> deletion was incomplete and we hypothesise that other mechanisms must contribute to fetal growth and developmental outcomes in offspring from <italic>Eed</italic>-null oocytes<italic>.</italic></p><p>In our study we demonstrate that surviving <italic>HET-hom</italic> offspring were able to attain normal weights by birth without deletion of <italic>Xist</italic> in the oocyte or correction of H3K27me3-dependent imprinting. Remarkably, the fetal growth delay in <italic>HET-hom</italic> fetuses was resolved during pregnancy despite reduced placental efficiency, low fetal blood glucose levels and unaltered amino acid and metabolite levels. Together, our observations indicate that <italic>HET-hom</italic> offspring have an innate ability to ameliorate fetal growth delay without increased placental function and within pregnancies of normal gestational length. Moreover, our comparison of <italic>HET-hom</italic> and SCNT derived growth and placental data suggest that similar fetal growth recovery occurs in both of these models without a requirement to correct maternally inherited impacts mediated by <italic>Xist</italic> or H3K27me3-dependent imprinting.</p><p>While the reason for this growth and developmental recovery during pregnancy remains unclear, our model demonstrates that these outcomes were initiated by loss of EED in the growing oocyte or during preimplantation development, or both. Given the capacity for fetal growth restriction to be resolved in the absence of enhanced placental function, we speculate that an unknown mechanism may sense growth restricted pregnancies to support adaptation(s) that favour the delivery of fully grown pups. In addition, we show that 60% of pregnancies are extended in length and that this increased gestational time contributes to offspring overgrowth. While it is clear that loss of H3K27me3 at <italic>Slc38a4, C2MC</italic> or <italic>Xist</italic> significantly contribute to the placental phenotype, loss of male fetuses and fetal growth delay, our study demonstrates that fetal growth and development are recovered in <italic>HET-hom</italic> offspring despite loss of H3K27me3 imprinting.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues raised by reviewer 2 that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>In particular, the point about normalization of fetal growth in mutants being a consequence of longer gestation period or the proposed intra-uterine catch-up growth has not been adequately addressed. Evidence should be provided that timing of birth is identical between genotypes to make this claim. Without this, conclusions about fetal catch-up should be toned down, removed from abstract and the two hypotheses (gestational length/catch-up) would need to considered alongside in results &amp; discussion, highlighting that future studies are needed to distinguish between the two.</p><p>Please also re-write the Results section for clarity, following the suggestions of Reviewer 3 below, and move the interpretations of results to the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a new analysis to demonstrate that the weight deficit in HET-hom offspring is resolved between E14.5 and E19.5 (excluding offspring with extended gestational length). Please refer to our detailed response to Reviewer 3, comment 3. We have also responded to Reviewer 3’s request to edit the Results section.</p><p>Given that the new analysis we have provided clearly demonstrates that the weight deficit is resolved in HEThom offspring between E14.5 and E19.5, we have opted not to remove our observation that offspring fetal growth is normalised within a normal gestational length from the abstract.

We extracted SCNT offspring and placental weight data from the supplementary material of Matoba et al., 2018 (26) and compared these data with our own Wt-wt and Het-hom offspring and placental weight data for the oocyte <italic>Eed</italic>-null model described in this study. This revealed marked similarities between these models. As this is part of our analysis, we prefer to leave this in the Results section, but have now explained this experiment in more detail (please refer to our response to Reviewer 3, Minor issue 2). Lines 355-359 now read: “Given that both <italic>Eed</italic> HET-hom offspring and SCNT offspring lack H3K27me3 imprinting, we compared E14.5 and E19.5 fetal and placental weight data collected in this study with SCNT offspring data extracted from Matoba <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018 (26). This revealed very similar fetal and placental growth trajectories in the <italic>Eed</italic> HET-hom and SCNT offspring models (Figure 7).”</p><p>While lines 415-417 (now lines 417-421) could be moved to discussion, they are included in results as an example of a non-imprinted gene that may be functionally important in the placenta. We included the sentence “An interesting example is <italic>NTN1</italic> (Netrin1), which is reduced in the placentas of women with fetal growth restriction and potentially influences placental size by increasing the viability of placental microvascular endothelial cells (48, 49)” to explain why NTN DNA methylation status was highlighted in comparison to its placental expression, including reference to these data in Supplementary Table 8. We have edited this sentence and prefer to leave this as now described, though we will move the sentence to discussion if required.</p><p>To capture the context here, the text referred to on lines 414-421 now reads:</p><p>“The latter included five DMRs within or nearby eight non imprinted genes (<italic>Ntn1</italic>, <italic>Unc45b</italic>, <italic>Fam83h</italic>, <italic>Tiam1</italic>, <italic>Pcdhga1</italic>, <italic>Pcdhga5</italic>, <italic>Pcdhgb5</italic>, and <italic>Pcdhgb7</italic>) that were differentially expressed between HET-het and HET-hom placentas (Figure 6I; Supplementary File 1G). Of these, <italic>NTN1</italic> (Netrin1) is of particular interest as it is reduced in the placentas of women with fetal growth restriction and potentially influences placental size by increasing the viability of placental microvascular endothelial cells (48, 49). While <italic>Ntn1</italic> is not imprinted, it had reduced DNA methylation, consistent with its increased transcription in HET-hom compared to HET-het placentas (Supplementary File 1H).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Main points about the claims of the paper:</p><p>1) Offspring of mouse oocytes lacking EED are initially developmentally delayed and growth restricted.</p><p>Well founded and supported by the data, though this was previously established.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate Reviewers comments. While previous studies have noted developmental delay, there has been no attempt to study this in detail or to explain how overgrowth could be observed in one study (our work in Prokopuk et al., 2018) while developmental delay was observed in another (Inoue et al., 2018). In this study we have taken great care to characterise the fetal growth in the context of the placental phenotype and have provided significantly more detail than previous studies. This includes determining when growth delay is initiated in preimplantation embryos and its eventual resolution during the later stages of pregnancy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Placentas from EED-deleted oocytes are dysmorphic with increased junctional zone and glycogen cell volume.</p><p>Histologically well demonstrated, but the molecular evaluation is incomplete and muddled. There are considerable differences in gene expression between EED-mutant and control placentas. This would be expected since the cell proportions are very different. The transcriptional data does not provide much additional explanatory power, at least as currently presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that by molecular evaluation of the placenta, reviewer 2 refers to the RNA sequencing and DNA methylation analyses. In our revised manuscript, as well as the DNA methylation analysis in placenta, we added analyses of metabolic state and circulating glucose levels in fetal and maternal blood samples and a detailed analysis of placental vasculature content using IF. These additional data substantially added to our initial analyses and have a bearing on the potential worth of additional molecular analyses in HET-hom placentas.</p><p>In HET-hom offspring we found substantially larger placentas (hyperplasia) and smaller fetuses, which are indicative of lower placental function assessed by fetal / placenta weight ratio. However, we found no difference in metabolic state in the serum of fetal offspring or in their mothers, strongly suggesting that the placenta does not have a major impact on metabolic state in the blood of the fetus or the mother. Glucose levels were also similar in fetuses and mothers at E17.5, although the average level was lower at E18.5, an observation most likely explained by the delay in parturition in around 60% of litters. Together these data indicate that despite the clear placental hyperplasia, metabolic state was not altered in HET-hom offspring blood samples and it is therefore difficult to attribute changes in late mid-gestational fetal growth to altered placental function at the metabolic level.</p><p>We appreciate that the global transcriptional analyses of the placenta lack spatial power and changes in cell proportions in the placenta will also contribute to overall changes in transcription. The way to resolve this would be by single cell or spatial RNAseq. However, if we performed single cell or spatial analyses, any cell specific transcriptional changes identified must still be interpreted in the light of the metabolic analyses. Given that we did not observe changes (either up or down) in the metabolic state of <italic>HET-hom</italic> offspring or their mothers, it is difficult to see how more detailed transcriptional analyses of the placental data could then be used to explain how the developmental delay and weight deficit that was observed at E14.5 in HET-hom offspring was resolved by birth (further discussed in our response to Reviewer 3, comment 3).</p><p>Single cell and spatial analyses are very expensive and time consuming. Moreover, given our findings, such an approach would have to include detailed analyses of fetal tissues as well as the placenta as, given the placental data, the fetal growth recovery we observed is likely to have at least some origin in the fetus. This would take substantial time and resources and would be unlikely to increase our ability to explain the central outcomes in this model. We therefore consider this to be outside the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Offspring undergo accelerated development and growth in late gestation.</p><p>Evidence for this claim is incomplete. I remain unconvinced that the normalisation in size between Het-hom and control offspring on the day of birth does not reflect a difference in the length of gestation. All embryo weights up to e18.5 show growth restriction in the mutants (Figure 2B-F). It is only in post-natal animals that normalisation is observed.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data do not support the conclusion that growth normalisation was only observed in post-natal animals. The data we provided must be taken in context of the whole developmental and growth curve of these offspring, from early embryonic stages until birth. We observed very marked developmental delay and weight deficit of HET-hom offspring at E9.5, E12.5 and at E14.5 (Figure 2A-D). At E17.5 HET-hom fetuses were still underweight compared to controls (Figure 2E). However, the difference at E17.5 was reduced compared to E14.5 and, while there remained a small difference in fetal weight between HET-hom offspring and controls at E18.5 (Figure 2F), the difference was modest. Moreover, while HET-hom embryos were very obviously morphologically delayed at E9.5 (Figure 2A), E12.5 (Figure 2B) and E14.5 (Figure 2 supplement 1B), with the exception of weight, it was no longer possible to morphologically distinguish HEThom offspring at the gross morphological level at E18.5. Finally, the weight of HET-hom offspring born on E19.5 was the same as controls (Figure 2j-K).</p><p>We have now illustrated these data by providing ratios of HET-hom offspring weight vs WT-wt, WT-het and HET-het control weight at E12.5, E14.5, E17.5, E18.5 and E19.5. Importantly, E19.5 data included only litters born on E19.5. (New Figure 2L). This clearly demonstrates that compared to all control genotypes, HET-hom weight was normalised between E14.5 and E19.5.</p><p>To reflect this analysis, we have added the following text and edits to lines 184-194 of the Results section: “However, ratios of HET-hom fetal weight over WT-wt, WT-het or HET-het fetal weight at E12.5, E14.5, E17.5, E18.5 and E19.5 (excluding litters of extended gestational length) revealed that the weight deficit in HET-hom was resolved between E14.5 and birth on E19.5 (Figure 2L). Moreover, with the exception of the modest weight deficit, E18.5 HET-hom offspring were indistinguishable from controls at the gross morphological level. Together, these data demonstrate that the gross morphological delay and the fetal weight deficit in HET-hom offspring was resolved by E19.5 and that this occurred independently of litter size. In addition, by P3 HET-hom offspring were heavier than controls. As the overgrown HET-hom offspring in the P3 weight cohort (Figure 2H) included litters born at E19.5 E20.5 and E21.5, both post-natal offspring growth and extended gestation presumably contributed to the overgrowth phenotype.”</p><p>Our observations clearly show that the developmental delay and weight deficit are resolved in HET-hom offspring between E14.5 and birth on E19.5. Our data do not support the conclusion that resolution of developmental delay and weight deficit occurred as a result of the extended gestational length in HET-hom offspring. However, it is clear that extended gestational length contributed to the overgrowth phenotype we observed in this study, and that was observed in our previous study (Prokopuk et al., 2018).</p><p>Previous studies have not examined the apparently discordant observations that offspring from <italic>Eed</italic> null oocytes are delayed during fetal development (Inoue et al., 2018, Matoba et al., 2022), but are overgrown post-natally (Prokopuk et al., 2018). Here we now demonstrate that these observations are concordant and provide clear evidence that developmental delay and the deficit in fetal weights were resolved during gestation and that offspring are ultimately overgrown partly as a result of extended gestation.</p><p>Moreover, by discovering that deletion of <italic>Eed</italic> in oocytes results in extended gestational length in some litters we reveal a fascinating aspect of this model that had previously remained unknown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As far as I can tell from the methods, the estimation of gestation length is based on the observation of a copulation plug on the morning following a mating. It is not clear if animals were separated in between mating days and what time they were set up. In addition, the time of birth was not recorded. Therefore, gestational length could reflect an interval of up to 24 hours. This is unlikely since mice usually mate at the beginning of the dark cycle and give birth at the end of it. However, without monitoring the time of birth there could be a significant delay in parturition in the mutant pregnancies that could still account for the small amount of 'growth recovery' observed in this study. Without a more thorough study of birth timing, I don't feel that the authors can hang the major conclusions of their paper on the single finding that the P0 weights are similar between genotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed studies using standard time-mating protocol for more than 20 years and have a great deal of experience in staging in embryos and fetuses. We used the same protocol to generate the litters examined in this study and to test whether gestational length was affected in the <italic>Eed</italic> model. Our protocol included checking for copulation plugs early on the morning following mating and immediately separating all females from males when a plug was discovered. To ensure we did not miss the day of birth, all females were visually monitored for litters without disturbance twice a day – first thing in the morning and last thing in the afternoon.</p><p>We apologise for omitting the important detail that females were separated when a plug was detected in timed mates, but have now added this in Materials and methods.</p><p>The methods now read (Lines 651-656) “Mice were time mated for two-four nights, with females plug checked daily for copulation plugs. Positive plugs were noted as day E0.5 and all females for which a plug was discovered were immediately separated from the male. Gestational length was measured in days post copulation by recording the morning of a copulation plug was detected E0.5 and visually monitoring females twice daily (morning and afternoon) for births from late gestation (E18.5) until pups were delivered (E19.5E21.5, depending on oocyte genotype).”</p><p>The data produced for gestational length are very clear. Extended gestation was only detected in litters from <italic>Eed-</italic>null oocytes (i.e. HET-hom offspring). In these animals 40% of litters were born on E19.5, 30% were born on E20.5 and 30% were born on E21.5. All litters (100%) from wild type or heterozygous oocytes were born on E19.5. Moreover, given that we monitored births in the morning and evening there could be a maximum of a half day difference for the 40% of litters born on E19.5 and for most the difference is less than that.</p><p>The data we have presented for E12.5-E19.5 offspring weights, including the new analysis we provide in Figure 2L, clearly demonstrate that the weight deficit of HET-hom offspring was resolved between E14.5 and E19.5. To conclude that the HET-hom weight deficit was resolved in the very last few hours of the pregnancy is not consistent with our data, especially given that this period also involved delivery.</p><p>To our knowledge, no other study has monitored gestational length in offspring from <italic>Eed</italic>-null oocytes or in studies of H3K27me3 imprinting in SCNT offspring. Our study is the first and in doing so provides important insight into the physiological responses that may help Het-hom offspring survive.</p><p>For all genotypes (experimental and control) there is some variation in plugging time, fertilisation time and birth time in mice and all of these factors influence exact gestational length. Measuring exact fertilisation time would require IVF followed by embryos transfer, rather than natural mates. However, IVF followed by embryo transfers may also affect gestational length as the procedure, timing of implantations and number of implantations are likely to vary between recipient females. In our opinion using IVF would be inferior to using natural mating to produce offspring in this model.</p><p>The most effective way to properly observe the exact hour of birth would be to place cameras in cages. This is impractical and would be hampered by cage contents such as tissues, wood shavings, nesting material etc, which enrich the female’s birthing environment. Such an approach would require repetition of all the term deliveries performed in this study. Moreover, it would be very expensive and time consuming, questionable from practical and ethical viewpoints and is unlikely to enhance the interpretation of the data that we have already provided.</p></body></sub-article></article>
