Notch is further characterized by a twofold relationship with its Delta-Serrate (DSL) ligands, as ligands from opposing cells (<italic>trans</italic>-ligands) activate Notch, whereas ligands expressed in the same cell (<italic>cis</italic>-ligands) inhibit signaling. We show that cells without both <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans-</italic>ligands can mediate Notch-dependent developmental events during <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis, indicating ligand-independent Notch activity occurs when the receptor is free of <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>-ligands. Furthermore, <italic>cis</italic>-ligands can reduce Notch activity in endogenous and genetically induced situations of elevated <italic>trans</italic>-ligand-independent Notch signaling.

Typically, this is achieved when molecules are released from one cell and make contact with companion molecules on another cell. This triggers a chemical or biological reaction in the receiving cell.</p><p>One of the most common examples of this is the Notch pathway, which is used throughout the animal kingdom and plays an important role in helping cells and embryos to develop. The Notch protein itself is a ‘receptor’ protein that is embedded in the surface of a cell, and relays signals from outside the cell to activate certain genes inside the cell. In fruit flies, two proteins called Serrate and Delta act as ‘ligands’ for Notch—by binding to Notch, they can change how this receptor works.</p><p>If Serrate or Delta are present on the outside of one cell, they can activate Notch (and hence the Notch signaling pathway) in an adjacent cell. However, if the Serrate or Delta ligands are present on the surface of the same cell as Notch they turn the receptor off, rather than activate it. Notch can also work without being activated by Serrate or Delta, but whether the ligands can inhibit this ‘ligand-independent’ Notch activation if they are on the surface of the same cell as the Notch receptor was unknown.</p><p>Palmer et al. study Notch signaling in the fruit fly equivalent of the ovary, in cells that are naturally deficient in Serrate and from which Delta was artificially removed. The Notch protein was activated when these ligands were not present. Furthermore, the developmental processes that are activated by Notch were able to proceed as normal when triggered by ligand-independent Notch signaling. In total, Palmer et al. investigated three different types of fruit fly cell, and found that ligand-independent Notch signaling can occur in all of them.</p><p>Reintroducing Delta to the same cell as Notch turns the receptor off, suggesting that ligands on the surface of the same cell as the receptor can inhibit ligand-independent Notch activity. Many genetic diseases and cancers have been linked to Notch being activated when it should not be; therefore, understanding how Notch is controlled could help guide the development of new treatments for these conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04415.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04415.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Notch pathway</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>oogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1052333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deng</surname><given-names>Wu-Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM072562</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deng</surname><given-names>Wu-Min</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Notch ligands expressed in the same cell as the Notch receptor are crucial to prevent accidental, ligand-independent Notch activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Main text</title><p>Canonical Notch signaling begins when the Notch receptor receives a stimulus from a DSL-type ligand (Delta [Dl] or Serrate [Ser] in Drosophila) in an adjacent cell, which leads to γ-secretase-dependent cleavage of Notch, and translocation of the intracellular domain—N<sup>ICD</sup>— into the nucleus to act as a transcriptional co-activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">de Celis, 2013</xref>). Notch may also be activated in a non-canonical, DSL-ligand independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hori et al., 2012</xref>).

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> provides a brief schematic depiction of the stages of early oogenesis.) At oogenesis stage 7, Notch signaling is activated in the somatic follicle cells by a robust germline Dl upregulation, which leads to the expression of <italic>Hindsight</italic> (<italic>Hnt</italic>), downregulation of <italic>Cut</italic>, and the polyploidization of the follicle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deng et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">López-Schier and St Johnston, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sun and Deng, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). When <italic>Dl</italic> germline mutant clones were generated (i.e., <italic>trans</italic>-activation was removed), the follicle cells failed to downregulate <italic>Cut</italic> expression, which persisted past stage 7, indicative of a failure to activate Notch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Surprisingly, <italic>Dl</italic> mutant clones in the follicle cells bordering <italic>Dl</italic> mutant clones in the germline (i.e., a germline with no signaling source, herein referred to as <italic>Dl-/Dl-</italic> cells) show correct <italic>Hnt</italic> and <italic>Cut</italic> expression from stage 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).

A Notch activity reporter, Notch Responsive Element (NRE)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stempfle et al., 2010</xref>) was also upregulated in <italic>Dl-/Dl-</italic> clones as early as stage 2, and this expression persisted beyond stage 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>), suggesting that NRE-GFP is probably more sensitive to Notch activation than Hnt in follicle cells. Together, these results suggest that Notch activity occurs independently of canonical ligands when both <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans-</italic>ligands are removed, resulting in normal downstream developmental events in the follicle cells. Consistently, <italic>Dl</italic><sup><italic>RevF10</italic></sup><italic>Ser</italic><sup><italic>Rx82</italic></sup> double mutant clones in the wing and eye discs show a slight cell-autonomous upregulation of NRE-GFP in the clone center, which would only occur if <italic>cis</italic>-inhibition blocked a DSL-independent mode of Notch activity, as interior cells have no access to <italic>trans</italic>-ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>).

This is consistent with the in vivo studies indicating that ligand-independent Notch activation relies heavily on receptor trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hori et al., 2012</xref>) (<italic>Rab5</italic> p = 0.00623, <italic>hrs</italic> p = 0.0159), and our observation that Notch accumulates in <italic>Dl-/Dl-</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). A requirement for trafficking is consistent with the results of others who have demonstrated aberrant Notch activation in follicle cell mutants for trafficking components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wilkin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vaccari et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schneider et al., 2013</xref>), such as <italic>tsg101</italic> mutant clones, which show early Notch activation in the follicle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

These observations indicate that increased ligand expression in crystal cells decreases cell survival by blocking Notch ligand-independent activation, and therefore the buffering role of <italic>cis</italic>-expressed ligand can be extended to endogenous cases of DSL-independent Notch activity.</p><p>In this study, we show that cells devoid of DSL ligands activate Notch sufficiently to stimulate reporter activity, and in the ovarian follicle cells the level of activation is above the threshold required to mediate normal Notch-induced downstream developmental events. During development, this type of noncanonical Notch activity is normally prevented by <italic>cis</italic>-expressed DSL ligands in numerous tissues. <italic>Cis</italic>-inhibition can also attenuate DSL-ligand independent Notch activity both in endogenous and genetically induced situations. Mechanistically, this could be explained if DSL ligands sequestered Notch at the membrane, made Notch more sensitive to degradation, or increased the stability of the heterodimer as it travels through the endosomal pathway. As we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fiuza et al., 2010</xref>) have shown that increasing or decreasing ligand has variable effects on receptor distribution among tissues, and given that we observe a consistent effect among tissues on Notch activation upon <italic>cis</italic>-ligand removal, we prefer the stability hypothesis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fiuza et al. (2010)</xref> show that ligand affects Notch stability during Notch activation by EDTA, giving support to the stability hypothesis as the most parsimonious explanation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fiuza et al., 2010</xref>). It is suggested that retaining a pool of translated Notch receptor keeps the pathway in a condition capable of almost instant activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we propose that a role of <italic>cis</italic>-ligands might be to keep the Notch pathway in a state of readiness by buffering against unintentional stochastic Notch activity resulting from normal processing through the endosomes. Endogenously, this may aid the ability of a cell to mediate future Notch-dependent developmental events that have strict temporal regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks and generation of clones</title><p>The following fly stocks were used for Drosophila crosses. hs-flp<sup>122</sup>;;FRT82B RFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Poulton et al., 2011</xref>), FRT82B Dl<sup>RevF10</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Haenlin et al., 1990</xref>), FRT82B Dl<sup>RevF10</sup>Ser<sup>Rx82</sup> (BDSC #6300), hs-FLP<sup>122</sup>; act-GAL4 UAS-GFP;FRT82B Gal80, UAS-Notch<sup>RNAi</sup> (VDRC #1112—no expression in germline cells), UAS-Delta<sup>RNAi</sup> (BDSC #34322—able to express in germline cells); hsFLP GFPstau; act &gt; y<sup>+</sup> &gt; GAL4, UAS-GFP, hs-flp<sup>122</sup>; Gal80 FRT40A; tubGAL4 UASGFP, Su(H)<sup>47</sup>FRT40A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Morel and Schweisguth, 2000</xref>), NRE-EGFP (BDSC #30727; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stempfle et al., 2010</xref>), ubx-FLP;;FRT82B RFP, patched-GAL4 UAS-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hinz et al., 1994</xref>), UAS-Dl<sup>Myc</sup> (a gift from Marc Muskavitch), tsg101<sup>111019</sup> from Kyoto stock center, UAS-Ser<sup>WT</sup> (BDSC #5815), UAS-Ser<sup>del3−tom</sup> (a gift from Robert J Fleming) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Graveley et al., 2011</xref>), UAS-Deltex (a gift from Martin Baron), lgd<sup>d7</sup>40A (BDSC #25087), dppGAL4 (BDSC #7007), lz-GAL4 UAS-GFP (BDSC #6314).

Aliquots (75 ng for 24-well plates or 50 ng for 96-well plates) of each non-luciferase plasmid were added and, where applicable, 10 ng of each luciferase plasmid. DNA concentration between transfections was kept constant with an empty vector. For experiments without dsRNA treatment, CuSO<sub>4</sub> was added to a concentration of 500 µM 24 hr after transfection, and cells were assayed 24 hr later. dsRNA was transcribed in vitro using the RiboMAX large-scale RNA production system-T7 kit (Promega, Madison, WI).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In general, all reviewers agreed that this is an imaginative paper that addresses an important issue. We would like to see this paper published if the authors address the issues raised by the reviewers.</p><p>1) Repeatedly, in post review discussions, it came up that the paper was written in a confusing form in many places. To make this paper more understandable by the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, it is essential that it is copyedited and simplified by the authors and perhaps in consultation with a non-<italic>Drosophila</italic> colleague. Also, many of the figures need to be improved.</p><p>2) In the Abstract, the authors state that the paper is about the ligand-independent N activity in the ovary; however, the suggested mechanism of DSL-independent N activation (endosomal-dependent N regulation) is shown only in the wing disk. If this mechanism is to be extrapolated to explain how ligand-independent N signaling acts in the ovarian soma, the authors should at least show that “endosomal pathway mutant” follicle cells also have precocious N activation.</p><p>3) Mosaic analyses in follicle cells provide evidence that these cells without both cis and trans ligand sources are still able to activate Notch through what is presumed to be a non-canonical pathway. It is not shown what the receptor does in these cells even though the consequences of its activation are well documented. I would have liked to see where the Notch receptor is under those conditions and presume that an immunocytological following of the Notch receptor could be informative. The conclusion that “Therefore, ligands expressed in the same cell as the Notch receptor have an endogenous role in buffering against DSL-independent Notch auto-activation” is too general and too strong and while this is possible it is certainly not conclusive. There are other roles that cis inhibition serves or indeed can serve.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04415.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Repeatedly, in post review discussions, it came up that the paper was written in a confusing form in many places. To make this paper more understandable by the broad readership of eLife, it is essential that it is copyedited and simplified by the authors and perhaps in consultation with a non-Drosophila colleague. Also, many of the figures need to be improved</italic>.</p><p>We have made substantial changes in the revision to clarify points that may have been a source of confusion before, especially for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and the related writing, as it contains inherently complicated data (two cell types with a phenotype conditional on the clonal state of another). In order to increase the readability by non-<italic>Drosophila</italic> biologists, we have gone through the manuscript with non-specialists who have helped us to locate areas which may not be clear, and have attempted to clarify these points. For example, we added a figure to show the schematic drawing of oogenesis, which shows where the follicle cells and germline cells are located. We also include a WT wing disc stained with Wg for comparison and label regions of interest on this disc (i.e., Notum region, hinge region, DV boundary, wing pouch) which we refer to in the text.</p><p><italic>2) In the Abstract, the authors state that the paper is about the ligand-independent N activity in the ovary; however, the suggested mechanism of DSL-independent N activation (endosomal-dependent N regulation) is shown only in the wing disk. If this mechanism is to be extrapolated to explain how ligand-independent N signaling acts in the ovarian soma, the authors should at least show that “endosomal pathway mutant” follicle cells also have precocious N activation</italic>.</p><p>Several earlier studies have reported that different trafficking mutants such as Su(Dx) (Wilkin et al, 2004), tsg101 (Vaccari et al, 2008), and lgd (Schneider et al, 2013) show precocious Notch activation in the follicle cells. We have added a sentence that makes these past results of others more explicit, and also added an example figure showing early Notch activity in <italic>tsg101</italic> mutant follicle cells.</p><p><italic>3) Mosaic analyses in follicle cells provide evidence that these cells without both cis and trans ligand sources are still able to activate Notch through what is presumed to be a non-canonical pathway. It is not shown what the receptor does in these cells even though the consequences of its activation are well documented. I would have liked to see where the Notch receptor is under those conditions and presume that an immunocytological following of the Notch receptor could be informative. The conclusion that “Therefore, ligands expressed in the same cell as the Notch receptor have an endogenous role in buffering against DSL-independent Notch auto-activation” is too general and too strong and while this is possible it is certainly not conclusive. There are other roles that cis inhibition serves or indeed can serve</italic>.</p><p>We have included figures of Notch distribution in different stages of oogenesis in <italic>Dl-/Dl-</italic> clones, and noted that we did observe Notch accumulation, consistent with other cases of ligand-independent Notch activation. From the comments, we are not sure whether “an immunocytological following” also refer to a pulse-chase experiment (i.e. pulse with NECD antibody then chase for varying amounts of time before fixation and secondary antibody wash), this technique, although it works in the imaginal disc, has not been successful in the follicle cells, which was noted in Yan et al, 2009, <italic>Dev Cell</italic> 17. We agree with the reviewer that the conclusion we made on cis-inhibition might be too general and too strong. We therefore have reworded this to the following: “Therefore, we propose that a role of <italic>cis</italic>-ligands could be to keep the Notch pathway in a state of readiness by buffering against unintentional stochastic Notch activity resulting from normal processing through the endosomes.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
