molecules – many of which are redundant in terms of gene copy number or function. It has been hypothesized that the redundancy evolves under selection, driven by its impacts on growth rate. However, we lack empirical measurements of the fitness costs and benefits of redundancy, and we have poor a understanding of how this redundancy is organized across components. We manipulated redundancy in multiple translation components of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> by deleting 28 tRNA genes, 3 tRNA modifying systems, and 4 rRNA operons in various combinations. We find that redundancy in tRNA pools is beneficial when nutrients are plentiful and costly under nutrient limitation. This nutrient-dependent cost of redundant tRNA genes stems from upper limits to translation capacity and growth rate, and therefore varies as a function of the maximum growth rate attainable in a given nutrient niche. The loss of redundancy in rRNA genes and tRNA modifying enzymes had similar nutrient-dependent fitness consequences. Importantly, these effects are also contingent upon interactions across translation components, indicating a layered hierarchy from copy number of tRNA and rRNA genes to their expression and downstream processing. Overall, our results indicate both positive and negative selection on redundancy in translation components, depending on a species’ evolutionary history with feasts and famines.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Translation is the process by which cellular machines called ribosomes use the information encoded in genes to make proteins . Every organism requires two types of RNA molecules to make new proteins: ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs, which form part of the ribosome) and transfer RNAs (tRNAs, which transport the amino acid molecules that form proteins to the ribosomes). These RNA molecules are coded in the genome, but different organisms have different ‘copy numbers’: some genomes contain just a few copies of each of these genes, while others have thousands.</p><p>This apparent redundancy – the presence of several copies of the same gene – is puzzling because it is costly to make and maintain DNA and RNA. This leads to an important question: how does redundancy in these important genes (coding for tRNAs and rRNAs) evolve? The answer is key to understanding how one of the most fundamental cellular processes, the making of proteins from DNA, has evolved.</p><p>A possible reason for organisms to have many copies of the genes required to make proteins is to allow rapid translation, which allows cells to divide faster, and populations of cells to grow more quickly. However, this would likely mean that, when nutrients are scarce, carrying and translating many copies of the same gene would become a burden on the cell. Raval et al. set out to test this idea by measuring the costs and benefits of seemingly redundant translation components.</p><p>To do this, Raval et al. deleted some of the redundant gene copies in the bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and asked if that changed bacterial growth. The experiments showed that when nutrients were plentiful, cells with more copies of the genes (high redundancy) were better able to use the nutrients and divide rapidly. However, when nutrients were limited, bacteria with extra gene copies divided more slowly, showing that the extra genes are indeed a big burden on the cell.</p><p>Raval et al. propose that nutrients available in the environment ultimately determine whether redundancy of the translation machinery is a blessing or a curse. This suggests that the redundancy and underlying growth strategies of different organisms are forged by their experiences of feast and famine during their evolutionary past.</p><p>Importantly, by testing the joint effect of many different molecules involved in translation, Raval et al. uncovered several strategies that may maximize bacterial growth and protein production. Their results could thus be useful for optimizing the synthesis of important products that use growing cells as factories – from beer to insulin – where the rate of growth is critical.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>redundancy</kwd><kwd>tRNA modifying enzyme</kwd><kwd>rRNA</kwd><kwd>translation rate</kwd><kwd>tRNA</kwd><kwd>fitness costs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001502</institution-id><institution>Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project 695 Identification No. RTI 4006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Agashe</surname><given-names>Deepa</given-names></name><name><surname>Raval</surname><given-names>Parth K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CSIR-UGC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>June/2018/430</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raval</surname><given-names>Parth K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ngan</surname><given-names>Wing Yui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>International Max Planck Research School for Evolutionary Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ngan</surname><given-names>Wing Yui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gallie</surname><given-names>Jenna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AOBJ:679030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ngan</surname><given-names>Wing Yui</given-names></name><name><surname>Gallie</surname><given-names>Jenna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Manipulation of the <italic>E. coli</italic> translation machinery sheds new light on evolutionary constraints and optimization strategies for bacterial translation and growth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the early 1960s, the degeneracy of the genetic code was revealed in the context of multiple synonymous codons encoding a given amino acid. A large body of work since then has uncovered an astonishing degree of redundancy in the translation apparatus. The redundancy is often qualitative, whereby some components can functionally compensate for others. This includes the pool of tRNA molecules that read mRNA codons and deliver the appropriate amino acid during translation. tRNAs with different anticodons may read distinct synonymous codons but carry the same amino acid (tRNA isoacceptors) and are thus functionally degenerate. In addition, tRNA modifying enzymes (MEs) post-transcriptionally alter specific tRNAs (‘target’ tRNAs, i.e. targets of modification), allowing them to read codons that are otherwise decoded by ‘non-target’ tRNAs that are not modified by MEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grosjean, 2009</xref>). Hence, some non-target tRNAs could be redundant because their function can be carried out by target tRNAs after they get modified. For instance, in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> the codon CCG can be decoded by the non-target tRNA<sub>CGG</sub> (encoded by the gene <italic>proK</italic>), but also by the target tRNA<sub>UGG</sub> (encoded by <italic>proM</italic>) after the U at position 34 is modified to cmo<sup>5</sup>U by the cmo modification pathway (in principle rendering the gene <italic>proK</italic> redundant). MEs are thus critical for maximizing cellular decoding capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwan and Agashe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grosjean et al., 2010</xref>), and maintaining translational capability requires either a very diverse tRNA pool or the presence of MEs that allows for a compact tRNA gene set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwan and Agashe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marck and Grosjean, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rocha, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wald and Margalit, 2014</xref>). In addition, quantitative redundancy is conferred by high gene copy number (GCN), such that multiple genes can perform identical functions. For instance, bacterial genomes often carry many copies of genes encoding tRNAs with the same anticodon (tRNA isotypes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan and Lowe, 2009</xref>). Similarly, cells typically have many copies of rRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roller et al., 2016</xref>), which govern ribosome availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nomura et al., 1980</xref>). Thus, the translation machinery is predicted to be functionally redundant at many levels, with qualitative (multiple codons, tRNA isoacceptors, and MEs) as well as quantitative (GCN) redundancy. However, in many cases, the predicted functional redundancy is not experimentally verified, and it remains unclear whether it influences fitness. We asked: what are the fitness costs and benefits of translational redundancy, and under what conditions do they manifest? Could these costs and benefits explain the evolution of a highly redundant translation apparatus?</p><p>In bacteria, selection for rapid growth (often facilitated by nutrient availability) is thought to be an important force that shapes the evolution of many translation components. The maximum possible growth rate is determined by translation efficiency, which in turn depends on the concentrations of ribosomes and tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ehrenberg and Kurland, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kurland and Ehrenberg, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kurland and Hughes, 1996</xref>). Across species, there are striking positive correlations between maximal growth rate and the number of tRNA and rRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dethlefsen and Schmidt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ikemura, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rocha, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vieira-Silva and Rocha, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weissman et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we expect that GCN redundancy in key translation components should be especially beneficial during rapid growth in a nutrient-rich niche. In contrast, under nutrient limitation, expressing redundant genes should be costly because translational output remains constrained by nutrients. However, this overarching growth rate-dependent selection may shape the redundancy of translation components differentially. For instance, selection should have the maximum impact on rRNA, whose GCN shows the strongest correlation with growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rocha, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roller et al., 2016</xref>). Ribosomal RNAs constitute up to 85% of all RNA in rapidly growing <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bremer and Dennis, 1996</xref>) and their concentration is most limiting for translation, likely because rRNA constitutes the core catalyst of ribosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bremer and Dennis, 1996</xref>). During fast growth, cellular rRNA abundance increases by ~250%, whereas total tRNA increases only by ~80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 1996</xref>). Consequently, the cellular ratio of tRNAs to rRNAs decreases under rapid growth, indicating greater investment in rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dittmar et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, deleting rRNA operons in <italic>E. coli</italic> reduces fitness in rich media, but improves fitness in poor media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Condon et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gyorfy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stevenson and Schmidt, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the growth rate-dependent impacts of redundancy in tRNA GCN remain largely unexplored, with the exception of initiator tRNA genes in <italic>E. coli</italic>. As predicted, in this case, the loss of some gene copies is deleterious in rich media and advantageous in poor media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Samhita et al., 2014</xref>). However, the growth impact of elongator tRNA GCN is not known. The paucity of data for tRNA redundancy is glaring because bacteria show enormous variation in tRNA pools, driven by evolutionary changes in tRNA GCN as well as MEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bedhomme et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwan and Agashe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Saks et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wald and Margalit, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the impacts of redundancy are predicted to vary substantially across different tRNA genes. For instance, mature tRNA pools are biased towards ‘major’ tRNAs that connect frequently used amino acids and codons, and are more strongly correlated with growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg and Kurland, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 1996</xref>) and rRNA GCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mahajan and Agashe, 2018</xref>) compared to minor tRNAs. The loss of redundancy in these tRNAs should impose a larger fitness cost, a hypothesis that remains untested. Thus, despite strong comparative evidence for growth rate-driven selection, our understanding of the evolution and impacts of redundancy in translation components is far from complete.</p><p>While the fitness costs and benefits of redundancy should ultimately be shaped by nutrient availability, redundancy may itself arise via different mechanisms for different translation components, and hence selection may shape the components in distinct ways. For instance, with rRNAs, the loss of GCN redundancy is buffered by strong compensatory upregulation of ‘backup’ gene copies. An <italic>E. coli</italic> strain with deletion of 6 out of 7 rRNA operons can produce about half of the normal levels of rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asai et al., 1999</xref>). As a result, the deletion of a few rRNA genes only moderately reduces the growth rate in rich media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gyorfy et al., 2015</xref>), though the direction of the effect is reversed in poor media (see above). Are tRNA pools similarly regulated? While this is possible (e.g. in response to nutrient availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fessler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sørensen et al., 2018</xref>), we have no data on compensatory regulation of the remaining tRNA copies after gene loss. Furthermore, tRNA redundancy is modulated not only by GCN but also by MEs that allow target tRNAs to perform the function of non-target tRNAs. Thus, tRNA gene loss could be buffered by the regulation of other tRNA gene copies, and/or by the action of MEs. Interestingly, fast-growing bacteria tend to have low tRNA diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rocha, 2004</xref>), with their decoding capacity likely maintained by the action of multiple tRNA modification pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwan and Agashe, 2018</xref>). Hence, the fitness consequences of tRNA gene loss should be contingent on the availability of ME backups. Conversely, the joint deletion of non-target tRNAs and MEs is predicted to be more costly than the loss of either component alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwan and Agashe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wald and Margalit, 2014</xref>). Thus, the mechanisms that mediate redundancy as well as the interactions between translation components are important to fully understand the evolution of translational redundancy.</p><p>The patterns noted above suggest a hierarchical organization, whereby redundancy in some components and genes is more important than others (e.g. rRNAs vs. tRNAs, and major vs. minor tRNA isotypes). However, as discussed above we have very limited empirical evidence for the fitness consequences of redundancy in different translation components, particularly in the case of tRNA pools. We addressed these gaps by analyzing the nutrient-dependent impact of changing redundancy in multiple translational components, alone as well as in combination. Specifically, we tested the following predictions: (1) redundancy in tRNA and rRNA GCN, on the whole, should be important to maintain rapid growth, and the benefits of increased redundancy should be proportional to the achievable growth rate (2) broadly, a reduction in rRNA GCN should have stronger fitness impacts than tRNA GCN (3) across tRNAs, the loss of redundancy should be most impactful for major tRNA isotypes, and for non-target tRNAs when combined with the loss of a relevant ME (4) the fitness impact of reduced redundancy should increase with the severity of the loss, e.g., due to the deletion of multiple gene copies or multiple translational components. We worked with <italic>E. coli</italic> because it has a highly redundant translation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwan and Agashe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wald and Margalit, 2014</xref>) that allowed us to test the impacts of successive losses of redundancy at the level of rRNA genes, tRNA pools, and tRNA modifying enzymes. We first show that, as expected, many components of the translation machinery are indeed redundant with respect to fitness. We then test our predictions by measuring the context-dependent costs and benefits of this redundancy. Our results reveal layered factors that may have shaped the evolution of the translation machinery in bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Altering redundancy in translation components</title><p>Prior work demonstrates the functional redundancy of some bacterial translation components with respect to translation rate or accuracy. However, it remains unknown whether and under what conditions this functional redundancy has fitness consequences. The genome of <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 (wild type, WT) encodes 42 tRNA isotypes with varying copy numbers (total 86 tRNA genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan and Lowe, 2016</xref>), five tRNA modification pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwan and Agashe, 2018</xref>) that modify the 34<sup>th</sup> base of the tRNA or first base of the anticodon, and seven rRNA genes in distinct operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Quan et al., 2015</xref>). We reduced redundancy in translation components in three ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). (1) We generated 23 distinct mutant strains of WT that represented a total of 28 deleted tRNA genes, with 20 strains carrying single tRNA deletions and three strains carrying multiple tRNA deletions. These strains denoted a direct genomic loss of redundancy, potentially altering the cellular tRNA pool (sets I, II and III, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). (2) Post-transcriptional modification enhances wobble pairing by adding anticodon loop modifications to target tRNAs. Hence, non-target tRNAs are made redundant by modified tRNAs. To reduce this form of redundancy, we deleted key enzymes (MEs) within four tRNA modification pathways of WT (set IV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>), as well as some of their non-target tRNAs (set V, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) and a target tRNA in one case. (3) Finally, to lower redundancy in rRNA genes, we used strains carrying 1–4 rRNA operon deletions, including deletions of interspersed tRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Quan et al., 2015</xref>) (set VI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). In one of the strains with four rRNA operons deletions, we made additional tRNA deletions to determine the fitness impact when the levels of both rRNA and tRNA are reduced (set VII, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Overall, we used 43 mutant strains covering 15 amino acids, 33 tRNA genes, three tRNA modifying systems, and four rRNA operons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of experimental manipulation of redundancy in translational components.</title><p>Target transfer RNAs (tRNAs): tRNA isotypes that are targets of modifying enzymes (MEs) (i.e. are post-transcriptionally modified by a tRNA modifying enzyme), expanding the repertoire of codons they can read.

All genes except one (<italic>proL</italic>) were predicted to be redundant because the genome has other gene copies encoding the same tRNA isotype (set I in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). In some cases, the original GCN was small so that our manipulation left a single redundant copy (<italic>phe U/V</italic> and <italic>ser W/X</italic>). In five other strains, we deleted single tRNA genes that appear redundant because MEs should allow other (target) tRNAs to perform their function (set II, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Given the expected functional backups for deletions in sets I and II, we predicted that the loss of redundancy should have relatively weak fitness consequences. Indeed, in complex rich media (LB and TB), the growth rate of these strains was largely similar to the WT, with the highest impact representing ~15% change in growth rate (R<sub>rel</sub> values between 0.85 and 1.15; R<sub>rel</sub> is the ratio of mutant growth rate to WT growth rate, so R<sub>rel</sub> &gt;1 indicates faster growth of mutant). Only 10 of 20 strains showed a significant difference in at least one of these complex rich media, six with faster growth and four with slower growth than WT (sets I and II in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

On the other hand, deleting different genes encoding the same tRNA isotype (e.g. the four genes for tRNA<sub>GUU</sub>-Asn) did not have identical growth impacts, corroborating previous work suggesting that copies of the same tRNA contribute differently to translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dittmar et al., 2004</xref>). These differences could potentially arise due to genomic location – prior work shows that tRNA gene expression is correlated with distance from the origin of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardell and Kirsebom, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hu and Lercher, 2021</xref>).

Over half of the 20 strains also showed a significant difference in the length of the lag phase, though the direction of the effect varied across strains and media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Consistent with the growth rate results, set III strains showed the maximum increase in lag phase length. However, barring a few exceptions, the loss of tRNA redundancy had a negligible impact on growth yield regardless of the severity of the manipulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tested the fitness of tRNA deletion strains in more permissive rich media with easy-to-use sources of carbon (glucose) and amino acids (casamino acids) (‘GA’), where the WT growth rate is similar to that in complex rich media. Here, tRNA gene loss was uniformly deleterious, with 18 of 20 strains showing significantly slower growth (GA 1.6, sets I and II, mean R<sub>rel</sub> = 0.84 and 0.88 respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Reducing the glucose and casamino acid concentration reversed this effect (GA 0.8, sets I and II, mean R<sub>rel</sub> = 0.98 and 1.02 respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that nutrient availability determined both the direction and uniformity of the impact of tRNA redundancy. As with complex rich media, strains with a severe loss of redundancy tended to show the largest reduction in fitness (set III, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, the impacts on other growth parameters were more variable. In GA 1.6, 6 of 20 strains (sets I and II) showed a significantly shorter lag phase than WT while five showed a longer lag phase; but in GA 0.8, only one strain had a longer lag phase and 12 strains entered the exponential growth phase faster than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Concomitantly, we observed little change in the growth yield of these strains, with only 3–4 strains showing a significant difference in either medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B</xref>). Unlike the patterns in complex rich media, set III strains did not show stronger effects on either lag phase length or growth yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>). Overall, in media where easily accessible nutrients are plentiful, even a small loss of tRNA redundancy strongly hindered rapid growth but had weak and/or inconsistent effects on the lag phase and growth yield.</p><p>Finally, we measured fitness in poor media where nutrients should severely limit translation, and maintaining tRNA redundancy may be costly. When using lactose (which reduces WT growth rate to ~50% of LB), the loss of redundancy had a weak and variable impact, with only 5 of 23 strains (across sets I–III) showing a significant difference from WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). However, in poorer media containing succinate, glycerol, or galactose (where WT growth rate is reduced to ~10–25% of LB), tRNA gene deletions were often beneficial (7, 15, and 9 out of 23 strains, respectively) and only 2–3 strains had slower growth than the WT (sets I–III, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Again, set III strains tended to show the maximum benefit of tRNA loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Although, the impacts on other growth parameters varied across strains and growth media, most strains had a shorter lag phase (20 of 23 strains) and a higher yield (14 of 23 strains) in at least one poor medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5C</xref>). Hence, the loss of redundancy appeared to be generally beneficial in poor media.</p><p>Finally, we found that the low growth rate of two of the tRNA deletion strains (ΔglyU and ΔthrW) was rescued by plasmid-borne tRNA copies, confirming that the observed fitness effects were indeed explained by tRNA loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). Overall, these results indicated that a severe reduction in tRNA redundancy amplified the fitness impacts of tRNA deletion, but the magnitude and direction of the effects varied substantially across growth media. However, in all growth media, the fitness impacts were generally similar for sets I and II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>), indicating that the nature of the backup available to maintain tRNA pools (redundant gene copies vs. ME activity) does not alter the impact of tRNA gene loss.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>tRNA redundancy is beneficial during rapid growth but costly under nutrient limitation</title><p>The results above showed that the fitness impacts of tRNA gene loss depend qualitatively on the growth medium. To test whether these patterns are quantitatively explained by growth limits set by nutrient availability, for each engineered strain we estimated the relationship between the relative impact of a loss of redundancy (R<sub>rel</sub>) and the maximum attainable WT growth rate (R<sub>max</sub>), across all growth media tested (data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Since WT has the highest level of redundancy and presumably the weakest internal limits on translation rate, we expected that the WT R<sub>max</sub> reflects the nutrient capacity of each growth medium (i.e. externally placed limits on growth). Of 28 strains (including five rRNA operon deletions described later in the results section), 26 showed a negative correlation between R<sub>max</sub> and R<sub>rel</sub>, with a significant relationship in 11 cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). Thus, tRNA and rRNA gene loss tends to be more beneficial (i.e. redundancy is more costly) under conditions of low nutrient availability, when the maximum possible growth rate is constrained.</p><p>This pattern was further supported by experiments performed during nutrient shifts, where cultures in the exponential growth phase were transferred from rich to poor media and vice versa. Note that this setup differs from the previous growth measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) where late stationary phase cultures grown overnight were transferred to either rich or poor media. Of the 27 tRNA and rRNA deletion strains tested, all but one had a growth rate that was comparable to WT (16 strains) or higher than WT (10 strains) after transitioning from rich to poor media (i.e. during a nutrient downshift, note data distribution along the x-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In contrast, after a nutrient upshift, 11 strains showed significantly slower growth in one or both pairs of media, and only two showed a significantly faster growth than WT (note data distribution along the y-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Thus, gene loss is beneficial during a nutrient downshift but deleterious in a nutrient upshift. These patterns were also most consistent for strains in sets III and VI (described later in the results section), corroborating our results from constant environments where we observed large impacts of redundancy for the same strains. Strains in the bottom right quadrant of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are especially interesting because they represent cases where the loss of redundancy is beneficial in a nutrient downshift but deleterious in a nutrient upshift. Hence, these genes should be important when ramping up translation in a nutrient-rich environment. In this category, we observed one strain each from sets I and II, and 4 strains from set VI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Thus, redundancy in tRNA genes can be beneficial during rapid growth but is generally costly in poor media where nutrients are limited.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Redundant transfer RNA (tRNA) gene copies are beneficial during nutrient fluctuations.</title><p>Relative growth rate of mutants (sets I to IV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) upon a nutrient downshift (R<sub>rel</sub> on the x-axis) and an upshift (R<sub>rel</sub> on the y-axis).

Conversely, the large fitness benefit of deleting the same tRNA genes in poor media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) suggests that these genes are not sufficiently downregulated in poor media, with cells paying a maintenance cost.</p><p>To test these hypotheses, we focused on four strains from sets II and III where we observed strong fitness effects. We measured the relative contribution of each tRNA isotype to the mature tRNA pool in WT and the tRNA deletion strains, in a rich (LB) and a poor medium (M9 galactose).

Notably, of the tRNA isotypes whose loss imposed a large fitness cost in rich media (set III, as well as a few from set I; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), none showed a higher relative abundance in rich media compared to poor media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

We expected that tRNA gene deletion would reduce the proportional contribution of the respective tRNA isotype to the total pool unless the deletion was compensated by expression from the remaining gene copies. In all four gene deletion mutants, the contribution of the focal (deleted) tRNA isotype to the total tRNA pool was lower than in the WT tRNA pool, in both rich and poor medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, expression from backup gene copies was not sufficient to compensate for the loss of the deleted tRNA genes. Together, these results suggest that change in gene copy number allows a much stronger (in this case, also more beneficial) response to the nutritional environment, compared to what can be achieved by differential gene expression (including processes such as gene regulation or tRNA degradation).</p><p>Interestingly, in the tRNA gene deletion strains, in addition to the focal isotype, the fractional contribution of many other tRNA species also differed from the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Since YAMAT-seq measures relative tRNA isotype levels, when we deleted genes whose products are typically highly represented in the mature tRNA pool (e.g. ∆glyVXY and ∆leuVPQ) we expected to automatically alter the relative contribution of other tRNA isotypes. However, the difference between WT and tRNA gene deletion strains varied systematically across media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and was also evident with the deletion of tRNA genes whose products show intermediate levels of contribution to the mature tRNA pool. Hence, these differences likely reflected transcriptional regulation or downstream processing. Broadly, the loss of tRNA gene copies led to stronger changes in tRNA pool composition in the rich medium, even though it did not restore fitness completely. This further indicated that in rich media, gene copy number is limiting, whereas in poor media nutrients are a major limiting factor. Note that as expected, deletion of the single-copy, non-target tRNA genes <italic>thrW</italic> or <italic>glyU</italic> caused near-elimination of these tRNA isotypes from the tRNA pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, the fitness impact of these deletions was weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), likely due to the action of MEs that allowed other (i.e. target) tRNAs to compensate for the loss of the deleted single-copy tRNAs. Thus, MEs indeed serve as a backup and render non-target tRNAs redundant. Overall, these data strongly suggest that moderate to severe loss of redundancy at the gene copy level is not fully rescued by expression from backup gene copies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Redundant tRNAs do not contribute to translation when nutrients are limited</title><p>We showed above that the WT over-produces many tRNA isotypes in poor media, potentially explaining its low fitness relative to the tRNA gene deletion strains. We suspected that although in rich media such ‘surplus’ tRNAs contribute to translation, this may not happen in poor media where growth is limited by nutrient availability rather than translation efficiency, and levels of charged amino acids drop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dittmar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elf et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, in rich media, the loss of tRNA genes should decrease translation; but in poor media, this effect should be weak. We therefore estimated translational output in a subset of our strains, by measuring the translation elongation rate of the native beta-galactosidase protein during the log phase of growth. As predicted, in a rich medium (LB) all strains with low redundancy had a significantly slower elongation rate than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In a permissive medium (GA), elongation rates were usually not significantly different from WT, a pattern that was also observed for another reporter protein (GFP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, in a poor medium (M9 glycerol), elongation rates were often higher than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), indicating that the loss of tRNA genes had a net beneficial impact on translation elongation.

Thus, the fitness impact of redundancy generally increases with the magnitude of the loss, as predicted by comparative evidence across genomes; but this has not been explicitly demonstrated.

As noted earlier, deleting rRNA operons simultaneously removes some tRNA genes located in the operon, so that even a single rRNA operon deletion is effectively a co-deletion. However, all the tRNA genes deleted in this manner had multiple genomic backup copies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Given the strong regulatory compensation of rRNA loss observed in prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elf et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Quan et al., 2015</xref>), it was not surprising that the deletion of up to three rRNA operons (along with up to four tRNA genes) had a very weak impact on growth rate in rich media. However, in poor media, the fitness impact was evident even with the loss of only two rRNA operons (and three tRNA genes). Mimicking the patterns observed for specific tRNA gene deletions, a more severe loss of rRNA and tRNA redundancy (from one to four rRNA operon deletions, set VI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) was detrimental in rich media (set VI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and increasingly beneficial in poor media (set VI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Further loss of redundancy – via simultaneous deletion of four rRNA operons (including seven tRNA genes) and extra-operonic tRNA genes (set VII, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) – had mixed effects on growth rate.

In rich media, only 1 of the 6 cases tested showed a significant additional fitness reduction upon co-deleting rRNA and extra-operonic tRNA. However, in poor media, tRNA loss led to an additional fitness benefit in 3 out of 6 co-deletions. Thus, when growth is strongly limited by the availability of rRNA (and hence mature ribosomes), the lack of tRNA is less detrimental to translation and growth rate. Conversely, when growth is limited by both nutrients and rRNAs, shedding tRNAs appears to be additionally beneficial.</p><p>Together, our results lead to the following conclusions. First, we find that the simultaneous deletion of multiple copies of tRNA genes or rRNA genes has more severe fitness consequences than the loss of single gene copies. Second, increasing the severity of reduction in translational redundancy via co-deletion of MEs and tRNA genes amplifies the fitness consequences of losing redundancy. Lastly, when nutrients are in plenty, rRNA becomes limiting and the loss of tRNA genes has little additional impact on fitness; but when nutrients are limiting, shedding different translation components (rRNA and tRNA) additively increases fitness.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The process of protein synthesis is central to life and is especially important to understand bacterial evolution given the direct link between translation, growth rate, and fitness. Translation rate is affected by several genomic components (e.g. tRNAs, rRNAs, tRNA modifying and charging enzymes) and environmental factors (e.g. nutrient availability). Comparative analyses show that the genomic components have different degrees of redundancy across taxa, and suggest that this redundancy (in the fitness context) should be shaped by the strength of ecological selection for rapid growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rocha, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roller et al., 2016</xref>). While lateral gene transfer and gene deletion/duplication make translation components labile even in the absence of selection, the correlation between maximum growth rate and redundancy of tRNA or rRNA GCN suggests a strong role for selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rocha, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roller et al., 2016</xref>), likely imposed by nutrients from the environment. Hence, nutrients ultimately limit translation. Cells can meet this environmental limit and maximize fitness by shaping genomic factors to achieve the maximum attainable translational output. Such modulation of the cellular machinery should occur at physiological (short-term) as well as evolutionary timescales. For instance, cells can control translation rates via rapid regulation of translation components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wilusz, 2015</xref>), including via degradation of ribosomes and tRNAs during nutrient starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fessler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sørensen et al., 2018</xref>). Across-species patterns of rRNA and tRNA GCN are consistent with such selection, as discussed in the Introduction. Similar arguments can also be made for redundancy across other translation components. Together, this suggests that the environment sets the limits of translation, according to which natural selection shapes the genomic redundancy of translational components. However, empirical evidence for a common underlying selection pressure shaping redundancy across various translational components has been missing.</p><p>Here, we provide such evidence, showing that broadly speaking, several components of the <italic>E. coli</italic> translation apparatus are indeed functionally redundant and that the costs and benefits of this redundancy vary with nutrient availability. When nutrients permit rapid growth, the loss of redundancy in both tRNAs and rRNAs is detrimental, as these components become limiting for translation. This is especially true for multiple deletions of abundantly used components such as rRNAs, MEs that modify many different tRNAs, and frequently used tRNAs (such as glycine and leucine). These results support prior predictions of larger fitness consequences following the loss of major tRNAs that read abundant codons and respond strongly to fast growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 1996</xref>), or tRNAs that make larger contributions to the tRNA pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloom-Ackermann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kanaya et al., 1999</xref>). The observed variability in fitness impacts across tRNAs is therefore at least partially explained by the relative use of different codons. Our results also support the broad prediction that high tRNA levels should be most critical during rapid growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mahajan and Agashe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vieira-Silva and Rocha, 2010</xref>), when the correlation between tRNA levels and gene copy number is strongest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 1996</xref>). Conversely, when nutrients are limiting, both rRNA as well as tRNA gene loss is beneficial. Importantly, we show that the expression cost of high translational redundancy of WT <italic>E. coli</italic> is not met by increased translation rate in poor media, and imposes a substantial net fitness cost.</p><p>While these observations suggest that nutrient availability can guide the evolutionary optimization of the cost-to-benefit ratio of the bacterial translation machinery, interactions (and potential hierarchies) amongst different components suggest multiple routes of optimization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We observe that the loss of rRNA genes is generally more impactful than the loss of tRNAs; and when rRNAs are limiting, the additional loss of tRNAs has a relatively weak effect. We suggest that this is because rRNAs set the first internal limit on translation rate, as predicted by prior work (see the Introduction). However, further experiments are necessary to separate the independent impacts of rRNA and tRNA genes linked within operons. Interestingly, even in complex bacterial communities, the addition of resources enriched for taxa with more rRNA copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2017</xref>) and the growth rate response to nutrient addition was positively correlated with rRNA copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2019</xref>). The next internal limiting factor for translation appears to be available tRNA pools, determined by the nested impacts of tRNA gene copy number, transcriptional regulation of gene expression, and MEs. Overall, tRNA gene copy number has a stronger impact on translation and fitness than the regulation of different isotype copies, corroborating prior results with yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Percudani et al., 1997</xref>). However, in the special case of non-target tRNAs, the relevant MEs have a stronger impact than the tRNA genes. This is not surprising given the predicted functional redundancy between MEs and non-target tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwan and Agashe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grosjean et al., 2010</xref>). As a result of this layering, a severe loss of tRNA redundancy becomes important for fitness only when many copies of an isotype are lost, or when a non-target tRNA is co-deleted with a relevant modifying enzyme. Conversely, these results predict that an increase in redundancy (e.g. due to occupation of a more nutrient-rich niche and selection for rapid growth) may occur via increasing isotype gene copy numbers, increasing non-target tRNAs, or gaining a relevant modifying enzyme. These predictions from our <italic>E. coli</italic> data closely match the patterns observed in comparative analyses across bacteria: selection for rapid growth is strongly correlated with gene copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rocha, 2004</xref>), and lineages may lose either MEs or non-target tRNAs, but not both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwan and Agashe, 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Multiple routes to translational adaptation.</title><p>Proposed highway model for the layered, hierarchical organisation of translation components showing multiple potential routes for optimizing translational output, based on the current study and previous work. The width of the routes is constrained primarily by available nutrients, which sets an upper limit to translational output; and the redundancy of various components evolves under this constraint. Within the confines of what is achievable under given nutrient conditions, different components may adapt in different order, and to different degrees. Important components that serve as bottlenecks are shown in yellow, from left to right in the proposed order of importance. rRNA should adapt first (via gene expression change in the short term and gene copy number, GCN, over long term), contributing to ribosome synthesis. Next, transfer RNA (tRNAs) may adapt via two possible parallel routes: by modulating the copy number or expression of target tRNAs, or non-target tRNA +MEs (see Introduction). Elongation factors (EF) can adapt by similar routes. Simultaneously, a stronger match between the tRNA pools and codon usage (CU) of highly expressed genes will enhance translational output. Components that are not directly tested or discussed extensively here but are likely to adapt via the general principles derived here are shown in the white spaces: tRNA synthetases and ribosomal and tRNA disassembly/degradation. Together, all these factors determine translation output, growth, and fitness.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81005-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Together with prior work, our results also suggest that fast-growing organisms such as <italic>E. coli</italic> have evolved to rely strongly on gene copy numbers to maximize translation rates. Presumably, such species are either able to bear the costs of maintenance of surplus tRNA genes during periods of slow growth, or across longer evolutionary timescales the extra tRNA copies provide a net benefit. We therefore suggest a model whereby bacterial growth rate is primarily limited by external nutrient availability, then by rRNA molecules, and finally by tRNA pools (determined by tRNA GCN and MEs, and secondarily via tRNA gene regulation). Thus, the layered costs and benefits of high translational redundancy – both within and across distinct components – are ultimately determined by the environmental context. Importantly, this model predicts that prolonged selection for rapid growth should cause successive evolutionary changes in the redundancy of different translation components, with the general order of events determined (and parallel routes offered) by the hierarchical layering of components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>We hope that future work will test this model and enrich it by considering additional translational components and factors that may drive their evolution. For instance, genome GC content is strongly associated with tRNA GCN and diversity across the bacterial phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwan and Agashe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wald and Margalit, 2014</xref>), as well as with codon bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hershberg and Petrov, 2010</xref>). An understanding of the ecological and evolutionary pressures that drive shifts in GC content would thus be useful to understand the impact of selection for rapid growth on genome GC. Parallel to our results, prior work shows that the two copies of <italic>tuf</italic> genes – encoding the <italic>E. coli</italic> translation elongation factor EF-Tu – also have distinct, medium-dependent impacts on growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zuurmond et al., 1999</xref>). It would thus be interesting to include EF-Tu redundancy in our model. It is also worth considering other evolutionary processes that can alter redundancy, such as genetic drift that may facilitate the loss of MEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diwan and Agashe, 2018</xref>). In addition, here we have focused on selection acting on translation rate, primarily tested using growth rate. However, our results hint at interesting effects of the loss of redundancy on other growth parameters such as yield and lag phase that may be orthogonal to growth rate. These measurements had a low resolution in our study, but explicit and better analysis of such impacts may reveal the effects of selection in niches where yield or survival (rather than growth rate) determine fitness. Finally, we note that selection may act on other cellular functions performed by some translational components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shepherd and Ibba, 2015</xref>), or on translational accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gingold and Pilpel, 2011</xref>). While global mistranslation can provide fitness benefits in stressful contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jones et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Samhita et al., 2020</xref>), the nature and strength of selection acting on translational accuracy and the relationship between translation rate and accuracy remain poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drummond and Wilke, 2009</xref>). Nonetheless, prior work suggests that both tRNA pools and MEs influence translation accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Manickam et al., 2016</xref>) and protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fedyunin et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, selection for accuracy could also shape the evolution of tRNAs and MEs. We therefore suggest that expanding the layers of organization of translational components in our model will prove fruitful in gaining a deeper understanding of the evolution of translational redundancy.</p><p>In summary, our experiments demonstrate that several components of the translation machinery are redundant in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the costs and benefits of which vary based on nutrient availability – an environmental variable that likely shaped the redundancy in the first place. Our results support the broad idea that translational limits imposed by different components and their interactions generate multiple translational optima and make many paths feasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grosjean et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Higgs and Ran, 2008</xref>), depending on the selective context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rocha, 2004</xref>). We propose a model with hierarchies of translation components that may allow for the maximization of translational output and fitness. It remains to be seen to what extent these hierarchies operate across diverse taxa, and which of the possible parallel routes are taken during the course of bacterial evolution in nature. Further studies on the layers and hierarchies connecting translational components will thus shed light on the molecular toolkits underlying evolutionary transitions between slow versus rapid translation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generating strains</title><p>We made all gene deletions in <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655, which we refer to as the wild type (WT). tRNA deletions were made using Red recombinase, slightly modifying the Datsenko-Wanner method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Datsenko and Wanner, 2000</xref>) with longer homology regions of 60–100 bases to increase the probability of recombination.

After the second wash, we resuspended the cells in 1 mL LB with 20 mM sodium citrate and incubated at 37 °C (60–90 min). Finally, we pelleted the cells, resuspended in 100 μl of citrate buffer and 5 mM sodium citrate, plated them on LB agar with Kanamycin (30 μg/ml), and incubated overnight at 37 °C.</p><p>We removed the kanamycin cassette that replaced the deleted gene using plasmid pCP20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Datsenko and Wanner, 2000</xref>). Briefly, we grew transformants (mutant +pCP20) at 30 °C, 18 h in LB medium (with ampicillin 100 μg/ml) and streaked them on LB agar plate with ampicillin. We patched individual colonies on LB agar, LB +Amp, and LB +Kan and incubated overnight at 37 °C. We confirmed the loss of the Kan marker (for all except ΔglyVXY) by PCR-amplifying and Sanger sequencing those colonies that had lost antibiotic resistance (indicating loss of the Kan cassette and the Amp-marked plasmid), and grew only on LB agar.</p><p>For all experiments, we used independently grown colonies or cultures to serve as biological replicates. Hence, unless mentioned otherwise, reported sample sizes refer to biological replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Measuring growth parameters</title><p>We inoculated strains in LB (Lysogeny Broth, Difco) from individual colonies grown from freezer stocks, and incubated cultures at 37 °C with shaking at 180 rpm for 14–16 hr (preculture). For growth rate measurement, we sub-cultured 1% v/v in 48 well microplates (Corning) in the appropriate growth medium: LB, TB (Terrific Broth, Sigma) or M9 minimal medium (M9 salts, 1 mM CaCl2, 2.5 mM MgSO4) supplemented with specific carbon and nitrogen sources (‘GA’: glucose and cas amino acids, either 1.6% w/v or 0.8% w/v each as specified in the results and figures; or carbon sources alone: lactose 0.05% w/v, galactose 0.05%, pyruvate 0.3% w/v, succinate 0.3% w/v, or glycerol 0.6% w/v). We measured growth rate (<italic>r</italic>) as the change in optical density (OD) read at 600 nm every 20 min or 45 min (for rapid and slow growth respectively), using an automated system (LiconiX incubator, robotic arm, and Tecan plate reader). We estimated <italic>r</italic> by fitting exponential equations to the first few data points representing the exponential growth phase from OD vs. time curves, using Curvefitter software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delaney et al., 2013</xref>). After 8–12 hr of growth, we estimated the carrying capacity (K) by measuring the maximum OD of late log phase cultures (after 10 x dilution in rich media, to accurately estimate ODs higher than one). We estimated the length of the lag phase (L) as the time taken to reach the early log phase of growth. This was limited by low temporal resolution, and we were unable to capture differences in L that were smaller than 20 min (often observed in the WT and single gene deletions during rapid growth). We estimated the relative fitness of each mutant as the ratio of its r, K, or L value vs. that of the WT measured in the same experiment.</p><p>To measure the growth rate under nutrient shifts, we initiated precultures and sub-cultured them as above in a rich medium (TB). From late log phase culture in the rich medium (after 6 hr of growth), we again sub-cultured as above into poor medium (either M9 glycerol or M9 galactose, representing a nutrient downshift). When these cultures reached late log phase in the poor medium (12–16 hr), we again sub-cultured them back into the rich medium (TB, representing a nutrient upshift). After each transfer (downshift or upshift), we measured the growth rate as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Measuring mature tRNA pools using YAMAT-seq</title><p>For a subset of our tRNA gene deletion strains and WT, we measured the relative abundance of each tRNA isotype and compared this proportion across strains as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shigematsu et al., 2017</xref>), or across growth media. We note that this procedure is analogous to measuring differences in relative mRNA levels by RNA-Seq. As such, it provides no information about (i) the absolute size of the mature tRNA pool, or (ii) the molecular mechanism(s) by which any observed differences arise (e.g. up versus down-regulation of gene expression, or degradation). Briefly, we grew three independent replicate cultures of each strain in two media and isolated total RNA from 4 ml (rich medium, LB) or 12 ml (poor medium, M9 +0.05% galactose) aliquots of mid-log phase cultures. We extracted total RNA from each growing culture using a TRIzol Max Bacterial RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen; catalog number 16096040) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. We subjected 10 μg of total RNA per sample to tRNA deacylation by incubating in 100 μl of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) for 40 min at 37 °C. We then desalted the deacylated RNAs and concentrated them by ethanol precipitation. Next, we took 1 μg of each precipitated product and ligated Y-shaped, DNA/RNA hybrid adapters (Eurofins; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shigematsu et al., 2017</xref>) to the conserved, exposed 5'-NCCA-3' and 3'-inorganic phosphate-5' ends of uncharged tRNAs using T4 RNA ligase 2 (dsRNA Ligase; New England BioLabs Inc, catalogue number M0239S). We reverse transcribed ligation products to cDNA using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen; catalog number 18080093), and amplified cDNA products by eleven rounds of PCR with Phusion High Fidelity Master Mix with HF Buffer (New England BioLabs Inc, catalog number M0531S) with sample-specific indices (Illumina). We checked the quality and quantity of each PCR product using an Agilent DNA 7500 kit on a Bioanalyzer and a Florescence Nanodrop, respectively, and combined all samples in equimolar amounts into a single tube. We ran the mixture on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel, and excised bands between ~200 bp and ~280 bp size, which are expected to be enriched in tRNA-adapter sequences. Finally, we extracted the excised DNA in deionized water overnight, and removed agarose by centrifugation through filter paper. Quality and quantity of the final product were checked on a Fluorescence Nanodrop. The final product was sequenced by the sequencing facility within the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, using an Illumina NextSeq 550 Output v2.5 kit (single-end, 150 bp reads). Raw reads and analysis files are available from NCBI GEO (accession number GSE198606).</p><p>We sorted raw reads for each sample using exact matches to each unique, 6 bp long Illumina barcode, obtaining a minimum of 707,429 reads per sample of which &gt;99.99% were the expected length (80–151 bp) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We assembled each set of reads to the 49 unique reference tRNA sequences predicted by GtRNAdb 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan and Lowe, 2009</xref>) for <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), allowing up to 10% mismatches, gaps of &lt;3 bp, and up to five ambiguities per read. We discarded reads that aligned equally well to more than one tRNA sequence. Finally, we de novo aligned the unused reads for each sample and checked the resulting contigs to ensure that none contained substantial numbers of tRNA reads. We calculated the within-sample proportion of reads aligned to each tRNA type and mean mature tRNA isotype proportions for each strain across the three replicates. Finally, we used DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Love et al., 2014</xref>) in R (version 3.6.0, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">R Development Core Team, 2021</xref>) to compare the fractional contribution of each tRNA isotype to the respective mature tRNA pool, across pairs of strains (e.g. WT vs. mutant) or media (rich vs. poor). We corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>). The raw YAMAT-seq reads and analysis files are available at the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO accession number GSE198606) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Edgar et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Measuring translation elongation rate</title><p>We measured the translation elongation rate for a subset of our strains, using the native β-galactosidase protein as a reporter as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller, 1972</xref>), with some modifications. Briefly, we induced <italic>lacZ</italic> gene expression in actively growing cultures (OD<sub>600</sub>=0.5, n=2–3) with 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG). Every 15 s, we pipetted out 500 µl culture and immediately mixed it with 100 µl of chloramphenicol (3 mg/ml) to block translation. After 10 mins of incubation on ice, we added 350 µl of Z buffer (reaction buffer) and continued incubation on ice for 1 hr. Next, we added 200 µl of 12 mg/ml ONPG (o-nitro-phenyl galactopyranoside, substrate for β-galactosidase). After 1–1.5 hr of incubation at 30 °C to allow the full development of colored product (o-nitrophenol) due to enzyme activity, we stopped the reaction by adding 500 µl of 1 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. After a brief centrifugation step to collect debris (5000 g, 1 min), we transferred the supernatant to a 96-well microplate to assay the formation of o-nitrophenol by measuring OD<sub>420</sub>. We converted OD values to Miller Units (MU) as per the original protocol, and from a plot of Miller Units (MU) of β-galactosidase vs. time, we estimated the first time point showing an increase in MU (after induction) as the time is taken to synthesize one molecule of β-galactosidase. The elongation rate (in amino acids per second) was inferred by dividing the length of the β-galactosidase protein (1019 amino acids) by this time.</p><p>The above assay informs us about the elongation rate, assuming that all other steps are equal between WT and mutant. Since, we only deleted genes encoding elongator tRNAs to create our mutant strains, this assumption likely holds. We also note that our WT strain contains an <italic>rph</italic> frameshift mutation that leads to pyrimidine starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jensen, 1993</xref>) in M9 medium. Therefore, we cannot make quantitative comparisons across media. However, comparing WT and mutants growing in the same medium is appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Measuring translation capacity with a GFP reporter</title><p>We grew WT and mutants transformed with plasmid pKEN::GFP2 overnight in LB medium with ampicillin for 14–16 hr. We subcultured 1% v/v into M9 with 0.8% glucose and amino acids (with 100 μg/ml ampicillin) and incubated for around 4–5 hr (mid-log phase) before inducing with 0.5 mM IPTG. After induction, we measured GFP and OD<sub>600</sub> in a microplate reader (Infinite Pro Tecan, Austria). We first normalized GFP readout with OD at the same time point and then took the difference in GFP reading between time zero (immediately after induction) and after 1 hr to estimate the amount of GFP produced in an hour. We then normalized this readout for each mutant with the WT, to get the relative translation capacity of mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analysis</title><p>We used GraphPad Prism (9.0.0) for all statistical analysis (except for YAMAT-seq) and to generate heatmaps, and DEseq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Love et al., 2014</xref>) and R version 3.6.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">R Development Core Team, 2021</xref>) for the analysis of YAMAT-seq data as described above.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Yitzhak Pilpel as Reviewing Editor and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Dvir Schirman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Each of the reviewers has comments for you to address (see below).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The induction lag method used to measure the &quot;elongation rate&quot; in Figure 5 quantifies the sum of the time to transcribe lacZ and the time to translate lacZ mRNA. To call it &quot;elongation rate&quot;, the authors should stress the underlying assumption that all steps in b-galactosidase synthesis except elongation are equal in WT and mutant. Of note, MG16555 has an rph frameshift mutation that leads to pyrimidine starvation due to low pyrE expression levels (DOI: 10.1128/jb.175.11.3401-3407.1993). Thus, transcription is likely substantially faster in LB (contains pyrimidines) than in the M9 media.</p><p>2) The concentration of galactose used for poor quality growth medium is not mentioned in the methods.</p><p>3) Line 82: the reason rRNA concentration is more limiting for translation than tRNA is probably not that it is more abundant, but that rRNA concentration affects the concentration of ribozymes/catalysts for translation, while tRNA concentration affects the concentration of tertiary complex (the &quot;substrate&quot;).</p><p>4) Line 317: &quot;so that both rRNA and tRNA would be limiting&quot; is a problematic statement. The levels of both would presumably be reduced, but not likely to both be limiting at the same time.</p><p>5) Line 336: presumably, the proM deletion mutant is growing OK because proL can read the same codon, not because the codon is rare.</p><p>6) Line 339: perhaps more likely than assigning different functionality to identical RNAs, the different deletions result in different concentrations of the tRNA due to e.g. polarity effects in transcription.</p><p>7) Line 464: what is meant by &quot;reduced expression of the deleted tRNA&quot;?</p><p>8) A compelling case that differences in tRNA levels and tRNA/rRNA ratios at different growth rates are largely determined by the location of the respective genes relative to the origin of replication was made recently for <italic>E. coli</italic> and other bacteria (Hu &amp; Lercher, 2021, PLOS Genetics). Gene copy numbers of genes close to the origin are more sensitive to growth rate than genes located close to the terminus. This work would benefit from including the distance to origin in the analysis of the impact of various gene deletions.</p><p>Regarding tRNA measurements by YAMAT-seq:</p><p>The authors should express more clearly in which sense the measurements are &quot;relative&quot;, as it is not the relative expression level but the relative fractional contribution of each tRNA to the respective tRNA pool that is reported (e.g. line 254 is incorrect : DEseq2 was used to measure tRNA expression level differences between pairs of strains&quot;; line 922 is incorrect: &quot;Expression level of all 42 WT tRNA isotypes in poor medium relative to rich medium&quot;, and others, including much of the wording in section &quot;Gene regulation cannot compensate for the loss of tRNA gene copies&quot;).</p><p>A final note is that the reason YAMAT-seq does not report on levels of tRNAs is because a fixed amount of total RNA was used for the procedure (10 ug from each sample). Fast-growing cells have more RNA than slow-growing cells (both more RNA per cell, more RNA per OD, more RNA per ug protein, etc), so 10 ug represents RNA from more cells in the slow-growing cultures than it does in the fast-growing cultures.</p><p>Line 42: it is not completely clear to this reviewer what is meant by &quot;target&quot; and &quot;non-target&quot; tRNAs. Further explanation in the Introduction would be beneficial for some readers (like myself).</p><p>Line 282: was a pBAD plasmid really induced with IPTG, or is it a typo? I am only familiar with the arabinose-induction of pBAD plasmids.</p><p>Figure 2 - Figure Supplement 1 1: Growth curves on a linear scale cannot be used to evaluate growth rates by eye. Showing the curves on semi-log graphs would be much more informative to the reader.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Please be clear and consistent in referencing the figure.</p><p>2. Please address or better explain your methodology, especially how Rrel can be negative.</p><p>3. Please change figure 3 to mark significant and non-significant data points and discuss them in the text.</p><p>4. Please tone down your arguments in places where they sound general when, in effect, they are specific to a condition (e.g., figure 3).</p><p>5. I am missing controls. Please express deleted tRNAs from a plasmid in at least some deletion strains. If the author's hypothesis is true, it will rescue the negative fitness observed in deletion strains in rich media. These controls are needed at least in Figures 2 and 3. Notably, I would like to stress again that it should be done on a subset of the strains, probably the ones that display the strongest effect.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. I think that in the discussion part the authors can discuss the possible cost/benefit effects of deleting one of the two copies of the translation elongation factor EF-Tu (Zuurmond et al. 1999, doi: 10.1007/s004380050934). As this is another example of seeming redundancy of the translation machinery in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and since EF-Tu is known as the most abundant cytoplasmic protein in <italic>E. coli</italic> I think it is an interesting case of translation machinery redundancy, and addressing it should benefit the manuscript.</p><p>2. In the discussion the authors suggest a model that explains their results (line 636). I think this suggested model will be clearer and easier to understand if it is described also through a graphical illustration.</p><p>3. In Figure 2D, I think the figure will be easier to understand with a clearer example of the relevant correlation using real data points. I would replace the bottom right example with one of the panels from Figure 2 —figure supplement 5.</p><p>4. In Figure 3 both panels have the same axes labels (Glycerol to TB / TB to glycerol), according to the figure legend one of them should be switched to (Galactose to TB / TB to galactose).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81005.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The induction lag method used to measure the &quot;elongation rate&quot; in Figure 5 quantifies the sum of the time to transcribe lacZ and the time to translate lacZ mRNA.

We have now mentioned both points in the methods section “Measuring translation elongation”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The concentration of galactose used for poor quality growth medium is not mentioned in the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added this in the methods section &quot;Measuring growth parameters”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Line 82: the reason rRNA concentration is more limiting for translation than tRNA is probably not that it is more abundant, but that rRNA concentration affects the concentration of ribozymes/catalysts for translation, while tRNA concentration affects the concentration of tertiary complex (the &quot;substrate&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed, we have now incorporated this (line 83-84).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Line 317: &quot;so that both rRNA and tRNA would be limiting&quot; is a problematic statement. The levels of both would presumably be reduced, but not likely to both be limiting at the same time.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the sentence to just say that they will both be reduced (line 338-39).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Line 336: presumably, the proM deletion mutant is growing OK because proL can read the same codon, not because the codon is rare.</p></disp-quote><p>The deletion mutant mentioned here is proL (not proM). The proL tRNA is a single-copy tRNA with no tRNA (or ME) backup. Hence, we speculate that its loss has negligible effects because the cognate codon is only used rarely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Line 339: perhaps more likely than assigning different functionality to identical RNAs, the different deletions result in different concentrations of the tRNA due to e.g. polarity effects in transcription.</p></disp-quote><p>By functional differences we meant that at the level of contribution to translation the two tRNAs are different, e.g. due to polarity effects as mentioned in the comment. We did not mean to say the tRNAs have completely distinct functions (outside the context of translation). We have now edited the sentence to avoid confusion (lines 361-362).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Line 464: what is meant by &quot;reduced expression of the deleted tRNA&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>Here, we refer to the deletion of single-copy tRNA genes, which should lead to a complete loss of the relevant tRNA isotypes. In YAMAT-seq data, this will show up as a large drop in the relative contribution of these tRNA isotypes to the tRNA pool (compared to WT). We have now rephrased the text here to avoid confusion (lines 488-489). We have also ensured that throughout the manuscript we have clarified whether we are referring to tRNA genes or tRNA isotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) A compelling case that differences in tRNA levels and tRNA/rRNA ratios at different growth rates are largely determined by the location of the respective genes relative to the origin of replication was made recently for <italic>E. coli</italic> and other bacteria (Hu &amp; Lercher, 2021, PLOS Genetics). Gene copy numbers of genes close to the origin are more sensitive to growth rate than genes located close to the terminus. This work would benefit from including the distance to origin in the analysis of the impact of various gene deletions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. The paper mentioned above also led us to other useful references, which we now cite in the manuscript.</p><p>Distance from the replication origin does not explain differences in the fitness impacts of copies of the same tRNA isotype (e.g. Asn-GUU). We have now included this in the text (lines 362-367) and in a new supplemental figure (Figure 2 supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding tRNA measurements by YAMAT-seq:</p><p>The authors should express more clearly in which sense the measurements are &quot;relative&quot;, as it is not the relative expression level but the relative fractional contribution of each tRNA to the respective tRNA pool that is reported (e.g. line 254 is incorrect : DEseq2 was used to measure tRNA expression level differences between pairs of strains&quot;; line 922 is incorrect: &quot;Expression level of all 42 WT tRNA isotypes in poor medium relative to rich medium&quot;, and others, including much of the wording in section &quot;Gene regulation cannot compensate for the loss of tRNA gene copies&quot;).</p><p>A final note is that the reason YAMAT-seq does not report on levels of tRNAs is because a fixed amount of total RNA was used for the procedure (10 ug from each sample). Fast-growing cells have more RNA than slow-growing cells (both more RNA per cell, more RNA per OD, more RNA per ug protein, etc), so 10 ug represents RNA from more cells in the slow-growing cultures than it does in the fast-growing cultures.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for these thoughtful comments. We agree that the phrasing was incorrect and confusing. We have now clarified in the methods section that YAMAT-seq is like RNA-seq, and only measures the contribution of a given tRNA isotype to the total tRNA pool (lines 221-225). We have also rephrased the text in the entire results section about YAMAT-seq as well as figure legends, to clearly convey the comparisons being made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 42: it is not completely clear to this reviewer what is meant by &quot;target&quot; and &quot;non-target&quot; tRNAs. Further explanation in the Introduction would be beneficial for some readers (like myself).</p></disp-quote><p>This was described with an example in the Introduction (lines 45-52). We have now edited the text there to explain why we call them “target” tRNAs, which is hopefully helpful; and we have now added more explanation in the legend for figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 282: was a pBAD plasmid really induced with IPTG, or is it a typo? I am only familiar with the arabinose-induction of pBAD plasmids.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a mistake, thank you for pointing it out. It was a pKEN plasmid, not pBAD; we have now corrected this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 - Figure Supplement 1 1: Growth curves on a linear scale cannot be used to evaluate growth rates by eye. Showing the curves on semi-log graphs would be much more informative to the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added growth curves on a log scale to this supplementary figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Please be clear and consistent in referencing the figure.</p><p>2. Please address or better explain your methodology, especially how Rrel can be negative.</p><p>3. Please change figure 3 to mark significant and non-significant data points and discuss them in the text.</p><p>4. Please tone down your arguments in places where they sound general when, in effect, they are specific to a condition (e.g., figure 3).</p><p>5. I am missing controls. Please express deleted tRNAs from a plasmid in at least some deletion strains. If the author's hypothesis is true, it will rescue the negative fitness observed in deletion strains in rich media. These controls are needed at least in Figures 2 and 3. Notably, I would like to stress again that it should be done on a subset of the strains, probably the ones that display the strongest effect.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these points, which we have addressed as detailed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. I think that in the discussion part the authors can discuss the possible cost/benefit effects of deleting one of the two copies of the translation elongation factor EF-Tu (Zuurmond et al. 1999, doi: 10.1007/s004380050934). As this is another example of seeming redundancy of the translation machinery in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and since EF-Tu is known as the most abundant cytoplasmic protein in E. coli I think it is an interesting case of translation machinery redundancy, and addressing it should benefit the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion, we have now discussed this work (lines 693-696).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In the discussion the authors suggest a model that explains their results (line 636). I think this suggested model will be clearer and easier to understand if it is described also through a graphical illustration.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have now added a graphical representation as (new) Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 2D, I think the figure will be easier to understand with a clearer example of the relevant correlation using real data points. I would replace the bottom right example with one of the panels from Figure 2 —figure supplement 5.</p></disp-quote><p>Here, we wanted to show the possible relationships and various implications, which would be difficult if we used actual data. Also, given the large variation across panels in the supplemental figure, we worry that choosing one would be misleading. Hence, we have retained the schematic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 3 both panels have the same axes labels (Glycerol to TB / TB to glycerol), according to the figure legend one of them should be switched to (Galactose to TB / TB to galactose).</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected, thank you.</p></body></sub-article></article>
