revealed the importance of biodiversity for stabilizing ecosystem functions through time. Despite the global degradation of soils, whether the loss of soil microbial diversity can destabilize ecosystem functioning is poorly understood. Here, we experimentally quantified the contribution of soil fungal and bacterial communities to the temporal stability of four key ecosystem functions related to biogeochemical cycling. Microbial diversity enhanced the temporal stability of all ecosystem functions and this pattern was particularly strong in plant-soil mesocosms with reduced microbial richness where over 50% of microbial taxa were lost. The stabilizing effect of soil biodiversity was linked to asynchrony among microbial taxa whereby different soil fungi and bacteria promoted different ecosystem functions at different times. Our results emphasize the need to conserve soil biodiversity for the provisioning of multiple ecosystem functions that soils provide to the society.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>grassland plants</kwd><kwd>soil fungi</kwd><kwd>soil bacteria</kwd><kwd>plant community</kwd><kwd>soil community</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>137136</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van der Heijden</surname><given-names>Marcel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR 1451</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmid</surname><given-names>Bernhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Soil microbial diversity loss destabilizes the ability of the soil to function because greater diversity is needed to maintain temporal and functional asynchrony among different microbes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The loss of biodiversity can compromise the functioning of ecosystems and services that the society depends upon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tilman and Downing, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hector and Bagchi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cardinale, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hooper et al., 2012</xref>). For example, evidence is mounting that the reduction in species diversity can reduce multiple ecosystem functions, such as processes that drive nutrient and carbon cycling and plant productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zavaleta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maestre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hautier et al., 2018</xref>). Reduced biodiversity has also been shown to destabilize ecosystem functioning over time, and thus the maintenance of biodiversity is critical to long-term ecosystem sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tilman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hector et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Isbell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hautier, 2015</xref>). Experiments with plant communities have shown that species diversity can support multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously because plant species that do not contribute to that function at a particular time may contribute at another time, or to another function at the same time. Thus, the asynchronous temporal fluctuations among species in their abundance and contribution to various ecosystem functions in more diverse communities contribute to a greater overall ecosystem functioning over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hautier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Isbell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yachi and Loreau, 1999</xref>).</p><p>While the reduction of plant diversity is well known to destabilize ecosystem functioning, effects of soil biodiversity loss on stabilizing ecosystem functioning are still poorly understood. A number of studies have shown that soil biodiversity is rapidly declining in intensively managed soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Helgason et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Birkhofer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Verbruggen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsiafouli et al., 2015</xref>), and one-quarter of soils worldwide are now degraded, causing a reduction of biological productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stavi and Lal, 2015</xref>). Thus, understanding the consequences of soil biodiversity loss is crucial, as there is a growing consensus that soil biota play key roles in ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bardgett and van der Putten, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van der Heijden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2016</xref>) and support a number of ecosystem services, including food production and nutrient cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brussaard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bender et al., 2016</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated that the composition and richness of soil microbiota can predict multiple ecosystem functions, such as plant diversity and productivity, soil carbon assimilation, and nutrient cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradford, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wagg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mori et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wagg et al., 2019</xref>). However, few studies have linked soil microbiota communities to the temporal stability of plant community composition and productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eisenhauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pellkofer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The compositions of soil bacterial and fungal communities are highly dynamic over short time scales, such as months and growing seasons, and temporal changes in composition are further altered by land management practices such as tillage and crop rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lauber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coudrain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wagg et al., 2018</xref>). Whether these temporal dynamics in microbial communities lead to temporal fluctuations in ecosystem functions and if microbial community dynamics are inhibited due to soil microbial biodiversity loss have not been assessed yet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bardgett and van der Putten, 2014</xref>). Past studies have shown that some soil functions do not track soil microbial loss, or they recover rapidly after perturbations of soil microbial communities. This suggests that such functions may either be highly resilient or contain many functionally redundant taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Griffiths et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fitter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allison and Martiny, 2008</xref>). However, functional redundancy is likely to fade as multiple time points and ecosystem functions are considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hector and Bagchi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Isbell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hautier et al., 2018</xref>). Considering that soil biodiversity supports numerous ecosystem functions, we hypothesize that greater soil biodiversity would also maintain a greater and less variable ecosystem functioning through time and would thus stabilize multiple ecosystem functions. Specifically, microbial taxa may fluctuate asynchronously in abundance through time such that different taxa support different functions at different times. This should provide insurance that some microbial taxa that support an ecosystem function will be present at any given time to stabilize the functioning of the ecosystem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Isbell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yachi and Loreau, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mori et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we predict that temporal asynchrony among taxa in diverse soil microbial communities should relate to greater temporal stability in multiple ecosystem functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loreau and de Mazancourt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thibaut and Connolly, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gross et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we decreased soil diversity by filtering out soil organisms based on size along a gradient to assess the effects of soil microbial communities on stabilizing four ecosystem functions. The exclusion of organisms based on size can lead to a functional simplification of soil communities because body size is directly associated with trophic guilds, metabolic rates, population density, and generational turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coudrain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradford, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yodzis and Innes, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wall and Moore, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Woodward, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, the size-based reduction of soil organisms parallels the impact of land management practices, such as soil tillage, that physically damage soil organisms depending on their size and, thus, also disrupts the community structure of soil biota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wagg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jansa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Köhl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Postma-Blaauw et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Using soil sieving gradient (5000, 100, 25, and 0 µm [sterile]), we created a monotonically declining gradient in fungal and bacterial richness among replicated soil-plant ecosystems established in self-contained mesocosms (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 46</sub> = 172.0, p&lt;0.001; and <italic>F</italic><sub>1, 45.7</sub> = 753.9, p&lt;0.001, respectively, for fungal and bacterial richness decline; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1 – </xref>table 1). The decline in diversity over our experimental gradient was maintained throughout the experimental duration (time [factor] by sieve gradient (log-linear) interaction: <italic>F</italic><sub>4, 170.1</sub> = 0.75, p=0.561; and <italic>F</italic><sub>4, 177.1</sub> = 1.60, p=0.174, respectively, for fungi and bacteria; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- table 1). This decline in bacterial richness along the four-step gradient was steepest for the final step from smallest sieve size to the sterile soil treatment), which resulted in a 60% loss of bacterial and 55% loss of fungal richness, compared to the highest soil biodiversity treatment. Community composition differed among the soil diversity treatments and the different time points, for both fungal and bacterial communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> – table 2). All four ecosystem functions (plant biomass production, plant diversity, litter decomposition, and soil carbon assimilation) changed significantly over our soil biodiversity treatment gradient and varied significantly through time depending on the soil biodiversity level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> – tables 3 and 4). Bacterial and fungal richness and community composition were significantly related to all four ecosystem functions, depending on the time, and differences in microbial community composition were all correlated with differences in ecosystem functions at all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>). These results demonstrate that we successfully established a broad gradient of soil microbial diversity, composition, and ecosystem functioning. This enabled us to assess effects of the soil microbial community on the temporal stability of ecosystem functioning, which we calculated as the inverse of the coefficient of variation of ecosystem functions across all five time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tilman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pimm, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tilman, 1999</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Changes in ecosystem functions through time and relationships between soil microbial diversity and multifunctional stability.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Plant biomass production, (<bold>b</bold>) plant diversity, (<bold>c</bold>) litter decomposition, and (<bold>d</bold>) soil carbon assimilation, measured as the δ<sup>13</sup>C in the soil and scaled by the minimum value such that larger positive values indicate a greater amount of δ<sup>13</sup>C detected in the soil.

Plant biomass production was particularly strongly destabilized in our sterile treatment with the lowest soil microbial diversity, exhibiting a ‘boom and bust’ temporal response, where plant biomass was the lowest of all treatments after 11 weeks, then the highest at 22 weeks and steadily declined afterwards to substantially lower values than in all other treatments by 55 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The effects of microbial diversity on the stability of plant biomass production were also significant when the sterile treatment was not considered, showing that microbial diversity is also important for plant community stability even at higher levels of microbial diversity. All mesocosms were initially planted with the same plant community and plant diversity increased steadily over time as communities developed. This occurred in all but the sterile soil treatment, which remained low throughout the experiment. This resulted in the positive effect of microbial diversity on stabilizing plant diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><p>The effect of soil microbial diversity on stabilizing plant biomass and diversity resulted from its influence on the changes in plant community composition. In the sterile and low soil biodiversity treatments, plant communities were dominated by the grass <italic>Lolium perenne</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>) which drove the ‘boom and bust’ trend in biomass production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In contrast, the biomass production by the legume <italic>Trifolium pratense</italic> increased steadily over time and was highest in the highest soil biodiversity treatment, contributing to the greater stability in plant diversity and productivity. The sterile treatment could account for the effect of microbial diversity on supporting more stable plant diversity, as well as the bacterial richness-biomass stability relationship, but not the stabilizing effect that fungal richness had on plant biomass production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> – table 5).</p><p>Fungal richness was significantly related to greater stability in litter decomposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), and soil carbon assimilation was positively related to greater bacterial richness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Using an averaging multifunctionality approach, where multifunctionality is calculated as the standardized average of all ecosystem functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maestre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Byrnes, 2014</xref>), we found that greater microbial diversity (richness of bacteria, fungi, and their scaled average) all showed strong positive relationships with the ability to maintain greater and more stable ecosystem functioning on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Using a multiple threshold approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Byrnes, 2014</xref>) to characterize how many functions achieve an increasing threshold of stabilization with greater diversity, we found that soil microbial diversity had a significant stabilizing effect on multiple functions at thresholds above 30% of the maximum stability value for each function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). At this threshold, more than three functions had high level of temporal stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), showing that high soil biodiversity can promote the stability of multiple functions simultaneously. This stabilizing effect increased to become strongest at a threshold of 72%. Soil bacterial richness had a significant stabilizing effect on multiple functions at low threshold values of 29% and was strongest at 68% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).

The influence of a taxon on an ecosystem service at a given time was considered to be significant when the effect of the presence of the taxon on an ecosystem function was greater than 1.96 (the 95 percentile of the t-distribution) times the SD of the null distribution.

This is supported by our analysis of individual functions, the average response in stability of all four functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maestre et al., 2012</xref>), and the multiple threshold approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Byrnes, 2014</xref>). Our results show that both fungal and bacterial richness support greater stability in multiple functions simultaneously with the strongest effect of microbial richness on stability occurring when functions need to achieve at least 70% of their maximum observed stability. The effect of soil biodiversity loss on multifunctional stability was strongest in our most extreme ‘sterile’ treatment, suggesting a loss of microbial richness over 50% as a potential tipping point over which the stabilizing effect of soil microbial diversity might drop abruptly.</p><p>We found that the stabilizing effect of a diverse soil microbial community is attributed to the asynchronous temporal dynamics in the soil microbial community composition. Despite the strong contribution of the sterile soil treatment to the results, we still found the effects of the composition and temporal asynchrony to be important for stabilizing ecosystem functions even after accounting for our most extreme treatment. To our knowledge, our results demonstrate for the first time that the maintenance of a more diverse soil microbial community allows for greater asynchronous temporal dynamics in the microbial communities to result in the maintenance of higher nutrient and carbon cycling processes through time (reflected here by four key ecosystem functions). This implies that different microbes can complement each other by functioning at different times to provide a stable support for ecosystem functions.</p><p>Asynchrony in microbial communities may arise as microbial community compositional changes track the phenology of the associated plant communities through plant nutrient uptake, root exudates, and litter inputs that generate changes in soil chemistry and resources for soil microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marschner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bray et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buscardo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Upton and Hofmockel, 2019</xref>). For instance, different N-cycling microbes exhibit temporal seasonal dynamics as they are active at different times to contribute to nitrification and denitrification processes that are also linked to plant community development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prosser and Nicol, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Regan, 2017</xref>). Additionally, microbial community composition changes during decomposition as microbes have different resource acquisition strategies where some fast-cycling microbes acquire readily available carbon early, while slow-cycling microbes decompose recalcitrant carbon at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herzog, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alavoine and Bertrand, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Su et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, by having a greater diversity of microbes there is a greater opportunity for different microbes to perform specific functions associated with the different stages of litter decomposition, nutrient and carbon cycling that together maintain the broad ecosystem functions of plant productivity, diversity, decomposition, and carbon assimilation through time.</p><p>Past studies assessing soil microbial diversity-ecosystem functioning relationships have shown that the suppression of soil microbial diversity and abundance can have little impact on particular functions measured at a single time point, possibly due to high redundancy among taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Griffiths et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fitter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allison and Martiny, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Louca et al., 2018</xref>). However, here we show that as more functions and time points are considered, a greater proportion of the microbial community is required to support these functions and correspondingly redundancy, or the proportion of microbes not associated with ecosystem functions, fades away. This is supported by the consistent trend that a greater number of taxa were found to positively support ecosystem functions when more functions and time points were considered, highlighting that increasing the number of taxa ensures the maintenance of the functioning of the overall ecosystem over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Isbell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hautier, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yachi and Loreau, 1999</xref>). This suggests that whereas a large number of soil microbial taxa may overlap in supporting a single function at a single time point, fewer and fewer taxa may overlap in supporting multiple functions over multiple time points. Similar to studies assessing the functional redundancy of plant communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hautier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Isbell, 2011</xref>), as more ecosystem functions and times were considered in the present study, more soil taxa were found to affect the overall functioning of the ecosystem. While high soil microbial diversity may appear functionally redundant for a given broad function, such as microbial respiration and decomposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schimel and Schaeffer, 2012</xref>), there are studies demonstrating low functional redundancy in soils in both broad functions (soil respiration) and specialized functions (degradation of specific organic compounds such as cellulose and microbial toxins)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wohl et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DelgadoBaquerizo, 2016</xref>). Here we found, for instance, that the mycorrhizal fungi <italic>Diversispora</italic> was frequently associated with positive effects on biomass production, but not other functions, while the plant pathogen <italic>Fusarium</italic> was frequently found to positively influence plant diversity and no other functions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> – table 2). Such findings are logical as mycorrhiza are well known to drive plant biomass production (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van der Heijden et al., 2008</xref>) and pathogens can maintain plant diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Petermann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schnitzer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that the composition and diversity of other key groups of soil biota, including protozoa and nematodes not assessed in our study were likely also affected by the sieving treatments and may also have contributed to the observed effect of our soil biodiversity measures on ecosystem functioning and stability either directly or through trophic interactions with soil microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Vries and Shade, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradford, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Trap et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thakur and Geisen, 2019</xref>). Assuming this was the case, this would suggest that the broader spectrum of soil biodiversity beyond the soil microbiome may also hold a key role in promoting multiple ecosystem functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradford, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wagg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mori et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wagg et al., 2019</xref>), their temporal stability and by extension possibly their resistance and resilience to environmental perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Griffiths et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delgado-Baquerizo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Griffiths and Philippot, 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, the effects of soil biodiversity loss and the role of functional redundancy in the soil microbiome for stabilizing soil functions have yet to be fully elucidated in the context of the complexity of interactions among the various trophic levels of soil organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Soliveres et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Studies focussing on plant communities have demonstrated the importance of plant diversity for promoting biomass production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cardinale, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hooper et al., 2012</xref>) and the temporal stability in biomass production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tilman and Downing, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hector and Bagchi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hautier et al., 2018</xref>), as well as building soil carbon pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lange et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). In our model system, we were able to reveal that soil microbial diversity had a direct positive effect on the stability of biomass production that in turn stabilized soil carbon assimilation. Specifically, soil microbial diversity supported a higher stability in biomass production due to its strong effect on lowering the temporal variation in plant biomass production, which was independent of plant diversity. While experimental manipulations of plant diversity are well known to enhance plant productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tilman and Downing, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cardinale, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hooper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tilman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hector et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Isbell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hautier, 2015</xref>), the lack of a direct effect of plant diversity on the stability of biomass production and carbon in our experiment may be not surprising, because all our treatments started off with the same plant diversity while soil communities were experimentally manipulated. At the lowest levels of soil biodiversity, we found that plant productivity initially increased over time and was the most productive. This was driven by the rapid growth of <italic>L. perenne</italic> grass, which is highly competitive for soil nitrogen and is a plant species that is hardly affected by changes in arbuscular mycorrhizal diversity when grown alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wagg et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wagg et al., 2011b</xref>). Its initial high productivity may be due to initial release from pathogens and plant competition at low levels of soil biodiversity. As time progressed, the productivity of this highly productive grass was unsustainable, and the productivity crashed compared with our more diverse treatments, resulting in the ‘boom and bust’ temporal trend. We attribute this decline in productivity at the lowest level of soil biodiversity to the inability of the soil community to maintain the presence and growth of legumes and impaired nutrient availability and reduced nutrient cycling processes needed to maintain higher plant community productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wagg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roscher, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marquard, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schmidtke et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the stability in biomass production, we found that the effect of soil microbial diversity on stabilizing soil carbon assimilation was indirect through its effect on promoting the stability in plant biomass production. This is logical since the primary path for atmospheric carbon to become assimilated into soils is through photosynthesis, upon which plant biomass production is based, that is then transferred to soil microbes symbiotically or through the microbial accumulation of plant-derived carbon through decomposition processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Deyn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Deyn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Merino et al., 2015</xref>). Together with our findings, these results provide support for the concept that there is a tight link between the diversity and composition of the soil microbiome belowground and the biomass production of plants aboveground that together promote and stabilize soil carbon assimilation.</p><p>Earlier studies showed that the diversity and composition of the soil microbiome has a big impact on ecosystem functioning. Yet it had not been shown previously whether altered temporal variations in community composition and biodiversity in the soil microbiome impairs the stability of soil functions. Our study provides a first proof of concept that severe degradation of belowground biological communities reduces multiple ecosystem functions and their stability over time with a likely tipping point (&gt;50% microbial biodiversity loss). Moreover, our work highlights that asynchrony of different microbes can improve the stability of ecosystem functioning over time. Our result is concerning as soil biodiversity is being lost in many parts of the world in response to anthropogenic disturbances and increasing land-use intensification compounded by effects of climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Helgason et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Birkhofer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Verbruggen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsiafouli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stavi and Lal, 2015</xref>). Such biological degradation of soils may likely have cascading effects on their ability to maintain diverse productive plant communities that promote carbon sequestration. Our study shows that this is because there are fewer microbes that are needed to support the cycling of soil nutrients and plant growth at different times throughout the development and growth of plant communities. Consequently, anthropogenic activities that simplify soil diversity are likely to diminish the reliable provisioning of essential ecosystem services.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Experimental grassland communities were established in self-contained mesocosms described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wagg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van der Heijden et al., 2016</xref>).

The bottom of each mesocosm was covered with a 1 cm layer of quartz stones (roughly 1 cm<sup>3</sup> in size) and topped with a propyltex screen (0.5 mm mesh size, Sefar AG, Heiden, Switzerland). Mesocosms were then filled with 5.5 kg (dry mass) of a 50/50 field soil-to-quartz sand mix that was previously sieved through a 5 mm mesh sterilized by autoclaving (120°C for 90 min). The soil for this substrate came from a grassland field in Zürich, Switzerland (47° 25′ 38.71″ N, 8° 31′ 3.91″ E).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Soil inoculum</title><p>Soils were collected from three different fields, having different soil histories. Two of the fields were located in Therwil, Switzerland (47° 30′ 8.9964″ N, 7° 32′ 21.8292″ E, one managed with organic fertilizer (soil attributes: pH = 7.9, P=50.3 mg/kg, N = 41.8 mg/kg, and K = 1.9 mg/kg) and the other with mineral fertilizer (soil attributes: pH = 7.4, P=47.5 mg/kg, N = 44.4 mg/kg, and K = 2.0 mg/kg). A third field as used to collect soil from a site in Freiburg, Germany (47° 58′ 26.058″ N, 7° 46′ 31.5336 E, soil attributes: pH = 7.4, P=41.1 mg/kg, N = 44.8 mg/kg, and K = 1.7 mg/kg). At each site, soil cores (size 10 cm deep) were collected every meter along four transects that were 4 m apart and homogenized per site by sieving through a 5 mm sieve. Different soil origins were used to block for potential site-specific effects so that general conclusions on the soil biodiversity and community compositional treatments can be inferred. The soil biodiversity gradient then was generated by sieving the soils to different sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradford, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wagg et al., 2014</xref>). Here we used four sieving treatments, 5000 µm (5 mm), 100 µm, 25 µm, and 0 µm (sterilized soil inoculum). Soil material not passing through the sieves was autoclaved and included with the unsterilized sieved portion that was used to inoculate the mesocosm substrate. Each mesocosm received inoculum of one of the four sieved soil inoculum treatments. The inoculum which consisted of ≈ 4.5% of the total substrate volume was then thoroughly mixed with the mesocosm substrate. Each of the four soil inoculum treatments was replicated five times using soil from each of the three soil histories for a total of 60 mesocosms (four inoculum treatments by three inoculum origins by five replicates). The mesocosms were set up over eight days and all subsequent data collection methods followed the order in which the mesocosms were set up. The day on which each was set up was used as a blocking factor in the subsequent analysis. Mesocosms were planted with a plant community of 34 individuals: 14 grasses (12 <italic>Lolium perenne</italic> and 2 <italic>Festuca pratensis</italic>), 14 legumes (12 <italic>Trifolium pratense and</italic> 2 <italic>Lotus corniculatus</italic>), and 6 forbs (2 <italic>Achillea millefolium,</italic> 2 <italic>Plantago lanceolate,</italic> and 2 <italic>Prunella vulgaris</italic>). Seeds of each species were surface sterilized in 2.5% hyposodium chlorate for five minutes and rinsing in sterile H<sub>2</sub>O. Seeds were germinated on 1% Agar in Petri dishes and the timing was staggered so that each species exhibited the presence of cotyledon(s) or radicle when planted. Microcosms were established in a glasshouse with natural light subsidized by 400 W high-pressure sodium lamps in order to maintain an environment of 16 hr/25°C days and 8 hr/16°C nights with a light level above 300 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Soil moisture in the microcosms was maintained by watering twice weekly with dH<sub>2</sub>O that first passed through a sterilizing filter before entering the microcosm. Since greenhouse conditions maintain a constant environment, which may not reflect natural temporal environmental variations, we varied the watering regime to simulate an extended period without rain. The variation in precipitation was applied to all of the experimental communities at the same time by withholding watering for 10 days beginning five-and-a-half weeks before each harvest.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Ecosystem functions</title><p>Plant diversity (Shannon <italic>H’</italic>), plant productivity (aboveground biomass produced between harvests), litter decomposition, and carbon assimilation were measured every 11 weeks over 55 weeks (five harvest dates). Plant diversity and plant productivity were measured by harvesting plants 5 cm above the soil surface and dried at 65°C for a minimum of 72 hr. Note that this harvesting treatment mimics typical cutting regimes in real grassland. Litter decomposition was measured in 0.5 mm propyltex mesh litterbags (6 × 6 cm) filled with 1 g of dried <italic>Lolium multiflorum</italic> shoots that were sterilized by autoclaving. Litterbags were buried just below the surface of the soil substrate in each mesocosm. At each harvest, the litterbag was removed, washed clean of soil, dried at 65°C and the remaining litter mass was weighed. The amount of the initial 1 g of litter lost (in mg lost per 11 weeks) was calculated as decomposition. A new litterbag was inserted every harvest. Carbon assimilation was quantified by injecting each mesocosm with 40 ml of <sup>13</sup>C-labelled CO<sub>2</sub> (99%) gas at 36 and 18 hr before each harvest. At each harvest, six soil cores (1.7 mm diameter) were taken to the depth of the mesocosm (~20 g of fresh soil). Soil cores were homogenized and a 0.5 g subsample was frozen at –20°C for DNA extraction. The remaining soil sample was lyophilized and analyzed for <sup>13</sup>C content using a Delta Plus XP isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan). The <sup>13</sup>C ratio was calculated in relation to the international standard VPDB (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite). The more negative the <sup>13</sup>C ratio, the less carbon was fixed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Soil community quantification</title><p>Here, we focused on soil bacterial and fungal communities as they are the most conspicuous and diverse components of the soil microbiome and they play a major role in the functional organization of ecosystems. Following each harvest, DNA was extracted from 500 mg of the homogenized soil samples taken from each microcosm mentioned above. Extraction was done using the FastDNA SPIN Kits for Soil (MP Biomedicals, Switzerland). Using a Quant-iT PicoGreen (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) on a luminescence spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, LS 30, Rotkreuz Switzerland), the extracted DNA was quantified. DNA concentrations were determined using a Qubit fluorometer (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). A barcoded high-throughput sequencing approach was employed to assess the diversity and composition of bacterial and fungal communities. Bacterial communities were examined by amplifying the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using the primers 341F (<named-content content-type="sequence">CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG</named-content>) and 805R (<named-content content-type="sequence">GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC</named-content>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herlemann, 2011</xref>). Fungal communities were examined by amplifying the ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) region using the primers ITS1F (<named-content content-type="sequence">CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA</named-content>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gardes and Bruns, 1993</xref>) and ITS2 (<named-content content-type="sequence">GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC</named-content>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">White et al., 1990</xref>) targeting the ITS1 region. Each primer was tagged with a 5-nucleotide-long padding sequence and an 8-nucleotide-long barcode. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) was conducted on a Biorad PCR Instrument (Biorad, Hamburg, Germany) using the 5PRIME HotMaster Taq DNA Polymerase (Quantabio, Beverly, MA) in 20 μl of reaction mixture. To alleviate stochastic PCR effects of individual reactions, PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)s were performed in triplicate for each DNA sample. Thermal cycling conditions for bacterial 16S rRNA were 2 min initial denaturation at 94°C followed by 30 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94°C, 30 s annealing at 53°C and 30 s elongation at 65°C, and finally a elongation of 10 min at 65°C. Thermal cycling conditions for fungal ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) comprised a 2 min of initial denaturation at 94°C followed by 30 cycles of 45 s denaturation at 94°C, 1 min annealing at 50°C and 90 s elongation at 72°C, and a final elongation of 10 min at 72°C. Amplicons were loaded on a 1% agarose gel to examine PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) efficiency and the lack of PCR amplicons in non-template control reactions. After PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), replicates were pooled for each sample and the concentration of amplicon DNA was determined using PicoGreen (Molecular Probes Inc, Eugene, OR) on the Varian Turbo GTI fluorescence plate reader (Varian Inc, Poalo, CA). Two amplicon libraries (~2 μg each) were assembled by combining barcoded DNA samples and purifying twice with the Agencourt AMPure XP PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) Purification system (Beckman Coulter, IN). For each library, a final volume of 100 μl was obtained by eluting in sterile miliQ water.</p><p>For all amplicons, Illumina 300 bp paired-end sequencing was performed at the Functional Genomics Centre of Zürich (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fgcz.ch">http://www.fgcz.ch</ext-link>). For bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes, the quality of R1 and R2 reads was determined using FastQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews, 2010</xref>). Reads were trimmed to remove base pairs from the end of reads after read quality per sample declined (25 and 50 bp for read1 and read2, respectively). Reads were then merged, allowing a minimum overlap of 15 bp using FLASH v1.2.11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Magoč and Salzberg, 2011</xref>). FASTA format sequences were extracted from FASTQ files quality filtered using the PRINSEQ-lite v0.20.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmieder and Edwards, 2011</xref>). Filtering parameters were: GC range 30–70, minimum mean quality score of 20, no ambiguous nucleotides, low sequence complexity filter with a threshold of 30 in the DUST algorithm. In a next step, the reads were demultiplexed using an in silico PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) approach as part of usearch (v11), allowing max one mismatch in the barcode-primer sequence but not at the 3-prime ends. Sequences were then clustered into OTUs, based on 97% similarity, using the UPARSE pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Edgar, 2013</xref>). Taxonomical information was predicted for bacterial and fungal OTUs based on the SILVA v128 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pruesse, 2007</xref>) and UNITE (V7.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kõljalg, 2005</xref>), respectively. For fungi, the taxonomic prediction was verified using ITSx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bengtsson-Palme, 2013</xref>) and non-fungal OTUs were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Microbial richness-multifunctional stability relationships</title><p>All statistical analyses and data manipulations were done using R software (version 3.0.0), including the packages ‘vegan’ and ‘nlme’. Mixed-effect models assessing the effects of our soil biodiversity treatment gradient and sampling time points on microbial richness and each ecosystem function were fitted using the packages ‘asreml’ (VSN International Ltd.) and ‘pascal’ (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/pascal-niklaus/pascal">https://github.com/pascal-niklaus/pascal</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wagg, 2021</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:ef53496c11e59c016b850c586efffb16ef92ce33;origin=https://github.com/pascal-niklaus/pascal;visit=swh:1:snp:8899174eca5681709cfb9932e98f869fa8b363fe;anchor=swh:1:rev:4759fc326603fe70be1f49c17e7c8227f37766af/">swh:1:rev:4759fc326603fe70be1f49c17e7c8227f37766af</ext-link>) and included the identity of the mesocosm and soil inoculum origin within blocks as random terms as well as the autocorrelation of residuals across sequential harvests. The treatment gradient and sampling time were both fit as continuous variables to trends along our gradient and through time and were followed by fitting the treatment gradient and time as factors to assess non-linearity in the relationships with our experimental gradient and time. Where ecosystem functions were found to follow non-linear temporal trends, polynomial regression (from cubic to fourth order) was used to fit non-linear relationships and the best fit was assessed using the marginal <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of the model and AICc.</p><p>The temporal stability for each ecosystem function (plant productivity, plant diversity, litter decomposition and carbon assimilation) within mesocosms was calculated as the inverse of the coefficient of variation: the ratio of the temporal mean of a function to its temporal SD over the five time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tilman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pimm, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tilman, 1999</xref>). The stability of each ecosystem function was assessed separately for its relationship with microbial richness (the average richness of fungi and bacteria per mesocosm over all time points) using a mixed-effect regression model with soil inoculum origin within experimental blocks as a random term. We also included a contrast term to test whether our microbial diversity-stability relationships were due to the most extreme (sterile) soil biodiversity treatment. In the same way, we assessed the relationship between the average stability of multiple functions after first scaling each function between 0 and 1 (multifunctional stability) with fungal and bacterial richness and a soil microbial diversity index, which we calculated by averaging the fungal and bacterial richness after first scaling them between 0 and 1 for each time point.</p><p>We also used the multifunctional threshold method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Byrnes, 2014</xref>) to quantify the number of functions with temporal stability exceeding a given threshold, where thresholds are varied along a gradient from 5% to 95% of the maximum observed stability of the function. This method allows us to determine whether our measures of soil microbial diversity support multiple functions at high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Byrnes, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pasari et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we explored threshold values between 5% and 95% at 1% intervals. We examined the relationships of soil bacterial and fungal richness as well as their microbial diversity index with the number of functions above a threshold by fitting generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs) with a negative binomial distribution with a logit link function and soil inoculum origin and block as random effects. Separate models were fitted for each of the threshold levels and the slope and associated 95% confidence intervals were recorded.</p><p>Since greater plant diversity is also known to enhance biomass production and soil carbon assimilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tilman and Downing, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hector and Bagchi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Deyn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zavaleta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lange et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hautier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), we assessed the indirect effects of soil microbial diversity on the stability of biomass production and soil carbon assimilation through their influence on plant diversity using a multi-model comparison and SEM) approach. First, we assessed all possible combinations of soil microbial diversity and plant diversity as predictors of the stability of plant biomass production as well as all possible combinations of soil microbial diversity, plant diversity, plant biomass production and the stability in plant biomass production as predictors of the stability in soil carbon assimilation using linear regression with soil inoculum origin and block as random effects. Models were compared based on AICc and marginal R<sup>2</sup> values. We then used the results of these models to construct SEM models to assess direct versus indirect effects of soil microbial diversity on the stability of biomass production and soil C assimilation. Since assessing direct and indirect paths of microbial diversity on the stability of biomass production and carbon assimilation is a fully saturated model and since stability is the ratio of the temporal mean to variance (SD), we decomposed the effects of soil microbial diversity on stability via their effects on the temporal mean and SD of biomass production and soil C assimilation. This also allows to assess the relative effects of whether stability is driven more by a higher overall value (temporal mean) or smaller temporal variation or both relatively equally.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Effects of microbial taxa on different functions at particular times</title><p>We tested whether the accumulation of taxa affected ecosystem functioning across functions and times. In order to do so, we sampled all combinations of the four functions at each time and all combinations of times for each function considered and quantified the proportion of unique taxa that promoted or reduced ecosystem functioning at least once. The effect of each operational taxonomic unit (taxon) on a given ecosystem function was generated by randomly reassigning the ecosystem function and calculating the difference in the mean ecosystem function when the taxon was absent or present over 999 iterations. This generated simulated means and SDs. The taxon-specific standardized effect size (SES) was then determined as the difference in the observed and simulated effects divided by the simulated SD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mori et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gotelli et al., 2011</xref>). Taxa were considered to have a significant impact on an ecosystem function if their |SES| &gt;1.96, corresponding to a 5% error probability that the difference was not zero. We then examined how the composition of soil bacterial and fungal taxa that were significantly associated to greater or reduced ecosystem functioning changed with the number of functions or times considered using GLMMs with beta-binomial distribution and soil inoculum origin as random effect. If completely unique sets of taxa affect different functions at any particular time or any particular function at different times, then the relationship between the proportion of taxa affecting ecosystem functioning and the number of functions or times considered, respectively, would be a positive linear relationship with slope 1. On the other hand, if completely identical sets of taxa were involved, then the relationships would be horizontal with slope 0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hector and Bagchi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Isbell, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Using the taxa that were found to be significantly positively related to an ecosystem function at any given time, we then calculated their stability (here termed species stability) and synchrony in their abundance. Species stability is the average coefficient of variation in the abundance of each fungal and bacterial taxon. Synchrony was calculated as the average of the covariance among all pairs of fungal and bacterial taxa after first standardizing their abundance (mean = 0, SE (Standard Error) = 1). We then assessed the relationships between the stability and synchrony of microbial OTUs that positively supported a function at any given time with the temporal stability of that function using separate regression models and contrasts assessing the influence of the sterile soil treatment on the relationship as was done for the richness-stability relationships mentioned above.</p><p>Code availability: R code will be made publicly available upon acceptance. </p><p>Data availability: All data will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Klaus Schitterer, Ernst Brack, Jochen Mayer, and Paul Mäder at the DOK Trial for soil collection and access to the field site, and Jan-Hendrik Dudenhöffer, Christoph Sax, and Alain Held for greenhouse support.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Akira Mori (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This well-written paper concerns a timely topic: What is the relationship between microbial diversity/asynchrony and ecosystem stability? The study is one of the first to link soil biodiversity to ecosystem stability, and as such, it has potential to become a reference paper in the field. The authors quantified diversity and functions with several rigorous approaches, and the findings are overall sound, providing important empirical data that have often been lacking for soil – an important compartment of ecological systems. Importantly, the work extends our understanding of diversity effects on ecosystem function beyond plants, the focus of most contributions in this area.</p><p>The work, however, would considerably benefit from more appropriate framing of the results. In the current form, the emphasis is on stabilizing effects and asynchronous dynamics of soil microbes, claimed to ensure multiple ecosystem functions, but with little attention to possible processes and mechanisms underlying these observations. Not only must there be a discussion of potential processes and mechanisms for broader appeal of the work, and to advance the theory of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, but from the outset (that is, in the Introduction) there is already a need to improve the framing of the study. We acknowledge that it is not fully possible to identify possible mechanisms based on the study design, but the area in general has to begin to go beyond merely observing relationships between diversity and function(s).</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>State already in the Abstract what members of the microbial community are considered.</p><p>You state &quot;negatively affects multiple ecosystem functions&quot;. This is too vague. Please be more specific and concrete what you mean.</p><p>Please explain what exactly is meant with &quot;making biodiversity a cornerstone for long-term sustainability&quot;. The stabilizing effects of biodiversity to ensure stable provisioning of ecosystem services are important. However, the current expression needs prior knowledge, which a general audience is unlikely to have. Sustainability itself is used very widely. Please be more specific here and elsewhere in the text.</p><p>&quot;Functions&quot; is also used without clear definitions. It is helpful for readers if clear and brief definitions are provided for this terminology. Without this, it is hard for most readers to follow the arguments in the second paragraph.</p><p>What is meant with &quot;soil degradation&quot;? It can be loss of soil biota, but other possibilities can be also included, such as pollution, erosion and so on.</p><p>Please provide assumptions that motivate the experimental manipulation, e.g., how this diversity loss is realistic reflecting a scenario of soil degradation. Best to do this early on, for example at the end of the Introduction.</p><p>Define stability and state how it was calculated.</p><p>Define temporal asynchrony, and &quot;asynchronous dynamics&quot;. Because of such dynamics, microbes are less redundant. We do agree that this is important, but the argument here sounds more like interpretation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62813.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>State already in the Abstract what members of the microbial community are considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We now state that we assessed fungal and bacterial communities: “Here we experimentally quantified the contribution diversity and the temporal dynamics in the composition of soil fungal and bacterial communities.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>You state &quot;negatively affects multiple ecosystem functions&quot;.

Best to do this early on, for example at the end of the Introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now moved the assumptions for the experimental manipulation that was in the methods up to the last paragraph of the Introduction. “The exclusion of organisms based on size can lead to a functional simplification of soil communities as body size is directly associated with trophic guilds, metabolic rates, population density and generational turnover (Bradford et al., 2002, Yodzis and Innes 1992, Woodward et al., 2005, Coudrain et al., 2016). Furthermore, the size-based reduction of soil organisms parallels the impact of land management practices, such as soil tillage, that physically damage soil organisms depending on their size and thus, also disrupting the community structure of soil biota (Jansa et al., 2003, Postma-Blaauw et al., 2010, Köhl et al., 2014, Wagg et al., 2018).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Define stability and state how it was calculated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now defined temporal stability: “we hypothesize that greater soil biodiversity should also maintain a greater and less variable ecosystem functioning through time and thus stabilize multiple ecosystem functions.” and: “This enabled us to assess effects of the soil microbial community on the temporal stability of ecosystem functioning, which we calculated as invariability, the inverse of the coefficient of variation of ecosystem functions across all five time points (Tilman et al., 2006; Pimm, 1984; Tillman, 1999).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Define temporal asynchrony, and &quot;asynchronous dynamics&quot;. Because of such dynamics, microbes are less redundant. We do agree that this is important, but the argument here sounds more like interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>Asynchrony is now clarified at the end of the first paragraph of the Introduction: “Thereby the asynchronous temporal fluctuations among species in their abundance and contribution to various ecosystem functions in more diverse communities contributes to a greater overall ecosystem functioning over time (Hautier et al., 2018; Isbell et al., 2011, Yachi and Loreau, 1999).”</p><p>We have also reworded the sentences: “However, functional redundancy is likely to fade as multiple time points and ecosystem functions are considered (Hector and Bagchi, 2007; Isbell et al., 2011, Hautier et al., 2018). Considering that soil biodiversity has been shown to support numerous ecosystem functions, we hypothesize that greater soil biodiversity should also maintain a greater and less variable ecosystem functioning through time and thus stabilize multiple ecosystem functions. Specifically, microbial taxa may fluctuate asynchronously through time where different taxa support different functions at different times, thus providing insurance that some of these microbial taxa will be present at any given time to stabilize the functioning of the ecosystem (Isbell et al., 2011; Yachi and Loreau 1999; Mori et al., 2016)”</p></body></sub-article></article>
