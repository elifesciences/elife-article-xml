(Gwl), and the resultant pEndos inhibits the phosphatase PP2A-B55, which would otherwise prematurely reverse many CDK-driven phosphorylations. We show here that PP2A-B55 is the enzyme responsible for dephosphorylating pEndos during M phase exit. The kinetic parameters for PP2A-B55’s action on pEndos are orders of magnitude lower than those for CDK-phosphorylated substrates, suggesting a simple model for PP2A-B55 regulation that we call inhibition by unfair competition. As the name suggests, during M phase PP2A-B55’s attention is diverted to pEndos, which binds much more avidly and is dephosphorylated more slowly than other substrates. When Gwl is inactivated during the M phase-to-interphase transition, the dynamic balance changes: pEndos dephosphorylated by PP2A-B55 cannot be replaced, so the phosphatase can refocus its attention on CDK-phosphorylated substrates. This mechanism explains simultaneously how PP2A-B55 and Gwl together regulate pEndos, and how pEndos controls PP2A-B55.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01695.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01695.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01695.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The most dramatic stage of the cell division cycle is M phase, when the cell splits into two genetically identical daughter cells. If this process goes wrong, the cell might die, so cells employ a complicated regulatory process to ensure that M phase begins and ends at the right time.</p><p>As with many biological processes, regulation of the cell cycle depends on the activation and inhibition of a range of enzymes. Enzymes act as biological catalysts, binding target molecules (substrates) to active sites so that chemical reactions can take place. However, the activity of the enzyme can be shut down if a different type of molecule, called a competitive inhibitor, binds to the active site.</p><p>For M phase to proceed, an enzyme called M phase promoting factor adds phosphate groups to hundreds of target proteins. At the end of M phase, a different enzyme, called PP2A-B55, removes these phosphate groups. Cells can enter M phase because an inhibitor called Endosulfine blocks the active site of the PP2A-B55 enzyme. However, the cells need to unblock the PP2A-B55 enzyme at the end of M phase. Williams et al. have now established the mechanism behind this unblocking of the PP2A-B55 enzyme.</p><p>One basis for this mechanism is that Endosulfine works as an inhibitor only when it is phosphorylated (contains a phosphate group). Throughout M phase, a plentiful supply of newly phosphorylated Endosulfine inhibitor molecules binds very tightly to the active sites of the PP2A-B55 enzyme molecules, blocking the enzyme’s more loosely binding substrates from accessing the active sites. The second basis for this mechanism is that PP2A-B55 can also slowly remove the phosphate groups from Endosulfine molecules bound at the active site. In other words, phosphorylated Endosulfine works as an inhibitor only because it is really a substrate with special properties. It binds very tightly to the active site, where it is destroyed very slowly. For this reason, Williams et al. have named the process inhibition by unfair competition.</p><p>In the final stages of M phase, the cell cannot produce any more phosphorylated Endosulfine molecules, and the PP2A-B55 enzyme can then destroy all the existing inhibitors. Even though this reaction is relatively slow, it is still achieved within a couple of minutes. After its active site is no longer blocked, the PP2A-B55 enzyme is then free to remove the phosphate groups from the target proteins, and M phase can come to an end.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01695.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01695.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>phosphatase</kwd><kwd>kinase</kwd><kwd>M phase exit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM048430</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldberg</surname><given-names>Michael L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM051366</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wadzinski</surname><given-names>Brian E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK070787</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wadzinski</surname><given-names>Brian E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mechanism of inhibition by unfair competition is central to determining the protein phosphorylation states that govern cell cycle transitions between M phase and interphase.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Entry of cells into M phase of mitosis or meiosis requires the phosphorylation of thousands of sites on hundreds of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dephoure et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lindqvist et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dulla et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>). Many of these sites are substrates of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), most notably MPF (M phase-promoting factor; CDK1-Cyclin B). CDK phosphosites are ‘proline-directed’, being phosphorylated at serine or threonine followed by proline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nigg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holmes and Solomon, 1996</xref>). These M phase-specific phosphorylations must eventually be removed so that mitotic/meiotic cells can reset to interphase. PP2A-B55 (heterotrimeric protein phosphatase 2A composed of a catalytic C subunit, a structural A subunit, and a B55-type regulatory subunit) is the phosphatase responsible for removing many key CDK-generated phosphorylations at the conclusion of M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clarke et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mayer-Jaekel et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mochida and Hunt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castilho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mochida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmitz et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The circuitry’s basic logic suggests that PP2A-B55 activity must be downregulated when cells go into M phase; if not, the phosphorylations catalyzed by MPF would be prematurely removed, preventing M phase entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clarke et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 1994</xref>). Indeed, a regulatory module that turns off PP2A-B55 specifically during M phase has recently been characterized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In brief, MPF phosphorylates and thereby activates the Greatwall kinase (Gwl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blake-Hodek et al., 2012</xref>). Activated Gwl phosphorylates small proteins of the Endosulfine family (Endos; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gharbi-Ayachi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mochida et al., 2010</xref>]) at a unique, highly conserved site. Gwl-phosphorylated Endos (pEndos) binds to and inactivates PP2A-B55, thus protecting a major class of CDK-governed phosphorylations from premature removal during M phase (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glover, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lorca and Castro, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hunt, 2013</xref>). The Gwl→pEndos ⊣ PP2A-B55 pathway is critical for M phase entry and maintenance in frog egg extracts, starfish oocytes, and in many cell types in culture or within metazoan organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Archambault et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgess et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hara et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lorca et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Voets and Wolthuis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yu et al., 2004</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01695.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Function of the Gwl → pEndos ⊣ PP2A-B55 module in cell cycle transitions.</title><p>The major driver for transitions between interphase and M phase is the cyclic activation and degradation of MPF (Cdk1-Cyclin B). When activated (in part through a feed-forward autoregulatory loop involving the kinases Myt1 and Wee1 and the phosphatase Cdc25; not shown), MPF phosphorylates many substrates (CDKSs) that play key roles in M phase events. One such MPF substrate is the kinase Greatwall (Gwl), which in its active form phosphorylates Endosulfine (Endos). Phosphorylated Endos binds to and inhibits the phosphatase PP2A-B55. This inhibition protects MPF substrates, including components of the autoregulatory loop, from premature dephosphorylation during M phase entry. During M phase exit, MPF is inactivated by degradation of its Cyclin B component (not shown), and PP2A-B55 becomes reactivated to dephosphorylate many MPF substrates. M phase exit also requires the dephosphorylation and inactivation of both Gwl and Endos. Here, we show that PP2A-B55 catalyzes Endos dephosphorylation. The activities responsible for the inactivation of Gwl currently remain unknown.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01695.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01695.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01695-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>In this report, we explore how this M phase activation system is reversed when cells exit mitosis or meiosis. Not only must CDK-dependent phosphorylations be removed by newly reactivated PP2A-B55, but also Gwl and pEndos must be inactivated at the end of M phase by the removal of their stimulatory phosphorylations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). If Gwl were to remain active, it would continually keep Endos phosphorylated; PP2A-B55 would stay inactive and the system would remain in M phase because mitotic phosphorylations could not be removed. On the other hand, if Gwl alone were inactivated but pEndos were to stay phosphorylated, M phase would again be maintained. We focus here on the second part of this equation by identifying the phosphatase that dephosphorylates and turns off pEndos.</p><p>At the onset of these investigations, we thought that pEndos inactivation could not be achieved solely by PP2A-B55. Not only is the Gwl-phosphorylated pEndos site not proline-directed, as are CDK targets, but also a system based only on PP2A-B55 would be closed and futile: if PP2A-B55 is inactive during M phase, how could this ‘dead‘ enzyme turn itself back on? Clearly, the ‘anti-Endos’ phosphatase(s) targeting Gwl-phosphorylated pEndos must instead be active during at least late M phase. As we will show, the expectation that anti-Endos is active during M phase has been borne out. However, counterintuitively, we found that almost all of this anti-Endos activity is contributed by PP2A-B55. This surprising conclusion is made possible because the kinetic parameters of this enzyme for pEndos and for CDK-phosphorylated substrates are very different. Based on this divergence, we suggest a straightforward mechanism we call ‘inhibition by unfair competition’ that explains how pEndos acts both as an inhibitor and a substrate of PP2A-B55, and how this phosphatase can simultaneously be ‘on’ for some substrates but ‘off’ for others. This mechanism may have broad implications for the control of other cellular protein phosphatases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>As a first step in identifying the phosphatase(s) that dephosphorylate and inactivate pEndos, we assayed various cellular extracts for the release of <sup>32</sup>P from recombinant pEndos previously phosphorylated by Gwl. The extracts’ anti-Endos activities were compared with their phosphatase activities against other representative substrates used as internal controls. Most often, we used the recombinant polypeptide CDKS (CDK substrate) phosphorylated in vitro by CDK1-Cyclin A (‘Materials and methods’). Previous studies have shown that dephosphorylation at this site is specifically catalyzed by PP2A-B55 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mochida and Hunt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castilho et al., 2009</xref>); hereafter we reference this dephosphorylation as the ‘anti-CDKS’ activity. We obtained very similar results in several experiments using a different CDK substrate that includes Fizzy (Fzy) phosphorylated at Ser50, which is also a specific target of PP2A-B55 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mochida and Hunt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castilho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mochida et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2010</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Anti-Endos remains active during M phase</title><p>We initiated our search for the anti-Endos phosphatase by asking if this activity has the basic characteristic predicted by the logic of the system: in contrast with the anti-CDKS activity of PP2A-B55, which is off during M phase, the anti-Endos phosphatase should remain active during M phase to permit subsequent M phase exit. This question could be addressed readily using extracts of <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs, which are prepared in an M phase state but can be induced to exit M phase by addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Murray and Kirschner, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Murray, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tunquist and Maller, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows that in accordance with this prediction, considerable anti-Endos activity is indeed seen during M phase. The level is roughly half that seen in interphase; as will be explained below, we believe this difference results from competition between exogenous radiolabeled pEndos and endogenous unlabeled pEndos present in M phase but not interphase. As expected from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mochida and Hunt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castilho et al., 2009</xref>), anti-CDKS activity (i.e., PP2A-B55) was completely blocked in M phase extracts and strongly induced by treatment with Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01695.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Characterization of anti-Endos in extracts.</title><p>In all parts of this figure, red circles depict anti-Endos, whereas blue squares represent anti-CDKS.

Anti-Endos and anti-CDKS activities were both considerably more sensitive to fostriecin than were the dephosphorylations of two other substrates, CDK-phosphorylated histone H1v1.0, which is substantially targeted by PP1-like enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Paulson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Qian et al., 2011</xref>), and histone H3, which is apparently a substrate for both a fostriecin-sensitive and a fostriecin-resistant phosphatase. The predominant anti-Endos activity in many cell types (∼70–90% of the total depending on the experiment) is thus due to PP2A, PP4, or PP6. Because the major anti-Endos activity displays closely similar sensitivities to okadaic acid or fostriecin when comparing M phase and interphase frog egg extracts, it appears that the same phosphatase is responsible for this activity during both cell cycle stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 1C and 2A</xref>).</p><p>A minor fraction of anti-Endos is nonetheless fostriecin-resistant; this part of the activity is labile and is seen in some extract preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C,F</xref>) but not others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D,E</xref>).

These drugs have been reported to be much more effective as inhibitors of PP1 than PP2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gupta et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitsuhashi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kelker et al., 2009</xref>). This conclusion was verified in our own system using purified enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>) and by the tautomycetin sensitivity of phosphatase activity in extracts against the PP1-specific substrate Histone H1v1.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, the anti-Endos activity in all extracts tested is 6- to 10-fold more resistant to tautomycetin than is anti-CDKS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–F</xref>). This result is surprising because we had not anticipated the existence of a PPP family phosphatase more tautomycetin-resistant than PP2A-B55. The tautomycetin/tautomycin resistance of anti-Endos is due to the major, fostriecin-sensitive component, because extracts lacking the labile fostriecin-resistant enzyme are still resistant to tautomycetin (the extracts used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> are identical).</p><p>Second, we found that in contrast to anti-CDKS, anti-Endos is relatively unaffected by the presence of constitutively activated Endos. Endosulfine thiophosphorylated by Gwl acts in vitro as a specific inhibitor of PP2A-B55’s anti-CDKS activity; this effect is also observed using Endos bearing a phosphomimetic mutation of the Gwl target site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gharbi-Ayachi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mochida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2012</xref>).

The anti-Endos activity in the peak fractions has the same characteristics as in concentrated extracts: it is sensitive to okadaic acid and fostriecin, but insensitive to tautomycetin and phosphomimetic <italic>Drosophila</italic> Endos (data not shown). The fractionation results are consistent with the idea that anti-Endos is indeed the PP2A-B55 heterotrimer and further exclude most other PPP enzymes as candidates.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01695.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mono-Q chromatography of HeLa extracts.</title><p>Total extract from asynchronous HeLa cells (high speed supernatant; HS) was applied to the column; FT is the flow-through.

(To appreciate the difficulties inherent in these measurements, it is informative to consider that, of more than 6200 enzymatic reactions currently cataloged in the BRENDA enzyme database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brenda-enzymes.org">http://www.brenda-enzymes.org</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schomburg et al., 2013</xref>), only three have <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> values less than 10 nM and none has a subnanomolar <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub><italic>.</italic>) In any event, the differences between the reactions using pEndos or pCDKS substrates are so pronounced that any variations within the ranges shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> are ultimately inconsequential to the models presented below.</p><p>These unusual kinetic properties explain the apparent paradox that a single enzyme, PP2A-B55, exhibits both anti-CDKS and anti-Endos activities that differ markedly in their responses to inhibition by both tautomycetin/tautomycin and an Endos phosphomimetic protein and to the dilution of extracts. In each case, the discrepancy is explained by careful quantitative attention to the relationship between the <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> of the inhibitor and the <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> of the target: roughly speaking, an inhibitor will be effective only if its <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is less than the <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> for the substrate. Thus, as was seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, tautomycetin, which has an IC<sub>50</sub> (which provides a very rough estimate of <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) of 62 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitsuhashi et al., 2001</xref>), effectively inhibits PP2A-B55 dephosphorylation of pCDKS (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> ∼ 90 μM, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), but only weakly inhibits PP2A-B55 dephosphorylation of pEndos (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> ∼ 1 nM, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The same consideration explains the difference in inhibition by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> S68 Endos phosphomimetic protein, whose IC<sub>50</sub> (approximately 500 nM from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) is again intermediate between that for dephosphorylation of pEndos and pCDKS. Although the identity of the inhibitor(s) present in extracts that presumably underlie the dilution effects seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> are unknown, the different sensitivities of anti-Endos and anti-CDK to extract dilution can be rationalized if the inhibitors’ <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> values are intermediate between the <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>’s of pEndos and pCDKS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>pEndos inhibition of PP2A-B55 depends on competition at the active site</title><p>Two findings clearly indicate that pEndos interacts with the active site of PP2A-B55. First, pEndos is a substrate that is dephosphorylated by this enzyme at a measurable rate; and second, pEndos competes with okadaic acid, a drug known to bind only to PP2A’s active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xing et al., 2006</xref>). Our results provide no indication that pEndos inhibits PP2A-B55 by binding to a second, allosteric site separate from the active site at which it is dephosphorylated. Such allosteric down-regulation would cause the rate of pEndos dephosphorylation to decrease when the substrate is added at very high concentrations, but this is not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Furthermore, the different responses of purified PP2A-B55’s anti-Endos and anti-CDKS activities to the addition of phosphomimetic <italic>Drosophila</italic> Endos (S68D in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) also argue strongly against inhibition at an allosteric site. If pEndos inhibited PP2A-B55 by binding to a site other than the active site, phosphomimetic Endos would have been expected to inhibit the dephosphorylations of pEndos and pCDKS at identical concentrations, and this is clearly not the case.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> provides yet another demonstration that the ability of pEndos to inhibit PP2A-B55 is mostly dependent on interactions at the enzyme’s active site. We assayed the response of PP2A-B55’s anti-CDKS activity to increasing concentrations of either unphosphorylated Endos or Endos previously thiophosphorylated by Gwl kinase; the incorporated thiophosphate cannot be removed by this enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morgan et al., 1976</xref>, and data not shown). The IC<sub>50</sub> of thiophosphorylated Endos determined in this way was 197 ± 14 pM; by comparison, the IC<sub>50</sub> of nonphosphorylated Endos was measured to be 566 ± 65 nM. Thus, the (thio)phosphorylation of Endos increases its binding affinity for PP2A-B55 about 3000-fold. Although these data do not preclude the existence of interactions outside of the active site and involving regions of Endos distant from the Gwl-phosphorylated site, it is clear that most of the binding is dictated by insertion of the phosphorylated residue into the active site, where it can then be dephosphorylated. Indicative of the strong affinity between activated Endos and PP2A-B55, the IC<sub>50</sub> of thiophosphorylated Endos is only about twice that of okadaic acid measured in similar assays (107 ± 10 pM <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), in close accordance with previous determinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kam et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Walsh et al., 1997</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01695.020</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Dose-response curves for PP2A-B55 inhibitors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The ability of PP2A-B55 (at 0.125 nM) to dephosphorylate radioactive CDKS substrate (at 5 μM) was measured in the presence of varying amounts of the following inhibitors: okadaic acid (green), thiophosphorylated Endos (black), non-radioactive pEndos (during a 30-min incubation [pink] and a 120-min incubation [red]), and unphospohorylated Endos (blue). Thiophosphorylation by Gwl kinase makes Endos into a much stronger inhibitor of PP2A-B55 than unphosphorylated Endos; the affinity of thiophosphorylated Endos is only about twofold lower than that of okadaic acid. Non-radioactive pEndos is a less efficient inhibitor of PP2A-B55 than is thiophosphorylated Endos because the enzyme dephosphorylates pEndos during the course of incubation; the longer pEndos is exposed to the enzyme, the higher is the concentration of pEndos required to achieve the same degree of inhibition.

By dephosphorylating pEndos inhibitor that can no longer be replenished once Gwl is inactivated, PP2A-B55 is now freed to recognize its normal, CDK-phosphorylated substrates. We tested this idea by setting up an in vitro analog of this aspect of M phase exit. We added varying amounts of non-radioactive pEndos to PP2A-B55, and monitored the enzyme’s ability to dephosphorylate radioactive pCDKS added at the same time. The results, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, show clearly that pEndos indeed inhibits PP2A-B55-mediated pCDKS dephosphorylation. Much higher concentrations of pEndos than thiophosphorylated Endos are needed to achieve the same degree of inhibition, which is to be expected if pEndos is being inactivated during the incubation. As the time of incubation increases, PP2A-B55 consumes more pEndos, so even higher concentrations of pEndos are required for the same amount of inhibition. Comparing the effects of pEndos inhibition after 30- and 120-min incubations demonstrates that PP2A-B55 cannot recognize the pCDKS substrate until the majority of the pEndos in the same tube has been dephosphorylated. We estimate that the <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> for the dephosphorylation of pEndos in these reactions is between 0.03 and 0.12 s<sup>−1</sup>, consistent with the range previously determined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> provides straightforward evidence for the automatic reset of PP2A-B55 activity that we postulate occurs after the enzyme has succeeded in inactivating pEndos.

The time courses of pCDKS dephosphorylation, assayed by <sup>32</sup>P release, were then measured. A clear delay in pCDKS dephosphorylation of roughly 35 min is visible in the sample containing pEndos, after which the rate of the reaction approaches the initial rate observed in the absence of Endos inhibitors. (This delay is longer than would occur in cells because the ratio of pEndos to the enzyme is much higher than the physiological condition. Also, even stronger in vivo inhibition is predicted because the physiological pEndos concentration is many times higher than the concentration used here, which was limited by experimental constraints.)

(1) <italic>Inhibitor specificities</italic>: all of the anti-Endos activity (whether in M phase or interphase) is sensitive to okadaic acid and calyculin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and the majority is highly sensitive to fostriecin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the catalytic subunit of the anti-Endos phosphatase is PP2A or its less abundant relatives PP4 or PP6. Furthermore, the facts that tautomycetin and the S68D <italic>Drosophila</italic> phosphomimetic Endos protein are such weak inhibitors of anti-Endos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) can be most easily explained if the anti-Endos phosphatase has a very low <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> for pEndos—below that for either inhibitor—as is the case for PP2A-B55. (2) <italic>Ablation of phosphatase activities</italic>: depletion of PP2A-A or PP2A-C from S2 tissue culture cells removes most anti-Endos from extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), while depletion of PP4 from HeLa cells does not affect this activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae mutant for <italic>twins</italic>, which encodes the sole B55-type regulatory subunit of PP2A in flies, exhibit very little anti-Endos, while mutations in genes for other PPP family catalytic and regulatory subunits do not impede pEndos dephosphorylation in larval extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Furthermore, highly purified PP2A-B55 heterotrimer displays robust anti-Endos activity whose properties match that of the predominant anti-Endos activity in extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Because most of our experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were performed with extracts prepared from unsynchronous cells (the large majority of which are in interphase), it is conceivable that a phosphatase other than PP2A-B55, that is activated only for a very short period following anaphase onset, is the enzyme responsible for dephosphorylating pEndos during M phase exit. We believe that this possibility is extremely remote for several reasons. (i) As discussed below, the inhibition by unfair competition mechanism we propose is sufficiently fast to account for the observed rapidity of M phase exit. (ii) The characteristics of the M phase and interphase anti-Endos activities measured in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts are very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 1C and 2A</xref>); PP2A-B55’s ability to dephosphorylate pEndos is therefore constitutive with respect to the cell cycle (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). (iii) Because of its extremely low <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>, pEndos is so tightly bound to PP2A-B55 during M phase that no other hypothetical phosphatase would be able to inactivate it in a reasonable time frame; the theoretical simulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> below illustrates this point. We thus see no reason to postulate the existence of such a transiently activated phosphatase, and we think this possibility is incompatible with the observed relationship between PP2A-B55 and pEndos.<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01695.022</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Theoretical time-course of pEndos dephosphorylation and PP2A/B55 activation at the end of M-phase.</title><p>These calculations make three assumptions: First, consistent with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gharbi-Ayachi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mochida et al., 2010</xref>), Endos was completely phosphorylated during M phase.

At high pEndos concentrations above the intracellular concentration of PP2A-B55, PPX could dephosphorylate the excess pEndos that was not bound to PP2A-B55. However, this dephosphorylation would have little regulatory consequence: as soon as the pEndos concentration is reduced to the intracellular concentration of PP2A-B55, the remaining pEndos would be protected from dephosphorylation by PPX due to the very tight (nanomolar or subnanomolar) binding of pEndos to PP2A-B55. The consequences of this conclusion to the dynamics of the M phase-to-interphase transition will be further explored later in the ‘Discussion’.</p><p>Since the original submission of this manuscript, three other papers have been published whose results bear on our identification of PP2A-B55 as the major anti-Endos phosphatase. The results from two of these studies support this conclusion. First, S Mochida measured the IC<sub>50</sub> of pEndos and thiophosphorylated Endos and obtained values very close to those shown in our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mochida, 2013</xref>). Moreover, he demonstrated that Endos bound by PP2A-B55 is in close proximity to both the B55 and C (catalytic) subunits of the enzyme, consistent with a location at the active site. An extremely tight association of phosphorylated Endos with the PP2A-B55 active site is an essential feature of our inhibition by unfair competition model. Second, during the course of an investigation that will be discussed further below, the laboratory of F A Barr provisionally identified PP2A-B55 as the phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylating pEndos in a mammalian cell system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cundell et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Fcp1 is not a major anti-Endos phosphatase</title><p>A third recent publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hegarat et al., 2014</xref>) came to a conclusion incompatible with that presented here: these authors maintain that the anti-Endos enzyme is Fcp1, a phosphatase known to target phosphorylations of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. We believe their report is incorrect for several reasons. (i) We show here strong evidence that PP2A-B55 is responsible for the anti-Endos activity. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C,D</xref> demonstrates that the very tight binding of pEndos to the PP2A-B55 active site blocks its binding to other phosphatases.

(ii) Among other issues, this new publication is internally inconsistent.

In essence, pEndos competes with a large class of CDK-catalyzed mitotic phosphosites (of which pCDKS and pSer50 Fizzy are examples) for access to the phosphatase active site. pEndos can successfully compete for the site because its affinity for PP2A-B55 is much higher than those of the competing substrates; that is, the <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> for pEndos is extremely low. However, PP2A-B55 dephosphorylates pEndos at a much slower rate (low <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub>) than the CDK phosphosites, so the tight interaction of PP2A-B55 and pEndos would be prolonged. Thus, pEndos would soon sequester the phosphatase from competing substrates, protecting such substrates against premature dephosphorylation. pEndos in this way permits M phase to begin and to be maintained as long as Gwl kinase is active. We call this mechanism ‘inhibition by unfair competition’<italic>.</italic> In its essence, the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> clarifies how PP2A-B55 can be ‘off’ during M phase for CDK-phosphorylated substrates, but ‘on’ at the same time for the Gwl-phosphorylated pEndos substrate.</p><p>In the context of the cell, the inhibition by unfair competition mechanism requires that pEndos be present in molar excess over PP2A-B55 in mitosis to account for the near-total absence of anti-CDKS activity observed during M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgess et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mochida and Hunt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mochida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Considerable evidence exists that this requirement is met in many cell types. From our own quantitation on Western blots, we estimate the intracellular concentration of the PP2A B55 subunit to be between 100 and 250 nM and that of Endos to be between 500 nM and 1 μΜ, depending on the cell type. (One example of this analysis is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). The 5:1 ratio of Endos to PP2A-B55 observed in that figure is roughly consistent with estimates from other laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cundell et al., 2013</xref>) and with estimates from mass spectrometry studies of whole cell extracts, after accounting for all Endos and PP2A-B55 family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kolker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). For example, the Pax-DB database integrating the results of many mass spectrometry experiments on a variety of tissue types estimates that the abundance of Endos in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells is 295 ppm while that of Twins (B55) is 123 ppm; for human cells, the integrated datasets yield values of 83.2 ppm for Endos-family proteins (ENSA and ARPP-19) and 23.1 ppm for B55-family proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pax-db.org">www.pax-db.org</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Although we ourselves have not determined the fraction of the total Endos protein that is phosphorylated during M phase, other investigators have found that this proportion is roughly 50% in extracts of synchronized mammalian tissue culture cells (perhaps some of which may not have been in M phase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cundell et al., 2013</xref>), and approaches 100% in frog egg M phase extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mochida et al., 2010</xref>). Sufficient ‘headroom’ thus exists to conclude that the molar concentration of pEndos during M phase in fact exceeds that of the PP2A-B55 phosphatase.</p><p>A major virtue of the inhibition by unfair competition model is that it explains not only how pEndos inhibits PP2A-B55 dephosphorylation of pCDKS-class substrates, but also how pEndos can itself become inactivated: the system has an automatic reset that is intrinsic to the mechanism that inactivates PP2A-B55 phosphatase in the first place. When Gwl is inactivated at anaphase onset, the pEndos dephosphorylated by PP2A-B55 can no longer be replaced. PP2A-B55 is now free to work on CDK-phosphorylated substrates and thus to promote the M phase-to-interphase transition. The experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, in which we added non-radioactive pEndos and radioactive pCDKS to the same tube of PP2A-B55, provide a direct in vitro test of the proposed mechanism by mimicking the events that occur during M phase exit. The results show that PP2A-B55 targets pCDKS only after the enzyme has dephosphorylated almost all of the pEndos.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Rapid M phase exit requires the inhibition by unfair competition mechanism</title><p>M phase exit is surprisingly rapid given the large number of phosphorylations which must be reversed; in <italic>Xenopus</italic> cycling extracts, for example, the M phase-to-interphase transition is completed within less than 5 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mochida et al., 2009</xref>). Even though the turnover rate of pEndos dephosphorylation by PP2A-B55 is quite slow (∼0.05 s<sup>−1</sup>), the inhibition by unfair competition mechanism is nevertheless compatible with the rapidity of M phase exit. The reason is that Endos is present in cells only in at most a fivefold stoichiometric excess with respect to the phosphatase, as was just discussed. Each molecule of PP2A-B55 thus needs to dephosphorylate only a few molecules of pEndos to effect the M phase-to-interphase transition.</p><p>To explore this idea quantitatively, we modeled the dynamics of a simplified system consisting solely of Endos and PP2A-B55 at estimated physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Because the <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> of PP2A-B55 for pEndos is four-to-five orders of magnitude smaller than the <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> for other substrates, typified by pCDKS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), and the pEndos concentration during M phase is in excess of the phosphatase concentration, we suggest that the approximation of ignoring the binding of PP2A-B55 to other substrates is appropriate, and that this simplified model should capture the essence of the regulatory process. The calculation begins at the end of M-phase (<italic>t</italic> = 0) with the inactivation of Gwl. Almost all the PP2A-B55 is sequestered by pEndos until PP2A-B55-catalyzed dephosphorylation causes the pEndos concentration to decrease from 1 μM to ∼250 nM, the intracellular PP2A-B55 concentration. Beyond this point, PP2A-B55 is rapidly released from sequestration; half is available to act on other substrates within 74 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Note that this calculation essentially recapitulates the actual experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, but here the inhibition of PP22A-B55 is stronger and the time to release is faster because physiological, not laboratory, conditions are being modeled.</p><p>We previously showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> that cells likely harbor a pEndos-targeting phosphatase other than PP2A-B55; because this secondary activity is fostriecin-resistant, we speculate that it may be a form of PP1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref> shows how the time courses of pEndos dephosphorylation and PP2A-B55 desequestration are modified if this second phosphatase (again called PPX) is present at the same concentration as PP2A-B55 and acts on pEndos with kinetic parameters matching the activity of PP2A-B55 on pCDKS. In this case, the lag in PP2A-B55 desequestration shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref> is shortened, because PPX can dephosphorylate the pEndos that is not bound to PP2A/B55. However, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>, the presence of PPX makes very little difference once the pEndos concentration decreases to the PP2A-B55 concentration of 250 nM, since almost all the remaining pEndos is bound to PP2A-B55. In this scenario, half of the PPA-B55 is released from pEndos by 38 s, producing a modest acceleration in M phase exit. We regard the situation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref> as a reasonable description of the actual events in the cell, as it accounts for contributions from both PP2A-B55 and other phosphatases in pEndos inactivation.</p><p>Further dynamic modeling surprisingly revealed a key insight: cells would be unable to exit M phase in a timely manner unless pEndos was in fact dephosphorylated by PP2A-B55 as demanded by unfair competition. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C,D</xref> assumes that pEndos is only an inhibitor and not a substrate of PP2A-B55; thus pEndos binds and sequesters PP2A-B55, but is only dephosphorylated by PPX (whose concentrations and properties are identical to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). In this scenario, PP2A-B55 would protect the bound pEndos from dephosphorylation, so many hours—not just a few minutes—would be required for PP2A-B55 desequestration and M phase exit. In other words, the dephosphorylation of pEndos by PP2A-B55 is an absolute requirement for rapid completion of the M phase-to-interphase transition.</p><p>Our identification of PP2A-B55 as the anti-Endos phosphatase poses a dilemma in terms of M phase exit: the inhibition by unfair competition model describes events that must occur downstream of the inactivation of Gwl kinase, but what then can inactivate Gwl upon anaphase onset? According to our model, the rate-limiting Gwl-inactivating phosphatase cannot be PP2A-B55, because the system would be futile. Gwl inactivation could not proceed until pEndos was depleted, but pEndos cannot be inactivated as long as Gwl is active. An argument can be made that PP2A-B55 should be the Gwl-inactivating phosphatase because Gwl is activated by CDKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blake-Hodek et al., 2012</xref>), and PP2A-B55 targets at least a subset of CDK phosphosites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mochida and Hunt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castilho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mochida et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, one group has recently reported some evidence in favor of this idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hegarat et al., 2014</xref>). However, it should be emphasized that PP2A-B55 does not act on all, or even perhaps the majority, of CDK phosphosites, as recently most forcefully demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cundell et al. (2013)</xref>. The obvious resolution of this dilemma is therefore that a phosphatase other than PP2A-B55 inactivates Gwl during M phase exit. We have obtained preliminary evidence in support of this idea in two ways (data not shown). First, in our hands purified PP2A-B55 in vitro is very inefficient in inactivating Gwl. Second, when active Gwl is added to interphase extracts from a variety of cell types, it becomes rapidly inactivated and dephosphorylated in a process that is insensitive to okadaic acid (and cannot therefore be controlled by PP2A-B55). Some evidence in favor of the existence of an okadaic acid-resistant anti-Gwl phosphatase has also recently been obtained by another group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hegarat et al., 2014</xref>); the identity of this Gwl-inactivating enzyme is currently unknown.</p><p>F A Barr et al. have recently proposed an elegant model in which the events of anaphase onset are ordered in time, with later events such as cytokinesis being controlled by the Gwl-Endos pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cundell et al., 2013</xref>). Our conclusions are in essence consistent with their hypothesis, and the automatic reset mechanism we propose provides an explanation for part of the delay they observe between CDK1-Cyclin B inactivation and the activation of PP2A-B55, and thus for the dephosphorylation of late substrates involved in cytokinesis such as PRC1. That is, the major determining factors for this delay would be the rate of Endos dephosphorylation by PP2A-B55 described here coupled with the time required to inactivate Gwl through mechanisms we do not yet understand.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Other AGC kinases may indirectly inhibit other PPP phosphatases through similar mechanisms</title><p>The virtues of inhibition by unfair competition are sufficiently compelling that one might ask whether other phosphatases are controlled in the same fashion. We believe this supposition is likely, based on findings published 30 years ago concerning inhibition of PP1 by a polypeptide called Inhibitor-1 that is, like Endosulfine, small and heat-stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foulkes et al., 1983</xref>). Inhibition occurs only after Inhibitor-1 is phosphorylated at a conserved site by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), an enzyme whose structure and activation mechanism are closely related to those of its fellow AGC kinase family member, Gwl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blake-Hodek et al., 2012</xref>). The investigators found that purified PP1 could dephosphorylate PKA-phosphorylated Inhibitor-1, and the values of <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> were both considerably lower for this reaction than for dephosphorylation of the more normal substrate phosphorylase <italic>a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foulkes et al., 1983</xref>). In short, just as we report here for pEndos and PP2A-B55, they concluded that pInhibitor-1 acts both as an inhibitor and a substrate for PP1.</p><p>These observations have long since been disregarded because PP1’s activity in inactivating pInhibitor-1 was very slow, and other phosphatases (PP2A and calcineurin) had substantial pInhibitor-1 dephosphorylating activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ingebritsen et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen, 1989</xref>). In light of the arguments summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> that a phosphatase will effectively sequester a tightly binding inhibitor from other phosphatases, we believe the biological significance of PP1’s activity in dephosphorylating pInhibitor-1 should be re-evaluated. Of interest, recent studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts have indicated that pInhibitor-1 dephosphorylation at the end of M phase is in fact dependent upon activity of PP1, although this work could not distinguish whether the effect was direct or indirect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). The inhibition by unfair competition mechanism may well prove to have been utilized by AGC kinases other than Gwl to control phosphatases other than PP2A-B55.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>Extracts from third instar larvae of the following genotypes were assayed for phosphatase activities: PP2A B55 regulatory subunit (<italic>twins</italic>): <italic>tws</italic><sup><italic>P</italic></sup><italic>/tws</italic><sup><italic>196</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Uemura et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2012</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 4 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study the authors have addressed the important question of how great wall kinase-dependent inhibition of PP2A phosphatases is reversed upon mitotic exit. The authors use a number of systems (<italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian tissue culture cells) to investigate the dephosphorylation of Endos, the protein that becomes an inhibitor of the PP2A-B55 isoform of PP2A once Endos is phosphorylated by Greatwall. The authors use a variety of inhibitors and siRNA treatments to identify the phosphatase as PP2A-B55 itself. They resolve this apparent paradox by suggesting that the kinetics of Endos dephosphorylation mean that it will be preferentially dephosporylated when Greatwall is inactivated in mitosis. This study presents an interesting idea for how mitotic exit can be controlled that should be of general interest in the field, and to those working on phosphatases in general. Before publication, however, the following points should be addressed.</p><p>1) The description of the phosphatase assays is unclear and should be described in more detail. It would be useful to state that, for instance, whether the dephosphorylation of substrates shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is linear with respect to enzyme concentrations. In some cases (i.e., data for fostriecin in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, incorrectly described as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> in the figure legend) there are different sensitivities to inhibitors that are ascribed to loss of potency with storage – obviously it would be better to repeat using new inhibitor if possible, even thought the conclusions of the experiment are not affected qualitatively. Moreover, it is not clear that Michaelis-Menton kinetics are really appropriate to analyse the substrate-enzyme relationship of a strongly-bound component of an inhibited complex. Can the authors comment? Presumably the dephosphorylation of endosulfine in the complex with PP2A-B55 would result in the activation of the enzyme towards other substrates after incubation. Does this occur? Indeed, dephosphorylation of endosulfine within the complex would presumably mean that the rate would be independent of the dilution of the complex. Is there any evidence that this is the case?</p><p>2) Most of the data are presented as single points on a graph, therefore we have no means to judge the variation in the assays. The authors should specify the number of independent experiments for each figure and estimate the variation between experiments.</p><p>3) Although the model of “inhibition by unfair competition” looks very beautiful, particularly in implying that the system has an intrinsic reset mechanism, it is assumed that at exit from M-phase, Gwl is inactivated prior to the reactivation of PP2A-B55. Nonetheless, presumably the inactivation of Gwl requires active/reactivated PP2A-B55, because Gwl is activated through direct phosphorylation by CDK1 (as previously reported by the authors). The authors should discuss why and how Gwl inactivation at anaphase onset is anticipated to occur prior to, or in the absence of, reactivation of PP2A-B55.</p><p>4) For their proposed mechanism to be valid, pEndos has to present in molar excess over active PP2A-B55 in mitosis because otherwise there would be free PP2A-B55 available to dephosphorylate pCDKS. The authors should measure the amounts of phospho-Endos to PP2A-B55 to address this point.</p><p>5) The authors should discuss the caveat that they are using asynchronous mammalian cells to measure an activity that conceivably is most active only for a short time in the cell cycle, i.e. in anaphase. Thus, it is conceivable that they may not have detected the physiological phosphatase in their experiments. They should also comment upon whether the mechanism that they propose is rapid enough to account for the reactivation of phosphatases in mitotic exit.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01695.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The description of the phosphatase assays is unclear and should be described in more detail.

For both the pEndos and pCDKS substrates, we took care to ensure that all of the experiments using these enzymes were done in the linear range with respect to enzyme concentrations (less than 1 nM), to time of incubation (less than 15 min), and to substrate utilization (less than 25% of the input phosphate was released).</p><p>The reviewers asked specifically whether the assays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are linear with respect to enzyme concentrations. In contrast with the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and later, which were done with purified enzymes, those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were performed in concentrated extracts. Because of the well-known dilution effects shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2–figure supplement 5</xref> (particularly for the pCDKS substrate), we cannot change the concentrations of the enzymes within the extracts without also changing the concentration of endogenous inhibitors (such as pEndos) at the same time; linearity with respect to the extract concentration therefore cannot be expected. However, we do know that these assays were conducted in the linear range with respect to enzyme amounts (the greater the volume and thus the more enzyme, the greater the signal), time, and substrate utilization. We added a statement to this effect in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> legend, but we don’t believe another supplemental figure is required given the documentation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref> for cases with the purified enzymes.</p><p><italic>In some cases (i.e., data for fostriecin in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>compared to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B</italic></xref><italic>, incorrectly described as</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6D</italic></xref> <italic>in the figure legend) there are different sensitivities to inhibitors that are ascribed to loss of potency with storage – obviously it would be better to repeat using new inhibitor if possible, even thought the conclusions of the experiment are not affected qualitatively</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers were referring specifically to the inhibitor fostriecin, which is somewhat notorious in being unstable (see the reference in the manuscript to the Swingle et al. review). We obtained new fostriecin from two different suppliers, and found that the potency of the material we received was lower than advertised. Both of these samples were encased in exactly the same type of vials; we suspect that both suppliers were selling the same preparation from a single manufacturer that was made many years ago. We also resuspended the fostriecin powder in different diluents (water, DMSO, and ethanol) and found identical results. It should be noted that the potency was reduced for the reactions of both pEndos and pCDKS substrates with the purified PP2A-B55 holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We also checked fostriecin against commercially obtained PP2A dimeric enzyme reacted with myelin basic protein as the substrate, and again the potency was much reduced relative to our expectations.</p><p>As pointed out by the reviewers, the critical point from the perspective of this paper is that it is the qualitative patterns that matter to our conclusions, not the absolute value. Our experiments all contained internal controls that allowed us to compare the activity of PP2A-like enzymes (sensitive to fostriecin) with that of PP1-like enzymes (relatively insensitive). In this regard, we also checked both of our new fostriecin samples on various preparations of PP1, which were all much more resistant to the inhibitor than were our various PP2A enzymes; this is the expected result.</p><p>We have noted these issues briefly in the Materials and methods and also the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, but we think there is little point in presenting all of the data with respect to all the samples of inhibitors and enzymes when the results already shown are representative.</p><p><italic>Moreover, it is not clear that Michaelis-Menton kinetics are really appropriate to analyse the substrate-enzyme relationship of a strongly-bound component of an inhibited complex. Can the authors comment</italic>?</p><p>In the original manuscript, some of the kinetic parameter measurements for pEndos dephosphorylation(those done as a competition with okadaic acid; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) were actually calculated with a modified form of the Michaelis–Menten equation that accounts for tight binding as the reviewer suggests, but other assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) were done with commercial software that probably used normal Michaelis-Menten assumptions (the documentation is unclear). As described in the revised text, we have recalculated the latter accounting for the tight binding and present these revised calculations in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. In fact, this change brings the two sets of values in somewhat closer correspondence and slightly tightens our estimate for the range of possible values of the pEndos dephosphorylation <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>.</p><p>In this regard, we were recently amazed to find by searching the BRENDA enzyme database that the <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> for this reaction may be the lowest recorded for any enzymatic process. We have added a sentence to this effect in the manuscript, as it may help readers comprehend the difficulties in these measurements and the unique nature of the pEndos dephosphorylation mechanism.</p><p><italic>Presumably the dephosphorylation of endosulfine in the complex with PP2A-B55 would result in the activation of the enzyme towards other substrates after incubation. Does this occur</italic>?</p><p>The reviewers are absolutely correct that after pEndos has been dephosphorylated to a level below that of the concentration PP2A-B55, the enzyme should direct its attention to other substrates; this is in fact the key point to our model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> of the original manuscript (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) presented some experimental evidence in support of this assertion, but the demonstration of this crucial point was not as direct as it could be. We thus took the suggestion of the reviewer to heart and conducted a time course in which PP2A-B55 was mixed with both radioactive pCDKS substrate and non-radioactive pEndos. These results are shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> of the revised manuscript, and they correspond extremely closely to our expectations. The enzyme barely works on the pCDKS substrate at early time points. But later, when the kinetics predicts the pEndos would have been substantially dephosphorylated, the rate of pCDKS dephosphorylation increases dramatically to about the same initial rate as the controls. In our opinion, this is a very clear demonstration of the PP2A-B55 reset mechanism we proposed. We particularly thank the reviewers for this suggestion.</p><p><italic>Indeed, dephosphorylation of endosulfine within the complex would presumably mean that the rate would be independent of the dilution of the complex. Is there any evidence that this is the case</italic>?</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that such would be the expectations of the system, but it is technically extremely difficult to demonstrate this point to our satisfaction. We did perform one new experiment in which we mixed together the enzyme and pEndos substrate at high concentrations, and then we diluted the sample through a 25-fold range. As expected, the velocity of the reaction was unchanged, meaning that the same number of cpm of phosphate were released regardless of the final concentrations. The problem with this experiment is that it was done at a considerable excess of pEndos to the enzyme, and at the final dilution, the concentration of pEndos was roughly 20 nM. This value is considerably above the <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and in the range where the enzyme remains saturated with substrate. Basically, this result is just another way of saying that the system is already at Vmax at pEndos concentrations higher than about 10 nM; this conclusion was already presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in a slightly different way. We thus have not included a figure showing the new less-than-ideal experiment, though we could of course do so if desired.</p><p>The experiment we think the reviewers were actually suggesting is probably one in which the enzyme is in considerable excess of the substrate. For example, we could increase the concentration of enzyme to say 5 nM (10 times what we normally use) and decrease the concentration of pEndos to 1 nM. But the sample would then have very few total cpm, and the complex would then have to be significantly diluted which presents difficulties in sample handling. (With higher substrate concentrations, we could avoid the sample handling problem by assaying the same volume of each dilution, but the same approach with more dilute substrate would yield samples with no counts.) An additional problem is that if the enzyme is in excess, the reaction would exhaust almost all of the substrate very rapidly (less than a half minute) even though the <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub> is relatively low. We thus believe that the data that could be gained from such an experiment would not be very believable.</p><p><italic>2) Most of the data are presented as single points on a graph, therefore we have no means to judge the variation in the assays. The authors should specify the number of independent experiments for each figure and estimate the variation between experiments</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and its various supplements and to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B-D</xref>, which show single points; in contrast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig6 fig7">Figures 3, 4, 6A, 7</xref>, and the three supplements to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> in the original manuscript did provide means to judge variations. In the case of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig6">Figures 2 and 6</xref>, we had conducted many additional experiments that convinced us the conclusions were quite reproducible, and the experiments themselves have internal controls for reproducibility in terms of closely spaced titrations. In some ways, we consider the titration points to be more informative than exact replicates of a given assay. Titrations are better able to show patterns that change with concentrations, and the consistency we see between closely spaced points provides a good indication of reproducibility. Nonetheless, we have taken a variety of additional measures to address this issue.</p><p>A brief digression: there are several types of experimental replications that may be considered. The first of these concern what we term <italic>technical replicates</italic> (independent assays of the same reagents). In our hands, these technical replicates are almost always within 10-15% of the average value. Next are what we term <italic>biological replicates</italic> (assays using independent preparations of one or more reagents). Finally, we define <italic>evolutionary replicates</italic> as assays using samples (in our case, cell extracts) obtained from different species.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have responded to the reviewers’ well-taken point in the following ways. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Wadzinski, 2007</xref>) We define these types of replicates in the Materials and Methods, and then give the type and number of replicates for each individual experiment in the legend for the figure describing that experiment. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Archambault et al., 2007</xref>) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and its supplemental figures, we have included several new figures that show biological and evolutionary replicates that reveal very similar patterns, demonstrating their reproducibility. The new figures added to the revised manuscript are:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> parts A B E</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> parts E and F</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref> parts B and D</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2–figure supplement 5</xref> (this figure supplement is completely new).</p></list-item></list></p><p>In addition, we altered a few of the figures by adding error bars or additional entries representing the technical replicates that were previously performed but had not been shown:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> part D</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> part C.</p></list-item></list></p><p>(3) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, we added a new part E that shows technical replicates and error bars for the reactions performed either without inhibitors or at the highest concentration of each of the inhibitors.</p><p><italic>3) Although the model of “inhibition by unfair competition” looks very beautiful, particularly in implying that the system has an intrinsic reset mechanism, it is assumed that at exit from M-phase, Gwl is inactivated prior to the reactivation of PP2A-B55. Nonetheless, presumably the inactivation of Gwl requires active/reactivated PP2A-B55, because Gwl is activated through direct phosphorylation by CDK1 (as previously reported by the authors). The authors should discuss why and how Gwl inactivation at anaphase onset is anticipated to occur prior to, or in the absence of, reactivation of PP2A-B55</italic>.</p><p>This is indeed an important issue and one that we cannot completely answer at this point in time because we do not know what phosphatases are responsible for Gwl inactivation. At the outset of our experiments, we had the same supposition as the reviewers: that PP2A-B55 would be the main such enzyme because CDK phosphorylations activate Gwl and PP2A-B55 can remove certain such phosphorylations. However, it is increasingly clear that PP2A-B55 does not act on all, or even perhaps the majority, of CDK sites. The best evidence for this statement comes from a recent paper from Cundell et al. that was referenced earlier by the reviewers. Thus, there is no a priori reason to conclude that Gwl must be inactivated by PP2A-B55.</p><p>Our own studies point to the existence of at least one Gwl-inactivating phosphatase that is not PP2A-B55. (i) Purified PP2A-B55 that we know is active against pCDKS and pEndos substrates is very inefficient at inactivating Gwl in vitro; in fact, after 90 minutes of incubation with a molar amount of phosphatase in excess to that of Gwl, more than 70% of Gwl activity remained. (ii) When we add active Gwl to extracts (frog eggs, or HeLa or S2 cells) that are not in M phase, Gwl rapidly loses its phosphorylations and is turned off even in the presence of high concentrations of okadaic acid that would completely inhibit PP2A. We presume that this okadaic acid-insensitive phosphatase is driving Gwl inactivation during M phase exit, but we do not yet know the identity of this enzyme. This phosphatase could be constitutively active if the rate of Gwl phosphorylation by CDK1 during M phase is higher than the rate of Gwl dephosphorylation, or this enzyme could conceivably be negatively regulated directly or indirectly by CDK1.</p><p>We have added a paragraph to the Discussion that addresses this key point and presents a short version of the arguments just made.</p><p>The recently-published paper by Hegarat et. al. claims to have identified PP2A-B55 as the major Gwl-inactivating enzyme; however, they also state that an okadaic acid-resistant phosphatase contributes to Gwl inactivation. We have serious concerns about their data on this point and their results concerning the identity of the anti-Endos phosphatase. For example, the activity they measure in PP2A-B55 IPs that can remove unspecified phosphates from Gwl (which may or may not be involved in Gwl regulation) is less than 30% higher than a high background (their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We have included a discussion of this recent publication and how the results are inconsistent with our own.</p><p><italic>4) For their proposed mechanism to be valid, pEndos has to present in molar excess over active PP2A-B55 in mitosis because otherwise there would be free PP2A-B55 available to dephosphorylate pCDKS. The authors should measure the amounts of phospho-Endos to PP2A-B55 to address this point</italic>.</p><p>We have not ourselves measured the amount of phospho-Endos, but we have good reason to assert that its concentration during M phase is indeed higher than that of PP2A-B55.</p><p>(i) This must be the case because the rate of dephosphorylation of several CDK substrates is decreased almost to 0 during M phase, as we and S. Mochida and T. Hunt have shown in several publications (a repeat of these experiments is also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> of this manuscript).</p><p>(ii) We have measured the relative concentrations of total PP2A-B55 (Twins) and Endos in fly S2 cells, and the relative stoichiometry is 1:5. We document these results in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2–figure supplement 6</xref>. Cundell et al<italic>.</italic> have arrived at a very similar figure, and we cite this reference. In addition, we summarize in the revised text information culled from the Pax-DB database of protein abundance levels determined by global mass spectrometry. These data show that Endosulfine proteins are present in more than a 2-fold molar excess to PP2A-B55 in several different organisms.</p><p>(iii) What fraction of this excess of Endosulfine proteins is phosphorylated at the Gwl site during M phase? We could not easily answer this question because we do not have antibodies specific to the phosphorylated form of Endos that are sufficiently sensitive to detect endogenous levels. However, S. Mochida and collaborators have previously shown by a combination of Western blotting and phos-tag gels that in frog M phase extracts, Endosulfine proteins are nearly quantitatively phosphorylated. Using similar methods, but on extracts from synchronized tissue culture cells, the Cundell et al. paper showed that roughly 50% of the Endosulfine was phosphorylated. Even with the lower of these estimates (which may reflect the presence of some cells that were not at M phase at the time), sufficient headroom exists to conclude that the molar concentration of pEndos during M phase in fact exceeds that of the PP2A-B55 phosphatase.</p><p>We summarize these arguments in the Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) The authors should discuss the caveat that they are using asynchronous mammalian cells to measure an activity that conceivably is most active only for a short time in the cell cycle, i.e. in anaphase. Thus, it is conceivable that they may not have detected the physiological phosphatase in their experiments. They should also comment upon whether the mechanism that they propose is rapid enough to account for the reactivation of phosphatases in mitotic exit</italic>.</p><p>We are somewhat puzzled by the reviewers’ comments here. An entire section of the Discussion is titled “Rapid M phase exit requires the inhibition by unfair competition mechanism”. In this section, we present in some detail arguments showing first that our proposed mechanism allows for the reactivation of PP2A-B55 within a couple of minutes (or even less than a minute if other phosphatases participate in reducing the concentration of pEndos to that of the phosphatase), and second that any other mechanism of pEndos inactivation would require far too much time for mitotic exit to be accomplished. We don’t see how we can add further to our presentation in this regard.</p><p>We have added to the Discussion a paragraph considering the caveat desired by the reviewer. However, we do not actually believe that the anti-Endos phosphatase is active only during the short time of anaphase. It is our contention that PP2A-B55 acts constitutively throughout the cell cycle against pEndos (although pEndos restricts PP2A-B55 activity against other substrates during M phase). Note in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> that the anti-Endos activity is present during M phase and appears to increase about 2-fold during interphase. This 2-fold difference is likely artifactual, being due to the presence (M phase) or absence (interphase) of unlabeled pEndos in the extract, which could compete with the exogenous labeled pEndos substrate. Moreover, the characteristics of the M phase and interphase anti-Endos activities are very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2A</xref>; and data not shown), and thus almost certainly represent the same enzyme (namely PP2A-B55).</p><p>We see no reason to posit the existence of an additional enzyme active only during the transition between M phase and interphase if PP2A-B55 is active against pEndos under both conditions and if the level of this activity, as we have shown, is by itself sufficient to account for the speed of M phase exit.</p></body></sub-article></article>
