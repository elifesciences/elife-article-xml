Here, we describe development and characterization of ‘Salsa6f’, a fusion of GCaMP6f and tdTomato optimized for cell tracking while monitoring cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and a transgenic Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter mouse with Salsa6f targeted to the Rosa26 locus for Cre-dependent expression in specific cell types. The development and function of T cells was unaffected in Cd4-Salsa6f mice. We describe Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals reported by Salsa6f during T cell receptor activation in naive T cells, helper Th17 T cells and regulatory T cells, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals mediated in T cells by an activator of mechanosensitive Piezo1 channels. Transgenic expression of Salsa6f enables ratiometric imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in complex tissue environments found in vivo. Two-photon imaging of migrating T cells in the steady-state lymph node revealed both cell-wide and localized sub-cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (‘sparkles’) as cells migrate.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32417.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To help protect the body from disease, small immune cells called T lymphocytes move rapidly, searching for signs of infection. These signs are antigens – processed pieces of proteins from invading bacteria and viruses – which are displayed on the surface of so-called antigen-presenting cells. To visit as many different antigen-presenting cells as possible, T cells move quickly from one to the next in an apparently random manner. How T cells are programmed to move in this way is largely unknown.</p><p>The entry of calcium ions into cells, through channel proteins, triggers characteristic actions in many cells throughout the body. As such it is possible that the T cells’ movements are related to calcium signals too. However, it was technically challenging to directly measure the amount of calcium in moving cells within the body.</p><p>To overcome this issue, Dong, Othy et al. genetically engineered mice to produce a new calcium-sensitive reporter protein in their T cells. The reporter, which was named Salsa6f, consisted of a red fluorescent protein fused to another protein that glows green when it binds to calcium ions. Measuring the ratio of red and green fluorescence gives a measure of the concentration of calcium ions inside the cell. In the absence of calcium signaling, the cells can still be tracked via the red fluorescence of Salsa6f. Importantly, the reporter did not affect the development or activity of the T cells in the mice. In a related study, Dong, Othy et al. then used their transgenic mice to ask whether calcium signals guide moving T cells as they search for antigens.</p><p>Future studies could use these transgenic mice to track the calcium ion concentration in numerous cell types. This would enable new approaches to relate the inner workings of cells to their behaviors in many different organ systems throughout the body.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator</kwd><kwd>Ca2+ signaling</kwd><kwd>T cell motility</kwd><kwd>Orai1</kwd><kwd>two-photon microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI117555</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dynes</surname><given-names>Joseph L</given-names></name><name><surname>Cahalan</surname><given-names>Michael D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS14609</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cahalan</surname><given-names>Michael D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI121945</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cahalan</surname><given-names>Michael D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Salsa6f is a novel, ratiometric genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator that combines the power of ratiometric chemical Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators with the ability, when expressed transgenically, to image cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals amid complex tissue environments in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) is an essential second messenger responsible for a wide variety of cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berridge et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clapham, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berridge, 2012</xref>). Through the use of synthetic small molecule Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators such as fura-2 and fluo-4, imaging studies have greatly expanded our understanding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tsien et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grynkiewicz et al., 1985</xref>). However, such indicators cannot be targeted to specific subcellular compartments or cell populations, and are unsuitable for long-term studies due to leakage out of cells. Moreover, they often do not faithfully report pure cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, because of diffusion into cellular compartments such as the nucleus. One alternative to overcoming these limitations is with genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs), first developed two decades ago as FRET-based fluorescence probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miyawaki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Romoser et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pérez Koldenkova and Nagai, 2013</xref>). Key advantages to GECIs include the capability for genetic targeting to specific cell types or subcellular organelles, measuring local Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels by direct fusion to a protein of interest, modulation of expression levels by inclusion of an inducible promoter, and long-term studies due to continuous expression of the genetic indicator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miyawaki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pérez Koldenkova and Nagai, 2013</xref>). Despite these inherent advantages, the initial FRET-based GECI probes were not widely used as their performance fell far behind small molecule Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators, particularly in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity, brightness, and dynamic range. Since then, successive rounds of design and contributions from multiple research groups have resulted in numerous variants of GECIs with high dynamic range and dramatically improved performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baird et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerboom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Akerboom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Single fluorescent protein-based GECIs containing a circularly permutated green fluorescent protein (GFP) exhibit high brightness, fast response kinetics, and offer multiple color variants, including the GECO and the GCaMP series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerboom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). FRET-based GECIs have continued to evolve as well, with sequential improvements including incorporation of circularly permuted yellow fluorescent proteins (cpYFPs) to improve dynamic range in the yellow cameleon (YC) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nagai et al., 2004</xref>), use of troponin C as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing element in the TN indicator family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heim and Griesbeck, 2004</xref>), computational redesign of the calmodulin-M13 interface to increase the range of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and reduce perturbation by native calmodulin in the DcpV family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Palmer et al., 2006</xref>), and complete redesign of the troponin C domain to increase response kinetics and reduce buffering of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the TN-XXL family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mank et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mank et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The latest generation of GECIs have crossed key performance thresholds previously set by small-molecule indicators, enabling GECIs to be widely applied in diverse Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging studies without sacrificing performance. Members of the GCaMP6 family are capable of tracking cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes from single neuronal action potentials, with higher sensitivity than small-molecule indicators such as OGB-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). The availability of multicolored variants in the GECO family and the RCaMP series allowed for simultaneous measurement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in different cell populations in the same preparation, or in different subcellular compartments within the same cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Akerboom et al., 2013</xref>). These variants can be integrated with optogenetics to simultaneously evoke channel rhodopsin activity while monitoring localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in independent spectral channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Akerboom et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, individual GECIs can be tagged onto membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to directly measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the target channel of interest, enabling optical recording of single channel activity without the need for technique-intensive patch clamping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dynes et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Another advantage of GECIs is their capability to be incorporated into transgenic organisms. Although several GECI-expressing transgenic mouse lines have already been reported, many of these studies used older variants of GECIs that are expressed only in selected tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hasan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ji et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tallini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heim et al., 2007</xref>). The Ai38 mouse line overcomes these issues by combining GCaMP3 with a robust and flexible Cre/lox system for selective expression in specific cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zariwala et al., 2012</xref>). Based on a series of Cre-responder lines designed for characterization of the whole mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>), the Ai38 mouse line contains GCaMP3 targeted to the Rosa26 locus but requires Cre recombinase for expression. By crossing Ai38 with various Cre mouse lines, GCaMP3 can be selectively expressed in specific cell populations. Thus, target cells may be endogenously labeled without invasive procedures, avoiding potential off-target side effects reported in GECI transgenic lines with global expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Direnberger et al., 2012</xref>). The newly released PC::G5-tdT mouse line provides improved functionality by targeting a Cre-dependent GCaMP5G-IRES-tdTomato transgenic cassette to the <italic>Polr2a</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gee et al., 2014</xref>). However, in the PC::G5-tdT mouse line, GCaMP5G and tdTomato are expressed individually, and localize to different cell compartments. Moreover, because expression of tdTomato is driven by an internal ribosomal entry site, the expression level is highly variable and weaker than GCaMP5G, limiting identification of positive cells and preventing accurate ratiometric measurements.</p><p>Although single fluorescent protein-based indicators have high brightness and fast response kinetics, as non-ratiometric probes they are problematic for Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in motile cells where fluorescence changes resulting from movement may be indistinguishable from actual changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Here, we introduce a novel genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator - that we christen ‘Salsa6f’ - by fusing green GCaMP6f to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive red fluorescent protein tdTomato. This probe enables true ratiometric imaging, in conjunction with the high dynamic range of GCaMP6. We further describe the generation of a transgenic mouse enabling Salsa6f expression in a tissue-specific manner, and demonstrate its utility for imaging T lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A novel ratiometric genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, Salsa6f</title><p>In order to develop a better tool to monitor Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in T cells both in vivo and in vitro, we first evaluated the latest generation of genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). We transiently expressed and screened a variety of single fluorescent protein-based GECIs in HEK 293A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and selected GCaMP6f based on fluorescence intensity, dynamic range, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity suitable for detecting a spectrum of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> = 375 nM). To enable cell tracking even when basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels evoke little GCaMP6f fluorescence, we fused GCaMP6f to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive red fluorescent protein tdTomato, chosen for its photostability and efficient two-photon excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drobizhev et al., 2011</xref>). A V5 epitope tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lobbestael E et al., 2010</xref>) served to link tdTomato to GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The resultant ratiometric fusion indicator, coined ‘Salsa6f’ for the combination of red tdTomato with the green GCaMP6f, was readily expressed by transfection into HEK 293A cells and human T cells. Salsa6f exhibited a ten-fold dynamic range, with a brightness comparable to GCaMP6f alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>). For two-photon microscopy, both components of Salsa6f can be visualized by femtosecond excitation at 900 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). GCaMP6f produces increased green fluorescence during elevations in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, while tdTomato provides a stable red fluorescence that facilitates cell tracking and allows for ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Salsa6f is excluded from the nucleus, ensuring accurate measurement of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>).

To facilitate comparison, fura-2 and Salsa6f ratios were normalized with R<sub>min</sub> = 0 and R<sub>max</sub> = 1. Salsa6f responded with faster rise and decay kinetics than fura-2 to progressive increases in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, especially at lower external Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. Salsa6f responses also saturated at lower cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels than fura-2 responses. This is not altogether surprising given that genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators have been reported to have a steeper Hill coefficient than chemical indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badura et al., 2014</xref>).

We examined activation of mechanosensitive channels in Salsa6f<sup>+</sup> T cells that were plated on αCd3/28-coated glass coverslips, by flowing external solution rapidly past the cells. Perfusion produced a transient rise in the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, likely a result of flow shear stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The Piezo family of mechanosensitive channels plays a vital role in cell motility and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nourse and Pathak, 2017</xref>), but it is not known whether these channels are expressed and play a role in immune cell function. Perfusion of medium including Yoda1, a selective small molecule activator of Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Syeda et al., 2015</xref>), resulted in robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in activated and naive T cells that were larger and more sustained than those activated by perfusion of solvent or media alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In summary, we show Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in T cells in response to an activator of Piezo1 channels.

Based on the one-to-one correspondence of tdTomato and GCaMP6f, we estimated and subtracted out fluctuations in green fluorescence due to cell movement and distribution. After processing, sparkles were found to occur widely across the imaging field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E–G</xref>), and many reached a characteristic maximum intensity (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F and G</xref>). The brightness of sparkles and the uniformity of background fluorescence allowed us to use a stringent threshold of signals exceeding 5.4 SD of the background noise level to systematically identify bright sparkles. Hundreds of events with a mean amplitude of 6.5 SD above background were observed in each 25 min imaging session (one image stack every five seconds), whereas fewer than one event exceeding our threshold was expected to occur from random noise fluctuations. Sparkles were more frequent than cell-wide transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9H</xref>), extended over a median area of 1.9 µm<sup>2</sup> (n = 441 sparkles from three lymph nodes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9I</xref>), and usually lasted for only one or two consecutive frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9J</xref>). Sparkle trace shape differs from that expected for autofluorescent cell processes drifting into the imaging field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9K</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that sparkles correspond to local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals restricted to small subcellular domains of T cells migrating through the lymph node.</p><p>The high density of expressing fluorescent T cells in the lymph nodes of Cd4-Salsa6f (Hom) mice makes it difficult to visualize and study subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals within individual cells. We thus adoptively transferred Cd4-Salsa6f T cells into wild-type recipients so these cells could be viewed in isolation at low density. Small green fluorescence transients seen in lymph nodes after adoptive transfer were similar in intensity to transients seen in Cd4-Salsa6f (Hom) lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). When small, bright, and brief green fluorescence signals were traced back, they were found to originate in red fluorescent Cd4-Salsa6f (Hom) T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B–M</xref>). Cell movement was used to define the front and back of labeled T cells for mapping the subcellular location of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Some sparkles, identified in processed green channel images, were found to selectively localize to the front or back of motile T cells in which both the cell front and back were clearly seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D,E,J,K</xref>). Green-red channel ratiometric images, enabled by Salsa6f labeling, confirmed differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration between front and back, although regions of elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> were also observed flanking the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F,L</xref>). Differences in green-red channel ratiometric pixel intensities between front and back were highly significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G,M</xref>; p&lt;0.0001, Mann–Whitney test). Thus, motile T cells exhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that are largely restricted to subregions of the cytoplasm, and these Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals – sparkles – were identified with high signal-to-noise ratio by Salsa6f expression.

Salsa6f is a fusion of the high-performing green fluorescent GECI GCaMP6f and the bright red fluorescent tdTomato. This simple modification imparts powerful capabilities, which facilitate tracking cells in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, enable ratiometric imaging to eliminate motility artifacts, and permit convenient single-wavelength femtosecond excitation for two-photon microscopy. Salsa6f addresses a key weakness of single fluorescent protein-based GECIs by enabling tracking of motile cells and identification of cell morphology, even at basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels when GCaMP6f fluorescence is very weak. We generated a transgenic reporter mouse with Cre-dependent expression of Salsa6f, enabling Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to be imaged in specific, genetically defined cell types. Transgenic expression of Salsa6f brings the power of ratiometric chemical Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators to imaging cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals amid the complex tissue environments found in vivo.</p><p>Salsa6f preserves the exceptional performance of GCaMP6f, which in the presence of high levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is as bright as the standard high-performing green fluorescent protein, EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). We find that Salsa6f possesses a dynamic range similar to GCaMP6f, and both are superior to FRET-based GECIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thestrup et al., 2014</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of Salsa6f, 160–300 nM, is well suited to detecting a variety of cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Inclusion of tdTomato in Salsa6f enables ratiometric imaging, calibration, and measurement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations within cells. Moreover, Salsa6f is distributed uniformly throughout the cytosol; its exclusion from the nucleus provides reliable and selective reporting of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. This is in contrast to the recently developed PC::G5-tdT mouse strain in which the tdTomato is found throughout the cell but the separately expressed GCaMP5G is excluded from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gee et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We created a transgenic mouse strain in which Salsa6f is expressed under genetic control using the Rosa26<italic><sup>Cre</sup></italic> recombinase system, and we used this system to label immune cells that express Cd4. Salsa6f labeling enables readout of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in T cells in vitro with high dynamic range, without the handling and potential toxicity associated with loading of chemical Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators. Indeed, a concern with any Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator is whether it may perturb cell function by buffering free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions or other means. In Cd4<sup>+</sup> immune cells, we found no effects of Salsa6f expression, even in Cd4-Salsa6f (Hom) mice, with respect to cellular phenotype, cell proliferation, differentiation, and, in our companion paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2017</xref>), homing and T-cell motility.</p><p>Salsa6f was used to detect Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx due to direct activation of SOCE, TCR stimulation, and an activator of Piezo1 channels – the latter observed in T cells for the first time to our knowledge. We also detected differences in patterns of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling between naive T cells, Th17 cells, and iTregs. These experiments demonstrate the sensitivity, brightness, uniformity of labeling, and ease of detecting dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals using Salsa6f.</p><p>A primary advance of this work is to take the in vitro capabilities of an excellent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator and bring these into the realm of in vivo imaging. Within tissues, nearby cells exhibit differences, ranging from subtle to dramatic, in morphology, connectivity, and molecular profile. The red fluorescence of Salsa6f, combined with genetic Salsa6f labeling, associates these characteristics with readout of cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Both the tdTomato and GCaMP6f in Salsa6f are excited well by a 920 nm femtosecond pulsed wavelength for two-photon imaging, enabling visualization hundreds of micrometers deep into lymph nodes. The immune system poses additional challenges for imaging because the constituent cells are highly motile. Indeed, direct cell-to-cell interactions of motile immune cells form the basis of immune surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mrass et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krummel et al., 2016</xref>). We were able to readily identify red fluorescent Salsa6f T cells easily in intact lymph nodes following adoptive transfer. Our images reveal uniform red fluorescence labeling by Salsa6f with clear subcellular morphology in imaging sessions encompassing hundreds of time lapse images. Moreover, Salsa6f offers the opportunity not only to record fluctuations in relative Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels over time, but also to read out absolute Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations within cells. We have measured the affinity of Salsa6f in intact cells; in principle, use of this approach will allow other microscope systems to be calibrated for measuring absolute Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations with Salsa6f. Knowledge of absolute Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations is necessary to develop quantitative models of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and cell behavior. Indeed, we demonstrate that clear Salsa6f ratio images can be generated from motile T cells in intact lymph nodes.</p><p>Our Salsa6f transgenic mouse line enables more sophisticated experimental approaches. One is the ability to detect rare Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling events. The high brightness and dynamic range of modern GECIs like Salsa6f contribute to detection of rare Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling events inside intact tissues or even whole transgenic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kubo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Portugues et al., 2014</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals have been previously recorded within lymph nodes in adoptively transferred T cells transgenically expressing doxycycline-inducible mCameleon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Le Borgne et al., 2016</xref>), GCaMP3 and dsRed as separate proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shulman et al., 2014</xref>), and virally transduced YC-nano-50<sup>CD</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Potential disadvantages of these probes include low dynamic range, nuclear expression of mCameleon and dsRed, the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of YC-nano-50<sup>CD</sup> (50 nM), and lack of ratiometric measurement. Imaging T cells transgenically expressing Salsa6f helps to overcome many of these limitations. Detecting rare events is made harder by inhomogeneities in cell populations of the lymph node as well as the movement of immune cells therein. Because of the one-to-one correspondence of tdTomato and GCaMP6f in Salsa6f, we were able to estimate and subtract resting GCaMP6f fluorescence even in motile cells. This approach substantially improves the uniformity of the fluorescence background upon which rare Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling events can be detected. Reliable and uniform cytosolic labeling contributes as well. Combined, these factors enabled us to detect not only sporadic cell-wide Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations, but also sparkles, much smaller sporadic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. The sensitivity and resolution of these images are sufficient to map local signals from intact lymph nodes to sub-regions of T cells. Moreover, while we focused upon the brightest local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to demonstrate their existence, we expect that Salsa6f will enable even lower intensity Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to be linked to subcellular mechanisms and, ultimately, resulting cell behaviors. In a companion paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2017</xref>), we capitalize on the unique properties of Salsa6F to relate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, both global and local, to T-cell motility in the intact lymph node.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">Salsa6f</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Fusion of GCaMP6f to tdTomato <break/>via a V5 epitope linker <break/>(GCaMP6f-V5-tdTomato)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">Gt(ROSA)26Sor5’-pCAG- <break/>FRT-LSL-Salsa6f-WPRE- <break/>bGHpA-AttB-FRT-NeoR- <break/>AttP-Gt(ROSA)26Sor3’ cassette</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Salsa6f inserted into a <break/>Gt(ROSA)26Sor-pCAG- <break/>LSL-(Salsa6f)-WPRE- <break/>bGHpA-NeoR cassette.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transgene (mouse)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>pCAG-FRT-LSL-</sup></italic> <break/><italic><sup>Salsa6f-WPRE-bGHpA-AttB-FRT-NeoR-AttP</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Allele with the above <break/>cassette targeted to <break/>the ROSA26 locus.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transgene (mouse)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Gt</italic>(<italic>ROSA</italic>)<italic>26Sor<sup>pCAG-FRT-LSL-</sup></italic> <break/><italic><sup>Salsa6f-WPRE-bGHpA-AttB/P</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Same as above with <break/>Neomycin cassette deleted</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (mouse)</td><td valign="top">LSL-Salsa6f (F1), LSL-Sals6f (Hom)</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Salsa6f transgene <break/>targeted to Rosa26 <break/>locus in JM8.N4 mouse <break/>embryonic stem (ES) <break/>cells.

HEK 293A cells (Invitrogen- Life Technologies # R705-07) were screened for viruses and mycoplasma, split and frozen into working stocks, cultured using aseptic techniques, and used to evaluate candidate genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators. Each probe was cotransfected with Orai1 and STIM1 into HEK 293A cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 48 hr before screening on an epifluorescence microscope. For construction of Salsa6f, a plasmid for tdTomato (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) and the pEGP-N1 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was used as a backbone. GCaMP6f was amplified via PCR with N- and C-terminal primers (5’ CACAACCGGTCGCCACCATGGTCGACTCATCACGTC 3’ and 5’ AGTCGCGGCCGCTTTAAAGCTTCGCTGTCATCATTTGTAC 3’) and ligated into pEGFP-N1 at the AgeI/NotI sites to replace the eGFP gene, while tdTomato was amplified via PCR with N- and C-terminal primers (5’ ATCCGCTAGCGCTACCGGTCGCC 3’ and 5’ TAACGAGATCTGCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC 3’) and ligated into the backbone at the NheI/BglII sites. An oligo containing the V5 epitope tag was synthesized with sense and antisense strands (5’ GATCTCGGGTAAGCCTATCCCTAACCCTCTCCTCGGTCTCGATTCTACG 3’ and 5’ GATCCGTAGAATCGAGACCGAGGAGAGGGTTAGGGATAGGCTTACCCGA 3’) and ligated into the backbone at the BglII/BamHI sites, linking tdTomato to GCaMP6f and creating Salsa6f. The amplified regions of the construct were verified by sequencing (Eton Bioscience Inc., San Diego, CA). This plasmid, driven by the CMV promoter, was used for transient transfections in HEK 293A cells with Lipofectamine 2000 and in primary human T cells with Amaxa Nucleofection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Transgenic mouse generation and breeding</title><p>The transgenic cassette in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> was generated by inserting Salsa6f, from the plasmid described above, into the Ai38 vector (Addgene Plasmid #34883) and replacing GCaMP3. The final targeting vector included the CAG (cytomegalovirus early enhancer/chicken β-actin) promoter, an LSL sequence with LoxP-STOP-LoxP, the Salsa6f probe (tdTomato-V5-GCaMP6f), the woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE), and a neomycin resistance gene (NeoR), all flanked by 5’ and 3’ Rosa26 homology arms of 1.1 and 4.3 kb. The targeting vector was linearized with PvuI and electroporated into JM8.N4 mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells of C57BL/6N background. Following selection with G418, clones carrying the <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>pCAG-FRT-LSL-Salsa6f-WPRE-bGHpA-AttB-FRT-NeoR-AttP</sup></italic> allele were screened by Southern blotting after digestion with HindIII for the 5’ end or BglI for the 3’ end. Four correctly targeted clones were expanded and checked by chromosome counting, then two clones with &gt;90% euploidy were further expanded and injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts for implantation into pseudopregnant foster mothers.

RPMI medium with 2% FCS and L-glutamine containing 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> was used for imaging experiments. For experiments involving calibration and characterization of the Salsa6f probe in Cd4-Salsa6f cells, Ringer solution containing various concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was used.

Diode lasers (488 and 561 nm) were used for excitation, and two high-sensitivity cooled GaAsP PMTs were used for detection. Cells were imaged using the Olympus 40x silicone oil objective (NA 1.25), by taking five slice z-stacks at 2 µm/step, at 5 s intervals, for up to 20 min. Temperature, humidity, and CO<sub>2</sub> were maintained using a Tokai-Hit WSKM-F1 stagetop incubator. Data were processed and analyzed using Imaris and ImageJ software. Calcium imaging experiments were done at 37°C on 2-day-activated Cd4<sup>+</sup> T cells from Cd4-Salsa6f (Het) mice, unless otherwise indicated. Salsa6f calibration experiments were done at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Two-photon microscopy</title><p>Lymph nodes images were acquired using a custom-built two photon microscope based on Olympus BX51 upright frame, Motorized ZDeck stage (Prior, Rockland, MA), with excitation generated by a tunable Chameleon femtosecond laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller et al., 2002</xref>). The following wavelengths were used to excite single or combination of fluorophores: 920 nm to excite tdTomato and GCaMP6f; 1040 nm to excite tdTomato alone. 495 nm and 538 nm dichroic filters were arranged in series to separate blue, green and red signals. Two-photon excitation maxima of tdTomato and GCaMP6f are 1040 and 920 nm, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drobizhev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Using 1040 nm excitation, tdTomato signals were readily detected up to 300 µm depth; however, 1040 is not ideal to image Salsa6f because: 1) Collagen fibers generate second harmonic at 520 nm when excited with 1040 nm, which interferes with simultaneous detection of GCaMP6f (emission maxima, 509 nm) and 2) 1040 nm does not excite GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A</xref>, top row). Alternatively, 920 nm optimally excites GCaMP6f, and excites tdTomato sufficiently, and Salsa6f signals were detected up to 300 µm depth, while second harmonic collagen signals (460 nm) can be easily separated into blue channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A</xref>, bottom row). Additionally, autofluorescent structures (LN resident DCs and fibroblastic reticular cells) show up as yellow bodies when excited with 920 nm, which serve as a guide to locate the T cell zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, 920 nm is the ideal two-photon excitation wavelength for simultaneous imaging of tdTomato and GCaMP6f as component parts of Salsa6f.</p><p>Lymph nodes were oriented with the hilum away from the water dipping microscope objective (Nikon 25x, NA 1.05). The node was maintained at 36–37°C by perfusion with medium (RPMI) bubbled with medical grade carbogen (95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) using a peristaltic heated perfusion system (Warner Instruments), with thermocouple-based temperature sensors placed next to the tissue in a custom built chamber. 3D image stacks of x = 250 μm, y = 250 μm, and z = 20 or 52 μm (4 μm step size) were sequentially acquired at 5 or 11 s intervals, respectively, using image acquisition software Slidebook (Intelligent Imaging Innovations) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matheu et al., 2015</xref>).

Maximum intensity projections of 1 pixel radius median-filtered images were used for subsequent processing and analysis. Autofluorescent cells were identified by averaging the red or green time lapse image stacks and automated local thresholding (Bernsen five pixel radius) using the public domain image processing program ImageJ. Autofluorescent cell masks were dilated by four pixels, regions exhibiting less contrast and detail due to light scattering manually masked to produce the final time lapse image mask. Red (tdTomato) channel fluorescence from Salsa6f corresponding to green (GCaMP6f) channel resting state fluorescence was determined to be fivefold higher using our standard two-photon microscope acquisition settings. Final green images were produced by subtracting a 0.2x scaled red channel image, and subsequently subtracting out the average of all green channel time lapse images. The standard deviation (SD) of each masked green channel time lapse image stack was used to determine thresholds for local (sparkle) and cell-wide Ca<sup>2+</sup> events. Thresholds for detection of local and cell-wide Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were 5.4 and 2.1 SD and 1.4 µm<sup>2</sup> and 25 µm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Local Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were excluded from the set of sparkles if they coincided with a cell-wide event. Frequency of background events was calculated using a standard normal distribution with a Z-score corresponding to the average intensity of local events (6.5 SD), which was 1 in 2 × 10<sup>10</sup> pixels (WolframAlpha). The front and back of motile T cells were traced manually from red channel TdTomato images. Individual pixel intensities from the front and back regions of interest were plotted and compared using the non-parametric Mann–Whitney test in Graphpad Prism.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge the UC Irvine Transgenic Mouse Facility for support in making the transgenic mouse, Dr. Grant MacGregor from the UC Irvine Department of Developmental and Cell Biology for excellent advice, and Dr. Jennifer Atwood of the Flow Core Facility supported by the UC Irvine Institute of Immunology.

This looks like a very useful mouse, particularly for adoptive transfer studies in the immune system, and when combined with different Cre's for different biological systems. The examples are quite detailed. For example, they examine Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in T cell activation cultures on anti-CD3/anti-CD28 at 2 days of culture and how a &quot;sustained oscillation&quot; in a small fraction of cells, which would just not be possible with an organic dye in the time frame. They also show advantages over other efforts at ratiometric, genetically encoded fluorescent proteins. They don't show comparison to the best recent FRET reporters, but it’s pretty clear they will not be able to compare in terms of the dynamic range of the green signal. The most biologically novel finding is related to demonstrating an effect of Piezo activator Yoda on Calcium responses in T cells in vitro. While this probably could have been done with Fura-2, this fits with the investigators interested in motility, and opens the possibility of examining this in vivo. This data is suggestive because it’s just one type of experiment with a small molecule activator in a cell type where the activator has not been validated to target only Piezo channels. Finally, they reveal subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes in the rear of migrating T cell in intact lymph nodes imaged ex vivo, which has not been reported before- so a new phenomenon that further demonstrates the power of the system. There is some concern that the sub cellular localisation of this signal may reflect the distribution of cytoplasm for the authors should be more conservative about interpreting this unless they want to provide clear quantification showing that the green/red ratio shows sub cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> over what is expected based on signal to noise. One can immediately begin to formulate hyptotheses about what this could be and the model will certainly be useful in determining the basis of these events.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors should provide quantification of the data described in relation to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10. A</xref> breakdown of the different patterns with number mice/LN analyzed and number of events observed. If statistically valid evidence of sub cellular Calcium is found then this should be discussed in the context of other invert studies that look at such local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. If it turns out that this is not possible, a more conservative interpretation should be presented and the advantages of the reporter would still be clear.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32417.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors should provide quantification of the data described in relation to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10.

Instead, we focused on ensuring that the signal-to-noise issues are addressed thoroughly and that the green/red ratio quantitation validates that sparkles are truly subcellular local signaling events. We are not certain about which “invert” studies the comment refers to. Local subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals have been detected using chemical indicators in a variety of cell types over the last 20-30 years. We further note that the accepted companion paper illustrates the relation of sparkles to cellular motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), presents an independent method for analyzing sparkles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), and a peptide-MHC-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> of the current manuscript illustrates detection of abundant sparkles in homozygous Cd4-Salsa6f lymph node; image processing minimized fluctuations in background fluorescence in order to identify cell-wide Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and sparkles.</p><p>In response to the reviewer comment, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> was revised and now includes a pixel intensity histogram, and two illustrations of how sparkles are localized in adoptively transferred Cd4-Salsa6f<sup>+/+</sup> T cells. The amplitude histogram (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>) illustrates sparkle signals that are more than 5 standard deviations above background noise. The remaining panels illustrate image processing on two representative sparkles to show that green/red ratios exhibit regional variation that are statistically significant beyond p values of 0.0001. The text in the Materials and methods has been amended to clarify sparkle identification, and we apologize for the confusion. As motile T cells extend, they adopt a polarized morphology, in which most cytoplasm is concentrated at the front and back with little on the sides of the cell (see our accepted companion <italic>eLife</italic> motility manuscript for additional example images). Because of this arrangement of cytoplasm, it is possible that apparent sparkles might arise from global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in which asymmetry in the distribution of T cell cytoplasm limits detection of fluorescence from other regions of the cell, or alternatively from polarized T cells in which half of the cell lies outside the imaging field. Bright local Ca<sup>2+</sup> events (&gt;5.4 SD) were excluded from the set of sparkles if they coincided with a cell-wide event, even if the intensity of cell-wide event was much lower (2.1 SD threshold). We show that sparkles are not subregions of cells with slightly higher amounts of fluorescence that we produced by inappropriately thresholding cell-wide Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. To address this potential concern, we selected example cells in which the front and back of the cells were clearly visible. We used a simple quantitative approach to establish that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals detected can selectively occupy either the front or back of these cells. Local signals with peak SNR of 6.6 and 7.3 were chosen, comparable in size to local signals reported in whole Cd4-Salsa6f lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). For both cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, five views are now shown: the median filtered maximum projection red TdTomato and green GCaMP6f channels (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B,C,H,I</xref>); the green GCaMP6f channel processed image (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D,J</xref>); two-channel composite images which have been green channel thresholded but are a clear way to visualize the locations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E,K</xref>; compare to panels D and J to ensure that the distribution of green fluorescence has not compromised by being displayed in this manner); and the G/R ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F,L</xref>). G/R ratio largely reflects the location of detected sparkles.</p></body></sub-article></article>
