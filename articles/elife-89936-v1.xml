In the auditory system, categorical information is thought to arise hierarchically, becoming increasingly prominent in higher-order cortical regions. The neural mechanisms that support this robust and flexible computation remain poorly understood. Here, we studied sound representations in the ferret primary and non-primary auditory cortex while animals engaged in a challenging sound discrimination task. Population-level decoding of simultaneously recorded single neurons revealed that task engagement caused categorical sound representations to emerge in non-primary auditory cortex. In primary auditory cortex, task engagement caused a general enhancement of sound decoding that was not specific to task-relevant categories. These findings are consistent with mixed selectivity models of neural disentanglement, in which early sensory regions build an overcomplete representation of the world and allow neurons in downstream brain regions to flexibly and selectively read out behaviorally relevant, categorical information.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auditory cortex</kwd><kwd>population coding</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GVPRS0015A2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heller</surname><given-names>Charles R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC0495</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>David</surname><given-names>Stephen V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Engagement in auditory detection task leads to selective enhancement of task relevant information by neural populations in higher order auditory cortex.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Perceptual decision-making requires behavioral responses based on specific sensory patterns that ignore distracting and irrelevant information. In the auditory system, categorical sensory representation is essential to many natural behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bizley and Cohen, 2013</xref>). For example, during language processing, vowels are perceived categorically, even though the formant frequencies that define them vary continuously across utterances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hillenbrand et al., 1995</xref>). Categorical perception is not limited to language, as subjects can learn to classify arbitrary, novel sounds according to one spectro-temporal feature while ignoring others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stilp and Kluender, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Neurophysiological studies in auditory cortex have shown that engaging in auditory behavior can enhance sensory discriminability at the level of single neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buran et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Niwa et al., 2012a</xref>) and neural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagur et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuchibhotla et al., 2017</xref>). Most of this work has demonstrated a generalized, overall improvement in sensory coding without contrasting neural representations of task-relevant versus -irrelevant features. In frontal cortex, neurons often only encode sound categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fritz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsunada et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that sound information is transformed into an invariant, categorical representation before exiting auditory cortex. Such representations require disentangling sensory features that are relevant for defining the object category from other features that are irrelevant to the category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DiCarlo and Cox, 2007</xref>). Theory predicts that neural systems can produce these invariant representations through hierarchical computation. In early processing regions, mixed selectivity of single neurons produces high-dimensional, overcomplete representations of sensory inputs and behavioral variables. From this population activity, it is straightforward for neurons in downstream areas to decode information about a specific feature that is important to the current behavior and whose representation is invariant to irrelevant sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rigotti et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that invariant auditory representations supporting perceptual discrimination arise through a behavior-dependent hierarchical process, consistent with mixed selectivity models. According to this model, engaging in an auditory behavior leads to a non-specific enhancement of auditory representations at early stages, followed by a selective enhancement of task-relevant features at later stages. Previous work has shown that the effects of task engagement are larger in non-primary auditory fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atiani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kline et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Niwa et al., 2013</xref>), as are the effects of selective attention, which may be related to invariant sound feature coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">O’Sullivan et al., 2019</xref>). Some studies have also reported that choice-related activity emerges in non-primary auditory cortex during a challenging perceptual discrimination behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsunada et al., 2016</xref>), although factors affecting choice coding may be task-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bizley et al., 2013</xref>). Together, these findings are consistent with the idea that behaviorally relevant neural representations are computed hierarchically in auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lestang et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the emergence of invariant sound coding, we recorded neural population activity from primary and non-primary fields of the ferret auditory cortex while animals alternated between active tone-in-noise detection and passive listening to task stimuli. We designed the task so that behavioral sessions contained multiple different target and distractor sounds and used decoding analysis to measure how neural populations discriminate between both task-relevant and -irrelevant sound features. For this analysis, we developed decoding-based dimensionality reduction (dDR), which projects neural activity into a low-dimensional subspace spanning both changes in mean firing rate between categories and covariability across trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heller and David, 2022</xref>) dDR prevents bias that can affect population decoding in behavioral studies with relatively limited numbers of trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanitscheider et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moreno-Bote et al., 2014</xref>). Effects of task engagement were highly variable across individual neurons, but the population-level analysis revealed that sound coding in primary auditory cortex was broadly and non-specifically improved by task engagement. In contrast, an enhanced, selective representation of task-relevant features emerged in non-primary auditory cortex. The degree of task-relevant enhancement was correlated with behavioral performance, consistent with the hypothesis that categorical representations in non-primary auditory cortex inform behavioral choices.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Psychometric tone-in-noise detection behavior</title><p>To study how neural representations of sound category emerge in auditory cortex, we trained four male ferrets to perform a go/no-go tone-in-noise detection task. Animals reported the occurrence of a target tone in a sequence of narrowband noise distractors by licking a piezo spout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, Methods: Behavioral paradigm, distractor stimulus sound level: 60 dB SPL). Targets were presented with variable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), masked by noise centered at the same frequency. We describe SNR as the overall SPL of the target relative to the distractor noise level. Thus, an SNR of –5 dB corresponds to a target level of 55 dB SPL while an Inf dB SNR corresponds to a target tone presented without any masking noise. A subset of behavioral trials in each experiment included an explicit catch stimulus whose center frequency was matched to that of the target tone. This task design permitted us to probe neural coding of both task-relevant sound features (presence or absence of a target tone) and -irrelevant features (level of noise masking the target tone, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tone-in-noise detection behavior.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of go/no-go tone-in-noise detection task. Licking responses to target tones were rewarded, while responses to narrowband noise distractors were penalized with a timeout. Target tone frequency was fixed during a single behavior session and masked by narrowband (0.3 octave) noise centered at the same frequency with variable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Variable SNR was achieved by varying the overall SPL of the target relative to the fixed (60 dB SPL) distractor noise, e.g., –5 dB SNR corresponds to a 55 dB SPL target with 60 dB SPL masking noise. Infinite (inf) dB SNR corresponds to a target tone presented in isolation (60 dB SPL). The ‘Catch’ distractor was identical to the masking noise but with no tone.

Recordings were targeted to each respective region based on functional mapping of neural responses (Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Behavior alternated between blocks of active task engagement and passive listening to task stimuli. During passive listening, licking responses were not rewarded and animals quickly disengaged from the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">David et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Sound-evoked spiking activity was compared between active and passive states to study the impact of task engagement on sound representation. In both A1 and dPEG, responses to target and catch stimuli were significantly discriminable for a subset of single neurons (about 25% in both areas, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>, bootstrap test). This supports the idea that stimulus identity can be decoded in both brain regions, regardless of task performance. However, the fact that the responses of most neurons in both brain areas could not significantly discriminate target vs. catch stimuli also highlights the diversity of sound encoding observed at the level of single neurons. The accuracy of catch vs. target discrimination for each neuron was quantified using neural d-prime, the z-scored difference in target minus catch spiking response for each neuron (Methods: Single neuron PSTHs and d-prime <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Niwa et al., 2012a</xref>). Task engagement was associated with significant changes in catch vs. target d-prime for roughly 10% of neurons in both A1 (40/481 neurons, bootstrap test) and dPEG (33/377 neurons, bootstrap test). This included neurons that both increased their discriminability and decreased their discriminability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). Thus, the effects of task engagement at the level of single neurons were relatively mild and inconsistent across the population; many neurons showed no significant change, and of those that did, the effects were bidirectional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>State-dependent modulation of single neuron target vs. catch discrimination.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Example peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) responses from a single recording site in A1.

Therefore, we hypothesized that in A1 modeling changes in covariability would be required to explain the observed task-dependent changes in generalized sound discriminability.

In A1, task engagement improved neural coding uniformly across all sound categories, both relevant and irrelevant to the current task. In dPEG, on the other hand, the neural population selectively enhanced the representation only of sound categories relevant to the tone-in-noise behavior. Task-dependent changes in neural response gain were sufficient to account for this emergent selectivity. In addition, we observed striking changes in population-level correlated activity that were strongly dependent on brain region. The pattern of task-related effects is consistent with a hierarchical, mixed selectivity model of sensory decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rigotti et al., 2013</xref>). Neural populations in early brain areas form a sparse, overcomplete representation of sensory inputs, which supports a simple linear readout of task-relevant features in downstream areas. The selective changes are measurable only at the population level in dPEG, but a subsequent stage of processing would support category-specific coding by single neurons, as in frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fritz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsunada et al., 2011</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Emergent invariant, behaviorally relevant sound representations in non-primary auditory cortex</title><p>It has been proposed that auditory cortex dynamically computes representations of task-relevant sound features from non-specific spectro-temporal inputs to A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lestang et al., 2023</xref>).

In our study, we asked how specific these changes in neural activity are to the encoding of task-relevant vs. irrelevant sound features. We found a clear dissociation between cortical fields; behaviorally relevant representations first emerged in the non-primary field, dPEG. In the frontal cortex (FC) of ferrets engaged in a similar tone detection behavior, single-neuron activity is behaviorally gated. Responses to a set of target tones are strongly enhanced when they require a behavioral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fritz et al., 2010</xref>). In our task, the enhanced category representation in dPEG supports a simple linear readout of ‘go’ versus ‘no-go’ categories that could provide input to category-specific neurons in FC.</p><p>Consistent with the hypothesis that the selective enhancement of category representation is causally related to behavior, we found that decoding accuracy in dPEG tracked the animal’s behavioral performance. This correlation between neural activity and behavioral performance is consistent with previous observations that choice-related activity is present or is stronger in non-primary versus primary auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bizley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsunada et al., 2016</xref>).

Future studies that precisely stimulate or suppress activity along the auditory pathway may definitively probe the causal role that each region plays in auditory perception.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Population activity reveals hierarchically organized representations in the auditory system</title><p>Despite the diverse task-dependent changes in sound representations across individual neurons, analysis of sound discriminability at the population level revealed striking qualitative differences between A1 and dPEG. This finding highlights the value of studying auditory coding at the level of neural populations, which provides a more complete assessment of system-wide function than individual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagur et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lestang et al., 2023</xref>). In our analysis, we defined population coding accuracy as the amount of stimulus information an ideal observer could extract from simultaneously recorded population activity. Thus, our results should be interpreted as an upper bound on the information transmitted by a group of neurons about a particular stimulus. Critically, these measures do not necessarily reflect the information utilized by the animal. In A1, for example, we found a decoding axis for every stimulus category along which task engagement improved sound representation. Despite this global improvement in A1, decoding downstream in dPEG was only improved for task-relevant sounds. This selective change indicates that dPEG does not always read out information optimally from A1. Instead, during the engaged state, it reads out activity along an axis of A1 population activity that is invariant to task-irrelevant stimuli.</p><p>At face value, these findings may seem paradoxical. If only one dimension of A1 activity is utilized downstream, why does task engagement improve sound representations so broadly? Theories of neural disentanglement and the formation of categorical representations posit that the brain must first build overcomplete, high-dimensional representations of the sensory world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DiCarlo and Cox, 2007</xref>). From this high-dimensional activity, it is straightforward to build a linear decoder, tuned to the task at hand, that extracts only task-relevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rigotti et al., 2013</xref>). Our findings are consistent with this theory and describe a hierarchical network for computing sound categories. An overcomplete representation in A1 is selectively filtered at the population level in dPEG, and subsequently, this activity may provide input to category-specific neurons in areas such as FC.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for the role of correlated activity in sensory processing</title><p>An important advantage of our experimental setup was that we simultaneously recorded the activity of populations of neurons, contrasting with previous studies that built pseudo-populations from serial experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagur et al., 2018</xref>). This approach allowed us to investigate how trial-by-trial covariability across the population depends on task engagement and contributes to sound encoding. Theoretical work has shown that trial-by-trial covariance can impair population coding accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>). Early experiments in visual cortex supported this idea, demonstrating that selective attention improves perceptual discriminations primarily by reducing covariance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen and Maunsell, 2009</xref>). We found task engagement modulated covariability patterns in both A1 and dPEG, broadly consistent with prior work in the auditory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Downer et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, however, the changes in covariance had no impact on emergent behavioral selectivity in dPEG or on the mean generalized improvement in sound coding in A1. What, then, do these changes in correlated neural activity reflect? In A1, we found that covariability became more aligned with the behaviorally relevant sensory decoding axis during task engagement. This finding is in opposition to a model in which covariability reflects information-limiting noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartolo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moreno-Bote et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rumyantsev et al., 2020</xref>). Instead, we hypothesize that covariability in A1 primarily reflects top-down gain modulation that drives changes in selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denfield et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). During the task-engaged state, top-down signals selectively modulate sound-evoked responses of neurons tuned to task-relevant stimuli, thus boosting the representation of task-relevant sounds for downstream readout. If gain is not perfectly static, but varies in strength from trial to trial, this could explain the observed increase in covariability amongst task-relevant neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denfield et al., 2018</xref>). Simultaneous recordings from multiple auditory fields that permit analysis of the communication subspace between areas may provide further insight into the interaction between top-down signals and sound-evoked responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Semedo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Srinath et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the direction of covariability in dPEG changed randomly with respect to the behaviorally relevant decoding axis. During both passive and engaged states, covariability remained mostly orthogonal to the sensory decoding axis and, therefore, had little impact on population decoding accuracy. These findings are consistent with recent work suggesting that trial-by-trial covariability is primarily orthogonal to sensory coding dimensions and reflects non-sensory motor or cognitive variables, such as whisking, running, or arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stringer et al., 2019b</xref>).

Recording sites were targeted based on external landmarks and tonotopic maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atiani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bizley et al., 2005</xref>). After recordings were complete at one location, the microcraniotomy was allowed to close and a new one was opened at a different location.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioral paradigm</title><p>Four adult male ferrets were trained on a positively reinforced, go/no-go tone-in-noise detection task. Throughout behavioral training, animals were provided with free access to water on weekends and placed on partial water restriction during the week. During restriction periods, animals were only able to receive liquid rewards during behavioral training. Supplemental water was provided after a training session, if necessary, to ensure that animals maintained at least 90% of their baseline body weight throughout training.</p><p>Single behavioral trials consisted of a sequence of narrow-band noise bursts (0.3-octave bandwidth, 0.3 s duration, 0.2 s ISI), followed by a target tone (0.3 s duration). Animals reported the presence of the target tone by licking a water spout. Licks were detected through a piezo electric sensor glued to the spout (two animals) or by a video camera monitoring the luminance change in a window around the spout (two animals). Licks occurring during a target window (0.2–1.0 s following target onset) were rewarded with a high-protein, high-calorie supplement (Ensure), while licks outside the window were penalized with a timeout (3–10 s). The number of distractor stimuli per trial was distributed randomly with a flat hazard function to prevent behavioral timing strategies. Each behavioral session consisted of 100–200 trials. A subset of trials contained an explicit catch stimulus – a noise burst with the same center frequency as the target tone and occurring with the same temporal distribution as targets. Trials containing a catch stimulus were always concluded by a pure tone reminder target, which was rewarded if the animal successfully withheld responding to the catch licked in response to the pure tone.</p><p>The center frequencies of distractor noise bursts spanned three octaves around the target tone frequency, which was varied randomly between days (0 .l–20 kHz). Initially, training sessions contained only a single pure tone target (Inf dB SNR). As training progressed, masking noise was introduced to the target tone in order to increase task difficulty. By the end of training, a single behavioral session could consist of up to four different target stimuli (–10 dB, –5 dB, 0 dB, Inf dB). More difficult target stimuli (e.g. –10 dB) occurred more rarely than easier stimuli (e.g<italic>.</italic> Inf dB) during behavioral sessions to maintain motivation. In all cases, noise masking the target was exactly matched to the catch stimulus (centered at the target frequency). Target frequency was fixed within a session, and variable SNR was achieved by adjusting tone amplitude relative to the fixed masking noise. That is, the masking noise (and distractor stimuli) were always presented with an overall sound level of 60 dB SPL. Infinite (inf) dB trials corresponded to trials where the target tone was presented at 60 dB SPL without any masking noise present, 0 dB to trials where the target was 60 dB SPL, –5 dB to trials where the target was presented at 55 dB SPL etc. Neurophysiological recordings proceeded only after animals were able to perform the full, variable SNR task with consistently above chance level performance on –5 dB SNR target tones.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Acoustic stimuli</title><p>All experiments were performed in a sound-attenuating chamber (Gretch-Ken).

Digital acoustic signals were transformed to analog (National Instruments), amplified (Crown), and delivered through free-field speakers (Manger, 50–35,000 Hz flat gain). Speakers were located 80 cm from the animal at +/-30 deg. azimuth. Stimuli were presented from a single speaker (left or right).

Tuning curves were calculated using pure tone stimuli (100ms duration, 200ms ISI, 3–7oc taves). Neurons were confirmed to be in A1 based on stereotypical response properties: short latency responses to sound onset, sharp and consistent frequency tuning across layers, and a characteristic dorsal-ventral tonotopic map across penetrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shamma et al., 1993</xref>). Once A1 was located, subsequent craniotomies were opened in small lateral steps. Tuning was measured at each recording site, and the border between A1 and dPEG was defined as the location where the tonotopic map gradient reversed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atiani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bizley et al., 2005</xref>).

We measured the false alarm rate from response to the catch stimulus, whose temporal distribution within a trial was explicitly balanced with target locations across trials. Thus, for each target SNR, d-prime described how well the animal could discriminate that target from the catch stimulus. A d-prime of 0 indicates chance level performance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Single neuron evoked activity and d-prime</title><p>Responses of single neurons to task stimuli were measured by computing each neuron’s peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) response to each stimulus. For visualization (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), spiking activity was binned at 20ms, normalized to its 100ms pre-stimulus baseline, z-scored, and smoothed with a gaussian kernel of width of 30ms. Single-trial responses were computed as a neuron’s mean z-scored activity during the 300ms sound evoked window. For active trials, we included responses measured on hit, correct reject, and miss trials. To quantify neural discriminability between catch and target sounds, we measured the difference between the mean z-scored response to target versus catch stimuli (neural d-prime), which is analogous to the behavioral d-prime described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Neural population d-prime</title><p>To determine how well the activity of simultaneously recorded populations of neurons could discriminate between task stimuli, we measured neural population d-prime.

Results were grouped into behaviorally relevant (target versus catch) and behaviorally irrelevant (target versus target, distractor versus distractor) categories. To be included in the analysis, we required that a sound stimulus must have been presented in at least five active and five passive trials. Thus, the number of target stimuli analyzed per session depended on the animal’s performance and how long they remained engaged in the task; for shorter behavioral sessions, fewer repetitions of each stimulus were presented and target conditions with low repetition count were omitted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Choice probability analysis</title><p>We performed a choice decoding analysis on hit vs. miss trials.

Results were similar for a control analysis that ignored pupil-dependent changes, indicating that the emergent selectivity in dPEG does not depend on this correction for generalized effects arousal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical tests</title><p>Given that the noise properties of neurons are not well understood, particularly around changes in behavioral state, a formal power analysis was not possible. Choice of sample size was based on standard practices in studies of cortex in ferrets and similarly sized species. For each experimental recording session, we measured the population decoding performance of multiple stimulus pairs. To control for any statistical dependencies between these data points within a recording session, we first took the mean projection across stimulus pairs within each recording session before measuring p-values. This procedure reduces our statistical power but provides more conservative estimates of statistical significance which are more robust to detecting spurious false positive results. For all pairwise statistical tests shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> we performed a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Significance was determined at the alpha = 0.05 level. The number of unique recording sessions and animals that went into each comparison are listed in the main text/figure legends, along with the p-value for each analysis.</p><p>The one exception to this general approach is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, where we analyzed the sound discrimination abilities of single neurons. In this case, we computed p-values for each neuron and stimulus independently. First, for each neuron and catch vs. target stimulus pair, we measured d-prime (see Methods: Single neuron evoked activity and d-prime). We generated a null distribution of d-prime values for each neuron-stimulus pair, under each experimental condition by shuffling stimulus identity across trials before computing d-prime (100 resamples). A neuron was determined to have a significant d-prime for a given target vs. catch pair if its actual measured d-prime was greater than the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of the null d-prime distribution. Second, for each neuron and catch vs. target stimulus pair, we tested if d-prime was significantly different between active and passive conditions. To test this, we followed a similar procedure as above, however, rather than shuffle stimulus identity, we shuffled active vs. passive trial labels. This allowed us to generate a null distribution of active vs. passive d-prime difference for each neuron and stimulus pair. A neuron was determined to have a significant change in d-prime between conditions if the actual Δ d-prime lay outside the 95% confidence interval of the null Δ d-prime distribution.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we tested if the change in neural population d-prime was correlated with behavior performance on a per-target stimulus basis. Because each target had different behavioral performance (due to varying SNR), here we treated each stimulus as an independent sample. Therefore, correlation was measured between <italic>n</italic> sessions x <italic>n</italic> target stimuli neural vs. behavioral d-primes. To determine the significance of correlation in each brain region, we performed random bootstrap resampling to generate a null distribution of correlation values. The correlation for a given brain region was deemed significant if the actual observed correlation was greater than the 97.5-percentile of the null distribution.</p><p>To evaluate the performance of FA model simulations in predicting behavioral selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and Δ d-prime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), we measured the correlation between simulated and actual metrics for each model. To determine if stepwise changes in the FA model (e.g. adding task-dependent gain modulation) caused significant improvements in model performance, we compared correlation coefficients for each model to the correlation coefficient for the final model. To do this, we computed 1000 bootstrap resamples of the correlation coefficient for each model. If the 97.5-percentile of this distribution was greater than the observed correlation for the full model, we determined that it was not significantly different. That is, if the observed correlation for the full model lay within the 95% confidence interval of the null bootstrapped distribution for a given model, it was determined to not be significantly different than the full model.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in accordance with the Oregon Health and Science University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and conforms to standards of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).

Using a variety of methods, the authors convincingly show differential effects of task engagement on population neural activity in primary vs non-primary auditory cortex; notably that in the primary auditory cortex, task-engagement (1) improves discriminability for both task-relevant and non-task relevant dimensions, and (2) improves the alignment between covariability and sound discrimination axes; whereas in the non-primary auditory cortex, task-engagement (1) improves discriminability for only task-relevant dimensions, and (2) does not affect the alignment between covariability and sound discrimination axes. They additionally show that task-engagement changes in gain can account for the selectivity noted in the discriminability of non-primary auditory neurons. They also admirably attempt to isolate task-engagement from arousal fluctuations, by using fluctuations in pupil size as a proxy for physiological arousal. This is a well-carried out study with thoughtful analyses which in large part achieves its aims to evaluate how task-engagement changes neural activity across multiple auditory regions . As with all work, there are several caveats or areas for future study/analysis. First, the sounds used here (tones, and narrow-band noise) are relatively simple sounds; previous work suggests that exactly what activity is observed within each region (e.g., sensory only, decision-related, etc) may depend in part upon what stimuli are used. Therefore, while the current study adds importance to the literature, future work may consider the use of more varied stimuli. Second, the animals here were engaged in a behavioral task; but apart from an initial calculation of behavioral d', the task performance (and its effect on neural activity) is largely unaddressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89936.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Heller</surname><given-names>Charles R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Oregon Health and Science University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Portland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hamersky</surname><given-names>Gregory R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Oregon Health and Science University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Portland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>David</surname><given-names>Stephen V</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Oregon Health &amp; Science University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Portland</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>…I find the concept and execution of the study very interesting and elegant.

Including significance here was clarifying and helps to strengthen our claim that state-dependent changes in neural activity were smaller and more diverse for single neurons than at the population level. We modified Figure 2b-c to indicate whether each neuron’s response to the target stimulus was significantly different than its response to the catch stimulus. The same test was performed in Supplementary Figure 3. Additionally, we added a statistical test in Figure 2d-e to indicate, for each pair of target/catch stimuli, whether discrimination (d-prime) changed significantly between active and passive conditions. Furthermore, we modified the text of the second paragraph under the results heading: “Diverse effects of task engagement on single neurons in primary and non-primary auditory cortex” to reference and interpret the results of these significance tests. The new text reads as follows (L. 121):</p><p>“Sound-evoked spiking activity was compared between active and passive states to study the impact of task engagement on sound representation. In both A1 and dPEG, responses to target and catch stimuli were significantly discriminable for a subset of single neurons (about 25% in both areas, Figure 2A-C, Supplemental Figures 3-5, bootstrap test). This supports the idea that stimulus identity can be decoded in both brain regions, regardless of task performance. However, the fact that the responses of most neurons in both brain areas could not significantly discriminate target vs. catch stimuli also highlights the diversity of sound encoding observed at the level of single neurons. The accuracy of catch vs. target discrimination for each neuron was quantified using neural d-prime, the z-scored difference in target minus catch spiking response for each neuron (Methods: Single neuron PSTHs and d-prime (Niwa et al., 2012a)). Task engagement was associated with significant changes in catch vs. target d-prime for roughly 10% of neurons in both A1 (40 / 481 neurons, bootstrap test) and dPEG (33 / 377 neurons, bootstrap test). This included neurons that both increased their discriminability and decreased their discriminability (Figure 2D-E). Thus, the effects of task engagement at the level of single neurons were relatively mild and inconsistent across the population; many neurons showed no significant change and of those that did, effects were bidirectional (Figure 2D-E).”</p><p>We also included an additional methods paragraph in the “Statistical tests” section to describe the bootstrapping procedure used for these significance tests (L. 644):</p><p>“The one exception to this general approach is in Figure 2, where we analyzed the sound discrimination abilities of single neurons. In this case, we computed p-values for each neuron and stimulus independently. First, for each neuron and catch vs. target stimulus pair, we measured d-prime (see Methods: Single neuron evoked activity and d-prime). We generated a null distribution of d-prime values for each neuron-stimulus pair, under each experimental condition by shuffling stimulus identity across trials before computing d-prime (100 resamples). A neuron was determined to have a significant d-prime for a given target vs. catch pair if its actual measured d-prime was greater than the 95th percentile of the null d-prime distribution. Second, for each neuron and catch vs. target stimulus pair, we tested if d-prime was significantly different between active and passive conditions. To test this, we followed a similar procedure as above, however, rather than shuffle stimulus identity, we shuffled active vs. passive trial labels. This allowed us to generate a null distribution of active vs. passive d-prime difference for each neuron and stimulus pair. A neuron was determined to have a significant change in d-prime between conditions if the actual Δ d-prime lay outside the 95% confidence interval of the null Δ d-prime distribution.”</p><p>For Figure 2a, we chose not to indicate significance on the figure to avoid clutter, since the significance for all neurons in the population are shown in panels b-c anyway. Additionally, the difference plot shown in panel a is in units of z-scores, which we believe already gives a raw sense of the significance of the target vs. catch response change per neuron in this example dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 3.

We agree that clarification about the overall sound level used here would be helpful. We have modified the methods section “Behavioral paradigm” to include the following sentence (L. 450):</p><p>“That is, the masking noise (and distractor stimuli) were always presented with an overall sound level of 60 dB SPL. Infinite (inf) dB trials corresponded to trials where the target tone was presented at 60 dB SPL without any masking noise present, 0 dB to trials where the target was 60 dB SPL, -5 dB to trials where the target was presented at 55 dB SPL etc.”</p><p>In addition, we have modified the main text (L. 82):</p><p>“Animals reported the occurrence of a target tone in a sequence of narrowband noise distractors by licking a piezo spout (Figure 1A, Methods: Behavioral paradigm, distractor stimulus sound level: 60 dB SPL). … We describe SNR as the overall SPL of the target relative to distractor noise level. Thus, an SNR of –5 dB corresponds to a target level of 55 dB SPL while an Inf dB SNR corresponds to a target tone presented without any masking noise.”</p><p>And Figure legend 1 now explicitly states the sound level used in the experiments (L. 104):</p><p>“Variable SNR was achieved by varying overall SPL of the target relative to the fixed (60 dB SPL) distractor noise, e.g., -5 dB SNR corresponds to a 55 dB SPL target with 60 dB SPL masking noise. Infinite (inf) dB SNR corresponds to a target tone presented in isolation (60 dB SPL).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I very much appreciate the attempt to disentangle task engagement from generalized arousal state, and specifically, addressing this through the use of pupillometry. However, by focusing the discussion of pupil dynamics solely on the arousal-state aspects of pupil size, the paper doesn't address the increasing evidence suggests that pupil size may fluctuate based upon a lot of other things, including perceptual events (see Kronemer et al, 2022 for a recent human paper; for auditory: Zekveld et al 2018 (review) and Montes-Lourido et al, 2021; but many many others, too). It would be nice to see either a bit more nuanced discussion of what pupil size may be indicating (easier), or analyzing the behavior in the context of pupil dynamics (a heavier lift).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We agree that it is worth mentioning these more nuanced aspects of cognition that may be reflected by pupil size. Therefore, we also analyzed pupil size in the context of behavioral performance (see Supplemental Figure 6) and added the following text to the results (L. 193).</p><p>“In addition to reflecting overall arousal level, pupil size has also been reported to reflect more nuanced cognitive variables such as, for example, listening effort (Zekveld et al., 2014). Furthermore, rodent data suggests that optimal sensory detection is associated with intermediate pupil size (McGinley et al., 2015), consistent with the hypothesis of an inverted-U relationship between arousal and behavioral performance (Zekveld et al., 2014). To determine if this pattern was true for the animals in our task, we measured the dynamics of pupil size in the context of behavioral performance. Across animals, task stimuli evoked robust pupil dilation that varied with trial outcome (Supplemental Figure 6b-c). Notably, pre-trial pupil size was significantly different between correct (hit and correct reject), hit, and miss trials (Supplemental Figure 6b-c), recapitulating the finding of an inverted-U relationship to performance in rodents (McGinley et al., 2015). Since we focused only on correct trials in our decoding analysis, these outcome-dependent differences in pupil size are unlikely to contribute to the emergent decoding selectivity in dPEG.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) I think it would make this paper shine that much more if behavioral performance were not subsumed into the overall label of task engagement. You've already established you have performance that varies as a function of SNR; I would love to see the neural d' and covariability related to the behavioral d' (in the comparisons where this is possible). I would also love to see a more direct measure of choice for those stimuli that show variable behavior (e.g., a choice probability analysis or something of the like would seem to be easily applied to the target SNRs of -5 and 0 dB); and compare task engaged activity of hits vs misses vs passive listening to those same stimuli. You discuss previous studies looking at choice-related/decision-related activity and draw parallels to this work-given that there is the opportunity with this data set to *directly* assess choice-related activity, the absence of such an analysis seems like a missed opportunity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this feedback. We agree that “task engagement” is not a unimodal state and that a more fine-grained analysis of task-engaged neural activity, according to behavioral choice, could be informative.</p><p>First, we would like to point out that in Figure 4 we did already compare behavioral d’ to delta neural d’. We found that the two were significantly correlated in dPEG, but not in A1. This suggests that task-dependent changes in stimulus decoding in dPEG, but not A1, are predictive of behavioral performance. This is consistent with the finding that task-relevant stimulus representations were selectively enhanced in dPEG, but not in A1.</p><p>Second, we added a choice decoding analysis to address whether auditory cortex represents the animal’s choice in our task. The results of this analysis are summarized in Supplemental Figure 8 and are discussed under the results section: “Behavioral performance is correlated with neural coding changes in non-primary auditory cortex only.” (L. 226):</p><p>“The previous analysis suggests that the task-dependent increase in stimulus information present in dPEG population activity is predictive of overall task performance. Next, we asked whether the population activity in either brain region was directly predictive of behavioral choice on single hit vs. miss trials. To do this, we conducted a choice probability analysis (Methods). We found that in both brain regions choice could be decoded well above chance level (Supplemental Figure 8). Choice information was present throughout the entire trial and did not increase during the target stimulus presentation. This suggests that the difference in population activity primarily reflects a cognitive state associated with the probability of licking on a given trial, or “impulsivity” rather than “choice.” This interpretation is consistent with our finding that baseline pupil size on each trial is predictive of trial outcome (Supplemental Figure 6b).”</p><p>To keep our decoding approach consistent throughout the manuscript, we followed the same approach for choice decoding as we did for stimulus decoding (perform dDR then calculate neural d-prime in the dimensionality reduced space). To make the results more interpretable, we converted choice d-prime to a choice probability (percent correctly decoded choices) using leave-one-out cross validation. (We note that d-prime and percent correct are very highly correlated statistics.) This is described in the methods as follows (L. 550):</p><p>“We performed a choice decoding analysis on hit vs. miss trials. We followed the same procedure as described above for stimulus decoding, where instead of a pair of stimuli our two classes to be decoded were “hit trial” vs. “miss trial”. That is, for each target stimulus we computed the optimal linear discrimination axis separating hit vs. miss trials (Abbott and Dayan, 1999) in the reduced dimensionality space identified with dDR (Heller and David, 2022). For the sake of interpretability with respect to previous work we reported choice probability as the percentage of correctly decoded trial outcomes rather than d-prime. Percent correct was calculated by projecting the population activity onto the optimal discrimination axis and using leave-one-out cross validation to measure the number of correct classifications.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It would also be interesting to look at population coding across sessions (although the point is taken that within a session allows the opportunity to assess covariability). Minorly self-servingly but very much related to the above point, Christison-Lagay et al, 2017 employed a similar detect-in-noise task, analyzed single neurons and population level activity, and looked at putative choice-related activity. The current study has the opportunity to expand on that kind of analysis that much more by looking across multiple sites vs within a given recording site; and compare across regions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this point, we agree that it is important. When studying population coding it is critical to consider the impact of covariability between neurons. Therefore, it is worthwhile to revisit our interpretations of prior results, e.g., Christison-Lagay et al, 2017, which studied population coding by combining neurons across different sessions, given that we now have access to simultaneously recorded population data.</p><p>First, we would like to point out that this was the primary motivation for our simulation analyses presented in Figure 5. Using simulations, we found that task-dependent gain modulation (which can be observed across sessions) was sufficient to explain our primary finding – selective enhancement in decoding of behaviorally relevant sound stimuli in dPEG.</p><p>Second, to address the question about how covariability affects choice-related information in auditory cortex and compare our findings with prior studies, we performed the same set of simulations for choice probability analysis. We found that, again, choice-dependent gain modulation was sufficient to explain our findings. That is, simulations with hit- vs. miss-dependent gain changes, but fixed covariability, closely mirrored the choice probability we observed in the raw data. An additional simulation where covariability between all neurons was set to zero also recapitulated our findings in the raw data. Collectively, this suggests that covariability does not play a significant role in shaping the choice information present in A1 and dPEG during this task. We have added the following text to the manuscript to summarize this finding (L. 293):</p><p>“Finally, we used the same simulation approach to determine what aspects of population activity carry the “choice” related information we observed in A1 and dPEG (Figure 4 – figure supplement 1). Similar to our findings for stimulus decoding, we found that gain modulation alone was sufficient to recapitulate the choice information present in the raw data for this task. This helps frame prior work that pooled neurons across sessions to study population coding of choice in similar auditory discrimination tasks (Christison-Lagay et al, 2017).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
