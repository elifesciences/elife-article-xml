Here, to test causal function, an array of G4s, or control sequence that does not form G4s, were inserted within chromatin in cells. In vivo G4 formation of the inserted G4 sequence array, and not the control sequence, was confirmed using G4-selective antibody. Compared to the control insert, we observed a remarkable increase in the number of 3D chromatin looping interactions from the inserted G4 array. This was evident within the immediate topologically associated domain (TAD) and throughout the genome. Locally, recruitment of enhancer histone marks and the transcriptional coactivator p300/Acetylated-p300 increased in the G4-array, but not in the control insertion. Resulting promoter-enhancer interactions and gene activation were clear up to 5 Mb away from the insertion site. Together, these show the causal role of G4s in enhancer function and long-range chromatin interactions. Mechanisms of 3D topology are primarily based on DNA-bound architectural proteins that induce/stabilize long-range interactions. Involvement of the underlying intrinsic DNA sequence/structure in 3D looping shown here therefore throws new light on how long-range chromosomal interactions might be induced or maintained.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>G-quadruplex</kwd><kwd>enhancer</kwd><kwd>chromatin looping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009053</institution-id><institution>DBT/Wellcome Trust India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA/S/18/2/504021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chowdhury</surname><given-names>Shantanu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Non-duplex DNA structures induce distant chromatin-chromatin interactions and gene activation over long distances.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>G-quadruplexes (G4s), non-canonical DNA secondary structures with quartets of Guanines bonded by Hoogsteen base pairing, are instrumental in regulating gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sengupta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Varshney et al., 2020</xref>).

G4s can regulate gene expression by directly regulating recruitment of transcription factors and RNA polymerase or via alteration of DNA accessibility by modulating the epigenetic state of the gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hussain et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lago et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mukherjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sharma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Varshney et al., 2020</xref>).

Interestingly, recent computational studies observed enrichment of G4s in TAD boundaries along with higher enrichment of architectural proteins like CTCF and cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hou et al., 2019</xref>). Further, multiple studies noted the presence of G4s correlated with enhancer histone marks like H3K27Ac and H3K4Me1, and predominantly open chromatin regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calo and Wysocka, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shlyueva et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although these studies implicate the role of G4s in long-range interactions and/or enhancer function, this was not directly tested. Here we asked if G4 structures might directly alter 3D chromatin, and affect long-range interactions including the epigenetic state of chromatin. To address this, we inserted an array of G4s into an isolated locus devoid of G4-forming sequences using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. To evaluate the specific function of G4s, a similar sequence of identical length but devoid of G4-forming capability was introduced. Using these pair of cell lines, we observed insertion of G4s specifically led to the recruitment of enhancer histone marks and increased expression of genes in a 10 Mb window. 3 C and Hi-C results showed induced long-range interactions throughout the genome affecting topologically associated domains (TADs) that were specifically due to the incorporated G4s, and not found in case of the control insertion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Insertion of an array of G4s in an isolated locus</title><p>First, we sought to insert an array of G4s in a relatively isolated locus.

In addition, this region was devoid of any G4s in the vicinity (no G4 forming motifs in a±2.5 kb window). Thereafter, we artificially inserted an array of G4 forming sequences (275 bp long) at this region near the 79 millionth position of chromosome 12 (79M in following text, chr12:79872423–79872424, hg19 genome assembly) using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To study specific effects due to G4s, if any, a control sequence of identical length was inserted in HEK293T cells at the same locus where specific G/Cs necessary for G4 formation were substituted so that G4s are not formed by this sequence (G4-mutated control, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>); we also ensured that the GC content was minimally affected by the substitutions (72.4% from 76.73%).

For a closer analysis, we mapped the interaction frequency in a±100 kb window centered on the insertion site. This clearly showed the difference in the number of interactions between the upstream region vis-a-vis the region downstream of the insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>To further confirm we used an independent HiC analysis method, HOMER (Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinz et al., 2018</xref>) to compute the enhanced/reduced long-range interactions in the G4-array insert, compared to the control G4-mutated insert.

Furthermore, the overall nature of the TAD was not disturbed, and largely consistent with what is noted in cells with no insertion. Overall, these support that the insertion of G4s induced long-range interactions with minimal organizational changes in the 3D chromatin domain, underlining the molecular role of G4s in the arrangement of 3D chromatin.</p><p>A second significant feature was notable at the insertion locus. The number of induced long-range interactions was more significant downstream of the insertion site, compared to the upstream region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D and F</xref>). A close look at the Hi-C contact matrices indicated that the site of insertion was very close and downstream to the TAD boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>).

Next, we checked for changes in chromatin and the surrounding gene expression due to G4 formation. A relative increase in the H3K4Me1 and H3K27Ac enhancer marks in the G4-array was evident compared to the G4-mutated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>), consistent with earlier observations following G4 insertion at the 79 M locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).

These suggest the impact of G4 formation on chromatin is likely context-specific, that is, dependent on the chromatin state of the adjacent regions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To directly test if G4s affect long-range chromatin organization we artificially inserted an array of G4s in the chromatin. Hi-C experiments clearly showed an enhanced number of cis- and trans-chromosomal long-range interactions emanating from the introduced G4s. This was G4-specific because a similar sequence devoid of G4-forming capability introduced at the same site did not result in enhanced interactions. Furthermore, interestingly, most new long-range interactions following G4 incorporation were downstream from the site of insertion. This is likely because the G4 insertion locus was proximal to the upstream TAD boundary thereby restricting most new interactions to the downstream regions within the TAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).</p><p>The insertion of the G4 array led to enhanced expression of genes up to 5 Mb away compared to cells with the G4 mutated control insertion. Furthermore, there was enrichment in the H3K4Me1 and H3K27Ac enhancer histone marks, along with recruitment of transcriptional coactivator p300 and more prominently the functionally active acetylated p300/CBP. This was clearly due to the introduction of G4s and not found upon the introduction of the G4-mutated control sequence. The enhancer marks were relatively reduced, although not markedly, when the inserted G4s were specifically disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The enhancer-like effects observed upon G4 insertion at the 79 M locus were largely replicated when the same G4-array was inserted in another locus (10 M). Interestingly, the G4-dependent increase in H3K27Me3 at the 10 M locus, in addition to the enhancer mark H3K4Me1, supports formation of a poised enhacer-like state, as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calo and Wysocka, 2013</xref>). Although both the inserted G4 regions induced enhancer-like chromatin, notable context-specific influence, likely due to the chromatin-state at the regions adjacent to the insertion locus, were evident. Taken together, findings here directly support the function of G4s as enhancer-like elements and as factors that enhance long-range chromatin interactions. It is possible that such interactions are also contextually dependent on the type of G4 structure, in addition to the adjacent sequence context, and further studies will be necessary to elucidate these.</p><p>To ensure that the observed effects were from intracellular G4 formation, we accounted for the following while designing the experiments. First, we introduced an array of G4s and confirmed in vivo G4 formation; the inserted sequence was from the hTERT promoter region with multiple arrayed G4s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Monsen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palumbo et al., 2009</xref>). Second, we selected an insertion locus that was otherwise devoid of intrinsic G4s in a±2.5 kb window. Third, the selected insertion locus was relatively sparse in long-range interactions. Fourth, we independently inserted a sequence of identical length (and similar GC%) which does not form G4s at the same locus (G4-mutated control). All results were compared to the G4-mutated insertion. Although the introduced mutations for the control sequences were minimal, the impacts of such mutations on the binding of specific transcription factors associated with the sequence, particularly SP1, reported to bind G4s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raiber et al., 2012</xref>), cannot be ruled out.</p><p>Existing literature shows promoter G4s are involved in regulating gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huppert and Balasubramanian, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rawal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Verma et al., 2008</xref>).

Previous studies by us further show that promoter G4s regulate gene expression by recruiting histone-modifying regulatory complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hussain et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mukherjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sharma et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we aimed to study how G4s affect the expression of genes far from their location, and if this was through G4-induced modifications in long-range 3D chromatin interactions.</p><p>Multiple studies have correlated the presence of G4s with long-range associations. CTCF, an architectural protein primarily involved in TAD boundary formation, was observed to bind to G4s and G4 stabilization was noted to enhance CTCF occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tikhonova et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, G4s were noted to be enriched in TAD boundaries and associated with the formation of chromatin loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hou et al., 2019</xref>). G4s were also found to coincide with open chromatin regions and H3K27Ac and H3K4Me1 ChIP-Seq peaks, which are markers for transcriptional enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calo and Wysocka, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lyu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shlyueva et al., 2014</xref>). Most of these regions were observed to overlap with annotated enhancers and promoters regulated by such enhancers were enriched in G4s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Williams et al., 2020</xref>). A recent G4 CUT&amp;Tag study further noted G4 formation at both active promoters and active and poised enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lyu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Further, it was proposed that inter-molecular G4 formation between distant stretches of Gs may lead to DNA looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hegyi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liano et al., 2022</xref>). Consistent with this, we noted with interest promoters of the four genes (<italic>PAWR, PPP1R12A, NAV3</italic> and <italic>SLC6A15</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), activated on long-range interaction with the inserted loci, harbor potential G4-forming sequences (pG4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Further, we analyzed the long-range contact regions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, along with the whole locus, for pG4s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hon et al., 2017</xref>). Relative enrichment in pG4s was evident, particularly within the significantly enhanced contact points, at times spreading beyond the interacting region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, lower panel). Together, these support G4-induced long-range interactions.</p><p>The YY1 transcription factor was found to bind to G4s and dimerization of G4-bound YY1 led to chromatin looping interactions and consequent regulation of target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2021</xref>). A recent study also showed R-loops and possibly R-loop-associated G4 formation are enriched at CTCF binding sites, and stronger CTCF binding facilitated by G4s promotes chromatin looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wulfridge et al., 2023</xref>). In addition, it was shown that G4s assist in RNA polymerase II-associated chromatin looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yuan et al., 2023</xref>). In this context, further work will be required to understand whether and how formation of R-loops or RNA-DNA hybrid G4s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fay et al., 2017</xref>), and/or association of factors like cohesion and CTCF, at the G4-array insertion sites impact chromatin looping.</p><p>In summary, our findings here demonstrate a causal role of G4s in inducing both long-range associations and enhancer function. Findings from a G4-forming stretch inserted at two independent loci illustrate the function of G4s in 3D gene regulation. Together these shed new mechanistic light on how DNA secondary structure motifs directly control the state of 3D chromatin and thereby biological function.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

For the G4 array insertion, 275 bp long <italic>hTERT</italic> promoter region was PCR amplified from HEK 293T genomic DNA. For the insertion of the mutated G4s, a synthetic DNA template was synthesized and cloned into pUC57 vector by Genscript Biotech Corp, where 12 Gs were substituted with Ts (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for detailed sequences). Both the G4 array and the G4 mutated insertion templates were PCR amplified using longer primers where the short homology arms were introduced as overhangs of the primer for the accurate insertion at the 79 M locus via homologous recombination (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for primer sequences) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paix et al., 2017</xref>).

Once the gRNA cloned vector and the insertion donor templates were ready, they were transfected into HEK293T cells and the transfected cells were selected using puromycin, whose resistance gene was present in the pX459 vector. Then these selected cells were serially diluted to isolate clones originating from single cells. Many such clones were screened to detect cells with homozygous/heterozygous insertion of the G4 array or mutated G4 insert by performing locus-specific PCR. Either primers adjacent to the insertion site or cross primers, i.e., one primer within the insert and another from the adjacent region, were used to screen and identify insertions. While using adjacent primers, a shift in PCR product with an increase in amplicon size by 275 bp (size of the insert) indicated successful insertion (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for primer sequences).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation)</title><p>ChIP assays were performed as per the protocol previously reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mukherjee et al., 2018</xref>.

The authors introduced an array of G4s spanning 275 bp, naturally found within a very well characterized promoter region of the hTERT promoter, in an ectopic region devoid of G-quadruplex and annotated gene. As a negative control, they used a mutant version of the same sequence in which G4 folding is impaired. Due to the complexity of the region, 3 G4s on the same strand and one on the opposite strand, 12 point mutations were made simultaneously (G to T and C to A). Analysis of the 3D genome organization shows that the WT array establishes more contact within the TAD and throughout the genome than the control array. Additionally, a slight enrichment of H3K4me1 and p300, both enhancer markers, was observed locally near the insertion site. The authors tested whether the expression of genes located either nearby or away up to 5 Mb were up-regulated based on this observation. They found that four genes were up-regulated from 1.5 to 3 fold. An increased interaction between the G4 array compared to the mutant was confirmed by the 3C assay.

Specifically, validation of actual G4-formation in chromatin by ChIP-qPCR (at least) is essential to support the association between G4-formation and looping. Moreover, this study is limited to a genomic location and an individual G4-sequence used, so the findings reported cannot yet be considered to reflect a general mechanism/effect of G4-formation in chromatin looping.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is the first attempt to connect genomics datasets of G4s and HiC with gene expression. The use of Cas9 to artificially insert a G4 is also very elegant.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Lack of controls, especially to validate G4-formation after insertion with Cas9. The work is limited to a single G4-sequence and a single G4-site, which limits the generalisation of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version we validated G4 formation inside cells at the insertion site using the reported G4-selective antibody BG4. Significant BG4 binding (by ChIP-qPCR) was clear in the G4-array insert, and not in the G4-mutated insert, supporting formation of G4s by the inserted G4-array (included as Figure S4).</p><p>To directly address the second point, we inserted the G4-sequence, or the mutated control, at a second relatively isolated locus (at the 10 millionth position on Chr12, denoted as 10M site in text). First, BG4 ChIP was done to confirm intracellular G4 formation by the inserted array. BG4 ChIP-qPCR binding was significant within the inserted region, and not in the negative control region (Figure S8), consistent with the 79M locus. Together these demonstrate intracellular G4 formation by inserted sequences at two different loci.</p><p>We next checked the state of chromatin of the G4-array inserted at the 10M locus, or its negative control. Histone marks H3K4Me1, H3K27Ac, H3K27Me3, H3K9me3 and H3K4Me3 were tested at the G4-array, or the negative control locus. Relative increase in the enhancer histone marks was evident, relative to the control sequence. This was largely similar to the 79M locus, supporting an enhancer-like state. Interestingly, here we further noted presence of the H3K27me3 histone mark. The presence of the H3K27Me3 repressor histone mark, along with H3K4Me1/H3K27Ac enhancer histone marks, support a poised enhancer-like status of the inserted G4 region, as has been observed earlier in other studies. Together, although data from the two distinct G4 insertion sites support the enhancer-like state, there are contextual differences likely due to the sequence/chromatin of the sites adjacent to the inserted sequence.</p><p>Effect of the 10M G4-insertion on activation of surrounding genes (10 Mb window), and not the G4-mutant insert, was evident for most genes.

The inserted sequences may not form G4s or other factors like G4-RNA hybrids may be involved.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in response to the previous comment, we confirmed that the inserted sequence indeed forms G4s inside the cells. RNA-DNA hybrid G4s can form within R-loops with two or more tandem G-tracks (G-rich sequences) on the nascent RNA transcript as well as the non-template DNA strand (Fay et al., 2017, 28554731). A recent study has observed that R-loop-associated G4 formation can enhance chromatin looping by strengthening CTCF binding (Wulfridge et al., 2023, 37552993). As pointed out by the reviewer, the possibility of G4-RNA hybrids remains, we have mentioned this possibility for readers in the second last paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Limited Data Depth and Clarity: ChIP-qPCR offers limited scope and considerable variation in some data makes conclusions difficult.</p></disp-quote><p>We noted variation with one of the primers in a few ChIP-qPCR experiments (in Figures 2 and 3D).

For in-depth analysis of the long-range changes, they also performed Hi-C experiments and showed a genome-wide increase in interactions of the WT array versus the mutated form.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The experiments were well-executed and the results indicate a statistical difference between the G4 array inserted cell line and the mutated modified cell line.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The control non-G4 sequence contains 12 point mutations, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions. These mutations not only alter the formation of G4, but also affect at least three Sp1 binding sites that have been shown to be essential for the function of the hTERT promoter, from which the sequence is derived. The strong intermingling of G4 and Sp1 binding sites makes it impossible to determine whether all the observations made are dependent on G4 or Sp1 binding. As a control, the authors used Locked Nucleic Acid probes to prevent the formation of G4. As for mutations, these probes also interfere with two Sp1 binding sites. Therefore, using this alternative method has the same drawback as point mutations. This major issue should be discussed in the paper. It is also possible that other unidentified transcription factor binding sites are affected in the presented point mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>Since the sequence we used to test the effects of G4 structure formation is highly G-rich, we had to introduce at least 12 mutations to be sure that a stable G4 structure would not form in the mutated control sequence. Sp1 has been reported to bind to G4 structures (Raiber et al., 2012). Therefore, Sp1 binding is likely to be associated with the G4-dependent enhancer functions observed here. We also appreciate that apart from Sp1, other unidentified transcription factor binding sites might be affected by the mutations we introduced. We have discussed these possibilities in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion section in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Whilst the data presented is promising and partially supports the authors' conclusion, this reviewer feels that some key controls are missing to fully support the narrative used. Below are my main concerns:</p><p>(1) The main thing missing in the current manuscript is to validate the actual formation of G4 in chromatin context for the repeat inserted by CRISPR-Cas. Whilst I appreciate this will form promptly a G4 in vitro, to fully support the conclusions proposed the authors would need to demonstrate actual G4-formation in cells after insertion. This could be done by ChIP-qPCR using the G4-selective antibody BG4 for example. This is an essential piece of evidence to be added to link with confidence G4-formation to chromatin looping.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the concern regarding whether the inserted G4 sequence forms G4s in cells, as suggested, we used the G4-selective antibody BG4. PCR primers in the study were designed keeping multiple points in mind: Primers should not bind to any site of G/C alteration in the mutated control insert; either the forward/reverse primer is from the adjacent region for specificity; covers adjacent regions for studying any effects on chromatin; and, PCRs optimized keeping in mind the repeats within the inserted sequence. Given these, primer pairs R1-R4 were chosen for further work following optimizations (Figure 2, top panel). For BG4 ChIP-qPCR we used primer pairs R2, which covered &gt;100 bases of the inserted G4-array, or the G4-mutated control. Significant BG4 binding was clear in the G4-array insert, and not in the G4-mutated insert, demonstrating formation of G4s by the inserted G4-array (Figure S4).</p><p>In response to comment #3 below, we inserted the G4-forming sequence (or its mutated control) at a second locus. This insertion was near the 10 millionth position of chromosome 12 (10M insertion locus in text). Here also, BG4 binding was significant within the G4-array inserted region, and not in the negative control region (Figure S8). Together these demonstrate G4 formation by the inserted sequence at two different loci.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I found the LNA experiment very elegant. However, what would be the effect of LNA treatment on the control sequence that does not form G4s? This control is essential to disentangle the effect of LNA pairing to the sequence itself vs disrupting the G4-structure.</p></disp-quote><p>As per the reviewer’s suggestion, we performed a control experiment where we treated the G4-mutated insert (control) cells with the G4-disrupting LNA probes. The changes in the expression of the surrounding genes in this case were not significant, indicating that the effects observed in the G4-array insert cells were possibly due to disruption of the inserted G4 structures. This data is presented in Figure S5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors describe their work and present its conclusion as if this were a genome-wide study, whilst the work is focused on a specific genomic location, and the looping, along with the effect on histone acetylation and gene expression, is limited to this. The authors cannot conclude, therefore, that this is a generic effect and the discussion should be more focused on the specific G4s used and the genomic location investigated. Ideally, insertion of a different G4-forming sequence or of the same in a different genomic location is recommended to really claim a generic effect.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this we inserted the G4-array sequence, or the G4-mutated control sequence, at another relatively isolated locus – at the 10 millionth position of chromosome 12 – denoted as 10M. Using BG4 ChIP-qPCR intracellular G4 formation was confirmed. We observed that the enhancer-like features in terms of enhancer histone marks and increase in the expression of surrounding genes were largely reproduced at the 10M locus on G4 insertion (Figure 7). These results are added as the final section under Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The study proposes a mechanism where G4s directly influence 3D chromatin organization, facilitating communication between regulatory elements and genes.</p><p>While the present manuscript presents an interesting hypothesis, it would benefit from enhanced novelty and more robust data. The study complements existing G4 research (e.g., PMID: 31177910). While the conclusions hold biological relevance, they largely reiterate established knowledge.

Also, other studies noted enrichment of potential G4-forming sequences at enhancers along with nucleosome depletion and higher transcription factor binding (Hou et al., 2021; Williams et al., 2020). These studies proposed the role of G4s in chromatin/TAD states based on analysis of potential G4-forming sequences using correlative bioinformatics analyses. Here we sought to directly test causality. Insertion of G4 sequence, and formation of intracellular G4s in an isolated, G4-depleted region resulted in altered characteristics of chromatin, and not in the negative control insertion that does not form G4s. These, in contrast to earlier studies, directly demonstrates the causal role of G4s as functional elements that impact local and distant chromatin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>(1) Lack of G4 Structure Confirmation: Implement G4-specific antibodies or fluorescent probes to verify G4 structures inside the cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Detailed response given above.

However, upon reading the publications, I found that these observations were made in vitro. I may have missed something, but there are now several mappings of folded-G4 in human cells based on different approaches. It would be beneficial to investigate whether the hTERT promoter is a site of G-quadruplex formation in vivo. If confirmed, a similar analysis should be conducted on the 275 bp region inserted into the ectopic region to determine if it also has the ability to form a structured G4.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed BG4 ChIP to confirm in vivo G4 formation by the inserted G4-array as suggested (Figures S4, S8). Detail response given above. Briefly, in the revised version we validated G4 formation inside cells at the insertion site using the reported G4-selective antibody BG4.

The authors suggest that placing it in an ectopic position creates an enhancer-like region, based on the observation of increased levels of H3K27Ac and H3K4me1 on the WT array. To provide a control that it is not a promoter, it would be useful to also analyze a specific mark of promoter activity, such as H3K4me3.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by reviewer, we also analysed the H3K4Me3 promoter activation mark at both the 79M and 10M (introduced in the revised manuscript, Figure 7) insertion loci.

To investigate this further, it would be worthwhile to examine whether the promoter regions of activated genes (PAWR, PPP1R12A, NAV3, and SLC6A15) contain potentially forming G-quadruplexes (pG4). Additionally, sites that establish more contact with the G4 array described in Figure 6F could be analyzed for enrichment in pG4.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We found promoters of the four genes (PAWR, PPP1R12A, NAV3, and SLC6A15) harbour potential G4-forming sequences (pG4s). Also as suggested, we analysed the contact regions in Fig 6F, along with the whole locus, for pG4s. Relative enrichment in pG4 was seen, particularly within the significantly enhanced interacting regions, which at times spreads beyond the interacting regions also. This is shown in the lower panel of Figure 6F in the revised version.
