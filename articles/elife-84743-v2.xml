transitions of cooperation in certain cases. Currently, the mechanism and significance of mediating the interaction between different cell types during the division of labor, remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism and ecological function of a policing system for optimizing the division of labor in <italic>Bacillus velezensis</italic> SQR9. During biofilm formation, cells differentiated into the extracellular matrix (ECM)-producers and cheater-like nonproducers. ECM-producers were also active in the biosynthesis of genomic island-governed toxic bacillunoic acids (BAs) and self-resistance; while the nonproducers were sensitive to this antibiotic and could be partially eliminated. Spo0A was identified to be the co-regulator for triggering both ECM production and BAs synthesis/immunity. Besides its well-known regulation of ECM secretion, Spo0A activates acetyl-CoA carboxylase to produce malonyl-CoA, which is essential for BAs biosynthesis, thereby stimulating BAs production and self-immunity. Finally, the policing system not only excluded ECM-nonproducing cheater-like individuals but also improved the production of other public goods such as protease and siderophore, consequently, enhancing the population stability and ecological fitness under stress conditions and in the rhizosphere. This study provides insights into our understanding of the maintenance and evolution of microbial cooperation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Bacillus velezensis</italic></kwd><kwd>population fitness</kwd><kwd>policing system</kwd><kwd>cheater-like nonproducers</kwd><kwd>public goods</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31870096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Ruifu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>42090064</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Qirong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31972512</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Zhihui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32072665</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Nan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32072675</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xun</surname><given-names>Weibing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFD1901300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Nan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KYZZ2022003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Ruifu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFD1900300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xun</surname><given-names>Weibing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A policing system in <italic>Bacillus velezensis</italic> coordinated extracellular matrix production and autotoxin synthesis/self-immunity to penalize cheater-like nonproducers in biofilm community, which enhances the population stability and ecological fitness under stress conditions and in the rhizosphere.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cooperative interactions are not restricted to complex, higher organisms, but are also prevalent among microbial communities in many contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kehe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rakoff-Nahoum et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wenseleers and Ratnieks, 2006</xref>). Both natural selection and game theory predict that cooperative systems are vulnerable to non-cooperative cheaters that exploit the benefit, such as public goods including extracellular enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), siderophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Griffin et al., 2004</xref>), or biofilm matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dragoš and Kovács, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vlamakis et al., 2013</xref>) since these selfish individuals enjoy the common resources without paying their cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hardin, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">West et al., 2006</xref>). Intriguingly, cooperation principally survives cheating during evolutionary history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Travisano and Velicer, 2004</xref>), and a couple of mechanisms have been proposed to play significant roles in maintaining cooperation by preventing cheater invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Özkaya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Travisano and Velicer, 2004</xref>). These strategies mainly include kin selection/discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Özkaya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diggle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McNally et al., 2017</xref>), facultative cooperation regulated by a quorum-sensing (QS) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2016</xref>), or nutrient fitness cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sexton and Schuster, 2017</xref>), coupling production of public and private goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dandekar et al., 2012</xref>), punishment of cheating individuals by cooperator-produced antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">García-Contreras et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), partial privatization of public goods under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otto et al., 2020</xref>), and spatial structuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Gestel et al., 2014</xref>). In general, the emergence of multiple sanction mechanisms is a consequence of natural selection, which suppresses social cheaters and enhances the altruistic behavior, thereby maintaining microbial community stability and improving their adaptation in different niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Özkaya et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In certain cases, microbial cooperation involves the division of labor, where subpopulations of cells are specialized to perform different tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dragoš et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Strassmann and Queller, 2011</xref>). Division of labor requires three basic conditions: individuals exhibit different tasks (phenotypic variation); some individuals carry out cooperative tasks that benefit other individuals (cooperation); all individuals gain an inclusive fitness benefit from the interaction (adaptation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dragoš et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">West and Cooper, 2016</xref>). For instance, <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> colony will phenotypically differentiate into surfactin-producing and matrix-producing cells during sliding motility, where the surfactin reduces the friction between cells and their substrate, while the matrix assembles into van Gogh bundles that drive the migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jordi et al., 2015</xref>). Another typical case is in early-stage biofilms, an extracellular matrix (ECM)-the enclosed multicellular community that sustains bacterial survival in diverse natural environments; it is known that <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells can differentiate into motile cells and matrix-producing cells during biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vlamakis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shank and Kolter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">López and Kolter, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">López et al., 2009c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">López et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Gestel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vlamakis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kearns, 2008</xref>). The advantage of the division of labor is to efficiently integrate distinct cellular activities, thereby endowing a community with higher fitness than undifferentiated clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">West and Cooper, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, efficient division of labor relies on elaborate coordination of cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cremer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">López et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lord et al., 2019</xref>). In relative to the subpopulation producing a certain public good (e.g. cells producing ECM during biofilm formation), the nonproducing cells that can also enjoy this common good, actually become the ‘cheater-like’ individuals to some extent (although they may provide other contributions to the community) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Claessen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">West and Cooper, 2016</xref>). Therefore, regulating the proportion of each cell type and alignment of interests, is important for maintaining the stability and fitness of the division of labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">West and Cooper, 2016</xref>), while an unbalanced cell differentiation will reduce the population productivity and even cause a collapse of the division of labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dragoš et al., 2018a</xref>). Despite the knowledge of pathways controlling cell differentiation in microbes, little is known about how the different cell types interact with each other and the fitness consequences of their interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Gestel et al., 2015</xref>). Although a few studies have investigated the overlap between public goods production and cell cannibalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">González-Pastor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">López et al., 2009c</xref>), as well as matrix privatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otto et al., 2020</xref>) during cell differentiation, the molecular mechanism involved in coordinating the cheater-like individuals in the division of labor, as well as the ecological significance of the policing system in regulating population stability and fitness, remain unclear. Accordingly, lacking these knowledge limits our understanding of cooperation and altruism within microbial social communities.</p><p><italic>Bacillus velezensis</italic> SQR9 (formerly <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> SQR9) is a well-studied beneficial rhizobacterium that forms robust and highly structured biofilms on the air-liquid interface and plant roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2011</xref>). Strain SQR9 harbors a novel genomic island 3 (GI3) consisting of four operons, where the second, third, and fourth operons are responsible for the production of the novel branched-chain fatty acids, BAs, while the first operon encodes an ABC transporter to export toxic BAs for self-immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Production of toxic BAs was proved to occur in the subfraction of cells with the self-immunity ability induced by BAs during biofilm formation, where the nonproducing siblings will be lysed by BAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Based on the manifestation that the BA-mediated cannibalism enhanced the biofilm formation of strain SQR9, we hypothesized the ECM and BAs synthesis can be co-regulated to restrain the cheater-like individuals that don’t produce ECM, thereby optimizing the division of labor and altruistic behavior. Using a combination of single-cell tracking techniques, molecular approaches, and ecological evaluation, we demonstrated that ECM and BAs production are coordinated in the same subpopulation by the same regulator during biofilm formation, which enforces punishment of the cheater-like nonproducers to maintain community stabilization; also this genomic island-governed policing system is significant to promote community fitness in various conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Coordinated production of ECM and autotoxin BAs punishes cheater-like nonproducers in the <italic>B. velezensis</italic> SQR9 community</title><p><italic>Bacillus</italic> cells in early-stage biofilms are known to contain specialized groups as motile cells and matrix-producing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kearns, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Gestel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vlamakis et al., 2008</xref>). We hypothesized that secretion of cannibal toxin BAs can eliminate ECM nonproducers in <italic>B. velezensis</italic> SQR9 biofilm, and try to determine the subpopulation for ECM (public goods) production and BAs (autotoxin) biosynthesis/BAs-induced self-immunity, as well as their interactions. We fused promoters for genes related to extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) and TasA fibers (two dominant ECM components in <italic>Bacillus</italic> biofilm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vlamakis et al., 2013</xref>) biosynthesis with <italic>mCherry</italic>, while the promoters for genes related to the autotoxin BAs biosynthesis and the self-immunity with <italic>gfp</italic>, obtained the transcriptional reporter <italic>P<sub>eps</sub>-mCherry</italic>, <italic>P<sub>tapA</sub>-mCherry</italic>, <italic>P<sub>bnaF</sub>-gfp</italic>, and <italic>P<sub>bnaAB</sub>-gfp</italic>, respectively. Their expression patterns were monitored using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) during the biofilm community formation.

Therefore, we determined the production of extracellular proteases and siderophore among the three strains, revealing that these public goods were also accumulated more in the wild-type than in these two mutants’ communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Unlike the diverse strategies for preventing obligate cheaters in cooperative systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Özkaya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith and Schuster, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Travisano and Velicer, 2004</xref>), division of labor requires an efficiency benefit and alignment of interests covering different specialized individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">West and Cooper, 2016</xref>). For instance, compared with cells that produce a certain kind of public goods (e.g. ECM or extracellular hydrolases), the subpopulations that don’t perform these tasks (but still share these benefits) become cheater-like individuals, and their proportion needs to be controlled for maintaining community stability and fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">West and Cooper, 2016</xref>). In the present study, we demonstrated that during biofilm formation, the beneficial rhizobacterium <italic>B. velezensis</italic> SQR9 engages a policing system that coordinately actives ECM production and autotoxin synthesis/immunity, to punish the cheater-like subpopulation silencing in public goods secretion and restrain their proportion in the community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Importantly, the optimized division of labor not only facilitates ECM accumulation but also contributes to elevated production of other public goods including proteases and siderophore, thereby improving the community fitness under different stressful conditions and in plant rhizosphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which could be defined as an effective strategy for enhancing cooperation and altruism. The coordination policing system suppresses subpopulation that stays in a fast-growing, motility phase (Spo0A-OFF state), to promote the population to a stationary, resource-mining phase (Spo0A-ON state) when the environment required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Our finding coincides with the phenomenon that Spo0A-dependent toxin killing of Spo0A-OFF cells in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> enhances biofilm formation and delays sporulation progress, which can be attributed to both eliminating of matrix-nonproducers and releasing of available nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">González-Pastor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">López et al., 2009c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2021</xref>).

Comparatively, the Spo0A-OFF subpopulation is cheat-like individuals that are silenced in public goods secretion, which are also disabled in malonyl-CoA production and BAs biosynthesis/self-immunity.

During biofilm formation and sporulation by <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, the global regulator Spo0A simultaneously induces the production of matrix and cannibalism toxins (Skf and Sdp); since genes responsible for toxin synthesis and self-immunity are simultaneously expressed, the matrix producers can be resistant to these toxins while the sensitive nonproducers will be selectively penalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ellermeier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">González-Pastor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">López et al., 2009c</xref>). In the comparison of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>B. velezensis</italic> SQR9, the similarity is that the global regulator Spo0A controls the synthesis of the ECM and the cannibalism toxin; the difference lies in the type of cannibalism toxin and its synthesis/regulation pathway. Specifically, the Spo0A-governed policing system in <italic>B. velezensis</italic> SQR9 is extremely unique: (i) The toxic BAs for punishment are novel antimicrobial fatty acids that firstly identified in strain SQR9, which mediate cannibalism and strongly inhibit the growth of closely related <italic>Bacillus</italic> strains; also its synthesis is encoded by a horizontal gene transfer (HGT)-acquired genomic island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). (ii) Spo0A doesn’t mediate the BAs production/self-immunity in a direct transcriptional regulation way, but activates AccDA for accumulating the precursor for BAs biosynthesis (a post-transcriptional manner; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The accumulated BA precursor may induce the expression of BA synthetase genes; additionally, the self-resistance is mainly induced by intracellular BAs through a two-component system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, the foreign genomic island and the indigenous Spo0A regulation pathways, constitute an ingenious coordination system for punishing cheater-like nonproducers and enhancing clonemate cooperation.</p><p>Relevant to how such a complex system could evolve, a possible scenario is a gradual evolution through transitional states. Perhaps homogeneous biofilm formation was the ancestral state, where all cells in the community are matrix producers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khare and Shaulsky, 2006</xref>). Thereafter, heterogeneous biofilm raised as cells specialize in motile or matrix-producing subpopulations; it would be favored if the benefit of quickly responding to drop-in nutrients outweighed the cost of having cheater-like nonproducers that reduced the ability to form a biofilm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamilton, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smits et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">López et al., 2009c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">West and Cooper, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the heterogeneous biofilm strategy provides the evolutionary context of sanctioning behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">López et al., 2009c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">West and Cooper, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spratt and Lane, 2022</xref>).

Considering that bacterial biofilm is a major lifestyle in the natural environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004</xref>), the dual ecological benefits probably explain why this large cluster was integrated into the genome of strain SQR9; also this case can provide inspiration for discovering novel molecular regulatory mechanisms and understanding microbial evolution events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strassmann et al., 2000</xref>). Alternatively, this sanction system can work in concert with a privatization strategy to collectively enhance cooperation during biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otto et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the present study highlights the beneficial rhizobacterium <italic>B. velezensis</italic> SQR9 engages a policing system that coordinately actives ECM production and autotoxin synthesis/immunity, to penalize the cheater-like subpopulation silencing in public goods secretion, thereby enhancing the division of labor and community fitness.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Aleksandra Walczak as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Bin Ni (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Addressing the following list of major suggestions is essential for substantiating the manuscript's conclusions. (Note: The reviewing editor has lightly edited the reviewers' statements for clarity.)</p><p>1) The microscopy needs additional quantitative analysis.</p><p>Item #(1) All of the microscopy needs total cell count numbers.</p><p>Item #(2) Although Figure 1 depicts the co-expression pattern of ECM production (eps and tapA) and policing system (bnaF and bnaA) as an individual-level property, it lacks statistical analysis and a spatial correlation test. The authors should provide flow-cytometry data that quantifies the overlap between different subpopulations; with this data, one could understand the cell differentiation pattern from a population perspective.</p><p>Item #(3) For the data presented in Figure 1, the authors need a more concrete discussion of methods and could expand upon their existing quantification to improve the understanding of the co-expression of EPS and BA genes. How were cells segmented? What were the thresholds for whether a cell emitted fluorescence, and how was such a threshold chosen? The authors should perform a more sophisticated colocalization/correlation analysis. e.g., if the cells have a high Peps signal, does that correlate with a high PbnaF signal?</p><p>Item #(4) In the CLSM photographs (figure supplement 6 and lines 195 – 199), only one frame and no population sizes were provided. Additional frames and population counts are needed.</p><p>2) The gfp/mCherry fusions need transcriptional validation. For example, use qPCR to ascertain the relationship between the transcription of the reporter genes and the genes (eps, tapA, etc.) to which they correspond.</p><p>3) Figure 2 is not definitive.</p><p>#(1) The PI staining microscopy (as shown in Figure 2 and the supplemental videos) does not demonstrate that only non-expressing cells perish. Also, the presented data shows many non-labeled cells without PI; why do some nearby non-gfp-expressing cells remain alive? Consider using a third reporter that is a marker for all living cells (constitutive expression).</p><p>Question #(2) How do the authors determine whether the PI-stained cells were producers or cheaters before they died based on the data shown in Figure 2? If a Peps-GFP cell dies, I presume it loses its GFP signal? Do the authors identify the cell types before death? Furthermore, in the figure legend, the authors should define what they mean by &quot;near&quot; an EPS- producing cell. Is this quantitatively defined?</p><p>Item #(3) Figure 2 shows no visual evidence that the distance to producer cells matters. Also, the counts for &quot;Statistics&quot; in Figure 2 lack total population sizes, error bars, and statistical analysis; these data are needed to determine whether &quot;selectively punish&quot; is an accurate conclusion or whether other cellular factors could also explain the PI-stained cells.</p><p>3) The authors need to standardize their measurements of gene expression. Currently, the authors determine gene expression in different ways. For example, in Figure 3D, the ratio between fluorescence intensity and cell density (RFU/OD600) is used to show the transcription of target genes. While in Figure 4F, only RFU is shown but OD600 is ignored. Using only the fluorescence data may not reflect the objective gene expression pattern if the xylose concentrations can affect the growth of wild-type SQR9 or the constructed strains.</p><p>4) The spo0A complementation is a partial rescue, most visible in cells with the eps promoter driving gfp expression. The authors need to address this discrepancy and discuss its implications.</p><p>5) The data in Figure 4E should be quantified, as similar data are in other figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Figure 2 shows no visual evidence that the distance to producer cells matters.

It would be helpful for the authors to include how the pathways in this Bacillus strain compare to the known ones in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. As written, it seems that accDA might be a direct regulator, but it's not clear from the results shown. (I took away that it's an upstream regulator, but is it indirect?)</p><p>– For all photography, explicitly state that the image represents ## experiments (in the legend).</p><p>– The supplemental videos do not show more than the still images and are not needed for this manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Although the manuscript is concise and brings a detailed study of social interactions within microbial populations, I nevertheless have a few major concerns. Some of my main concerns would require additional experiments and a re-write of some part of the manuscript.</p><p>1) The co-expression pattern of ECM production (eps and tapA) and policing system (bnaF and bnaA) was shown in Figure 1 in an individual-level property, but lacks statistical analysis or spatial correlation test. I suggest authors provide a flow-cytometry data that quantifies the overlap between different subpopulations, thus we can understand the cell differentiation pattern in a population perspective.</p><p>2) The gfp/mCherry fusions need a transcriptional validation, such as the correspondence between the transcription of the reporter genes and corresponding genes (eps, tapA, etc.) determined by qPCR.</p><p>3) Determination of gene expression are performed in different ways. For example, in Figure 3D, the ratio between fluorescence intensity and cell density (RFU/OD600) is used to show the transcription of target genes. While in Figure 4F, only RFU is shown but OD600 is ignored; if the xylose concentrations can affect the growth of wild-type SQR9 or the constructed strains, using only the fluorescence data may not reflect the objective gene expression pattern.</p><p>4) According to the working model raised by the authors, it seems that expression of ECM-related genes (eps and tapA) and BAs-synthesis genes (bnaF) are not directly relevant, since Spo0A enhances ECM production in a transcriptional-regulation pattern but activates BAs biosynthesis in a post-transcriptional manner (by promoting the accumulation of the precursor). Interestingly, the CLSM graph shows that expression of these two sorts of genes is also likely to be overlapped. Authors should discuss or comment on this phenomenon in the manuscript.</p><p>5) Line 111-114, one additional sentence is needed here for introducing why the autotoxin system is involved in this scene.</p><p>6) Line 261, the reference citation format is incorrect.</p><p>The two references in Table S1 (Chen et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2017) are missing in the Reference List.</p><p>7) Figures need to be standardized, such as font size and initial capitalization in Figure 5D.</p><p>8) There are a couple of grammatical and semantic errors in the manuscript. Please carefully go through the manuscript to correct them.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

We have performed additional experiments and analyses to address all these comments. Please see the specific responses as follows.</p><p>Item #(1) The statistical analyses in the original Figure 1 were removed. A more accurate and objective method, flow cytometry, was used to analyze the fluorescence expression patterns of different double-labeled strains (revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1). The total cell number observed for each strain was 20,000, and this information is included in the caption of revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><p>The statistical analyses in the original Figure 2 were also removed. We re-observed cells in biofilms for 3 hours (revised Figure 2-video 1-4), the source and distribution of newly emerged dead cells during this period was counted and analyzed in detail (revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1). During the 3 hours, pictures covering a 6 minutes stage that show the elimination process of several non-<italic>gfp</italic> expressing cells, are selected for display in revised Figure 2; the total number of cells in this figure is 198 for strain SQR9-<italic>P<sub>eps</sub></italic>-<italic>gfp</italic>, 71 for strain SQR9-<italic>P<sub>tasA</sub></italic>-<italic>gfp</italic>, 88 for strain SQR9-<italic>P<sub>bnaF</sub></italic>-<italic>gfp</italic>, and 162 for strain SQR9-<italic>P<sub>bnaAB</sub></italic>-<italic>gfp</italic>, and this information is included in the caption.</p><p>Item #(2) We further monitored the expression pattern of mCherry and GFP signals in each single double-labeled cell by flow cytometry. The results revealed that both fluorescence was generally located in the same subpopulation in the community (revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1), which confirmed the positive correlation between the two reporters within the picked cells from a population perspective. Thus, ECM production (<italic>eps</italic> and <italic>tapA</italic>) and the policing system (<italic>bnaF</italic> and <italic>bnaA</italic>) are co-expressed.</p><p>Item #(3) The statistical analysis in original Figure 1 was replaced by flow cytometry data that can accurately access the fluorescence emitted by each cell of double-labeled strains and determine their distribution pattern (revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Flow cytometry showed that in all double-labeled strains, mCherry fluorescence intensity generally correlated with GFP fluorescence intensity. For example, in strain <italic>P<sub>eps</sub></italic>-<italic>mCherry P<sub>bnaF</sub></italic>-<italic>gfp</italic>, the <italic>P<sub>eps</sub></italic> signal was correlated with the <italic>P<sub>bnaF</sub></italic> signal to a certain extent, highlighting the co-expression of EPS and BA synthesis genes in the same subpopulation (revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1). With regards to the experimental method of flow cytometry, (1) mild sonication of the biofilms was performed to segment cells for flow cytometry analysis; (2) the wild-type strain expressing no fluorescence protein was used as a negative control; (3) the negative control establishes the background fluorescence of the experimental samples and is used to set the threshold by adjusting baseline PMT (photomultiplier tube) voltages of the instrument.</p><p>For CLSM observation, the wild-type strain without fluorescent proteins was used as a negative control to estimate the fluorescence threshold. Besides, early-stage biofilms with monolayer cells were selected for observation.</p><p>Item #(4) Additional frames have been provided (revised Figure 4—figure supplement 5A) and the fluorescence expression patterns of 20,000 cells has been analyzed by flow cytometry (revised Figure 4—figure supplement 5B). In detail, the fluorescent signals of both mCherry and GFP were detected to be in the same subpopulation of the double-labeled strain <italic>P<sub>accDA</sub>-mCherry P<sub>bnaAB</sub>-gfp</italic> (revised Figure 4—figure supplement 5B). Thus, the activation of <italic>accDA</italic> and <italic>bnaAB</italic> was located in the same subpopulation cells. Accordingly, the “Statistics” of the original figure was replaced by the flow cytometry analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The gfp/mCherry fusions need transcriptional validation.

We have addressed all these comments carefully. Please see the specific responses as follows.</p><p>Item #(1) According to the reviewer's suggestion, an observation covering more complete biofilm forming process, as well as a more convinced data statistics, should be performed. We then re-conducted microscope observation lasting for 3 h during biofilm formation, and assess the source and location of dead cells for statistical analysis. The results showed that all dead cells were originated from the subpopulation that didn't express the <italic>gfp</italic> (the nonproducers), and the number of dead cells adjacent to the producers was significantly higher than that closed to the non-producers (please see the pictures in Figure 2 and revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><p>In addition, regarding the survival of some non-<italic>gfp</italic>-expressing cells near the producers, based on several relevant literatures<sup>1-3</sup> and the observation in the present study, we speculate that the coordination system for optimizing the division of labor is relatively temperate, thus only a part of the nonproducers (relative sensitive cells or facing higher concentrations of the toxin) are eliminated. We think this scene is a balance between restraining the cheater-like subpopulation and retaining the advantages of cell differentiation.</p><p>Item #(2) The SQR9-<italic>P<sub>eps</sub></italic>-<italic>gfp</italic> cells emitting GFP signal are supposed to be producers because their EPS synthesis gene is activated; conversely, cells that don’t emit GFP signal are nonproducing cheaters. Based on this criterion, we determined the source of dead cells in the newly captured time-lapse images. The results showed that all dead cells were from non-<italic>gfp</italic> expressing cells (revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1), while the active <italic>P<sub>eps</sub></italic>-<italic>gfp</italic> cells kept alive and didn’t lose their GFP signal during the cannibalism progress. Additionally, the distribution of dead cells in the newly captured time-lapse images were also analyzed. We define &quot;near&quot; an EPS- producing cell as cells that were in contact with an EPS-producing cell, also this information has been included in the figure legend. The number of dead cells adjacent to producers was significantly higher than that of non-adjacent cells (revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Item #(3) We re-observed the cell differentiation and live-dead distribution in early-stage biofilms for 3 hours (revised Figure 2-video 1-4). The progress of individual nonproducers from alive to initial death and even disappearance in a biofilm population is shown in Figure 2 of the revised manuscript; also the source (from <italic>gfp</italic>-expressing or non-expressing cells) and distribution (near GFP-emitting cells or silent cells) of the dead cells in the newly captured time-lapse images were statistically analyzed. The results showed that all dead cells were from non-<italic>gfp</italic> expressing cells, and the number of dead cells adjacent to producers (in contact with a <italic>gfp</italic> expressing cell) was significantly higher than that of non-adjacent cells (revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1). We think the re-collected data can demonstrate the &quot;selectively punish&quot; in the biofilm population of strain SQR9. Also, total population sizes, error bars, and statistical analysis have been provided in revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors need to standardize their measurements of gene expression. Currently, the authors determine gene expression in different ways. For example, in Figure 3D, the ratio between fluorescence intensity and cell density (RFU/OD600) is used to show the transcription of target genes. While in Figure 4F, only RFU is shown but OD600 is ignored.

It would be helpful for the authors to include how the pathways in this Bacillus strain compare to the known ones in B. subtilis. As written, it seems that accDA might be a direct regulator, but it's not clear from the results shown. (I took away that it's an upstream regulator, but is it indirect?)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, as a global regulator, Spo0A simultaneously induces the production of extracellular matrix and toxic peptides (Skf and Sdp, sporulation killing factor and sporulation delaying protein, respectively)<sup>7</sup>. Thus, in the comparison of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>B. velezensis</italic> SQR9, the similarity is that the global regulator Spo0A controls the synthesis of extracellular matrix and the cannibalism toxin. The difference lies in the type of cannibalism toxin and its synthesis/regulation pathway (Line 278~281 of the revised Discussion). For <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, Spo0A directly activate the peptide Skf synthesis genes <italic>skfABH</italic>. The first gene, <italic>skfA</italic>, encodes the 56-amino acid long pro-antimicrobial peptide, which is post-translationally modified by SkfB, a radical S-adenosyl-methionine enzyme<sup>8,9</sup>. The resulting pre-SkfA is further processed to its active state by the putative thioredoxin oxidoreductase SkfH<sup>10</sup>. In contrast to the directly controlling of <italic>skf</italic> expression, Spo0A only plays an indirect role for regulating the <italic>sdp</italic> locus by repressing the global regulator AbrB that inhibits <italic>sdp</italic> expression<sup>11</sup>. Upon transcription of the <italic>sdpABC</italic> operon, the toxic peptide SdpC is post-translationally modified by SdpAB to its active 63-amino acids-long form.</p><p>For <italic>B. velezensis</italic> SQR9, the global regulator Spo0A activates acetyl-coA carboxylase AccDA through a direct manner, and this regulation is also conserved in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. AccDA catalyzes the production of malonyl-CoA, which is essential for the synthesis of BAs precursors. As a result, AccDA is not a direct regulator for BAs synthesis, but works as a critical enzyme that controls the synthesis of BAs precursors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For all photography, explicitly state that the image represents ## experiments (in the legend).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion and sorry for unclearness.

We further monitored the expression pattern of mCherry and GFP signals in each single double-labeled cell by flow cytometry. The results revealed that both fluorescence was generally located in the same subpopulation in the community (revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1), which confirmed the positive correlation between the two reporters within the picked cells from a population perspective. Thus, ECM production (<italic>eps</italic> and <italic>tapA</italic>) and the policing system (<italic>bnaF</italic> and <italic>bnaA</italic>) are co-expressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The gfp/mCherry fusions need a transcriptional validation, such as the correspondence between the transcription of the reporter genes and corresponding genes (eps, tapA, etc.) determined by qPCR.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion.

Interestingly, the CLSM graph shows that expression of these two sorts of genes is also likely to be overlapped.

According to the manner that Spo0A controls ECM and BA synthesis, that expression of ECM-related genes (<italic>eps</italic> and <italic>tapA</italic>) and BAs-synthesis genes (<italic>bnaF</italic>) may not be directly relevant. Interestingly, both CLSM and flow cytometry data show that the expression of these two sorts of genes is also likely to be overlapped. It's common for a substrate or precursor to induce functional enzyme expression<sup>12</sup>, thus we speculated that the accumulated BA precursor (catalyzed by AccDA under the activation of Spo0A) may induce expression of BA synthetase genes, thus exhibiting such expression pattern.

The statistical analysis in original Figure 1 was replaced by flow cytometry data that can accurately access the fluorescence emitted by each cell of double-labeled strains and determine their distribution patterns (revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Flow cytometry showed that in all double-labeled strains, mCherry fluorescence intensity generally correlated with GFP fluorescence intensity. For example, in strain <italic>P<sub>eps</sub></italic>-<italic>mCherry P<sub>bnaF</sub></italic>-<italic>gfp</italic>, the <italic>P<sub>eps</sub></italic> signal was correlated with the <italic>P<sub>bnaF</sub></italic> signal to a certain extent, highlighting the co-expression of EPS and BA synthesis genes in the same subpopulation (revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1). With regards to the experimental method of flow cytometry, (1) mild sonication of the biofilms was performed to segment cells for flow cytometry analysis; (2) the wild-type strain expressing no fluorescence protein was used as a negative control; (3) the negative control establishes the background fluorescence of the experimental samples and is used to set the threshold by adjusting baseline PMT (photomultiplier tube) voltages of the instrument.</p><p>For CLSM observation, the wild-type strain without fluorescent proteins was used as a negative control to estimate the fluorescence threshold.

Is this quantitatively defined?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. The SQR9-<italic>P<sub>eps</sub></italic>-<italic>gfp</italic> cells emitting GFP signal are supposed to be producers because their EPS synthesis gene is activated; conversely, cells that don’t emit GFP signal are nonproducing cheaters. Based on this criterion, we determined the source of dead cells in the newly captured time-lapse images. The results showed that all dead cells were from non-<italic>gfp</italic> expressing cells (revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1), while the active <italic>P<sub>eps</sub></italic>-<italic>gfp</italic> cells kept alive and didn’t lose their GFP signal during the cannibalism progress. Additionally, the distribution of dead cells in the newly captured time-lapse images were also analyzed. We define &quot;near&quot; an EPS- producing cell as cells that were in contact with an EPS-producing cell, also this information has been included in the figure legend. The number of dead cells adjacent to producers was significantly higher than that of non-adjacent cells (revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
