The severity of the infantile forms is classically ranked into types I–III, according to the age of onset and the maximum motor milestone achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mercuri et al., 2020</xref>). According to the conventional classification, the onset of the condition in type I is below 6 months of age and patients do not acquire the sitting position; in type II, symptoms occur within 18 months and children do not acquire autonomous ambulation. Type III is the most variable phenotype; developmental phases are comparable to that of the general population, the onset is over 18 months. Type III is subclassified into -a and -b, based on onset below or over 3 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zerres and Rudnik-Schöneborn, 1995</xref>). An additional form, with onset over 18 years of age, is usually reported as type IV: the outcome is variable and the degree of disability is usually mild. Indeed, SMA phenotype is better depicted as a continuous spectrum: for this reason, patients are preferably stratified according to a decimal classification, available for types I and II only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dubowitz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Main et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Irrespective of the phenotypic severity, SMA patients have the same genetic defect: the homozygous loss of the <italic>SMN1</italic> gene, located in 5q13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lefebvre et al., 1995</xref>). In the same region, a hypomorphic allele of <italic>SMN1</italic> is present (<italic>SMN2</italic>), which produces insufficient levels of the SMN protein. Due to an alternative splicing, <italic>SMN2</italic> is mainly transcribed into an isoform lacking exon 7 (SMN-del7) and then translated into an unstable protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mercuri et al., 2020</xref>). The number of <italic>SMN2</italic> genes is variable in patients, generally 2–4; <italic>SMN2</italic> copy number is the only consistent phenotypic modifier known to date, grossly and inversely related to disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calucho et al., 2018</xref>). The efficiency of exon 7 inclusion in <italic>SMN2</italic> mRNA can be enhanced by two relatively rare variants (rs121909192 and rs1454173648), more commonly found in the less severely affected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vezain et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The molecular pathophysiology of SMA is largely unknown: even though the SMN protein is ubiquitously expressed and has a housekeeping function in splicing regulation, the second motor neuron is the main target cell of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beattie and Kolb, 2018</xref>). However, a growing bulk of evidence supports the pathogenic role of skeletal muscle or even of the whole motor arch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bricceno et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martínez-Hernández et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ripolone et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Physiological and pathological degeneration of skeletal muscle in SMA has been intensively investigated, also focusing on the role of microRNAs (miRs or miRNAs), 20-22mers non-coding RNAs. miRs are involved in most cellular processes: these regulate gene expression through mRNA degradation or translational inhibition, mainly by binding cis-regulatory elements present in the 3′UTR of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vidigal and Ventura, 2015</xref>). Among miRs, the myomiRs play a pivotal role in regulating myogenesis and muscle degeneration (including hsa-miR-1, miR-206, miR-133a, and miR-133b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horak et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>miRs have been intensively studied also as potential biomarkers in several conditions, including SMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kariyawasam et al., 2019</xref>). This topic has become even more relevant after the development and registration of the first effective treatments, which have led to a revolutionary change of perspective for patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mercuri et al., 2020</xref>). The results of presymptomatic treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mercuri et al., 2020</xref>) are prompting the development of newborn screening programs, already started in some countries worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dangouloff et al., 2020</xref>), and are making compelling the need of prognostic biomarkers to predict the progression trajectories of patients identified at birth. Besides the <italic>SMN2</italic> products, either transcripts or protein, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tiziano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tiziano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crawford et al., 2012</xref>), few SMN-independent biomarkers have been evaluated so far, with discordant results; these include the SMA-MAP, creatinine, neurofilament dosage, and a few miRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kariyawasam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kobayashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alves et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darras et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we have first used whole miRNome sequencing of muscle specimens and cultures from SMA patients and controls to identify a specific signature of the disease and investigate on the muscle involvement in the pathogenic process.

Only reads longer than 15 bases were retained and mapped on the miR-precursor sequences annotated in the miRBase repository (v19). The Bowtie2 algorithm was used for the alignment, allowing no more than two mismatches. Quantification, TMM normalization, and significant differential expression test of the known mature miRs were performed using the edgeR package (v2.4.1). Only miRs with &gt;1 count per million (cpm) in at least one condition and in a minimum number of samples (depending on group size) were retained.

Firstly, the usual clinical classification is unsatisfactory for several reasons: (1) the treatment of patients has uncovered novel phenotypes that do not fall in any of the classical forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mercuri et al., 2020</xref>); (2) the spreading of newborn screening programs is changing the diagnosis of SMA into that of subjects with a genetic defect who might or not develop signs of the condition. Secondly, the identification of prognostic response and predictive biomarkers has become even more urgent since (1) the available outcome measures may not be sensitive enough to detect slight improvements that may still be clinically relevant and (2) the molecular effect of treatments that target CNS only cannot be evaluated peripherally.</p><p>The only genomic biomarker with clinical relevance is the determination of <italic>SMN2</italic> copy number, alongside two alternative splicing-modulating variants (rs121909192 and rs1454173648; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vezain et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2017</xref>) even though some other modifier genes have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kariyawasam et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we have exploited an unbiased approach to identify deregulated muscular miRs that could be dosed in serum samples as candidate biomarkers for SMA; at the same time, high-throughput data might provide hints on the possible pathogenic role of skeletal muscle. miRs and neurodegeneration processes are tightly related: the depletion of DICER in mice leads to a phenotype resembling SMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonçalves et al., 2018</xref>); DROSHA is downregulated in motor neurons of a SMA model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haramati et al., 2010</xref>). In this latter study, the depletion of the bouquet of expressed miRs was interpreted as due to a global deregulation of miR biogenesis. In our study, less than 10% of miRs (100/1115 annotated miRs) were significantly deregulated in patients’ muscle biopsies. This discrepancy might be related to the obvious difference in the tissues analyzed. More importantly, while we used human tissues, the motor neurons studied by Goncalves et al. were from the Taiwanese murine model of SMA that displays very low SMN levels, incomparable with those found in patients.</p><p>The involvement of skeletal muscle in SMA is unquestionable; to discern whether active or passive, we used the dual approach of muscle cell cultures and biopsies. While alterations found in vivo only could have been either primitive or secondary to the denervation/atrophy processes, the alterations found also in cultured cells point to a primary defect related to SMN deficiency.</p><p>In cell cultures, the number of differentially expressed miRs was smaller than in muscle samples. This finding could be related to the higher variability of cultured cells compared to the in vivo specimens. Interestingly, of the five miRs shared in all groups of samples (hsa-miR-1, -133a, -133b, -204-5p, -208b all upregulated), four belonged to the myomiRs: miR-1 and miR-133 family levels inversely correlate with myogenic differentiation/proliferation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kirby and McCarthy, 2013</xref>); miR-208b overexpression favors proliferation to differentiation during skeletal muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fu et al., 2020</xref>). Globally, these data suggest a primary muscular defect in SMA, determining a delay in the differentiation path from myoblasts to maturely innervated myofibers. The maturation defect of SMA skeletal muscle has been historically reported in morphological studies ahead of the identification of <italic>SMN1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fidziańska et al., 1990</xref>) and has been confirmed in more recent studies on human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martínez-Hernández et al., 2014</xref>) and murine tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bricceno et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, Houzelle et al. have very recently shown that hsa-miR-204-5p and -133b levels inversely correlate with the mitochondrial activity in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Houzelle et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that these miRs could be involved in the mitochondrial depletion observed in SMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ripolone et al., 2015</xref>). How miR modulation occurs is unknown: SMN is not directly binding miRs even though the SMN complex can assemble with these small RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Chen, 2019</xref>); conversely, in silico predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dweep et al., 2014</xref>) indicate that miR-133a, -133b, and -204-5p bind the 3′-UTR of <italic>SMN2</italic>, and thus might downregulate SMN transcript/protein levels.</p><p>In this study, we used the unbiased dataset above to identify candidate SMN-independent biomarkers. We first tested &gt;100 miRs in a small cohort of patients and controls to get the shortlist of potential biomarkers. Most miRs were not detectable in serum, indicating the integrity of the sarcolemma in SMA, differently from other neuromuscular conditions such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cacchiarelli et al., 2011</xref>). Only three miRs were overexpressed in serum of patients (miR-181a-5p, miR-324-5p, and miR-451a, the SMA-miRs), suggesting that these might be actively secreted by skeletal muscle. We can hypothesize that these miRs, which do not modulate <italic>SMN2</italic>, may exert a loco-regional effect in muscle and have, at the same time, an at-distance-effect following secretion.</p><p>Regarding the possible pathophysiological function of the SMA-miRs, to our knowledge, few data are available on the role of miR-324-5p in skeletal muscle: a single study reported the upregulation in human CD56+ myoblasts, during differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dmitriev et al., 2013</xref>), again supporting the immaturity of SMA skeletal muscle. The putative role of the secreted miR-324-5p remains unknown: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2019</xref> reported an essential function of this miR in synapsis formation. Intriguingly, we observed that even if the intrathecal administration of the specific antagomir did not improve the survival of SMNΔ7 mice, however, it induced a significant transient increase in body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>More information is available regarding the role of miR-451a: an increase was found in aged muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mercken et al., 2013</xref>), whereas the downregulation occurred during endurance training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zacharewicz et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that miR-451a levels may be inversely related to muscle mass. However, in our cohort, this miR was upregulated in patients independently of the degree of the atrophic process. Some studies have reported the simultaneous modulation of miR-451a and miR-181a-5p: in acute exercise both miRs are upregulated, whereas in aging these displayed an opposite trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zacharewicz et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that the modulation in SMA is independent of the reduced mobility of patients; interestingly, we found that the expression levels of the two miRs are related (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). miR-181a-5p displays the more intriguing profile in terms of putative involvement in SMA: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ouyang et al., 2012</xref> reported a worsening of brain injury following the increase of miR levels in a mouse model of stroke, whereas the depletion accelerated the recovery. More importantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benigni et al., 2016</xref> found an increase in miR-181a levels in CSF of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. We argue that miR-181a-5p might be a part of a retrograde signaling system from skeletal muscle, which may accelerate motor neuron loss in SMA. To test this hypothesis, we treated SMNΔ7 mice with both mimic and anti-miR-181a-5p without increasing SMN levels. miR-181a-5p modulation alone was not sufficient to significantly improve the survival of affected mice even if some changes in Kaplan–Meier curves were observed in a subset of animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>If confirmed in other studies with more therapeutic or pathogenic purposes, our data suggest that systemic therapeutic approaches increasing SMN levels also in skeletal muscle may provide additional benefits to SMA patients, and that miR-181a-5p (and/or miR324-5p) modulation might be a potential target for combinatorial treatments in addition to SMN modulation.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the miRs we have identified in the present study have not been described in SMA so far. Previously, other miRs have been found differentially expressed in animal models or in serum samples of patients (miR-9, -19a-3p, -23a-3p, -132, -146a, -183, -206, -431) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kye et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Valsecchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murdocca et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Catapano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wertz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O’Hern et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sison et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaifer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonanno et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haramati et al., 2010</xref>). Of these (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), three (miR-132, -183, -431) were not differentially expressed in muscle biopsies and had not been described at the time of study design, thus have not been tested here; among the others, three were almost undetectable in serum samples of our cohorts (miR-9, -19a-3p, -146a) and two were not differentially expressed (miR-23a-3p, -206). The discrepancy between our and previous data may be ascribed to the different technical approaches used: as in the case of <italic>SMN2</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tiziano et al., 2010</xref>), the results of absolute qPCR, differently from the relative approaches, are not affected by the expression levels of endogenous genes and calibrators. Moreover, in the case of low-copy number transcripts, the relative approaches may magnify even small differences in expression levels, which may be statistically significant but of doubtful biological meaning.</p><p>One of the most relevant results of our study is the development of the SMA-score. The global spreading of newborn screening programs for SMA has made compelling the identification of tools with good predictive power of the clinical severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dangouloff et al., 2020</xref>). So far, the stop-or-go to the treatment of presymptomatic patients is uniquely based on <italic>SMN2</italic> copy number assessment, which is roughly predictive of the clinical severity in individual patients. Even more critical are patients with three <italic>SMN2</italic> copies whose severity may range from type I to type III (1.9 to 3b in our cohort).</p><p>Two <italic>SMN2</italic> variants (rs121909192 and rs1454173648) modulate the inclusion efficiency of exon 7 into mature mRNA, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vezain et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2017</xref>), but these variants are relatively rare in patients. Additional <italic>SMN2</italic> variants have been very recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blasco-Pérez et al., 2021</xref>); however, the frequency and the functional effect of these variants have not been elucidated yet. For these reasons, more functional and dynamic molecular markers could reasonably improve the prediction of the severity. The inclusion of serum SMA-miRs, whole-blood <italic>SMN2</italic>-fl levels, and age has markedly increased the accuracy of the severity prediction of <italic>SMN2</italic> copy number alone, from about 52% to about 75%. The age effect might be related to the physiological modulation of <italic>SMN2</italic>-fl levels over time, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crawford et al., 2012</xref>). In patients with three <italic>SMN2</italic> copies, the SMA-score was significantly related to the decimal classification of patients, even if with about 30% strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The increase in the population size might improve these results.</p><p>The main drawback of our results is related to the cross-sectional nature of the present study. While we have previously shown that <italic>SMN2</italic>-fl levels are stable in untreated patients for &gt;1 year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tiziano et al., 2019</xref>), longitudinal data on SMA-miR stability are lacking. In any case, repeated samplings could not be feasible in our study since almost all patients (except for the few type I subjects) were treated with SMN-modifying compounds (such as salbutamol; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tiziano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tiziano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelozzi et al., 2008</xref>) or new experimental treatments. Also, the effect of SMN-modifying treatments on SMA-miRs is unknown. The collection of longitudinal data would be highly desirable, namely in presymptomatic patients, identified in our and other newborn screening projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dangouloff et al., 2020</xref>). If the accuracy will be confirmed in replicative studies, the SMA-score might be included in the clinical routine, as part of the prognostic process, once newborn testing will be universally available.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Davide D'Amico is affiliated with Amazentis SA.

They use muscle biopsies and primary cell cultures as well as serum from individuals with SMA. For additional studies, they use an SMA mouse model with miRNA anti-sense injections. They conclude their new model was able to improve prediction of phenotypic severity when related to patient subtype and stratified by age. While the paper has a solid base, I think there are areas that need to be clarified, strengthened or carefully considered. I thank the authors for doing this work and putting together the manuscript. I hope the following will help solidify and improve aspects of the paper.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>– SMA is a deleterious genetic disease and the ability to improve prediction of severity would be an important clinical outcome.</p><p>– Use of miRNA sequencing to find biomarkers is a solid experimental approach.</p><p>– Coupling biomarkers with genetic outcomes is a logical predictive strategy.</p><p>– Follow-up testing on previously proposed biomarkers.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>– There is a disparity in FDRs used for various miRNA analyses. Reasons for differences in the accepted FDR should be explained and also may have affected downstream analyses. FDRs listed for miRNome was said to be selected at p&lt;0.01 in the methods, with muscle having 99, myoblasts having 20 and myotubes having 19 DE miRNA. However, using their stated FDR of p&lt;0.01, two of their selected predictors, miR-181 and miR-324 do not meet that threshold for being differentially expressed. Then there is a switch to accepting an FDR of p&lt;0.05. Uniformity of data analyses is crucial for biomarker studies and this is a major oversight.</p><p>– For the first tier round of qPCR follow up, how and why where those individuals selected out of the complete cohort? Having 1 SMA1 and 9 SMA II seems like a very oddly weighted group breakdown.</p><p>– How was type I error limited for the absolute qPCR? FDRs of relative qPCR were stated to be an FDR but nothing is mentioned for absolute qPCR. This is important considering 50 assays were completed for these outcomes.</p><p>– A table showing all the outcomes of the relative and absolute qPCR would provide a great deal of information and transparency. For example, the miRNA selected as 'predictors' for SMA were upregulated, but biomarkers can also be down-regulated.</p><p>– The link of SMN being depleted in muscle having primary effects is intriguing, but should be interpreted with caution. The importance of having a tonic motor connection with a healthy motor neuron cannot be underestimated. Changes in differentiation factors in proliferating myoblasts and forming myotubes related to myomiR are often seen in other pathological conditions that result from denervation (such as Parkinson's, age-related denervation and ALS). Additionally, only these factors were considered and not any phenotypic measurements of differentiating myotubes. The data are intriguing, but directed and focused studies are needed to investigate how muscle may or may not be regulated by global SMN1 reductions.</p><p>– There is no description of when the biopsies of the SMA patients were taken. As they say they were taken from the quadriceps during the first stages of the disease, this could be quite variable depending on fiber type of the muscle group the biopsy was taken from, time diagnosis was confirmed and the age at the time of biopsy. Clarification of these points, as well as for the primary tissue cultures, is important.</p><p>– It is not listed where the serum from individuals with SMA came from. Please explain if these were obtained from a repository similar to the muscle tissues or if separate process was conducted.</p><p>– The disparity in group sizes from type I to type II and III is unfortunate. It is understood the difference in disease disparity causes this, but it is a limitation in the search for prognostic biomarkers to have such unbalanced group differences.</p><p>– Assignment of patients to the SMA subgroup is vague and likely difficult to understand for non-clinicians. Explicit descriptions of how each individual used the clinical data available to stratify patients would be appreciated.</p><p>– The authors do not describe what SMN1/2 encodes, what its biological function is, and why genetic disruption of its expression is so detrimental to muscle function. A brief paragraph providing some general background on SMN would be appreciated for readers not familiar with SMA. Additional notes of onset, severity and phenotype differences between SMA I-III would also be useful to provide some additional background for the disease.</p><p>– Data that is listed as 'available on request' or 'data not shown', should be provided in a Supplementary file either with the journal or 3rd party repository (figshare or similar). In this age of almost unlimited file space, all data reported should be directly presented to the reader.</p><p>– Paragraph #2 of the introduction should be removed or worked into other portions of the paper.</p><p>– This Italian cohort of authors should be commended for their preparation of the manuscript in English. However, there are many sections (such as paragraph 4 of the introduction) that would be greatly improved by a careful proofread by a native English speaker.</p><p>– One abbreviation of microRNA, either miR or miRNA, should be used throughout the paper.</p><p>– Background information on what miRNA are and their biological affect would be useful.</p><p>– It is unclear what 51 serum/RNA/DNA samples means. Does it simply mean the authors collected 51 samples, then isolated RNA and DNA from it? Or were samples received with both RNA and DNA already isolated?</p><p>– Exact p values should be listed uniformly throughout the paper (some figures have asterisks or section have p&lt;0.05).</p><p>– What passage numbers were use for cell cultures? How were the primary myoblasts isolated and stored (i.e. was CD56+ screening used)?

Furthermore, the authors study their presence in serum of 51 patients and report an attempt to correlate results in serum miRNAs with SMN2 copy number, FL transcripts and age of the SMA patients under study. The resulting correlation is named SMA-score.</p><p>The authors managed to develop an appropriate streamline to detect and validate candidate miRNAs. Data of specific miRNAs is interesting but at present there is lack of longitudinal analysis or trajectories to ascribe them a value as dynamic biomarkers. These issues should be investigated to ascribe a potential role of miRNAs as biomarkers and to further validate the utility of the SMA-score.</p><p>SMN2 analysis of these patients was appropriate including the variants rs121909192 and rs1454173648 as positive modifiers (that were discarded in the cases under study) strengthen the accuracy of this variable to include into the score. Further investigation of the entire sequence of the SMN2 of patients may provide additional information about prediction of severity and would be a next step to help improving accuracy of SMA prediction and possibly will be included in the score.</p><p>1) Title. I would edit the title to reflect a more realistic scenario of this investigation that is the discovering and validation of miRNAs. The application of the SMA-score is in my opinion preliminary (see below further comments).</p><p>2) Abstract. Edits are also necessary in the abstract. i.e. there is incomplete information given that a part of these studies were performed in mice models; wording: &quot;evaluate its controversial pathogenic role&quot; is not addressed in this work and the conclusion that &quot;may provide additional benefit to SMA patients&quot; is not new; also &quot;the SMA-score could be crucial for the prognostic assessment of pre-symptomatic patients&quot; is rather speculative given the lack of data in pre-symptomatic patients regarding the candidates miRNAs and the score application. In summary, the abstract should be more focused in the issues of the study.</p><p>3) Methods. The authors should clarify the meaning of &quot;first stages&quot;, does mean that all the samples were taken at the beginning of manifestations? Perhaps a Table (could be also supplementary) can be included with a summary of the samples studied with additional information of first stages.</p><p>4) Discovering and data of specific miRNAs is interesting and the analysis is adequate. The lack of longitudinal analysis or trajectories to ascribe them a value as dynamic biomarkers should be commented.</p><p>5) The cohort of type I patients is small in my opinion to establish a correlation (only four patients). But it could be interesting to try a correlation between the values of type II versus type III cases to determine if patients with three copies acquire (type III) or not (type II) the ability for autonomous walking.</p><p>6) There are four patients in the list of type II and III disease with two SMN2 copies. In absence of positive modifier variants (rs121909192 and rs1454173648 also known as NM_017411.3:c.859G&gt;C and NM_017411.3:c.835-44A&gt;G)(both nomenclatures can be included for clarity in the paper) these &quot;outliers&quot; may influence the final score? i.e. PT11 2.70 vs. PT 38 2.12 &gt;6 years (according to data set). Values should be with period not commas, the same applies to the equation.</p><p>7) What explanation is feasible to explain the correlation differences in &gt; or &lt; 6 years? Can the authors clarify scores &gt;6 years or &lt; 6 years from the same patient?</p><p>8) Discussion: neurofilament should be referenced (i.e. Darras BT, et al., Ann Clin Transl Neurol. 2019 Apr 17;6(5):932-944. doi: 10.1002/acn3.779. PMID: 31139691; PMCID: PMC6530526.</p><p>9) The authors provide additional evidence that muscle is involved in SMA but as they said in Discussion, there is some heterogeneity in the samples. The statement &quot;Taken together, these data suggest that systemic therapeutic approaches increasing SMN levels also in skeletal muscle tissues may provide additional benefits to SMA patients&quot; remains speculative according to what is discussed below this statement about miR-324-5p, miR-451a and miR-181a-5p. I would try to elaborate a statement after the discussion of the role in muscle of the miRNAs detected with a more realistic conclusion.</p><p>10) &quot;More information is (are) available&quot;.</p><p>11) Please clarify some aspects of the multivariate analysis performed. Selection of variables that are introduced in the multivariate analysis can be done by a full model (the more variables you enter, the better R2 you will have…) or selection of only those variables with significant value in the bivariate linear regression (one by one). The authors state: &quot;Continuous variables were compared by linear correlations. Multivariate analysis was used to correlate severity and molecular parameters (miRNA levels, SMN2 transcripts, SMN2 copy number)&quot;. Which variables were significant if compared one by one?</p><p>12) Please clarify in Table 1 the meaning of P in the column of absolute qPCR.</p><p>13) The statement &quot;The inclusion of SMA-miRs, age and SMN2-fl levels has almost doubled the accuracy of the severity prediction of SMN2 copy number alone, from about 43% to 82%.&quot; should be better discussed. Data of calculations on SMN2 alone (according to the authors apparently is 43%) should be provided because is confusing. Looking at the data set Table, in type III there are 13 with 4 copies (54%), 9 with 3 copies (37%) and 2 with 2 copies (8%). In a total of 18 type II patients the score was calculated and 15 (83%) had 3 SMN2 copies as expected in these type of patients. Adding the 4 type I patients the total number of patients with calculated score is 46 (just serum was available in 51 but the score was performed in 46, please mention in the text).</p><p>14) I found 7/24 (30%) cases with type III disease with an insufficient SMA-score (less than 2.5 assuming in type II disease according to the score). It is possible to discuss these results?</p><p>15) As the authors mentioned in the last paragraphs, data in newborns (control and SMA) and trajectories with longitudinal data and evolution of the miRNAS should be investigated to ascribe a potential role as a biomarker and to validate the utility of the score.</p><p>16) Even though the variants rs121909192 and rs1454173648 were discarded, a sentence may be included mentioning that investigation of the entire sequence of the SMN2 of patients (perhaps with a reference) may provide additional information about prediction of severity and would be a next step to help improving accuracy of prediction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68054.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>General comments:</p><p>1.

For similar reasons, we did not check whether miR level modulation could affect SMN levels in CNS or namely in spinal cord. Additionally, two lines of evidences were in support of this strategy: (1) as shown in the present study, SMA-miRs do not modulate SMN levels in human cells of neuronal origin; (2) since the survival of treated mice is not affected by antagomiRs, we think unlikely a direct effect on SMN levels that, based on preclinical and clinical data, would have led to a positive effect on mice phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also unclear is why the miR were delivered to the central nervous system rather than skeletal muscle where they arose.

I do not know if miRs cross the blood brain barrier.</p></disp-quote><p>With our preliminary experiments (but more detailed studies on miR/antagomiR system are ongoing) we aimed at evaluating a specific hypothesis, that is the retrograde effect of SMA-miRs on CNS. We agree with the reviewer that it is conceivable that, based on the finding of secreted miRs in serum, these molecules are likely exert a systemic effect: to reduce possible confounding variables, we decided to restrict miR modulation to a specific target tissue, namely the CNS, rather than evaluating the loco-regional effect in skeletal muscle. However, several studies report the ability of extra-cellular vesicles to cross the blood brain barrier and to deliver their content to the CNS (see for example Izco et al., Neuroscientist 2021 Feb 3; 1073858421990001. doi: 10.1177/1073858421990001).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22.

Since miRNA levels in serum were determined by absolute qPCR, the relative abundance of the different miRs is reported as no. of molecules/μl of serum in figures and tables. As hypothesized by the reviewer, myo-miRs were abundantly expressed in muscle samples, at significantly higher levels in patients. Intriguingly, these miRNAs were not differentially expressed in serum, suggesting that, differently from the SMA-miRs, myo-miRs are not actively secreted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>General comments:</p><p>The authors refer to multiple sets of data that has not been included in the manuscript.

Keep in mind that the muscle biopsies sampled primarily muscle fibers and that satellite cells in those biopsies were quiescent, rather than the active proliferating form they take as myoblasts. Is it not also possible that these miRs target other key genes in mature myofibers? In addition, the paper really did not delve into role(s) of SMA in muscle per se, and did not try to link SMA1/2 levels to expression of the miRs identified.

They use muscle biopsies and primary cell cultures as well as serum from individuals with SMA. For additional studies, they use an SMA mouse model with miRNA anti-sense injections. They conclude their new model was able to improve prediction of phenotypic severity when related to patient subtype and stratified by age. While the paper has a solid base, I think there are areas that need to be clarified, strengthened or carefully considered. I thank the authors for doing this work and putting together the manuscript. I hope the following will help solidify and improve aspects of the paper.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>– SMA is a deleterious genetic disease and the ability to improve prediction of severity would be an important clinical outcome.</p><p>– Use of miRNA sequencing to find biomarkers is a solid experimental approach.</p><p>– Coupling biomarkers with genetic outcomes is a logical predictive strategy.</p><p>– Follow-up testing on previously proposed biomarkers.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>– There is a disparity in FDRs used for various miRNA analyses. Reasons for differences in the accepted FDR should be explained and also may have affected downstream analyses. FDRs listed for miRNome was said to be selected at p&lt;0.01 in the methods, with muscle having 99, myoblasts having 20 and myotubes having 19 DE miRNA. However, using their stated FDR of p&lt;0.01, two of their selected predictors, miR-181 and miR-324 do not meet that threshold for being differentially expressed. Then there is a switch to accepting an FDR of p&lt;0.05. Uniformity of data analyses is crucial for biomarker studies and this is a major oversight.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very grateful to the reviewer for noticing our mistake, due to a typo. The FDR for all analyses was selected &lt;0.05. The text has been modified accordingly in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For the first tier round of qPCR follow up, how and why where those individuals selected out of the complete cohort? Having 1 SMA1 and 9 SMA II seems like a very oddly weighted group breakdown.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the constructive comment, we specified this information in the Results. At that stage, due to the lack of preliminary data, we opted for the more homogenous sub-cohort of patients, in terms of age and severity, to reduce potential biases in miR quantification. The type I patient was the only available at the time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How was type I error limited for the absolute qPCR? FDRs of relative qPCR were stated to be an FDR but nothing is mentioned for absolute qPCR. This is important considering 50 assays were completed for these outcomes.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to Specific comments #19.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– A table showing all the outcomes of the relative and absolute qPCR would provide a great deal of information and transparency. For example, the miRNA selected as 'predictors' for SMA were upregulated, but biomarkers can also be down-regulated.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested we have included a supplementary table (#5) reporting the results of the single miRNAs in relative and/or absolute qPCR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The link of SMN being depleted in muscle having primary effects is intriguing, but should be interpreted with caution. The importance of having a tonic motor connection with a healthy motor neuron cannot be underestimated. Changes in differentiation factors in proliferating myoblasts and forming myotubes related to myomiR are often seen in other pathological conditions that result from denervation (such as Parkinson's, age-related denervation and ALS). Additionally, only these factors were considered and not any phenotypic measurements of differentiating myotubes. The data are intriguing, but directed and focused studies are needed to investigate how muscle may or may not be regulated by global SMN1 reductions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the comment. We fully agree that our data alone do not allow drawing any conclusion on the pathogenic role of skeletal muscle in SMA, but this was not the primary aim of the study that has been designed for biomarker discovery. However, besides data obtained in murine models or those in human whole muscle samples, some in vitro studies on human muscle cell cultures have demonstrated primitive alterations of patients’ satellite cells, including the inability of SMA myotubes to sustain motor neuron innervation, when co-cultured with wild type motor neurons (see for example Braun et al., 1995; Guettier-Sigrist et al., 2002).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– There is no description of when the biopsies of the SMA patients were taken. As they say they were taken from the quadriceps during the first stages of the disease, this could be quite variable depending on fiber type of the muscle group the biopsy was taken from, time diagnosis was confirmed and the age at the time of biopsy. Clarification of these points, as well as for the primary tissue cultures, is important.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to item 12 in the Specific comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is not listed where the serum from individuals with SMA came from. Please explain if these were obtained from a repository similar to the muscle tissues or if separate process was conducted.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. Patients were enrolled ad hoc in the participating neuromuscular centers. These patients are or were in routine clinical follow-up. This aspect has been specified in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The disparity in group sizes from type I to type II and III is unfortunate. It is understood the difference in disease disparity causes this, but it is a limitation in the search for prognostic biomarkers to have such unbalanced group differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer. However, it is unlikely to succeed in balancing the sub-populations, in such wide phenotypic spectrum of disease, in terms of age of onset, severity and relative abundance of the different forms. Additionally, the total number of type I patients in our study has been limited also by the difficulties in sampling adequate amounts of blood from such young and/or hypotonic patients.

But it could be interesting to try a correlation between the values of type II versus type III cases to determine if patients with three copies acquire (type III) or not (type II) the ability for autonomous walking.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the type I cohort is very small. However, due to the difficult sampling and to the amount of biological specimen required for the different analyses reported in this study, we had to exclude 4 additional patients due to the lack of serum or RNA samples. Additionally, the spreading of experimental treatments has complicated the enrollment of further naïve patients.</p><p>We re-evaluated with the referral clinicians the whole cohort and concluded that one of the patients has been erroneously attributed to type I while being type II. This aspect has been emended in table and figures, and the equations have been concordantly corrected. These modifications have led to a further improvement of the correlation between the SMA-score and the SMA decimal classification.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we compared SMA-miRs’ levels in type II and III patients with 3 SMN2 copies (Figure 3 – figure supplement 3A). The difference was not significant for any miR or the sum. However, the age at sampling was significantly higher in type III (Figure 3 – figure supplement 3B). In our opinion it would be more appropriate to compare age-matched groups to draw any conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) There are four patients in the list of type II and III disease with two SMN2 copies. In absence of positive modifier variants (rs121909192 and rs1454173648 also known as NM_017411.3:c.859G&gt;C and NM_017411.3:c.835-44A&gt;G)(both nomenclatures can be included for clarity in the paper) these &quot;outliers&quot; may influence the final score? i.e. PT11 2.70 vs. PT 38 2.12 &gt;6 years (according to data set). Values should be with period not commas, the same applies to the equation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included an additional supplementary table (#2) with individual data for each patient, which has integrated and replaced the previous file “patient_database”. Of the mentioned type II patients, one was twin-sister of a type I male that were previously reported [Pane et al., Neuromuscular Disorders 27 (2017) 890–893]. The 2 other patients were confirmed, both in terms of clinical severity and SMN2 copy number/absence of splicing variants. Regarding the type III patient, due to homonymy, the number of SMN2 copies was erroneously attributed. Indeed, DNA sample of this patient was not available. These data have been amended in figures, table, and equations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) What explanation is feasible to explain the correlation differences in &gt; or &lt; 6 years? Can the authors clarify scores &gt;6 years or &lt; 6 years from the same patient?</p></disp-quote><p>In supplementary table 2, we have indicated the SMA score obtained with both equations for patients below 6 years. Indeed, the correlation between the scores is very high, since the correlation coefficient is 0.90 and R<sup>2</sup> is 80.31 (p&lt;10<sup>-5</sup>, n=21, supplementary Figure 5D). These aspects have been pointed in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Discussion: neurofilament should be referenced (i.e. Darras BT, et al., Ann Clin Transl Neurol. 2019 Apr 17;6(5):932-944. doi: 10.1002/acn3.779.

We have corrected the typo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Please clarify some aspects of the multivariate analysis performed. Selection of variables that are introduced in the multivariate analysis can be done by a full model (the more variables you enter, the better R2 you will have…) or selection of only those variables with significant value in the bivariate linear regression (one by one). The authors state: &quot;Continuous variables were compared by linear correlations. Multivariate analysis was used to correlate severity and molecular parameters (miRNA levels, SMN2 transcripts, SMN2 copy number)&quot;. Which variables were significant if compared one by one?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, even if it has not been reported, in the present study, besides <italic>SMN2</italic>-fl levels, we have also evaluated SMN-del7 and SMN-total transcripts. The inclusion of these variables in the multivariate analyses led to a reduction in both significance and strength of association, since p-value increased and R2 decreased. Thus, we do not agree that by simply adding variables the R2 value increases. Similarly, the single miRNA performed worse than the miR-sum. As reported in the Results, the strongest contribution to the model was not surprisingly provided by SMN2 copy number and SMN2-fl levels.</p><p>Besides the contribution of the single variables in the definition of the equation, in our opinion, the correlation of two completely independent variables (decimal SMA classification and SMA-score) is unequivocally strong, up to levels that have never been raised so far in SMA biomarker research. Nonetheless, we fully agree that these data need to be validated in independent cohort, as well as, longitudinal evaluation of SMA-miR levels is required. We remind that we have shown in our previous studies that longitudinal levels of SMN2-fl transcripts are very stable over more than one year (Tiziano et al., 2019). This aspect has been pointed in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Please clarify in Table 1 the meaning of P in the column of absolute qPCR.</p></disp-quote><p>The p-value has been obtained by comparing miR levels in patients and controls by Mann-Whitney U-test.

Data of calculations on SMN2 alone (according to the authors apparently is 43%) should be provided because is confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>The correlation between SMA Type and SMN2 copy number has been evaluated by a linear regression model (R<sup>2</sup>=52.45%, p&lt;10<sup>-5</sup>, n=41; Figure 5 – figure supplement 1A). This has been specified in the Results and in the statistical analysis section of the Methods. Additionally, we have related SMN2 copies with the decimal SMA classification that has raised the R2 up to 67.00% (Figure 5 – figure supplement 1B). While SMN2 copy number alone provides sufficient predictability in the case of patients with 2 or 4 copies, the relevance in patients with 3 copies is very limited. Indeed, in our cohort, the SMA decimal classification ranges in these patients ranges from 1.9 to 3b. The correlation of the SMA score with the decimal classification in this subgroup of patients (n=21), is significant with a correlation coefficient of 0.55 (p=0.008, R<sup>2</sup>=30.00, Figure 5 – figure supplement 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Looking at the data set Table, in type III there are 13 with 4 copies (54%), 9 with 3 copies (37%) and 2 with 2 copies (8%). In a total of 18 type II patients the score was calculated and 15 (83%) had 3 SMN2 copies as expected in these type of patients. Adding the 4 type I patients the total number of patients with calculated score is 46 (just serum was available in 51 but the score was performed in 46, please mention in the text).</p></disp-quote><p>The different biological samples were not available for all patients.

This is likely due to the SMN2-fl levels, which appear to be quite low.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) As the authors mentioned in the last paragraphs, data in newborns (control and SMA) and trajectories with longitudinal data and evolution of the miRNAS should be investigated to ascribe a potential role as a biomarker and to validate the utility of the score.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer.
