At gastrulation, interactions between the pair-rule genes lead to frequency doubling and the patterning of 14 parasegment boundaries. In contrast to earlier stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> anteroposterior patterning, this transition is not well understood. By carefully analysing the spatiotemporal dynamics of pair-rule gene expression, we demonstrate that frequency-doubling is precipitated by multiple coordinated changes to the network of regulatory interactions between the pair-rule genes. We identify the broadly expressed but temporally patterned transcription factor, Odd-paired (Opa/Zic), as the cause of these changes, and show that the patterning of the even-numbered parasegment boundaries relies on Opa-dependent regulatory interactions. Our findings indicate that the pair-rule gene regulatory network has a temporally modulated topology, permitting the pair-rule genes to play stage-specific patterning roles.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18215.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18215.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18215.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The basic body plan of an animal is set up in the early embryo, where key developmental genes are expressed in specific patterns across the organism. These patterns emerge from the way in which the proteins encoded by these genes act to regulate each other’s expression. The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> is often used as a simple model for studying how regulatory interactions between genes lead to the formation of complex developmental patterns.</p><p>One example is segmentation, the process by which the trunk (main body) region of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo is subdivided into 14 segments. A group of transcription factor proteins that are encoded by the so-called “pair-rule” genes play a crucial role in producing the final pattern. Early in development, the pair-rule genes are expressed in patterns of seven stripes, dividing the embryo into double segment units. As the embryo develops, these patterns change to form more precise patterns of 14 stripes, corresponding to single segments. Although many of the regulatory interactions between the pair-rule genes were known, how the system works as a whole to produce this change in expression patterns was not well understood.</p><p>Clark and Akam have now examined how the patterns of pair-rule gene expression change over time inside fly embryos. This revealed that a “rewiring” of the network of pair-rule genes occurs at the end of the seven stripe stage to produce fourteen stripes. Further investigation revealed that a transcription factor encoded by the gene <italic>odd-paired</italic> causes this rewiring, and that the timing of the expression of the Odd-paired protein determines when the rewiring happens.</p><p>Further studies could now investigate whether Odd-paired’s role as a timer extends to species where segments emerge sequentially, instead of the simultaneous formation of segments seen in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Future challenges will be to find out how Odd-paired interacts with other pair-rule transcription factors, and whether there are other timing factors that help to coordinate embryonic patterning.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18215.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18215.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>segmentation</kwd><kwd>patterning</kwd><kwd>gene regulatory network</kwd><kwd>pair-rule genes</kwd><kwd>Odd-paired</kwd><kwd>Zic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The organisation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo into segmental units is orchestrated by combinatorial regulatory interactions between spatially patterned and temporally patterned transcription factors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Segmentation is a developmental process that subdivides an animal body axis into similar, repeating units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Hannibal and Patel, 2013</xref>). Segmentation of the main body axis underlies the body plans of arthropods, annelids and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Telford et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balavoine, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Graham et al., 2014</xref>). In arthropods, segmentation first involves setting up polarised boundaries early in development to define 'parasegments' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Martinez-Arias and Lawrence, 1985</xref>). Parasegment boundaries are maintained by an elaborate and strongly-conserved signalling network of 'segment-polarity' genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ingham, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Perrimon, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">DiNardo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Sanson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Janssen and Budd, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In all arthropods yet studied, the segmental stripes of segment-polarity genes are initially patterned by a group of transcription factors known as the 'pair-rule' genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Green and Akam, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Peel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Damen et al., 2005</xref>). The pair-rule genes were originally identified in a screen for mutations affecting the segmental pattern of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larval cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980</xref>). They appeared to be required for the patterning of alternate segment boundaries (hence 'pair-rule') and were subsequently found to be expressed in stripes of double-segment periodicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hafen et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akam, 1987</xref>).</p><p>Early models of <italic>Drosophila</italic> segmentation suggested that the blastoderm might be progressively patterned into finer-scale units by some reaction-diffusion mechanism that exhibited iterative frequency-doubling (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Jaeger, 2009</xref>). The discovery of a double-segment unit of organisation seemed to support these ideas, and pair-rule patterning was therefore thought to be an adaptation to the syncytial environment of the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, which allows diffusion of gene products between neighbouring nuclei. However, the transcripts of pair-rule genes are apically localised during cellularisation of the blastoderm, and thus pair-rule patterning occurs in an effectively cellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Edgar et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Davis and Ish-Horowicz, 1991</xref>). Furthermore, double-segment periodicity of pair-rule gene expression is also found in some sequentially segmenting ('short germ') insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Patel et al., 1994</xref>), indicating that pair-rule patterning predates the evolution of simultaneous ('long germ') segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18215.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The evolution of pair-rule patterning predates the evolution of long germ segmentation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Single segment periodicity is ancestral in arthropod segmentation, being found in spiders, millipedes, crustaceans and some insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Davis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Pueyo et al., 2008</xref>). 'Pair-rule' patterning, involving an initial double segment periodicity of pair-rule gene expression, appears to have evolved independently at least twice.

It was found that odd-numbered <italic>en</italic> stripes – and thus the anterior boundaries of odd-numbered parasegments (hereafter 'odd-numbered parasegment boundaries') – require the pair-rule gene <italic>paired (prd</italic>), but not another pair-rule gene <italic>fushi tarazu (ftz</italic>), while the opposite was true for the even-numbered <italic>en</italic> stripes and their associated ('even-numbered') parasegment boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">DiNardo and O'Farrell, 1987</xref>). Differential patterning of alternate segment-polarity stripes, combined with the observation that the different pair-rule genes are expressed with different relative phasings along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis, led to models where static, partially overlapping domains of pair-rule gene expression form a combinatorial regulatory code that patterns the blastoderm with single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">DiNardo and O'Farrell, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Gergen and Butler, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Weir et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Coulter et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Morrissey et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>However, pair-rule gene expression domains are not static. One reason for this is that their upstream regulators, the gap genes, are themselves dynamically expressed, exhibiting expression domains that shift anteriorly over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Jaeger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">El-Sherif and Levine, 2016</xref>). Another major reason is that, in addition to directing the initial expression of the segment-polarity genes, pair-rule genes also cross-regulate one another. Pair-rule proteins and transcripts turn over extremely rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Edgar et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Nasiadka and Krause, 1999</xref>), and therefore regulatory feedback between the different pair-rule genes mediates dynamic pattern changes throughout the period that they are expressed. Most strikingly, many of the pair-rule genes undergo a transition from double-segment periodicity to single-segment periodicity at the end of cellularisation. The significance of this frequency-doubling is not totally clear. In some cases, the late, segmental stripes are crucial for proper segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cadigan et al., 1994b</xref>), but in others they appear to be dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Coulter et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Fujioka et al., 1995</xref>), or their function (if any) is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Klingler and Gergen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Jaynes and Fujioka, 2004</xref>).</p><p>More recent models of pair-rule patterning recognise that the pair-rule genes form a complex gene regulatory network that mediates dynamic patterns of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Edgar et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Sánchez and Thieffry, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Jaynes and Fujioka, 2004</xref>). However, whereas other stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> segmentation have been extensively studied from a dynamical systems perspective (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Jaeger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Grimm et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Jaeger, 2011</xref>), we do not yet have a good systems-level understanding of the pair-rule gene network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Jaeger, 2009</xref>). This appears to be a missed opportunity: not only do the pair-rule genes exhibit fascinating transcriptional regulation, but their interactions are potentially very informative for comparative studies with short germ arthropods. These include the beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, in which the pair-rule genes form a segmentation oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Sarrazin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Choe et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>To better understand exactly how pair-rule patterning works in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we carried out a careful analysis of pair-rule gene regulation during cellularisation and gastrulation, drawing on both the genetic literature and a newly generated dataset of double-fluorescent in situs. Surprisingly, we found that the majority of regulatory interactions between pair-rule genes are not constant, but undergo dramatic changes just before the onset of gastrulation. These regulatory changes mediate the frequency-doubling phenomena observed in the embryo at this time.</p><p>We then realised that all the regulatory interactions specific to the late pair-rule gene regulatory network seem to require the non-canonical pair-rule gene <italic>odd-paired (opa). opa</italic> was identified through the original <italic>Drosophila</italic> segmentation screen as being required for the patterning of the even-numbered parasegment boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Jürgens et al., 1984</xref>). However, rather than being expressed periodically like the rest of the pair-rule genes, <italic>opa</italic> is expressed ubiquitously throughout the trunk region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benedyk et al., 1994</xref>). The reported appearance of Opa protein temporally correlates with the time we see regulatory changes in the embryo, indicating that it may be directly responsible for these changes. We propose that Opa provides a source of temporal information that acts combinatorially with the spatial information provided by the periodically expressed pair-rule genes. Pair-rule patterning thus appears to be a two-stage process that relies on the interplay of spatial and temporal signals to permit a common set of patterning genes to carry out stage-specific regulatory functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High-resolution spatiotemporal characterisation of wild-type pair-rule gene expression</title><p>We carried out double fluorescent in situ hybridisation on fixed wild-type <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos for all pairwise combinations of the pair-rule genes <italic>hairy, even-skipped (eve), runt, fushi tarazu (ftz), odd-skipped (odd), paired (prd</italic>) and <italic>sloppy-paired (slp</italic>).

The regulation of various stripe-specific elements by gap proteins has been studied extensively (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Small et al., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">1996</xref>).</p><p>Phase 2 is dominated by the expression of so-called 'zebra' (or '7-stripe') elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Hiromi et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dearolf et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Butler et al., 1992</xref>). These elements, which tend to be relatively large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Gutjahr et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Klingler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Schroeder et al., 2011</xref>), are regulated by pair-rule gene inputs and thus produce periodic output patterns. The stripes produced from these elements overlap with the stripes generated by stripe-specific elements, and often the two sets of stripes appear to be at least partially redundant. For example, <italic>ftz</italic> and <italic>odd</italic> lack a full complement of stripe-specific elements (see above), while the stripe-specific elements of <italic>runt</italic> are dispensable for segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Butler et al., 1992</xref>). Neither <italic>hairy</italic> nor <italic>eve</italic> appears to possess a zebra element, and thus their expression during phase 2 is driven entirely by their stripe-specific elements. (Note that the 'late' (or 'autoregulatory') element of <italic>eve</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Goto et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Harding et al., 1989</xref>) does generate a periodic pattern and has therefore been considered to be analogous to the zebra elements of other pair-rule genes. However, because it is not expressed until phase 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Schroeder et al., 2011</xref>), we do not classify it as such.)</p><p>In addition to the five primary pair-rule genes, there are two other pair-rule genes, <italic>prd</italic> and <italic>slp</italic>, that turn on after regular periodic patterns of the other genes have been established. These genes possess only a single, anterior stripe-specific element, and their trunk stripes are generated by a zebra element alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Schroeder et al., 2011</xref>). Because (ignoring the head stripes) these genes are regulated only by other pair-rule genes, and not by gap genes, they are termed as the 'secondary' pair-rule genes.</p><p>The third, 'late' phase of expression is the least understood. Around the time of gastrulation, most of the pair-rule genes undergo a transition from double-segmental stripes to single-segmental stripes. For <italic>prd</italic>, this happens by splitting of its early, broad pair-rule stripes. In contrast, <italic>odd, runt</italic> and <italic>slp</italic> show intercalation of 'secondary' stripes between their 'primary' 7-stripe patterns. Secondary stripes of <italic>eve</italic> also appear at gastrulation, but these 'minor' stripes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Macdonald et al., 1986</xref>) are extremely weak (usually undetectable in our fluorescent in situs), and not comparable to the rapidly developing segmental expression of <italic>prd, odd, runt</italic> and <italic>slp</italic>. Expression of <italic>hairy</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic> remains double segmental.</p><p>In some cases, discrete enhancer elements have been found that mediate just the secondary stripes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Klingler et al., 1996</xref>), while in other cases, all 14 segmental stripes are likely to be regulated coordinately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Fujioka et al., 1995</xref>). In certain cases, non-additive interactions between enhancers play a role in generating the segmental pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Prazak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Gutjahr et al., 1994</xref>). The functional significance of the late patterns is not always clear, since they are usually not reflected in pair-rule gene mutant cuticle phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Kilchherr et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Coulter et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>In the remainder of this paper, we investigate the nature and causes of the pattern transitions that occur between the end of phase 2 and the beginning of phase 3.

We find that the spatiotemporal pattern of segment-polarity gene activation coincides closely with that of pair-rule frequency-doubling – starting at the beginning of phase 3, and rapidly progressing over the course of gastrulation. Only around 20 min separate a late stage 5 embryo (with double-segment periodicity of pair-rule gene expression and no segment-polarity gene expression) from a late stage 7 embryo (with regular segmental expression of both pair-rule genes and segment-polarity genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Campos-Ortega and Hartenstein, 1985</xref>).</p><p>We can make three conclusions from the timing of these events. First, segment-polarity gene expression cannot be precipitating the frequency-doubling of pair-rule gene expression, because frequency-doubling occurs before segment-polarity proteins would have had time to be synthesised. Second, the late, segmental patterns of pair-rule gene expression do not play a role in regulating the initial expression of segment-polarity genes, because they are not reflected at the protein level until after segmental patterns of segment-polarity gene transcripts are observed. Third, the synchrony of pair-rule gene frequency-doubling and segment-polarity gene activation is consistent with co-regulation of these events by a single temporal signal.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The transition to single-segment periodicity is mediated by altered regulatory interactions</title><p>It is clear that a dramatic change overtakes pair-rule gene expression at gastrulation. For a given gene, an altered pattern of transcriptional output could result from an altered spatial pattern of regulatory inputs, or, alternatively, altered regulatory logic. Pair-rule proteins provide most of the spatial regulatory input for pair-rule gene expression at both phase 2 and phase 3. Therefore, the fact that the distributions of pair-rule proteins are very similar at the end of phase 2 and the beginning of phase 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Pisarev et al., 2009</xref>) suggests that it must be the 'input-output functions' of pair-rule gene transcription that change to bring about the new expression patterns.</p><p>For example, consider the relative expression patterns of <italic>prd</italic> and <italic>odd</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). There is abundant experimental evidence that the splitting of the <italic>prd</italic> stripes is caused by direct repression by Odd protein. The primary stripes of <italic>odd</italic> lie within the broad <italic>prd</italic> stripes, and the secondary interstripes that form within the <italic>prd</italic> stripes at gastrulation correspond precisely to those cells that express <italic>odd</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>prd</italic> stripes do not split in <italic>odd</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baumgartner and Noll, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Saulier-Le Dréan et al., 1998</xref>), and <italic>prd</italic> expression is largely repressed by ectopically expressed Odd protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Saulier-Le Dréan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Goldstein et al., 2005</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18215.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Odd does not repress <italic>prd</italic> transcription until phase 3.</title><p>Relative expression of <italic>prd</italic> and <italic>odd</italic> is shown in a late phase 2 embryo (just prior to frequency doubling) and an early phase 3 embryo (showing the first signs of frequency doubling).

The two sets of stripes are mediated by separate stretches of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Gutjahr et al., 1994</xref>), and must be regulated differently, since the 'P' stripes remain insensitive to ectopic Odd even during phase 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Saulier-Le Dréan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Goldstein et al., 2005</xref>).

Because <italic>prd</italic> expression begins at a time when Odd protein is already present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Pisarev et al., 2009</xref>), this co-expression cannot be explained by protein synthesis delays. We therefore infer that Odd only becomes a repressor of <italic>prd</italic> at gastrulation, consistent with previous observations that aspects of Odd regulatory activity are temporally restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Saulier-Le Dréan et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>This apparent temporal switch in the regulatory function of Odd is not unique. We have carefully examined pair-rule gene stripe phasings just before and just after the double-segment to single-segment transition, and find that these patterns do indeed indicate significant changes to the control logic of multiple pair-rule genes. The results of this analysis are presented in Appendix 1. In summary, a number of regulatory interactions seem to disappear at the beginning of phase 3: repression of <italic>odd</italic> by Hairy, repression of <italic>odd</italic> by Eve, and repression of <italic>slp</italic> by Runt. These regulatory interactions are replaced by a number of new interactions: repression of <italic>prd</italic> by Odd, repression of <italic>odd</italic> by Runt, repression of <italic>runt</italic> by Eve and repression of <italic>slp</italic> by Ftz. At the same time that these regulatory changes are observed, new elements for <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>runt</italic> turn on and various segment-polarity genes start to be expressed.</p><p>The outcome of all these regulatory changes is a coordinated transition to single-segment periodicity. We have schematised this transition in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Our diagrams are in broad agreement with the interpretation of Jaynes and Fujioka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Jaynes and Fujioka, 2004</xref>), although we characterise the process in greater temporal detail and distinguish between transcript and protein distributions at each timepoint.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18215.010</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of the transition to single-segment periodicity.</title><p>Schematic diagram showing segmentation gene expression at late phase 2 (<bold>A</bold>), early phase 3 (<bold>B</bold>) and late phase 3 (<bold>C</bold>).

The aberrant expression patterns of <italic>odd, prd</italic> and <italic>slp</italic> appear to directly reflect an absence of the regulatory changes normally observed in wild-type at phase 3. For example, the altered <italic>prd</italic> pattern is consistent with Odd failing to repress <italic>prd</italic>, indicating that Odd only acts as a repressor of <italic>prd</italic> in combination with Opa. Similarly, the expression pattern of <italic>slp</italic> is consistent with continued repression from Runt (a phase 2 interaction) and an absence of repression from Ftz (a phase 3 interaction), indicating that Runt only represses <italic>slp</italic> in the absence of Opa, while the opposite is true for Ftz. In Appendix 2, we demonstrate how an Opa-dependent switch from repression of <italic>odd</italic> by Eve (phase 2) to repression of <italic>odd</italic> by Runt (phase 3) is important for the precise positioning of the anterior borders of the <italic>odd</italic> primary stripes, in addition to being necessary for the emergence of the <italic>odd</italic> secondary stripes.</p><p>The loss of <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>runt</italic> expression in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos indicates first that the activators that drive expression of <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>runt</italic> during phase 2 do not persist in the embryo after the end of cellularisation, and second that the expression of these genes during phase 3 is activated by the new appearance of Opa. The inference of different activators at phase 2 and phase 3 is not too surprising for <italic>eve</italic>, which has phase 2 expression driven by stripe-specific elements and phase 3 expression driven by a separate 'late' element (see below). Indeed, expression of stripe-specific elements is known to fade away at gastrulation, as seen for endogenous expression of <italic>hairy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ingham et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), for stripe-specific reporter elements of <italic>eve</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bothma et al., 2014</xref>), or for transgenic embryos lacking <italic>eve</italic> late element expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Fujioka et al., 1995</xref>). However, a single stretch of DNA drives <italic>runt</italic> primary stripe expression at both phase 2 and phase 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Klingler et al., 1996</xref>). This suggests that the organisation and regulatory logic of this element may be complex, as it is evidently activated by different factors at different times.</p><p>Opa is also likely to contribute to the activation of the <italic>slp</italic> primary stripes, explaining why they are initially weaker than normal in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos.

A resulting delay in the appearance of Slp protein in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos could account for the broadened stripes of <italic>ftz</italic> and <italic>odd</italic>, which normally narrow during phase 3 in response to repression from Slp at the posterior.

The <italic>eve</italic> 'late' element is sometimes referred to as the <italic>eve</italic> 'autoregulatory' element, because expression from it is lost in <italic>eve</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Harding et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Jiang et al., 1991</xref>).

Instead of being directly activated by Eve, the element mediates regulatory inputs from repressors such as Runt and Slp, which are ectopically expressed in <italic>eve</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">Vavra and Carroll, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Klingler and Gergen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Riechmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Jaynes and Fujioka, 2004</xref>). The element is thought to be directly activated by Prd, and functional Prd-binding sites have been demonstrated within it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Fujioka et al., 1996</xref>). However, while Prd protein appears at roughly the right time to activate the <italic>eve</italic> late element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Pisarev et al., 2009</xref>), activation by Prd cannot explain all the expression generated from this element, because during early phase 3 it drives expression in many cells that do not express <italic>prd</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">Figure 8—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>Instead, it seems that the <italic>eve</italic> late element is directly activated by Opa. The lack of late <italic>eve</italic> expression in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos cannot be explained by the ectopic expression of repressive inputs, since none of <italic>runt, odd</italic> or <italic>slp</italic> are ectopically expressed in the domains where <italic>eve</italic> late element expression would normally be seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>). Furthermore, the total loss of <italic>eve</italic> expression in certain stripes despite the presence of appropriately positioned <italic>prd</italic> expression indicates that Prd alone is not sufficient to drive strong <italic>eve</italic> expression. Activation of <italic>en</italic> expression by Prd also requires the presence of Opa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benedyk et al., 1994</xref>), suggesting that cooperative interactions between Prd and Opa might be common.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Opa regulatory activity may be concentration-dependent</title><p>Not all the Opa-dependent expression pattern changes we identified through our analysis of <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos happen at exactly the same time in wild-type embryos.

During germband extension, they become dependent on intercellular signalling for their continued expression, with the Wingless and Hedgehog signalling pathways forming a positive feedback loop that maintains each parasegment boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">DiNardo et al., 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Perrimon, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">von Dassow et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Expression of <italic>en</italic> and <italic>wg</italic> has previously been characterised in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos, demonstrating that the even-numbered parasegment boundaries fail to establish properly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benedyk et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ingham, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">DiNardo and O'Farrell, 1987</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). To summarise, although their initial appearance is somewhat delayed, the even-numbered <italic>wg</italic> stripes (which normally contribute to the odd-numbered parasegment boundaries) and some of the even-numbered <italic>en</italic> stripes (which normally contribute to the even-numbered parasegment boundaries) become established in their normal locations by the beginning of the germband extension. Later on in germband extension, odd-numbered <italic>en</italic> stripes become established adjacent to the even-numbered <italic>wg</italic> stripes, leading to the formation of the odd-numbered parasegment boundaries. In contrast, the odd-numbered <italic>wg</italic> stripes never appear, the even-numbered <italic>en</italic> stripes eventually fade away, and the even-numbered parasegment boundaries are not established.</p><p>Our characterisation of pair-rule gene expression in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos enables us to make sense of these patterns. First, Opa appears to regulate <italic>slp</italic> and <italic>wg</italic> in a very similar way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). The even-numbered <italic>wg</italic> stripes overlap with the primary stripes of <italic>slp</italic> and show the same expression delays in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos, while the odd-numbered <italic>wg</italic> stripes and the <italic>slp</italic> secondary stripes, which would normally be activated at the same time and in the same places, both fail to appear. Second, the activation of <italic>en</italic> by Prd seems to strictly require Opa activity, whereas the activation of <italic>en</italic> by Ftz does not. Therefore, while the odd-numbered (Prd-activated) <italic>en</italic> stripes are initially absent in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos, some of the even-numbered (Ftz-activated) stripes do appear, although this is compromised by ectopic expression of Odd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benedyk et al., 1994</xref>, Appendix 2). Third, the capacity for a partially specified parasegment boundary to later recover depends on the presence of an appropriate segmental pattern of pair-rule gene expression, despite these patterns arising too late to regulate the initial expression of segment-polarity genes at gastrulation.</p><p>For example, the Slp stripes play an important segment-polarity role during germband extension, defining the posterior half of each parasegment. They repress <italic>en</italic> expression and are also necessary for the maintenance of <italic>wg</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cadigan et al., 1994b</xref>). In the case of the odd-numbered parasegment boundaries, <italic>slp</italic> and <italic>wg</italic> are properly patterned in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos, but the <italic>en</italic> stripes are absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, repressors of <italic>en</italic> such as Odd and Slp are not ectopically expressed in their place. Therefore, the odd-numbered <italic>en</italic> stripes are able to be later induced in their normal positions, presumably in response to Wg signalling coming from the Slp primary stripes, and therefore properly patterned boundaries eventually emerge. However, in the case of the even-numbered parasegment boundaries, while the <italic>en</italic> stripes are usually present in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos, both the <italic>slp</italic> stripes and the <italic>wg</italic> stripes are not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). The absence of the Slp secondary stripes means that the cells anterior to the even-numbered En stripes are not competent to express <italic>wg</italic>. Hedgehog signalling from the even-numbered En stripes is therefore unable to induce the odd-numbered <italic>wg</italic> stripes, and consequently the boundaries do not recover.</p><p>Based on regulatory interactions analysed in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2, we present an updated model for how the even-numbered parasegment boundaries are specified in wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). We propose that the spatial information directly responsible for patterning these boundaries derives from overlapping domains of Runt and Ftz activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Appendix 1—figure 3G,H</xref>). Ftz and Runt combinatorially specify distinct expression domains of <italic>slp, en</italic> and <italic>odd</italic>, by way of late acting, Opa-dependent regulatory interactions. As described above, the loss of these interactions in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos results in mispatterning of <italic>slp</italic> and <italic>odd</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>), which later has significant repercussions for segment-polarity gene expression.<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18215.021</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model for the Opa-dependent patterning of the even-numbered parasegment boundaries.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the phasing of <italic>odd, slp</italic> and <italic>en</italic> relative to Runt and Ftz protein at phase 3.

We are not the first to notice that certain regulatory interactions do not apply to all stages of pair-rule gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baumgartner and Noll, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Manoukian and Krause, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Manoukian and Krause, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Fujioka et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Saulier-Le Dréan et al., 1998</xref>). However, cataloguing and analysing these changes for the whole pair-rule system led us to the realisation that they are almost simultaneous and mediate the transition from double-segment to single-segment periodicity. We propose that the product of the non-canonical pair-rule gene <italic>opa</italic> acts as a temporal signal that mediates these changes, and simultaneously activates the expression of segment-polarity genes. Analysis of pair-rule gene expression patterns in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos indicates that the phase-specific regulatory interactions we inferred from wild-type embryos appear to be modulated by Opa, and thus explained by the onset of Opa regulatory activity at gastrulation.</p><p>We argue that the pair-rule system should not be thought of as a static gene regulatory network, but rather two temporally and topologically distinct networks, each with its own dynamical behaviour and consequent developmental patterning role. Pair-rule patterning can therefore be thought of as a two-stage process. In the absence of Opa, the early network patterns the template for the odd-numbered parasegment boundaries. Then, when Opa turns on, Opa-dependent regulatory interactions lead to the patterning of the even-numbered parasegment boundaries. Each stage of patterning uses the same source of positional information (the primary stripes of the pair-rule genes), but uses different sets of regulatory logic to exploit this information in different ways.</p><p>Opa thus plays a crucial timing role in segmentation, orchestrating the transition from pair-rule to segmental patterning. Notably, the role of Opa in activating the initial stages of segment-polarity gene expression demonstrates that segment-polarity gene expression is not simply induced by the emergence of an appropriate pattern of pair-rule proteins, as in textbook models of hierarchical gene regulation. The necessity for an additional signal had been surmised previously, based on the delayed appearance of odd-numbered <italic>en</italic> stripes in cells already expressing Eve and Prd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Manoukian and Krause, 1993</xref>).</p><p>Because correct segmentation depends upon the initial expression of segment-polarity genes being precisely positioned, it is imperative that a regular pair-rule pattern is present before the segment-polarity genes first turn on. Therefore, explicit temporal control of segment-polarity gene activation by Opa makes good sense from a patterning perspective. There are likely to be a number of analogous regulatory signals that provide extrinsic temporal information to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> segmentation cascade. For example, a ubiquitously expressed maternal protein, Tramtrack, represses pair-rule gene expression during early embryogenesis, effectively delaying pair-rule gene expression until appropriate patterns of gap gene expression have been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Harrison and Travers, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Read et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brown and Wu, 1993</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>What is the mechanism of Opa regulatory activity?</title><p><italic>opa</italic> is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of <italic>zinc finger of the cerebellum (zic</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aruga et al., 1994</xref>). <italic>zic</italic> genes encode zinc finger transcription factors closely related to Gli proteins that have many important developmental roles.</p><p>In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, in addition to its role in segmentation, Opa is also involved in the formation of visceral mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cimbora and Sakonju, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Schaub and Frasch, 2013</xref>). Opa is later highly expressed in the larval and adult brain (FlyAtlas – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chintapalli et al., 2007</xref>) and is likely to be involved in neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Eroglu et al., 2014</xref>). It is also involved in the regulation of adult head development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Lee et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The neuronal function is likely to reflect an ancestral role of Zic, as involvement of Zic genes in nervous system development and neuronal differentiation is pervasive throughout metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Layden et al., 2010</xref>). Lineage-specific duplications have resulted in five <italic>zic</italic> genes in most vertebrate taxa, and seven in teleosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aruga et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Merzdorf, 2007</xref>). While partial redundancy between these paralogs complicates the interpretation of mutant phenotypes, it is clear that in vertebrates Zic proteins play crucial roles in early embryonic patterning, neurogenesis, left-right asymmetry, neural crest formation, somite development, and cell proliferation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Merzdorf, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Houtmeyers et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Zic proteins have been shown to act both as classical DNA-binding transcription factors, and as cofactors that modulate the regulatory activity of other transcription factors via protein-protein interactions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Winata et al., 2015</xref>). They show context-dependent activity and can both activate and repress transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Yang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Salero et al., 2001</xref>). In particular, they appear to be directly involved in the modulation and interpretation of Wnt and Hedgehog signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Murgan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Pourebrahim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Fujimi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Koyabu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Quinn et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, they may play a direct role in chromatin regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Luo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The roles that Opa plays in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> segmentation network appear to be consistent with the mechanisms of Zic regulatory activity that have been characterised in vertebrates. Opa appears to transcriptionally activate a number of enhancers, including those driving late expression of <italic>eve, runt</italic> and <italic>slp</italic>. In the case of the <italic>slp</italic> enhancer, this has been verified experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Sen et al., 2010</xref>). In other cases, the role of Opa is likely to be restricted to modulating the effect of other regulatory inputs, such as mediating the repressive effect of Odd on <italic>prd</italic> expression, or the activatory effect of Prd on <italic>en</italic> expression. It will be interesting to investigate the enhancers mediating late pair-rule gene expression and early segment polarity gene expression, and to determine how Opa interacts with them to bring about these varied effects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Is Opa sufficient for the regulatory changes we observe at gastrulation?</title><p>Our data seem consistent with Opa being 'the' temporal signal that precipitates the 7 stripe to 14 stripe transition. However, it remains possible that Opa acts in conjunction with some other, as yet unidentified, temporally patterned factor, or has activity that is overridden during cellularisation by some maternal or zygotic factor that disappears at gastrulation. Indeed, combinatorial interactions with DV factors do seem likely to be playing a role in restricting the effects of Opa: despite the <italic>opa</italic> expression domain encircling the embryo, many Opa-dependent patterning events do not extend into the mesoderm or across the dorsal midline. Identification of these factors should yield insights into cross-talk between the AP and DV patterning systems of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> blastoderm.</p><p>The activity of Opa has previously been suggested to be concentration-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Swantek and Gergen, 2004</xref>). By comparing pair-rule gene expression in embryos with varying levels of Opa activity, we found evidence that different enhancers show different sensitivity to the concentration of Opa in a nucleus, explaining why different Opa-dependent regulatory events happen at slightly different times in wild-type embryos.</p><p>One of the earliest responses to Opa regulatory activity is the appearance of the <italic>slp</italic> primary stripes. However, we note that while Opa may contribute to their timely activation, these stripes still emerge in <italic>opa</italic> null mutant embryos. This is not surprising, as the <italic>slp</italic> locus has been shown to possess multiple partially redundant regulatory elements driving spatially and temporally overlapping expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Fujioka and Jaynes, 2012</xref>). From our own observations, we have found multiple cases where mutation of a particular gene causes the <italic>slp</italic> primary stripes to be reduced in intensity, but not abolished (data not shown), suggesting that regulatory control of these expression domains is redundant at the <italic>trans</italic> level as well as at the <italic>cis</italic> level. Partially redundant enhancers that drive similar patterns, but are not necessarily subject to the same regulatory logic, appear to be very common for developmental transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cannavò et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Hong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Perry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Staller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Wunderlich et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>General regulatory principles of the pair-rule network</title><p>By carefully analysing pair-rule gene expression patterns in the light of the experimental literature (Appendix 1), we have clarified our understanding of the regulatory logic responsible for generating them. In particular, we propose significantly revised models for the patterning of <italic>odd, slp</italic> and <italic>runt</italic>. Because the structure of a regulatory network determines its dynamics, and its structure is determined by the control logic of its individual components, these subtleties are not merely developmental genetic stamp-collecting. Our reappraisal of the pair-rule gene network allows us to re-evaluate some long-held views about <italic>Drosphila</italic> blastoderm patterning.</p><p>First, pair-rule gene interactions are combinatorially regulated by an extrinsic source of temporal information, something not allowed for by textbook models of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> segmentation cascade. We have characterised the role of Opa during the 7 stripe to 14 stripe transition, but there may well be other such signals acting earlier or later. Indeed, context-dependent transcription factor activity appears to be very common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Stampfel et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Second, our updated model of the pair-rule network is in many ways simpler than previously thought. While we do introduce the complication of an Opa-dependent network topology, this effectively streamlines the sub-networks that operate early (phase 2) and late (phase 3). At any one time, each pair-rule gene is only regulated by two or three other pair-rule genes. We do not see strong evidence for combinatorial interactions between these inputs (<italic>cf.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">DiNardo and O'Farrell, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baumgartner and Noll, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Swantek and Gergen, 2004</xref>). Instead, pair-rule gene regulatory logic seems invariably to consist of permissive activation by a broadly expressed factor (or factors) that is overridden by precisely positioned repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Edgar et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Weir et al., 1988</xref>). This kind of regulation appears to typify other complex patterning systems, such as the vertebrate neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Briscoe and Small, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Finally, pair-rule gene cross-regulation has traditionally been thought of as a mechanism to stabilise and refine stripe boundaries (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Edgar et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Schroeder et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this function, as well as with the observed digitisation of gene expression observed at gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baumgartner and Noll, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Pisarev et al., 2009</xref>), we find that the late network contains a number of mutually repressive interactions (Eve/Runt, Eve/Slp, Ftz/Slp, Odd/Runt, Odd/Slp, and perhaps Odd/Prd). However, the early network does not appear to utilise these switch-like interactions, but is instead characterised by unidirectional repression (e.g. of <italic>ftz</italic> and <italic>odd</italic> by Eve and Hairy, or of <italic>runt</italic> by Odd). Interestingly, pair-rule gene expression during cellularisation has been observed to be unexpectedly dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Keränen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Surkova et al., 2008</xref>), something that is notable given the oscillatory expression of pair-rule gene orthologs in short germ arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Sarrazin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">El-Sherif et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brena and Akam, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Why do pair-rule genes show a late phase of expression?</title><p>We have shown that for the pair-rule genes, the transition to single-segment periodicity is mediated by substantial re-wiring of regulatory interactions. In addition, we have shown that this re-wiring is controlled by the same signal, Opa, that activates segment-polarity gene expression. We propose that Opa's effective role is to usher in a 'segment-polarity phase' of expression, in which both canonical segment-polarity factors, and erstwhile pair-rule factors, work together to define cell states. This hypothesis is consistent with the spatial patterns and regulatory logic of late pair-rule gene expression: most pair-rule genes become expressed in narrow segmental stripes, and partake in switch-like regulatory interactions consistent with segment-polarity roles. Furthermore, regulatory feedback from segment-polarity genes suggests the pair-rule genes become integrated into the segment-polarity network: for example, En protein is involved in patterning the late expression of <italic>eve, odd, runt</italic> and <italic>slp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Harding et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Mullen and DiNardo, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Klingler and Gergen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Fujioka et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>However, the hypothesis that pair-rule factors perform segment-polarity roles is at odds with that fact that their mutants generally do not exhibit segment-polarity defects. We argue that this discrepancy can be resolved by accounting for partial redundancy with paralogous factors. For example, <italic>slp</italic> has a closely linked paralog, <italic>slp2</italic>, expressed almost identically, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Grossniklaus et al., 1992</xref>), and simultaneous disruption of both genes is required in order to reveal that the Slp stripes are a critical component of the segment-polarity network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cadigan et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">1994b</xref>). <italic>prd</italic> and <italic>odd</italic> also have paralogs, expressed in persistent segmental stripes coincident with their respective phase 3 expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baumgartner et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Hart et al., 1996</xref>). The <italic>prd</italic> paralog, <italic>gsb</italic>, gives a segment-polarity phenotype if mutated, but Prd and Gsb are able to substitute for each other if expressed under the control of the other gene's regulatory region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Li and Noll, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">Xue and Noll, 1996</xref>), indicating that the same protein can fulfil both pair-rule and segment-polarity functions. Moreover, we have found that a deficiency removing both <italic>odd</italic> and its closely linked paralogs, <italic>sob</italic> and <italic>drm</italic>, gives a cuticle phenotype that shows segment-polarity defects corresponding to the locations of <italic>odd</italic> secondary stripes, in addition to the pair-rule defects characteristic of <italic>odd</italic> mutants (data not shown).</p><p>We envisage that ancestrally, the orthologs of <italic>prd/gsb</italic> and <italic>odd/sob/drm</italic> would have sequentially fulfilled both pair-rule and segment-polarity functions, employing different regulatory logic in each case. Later, these roles would have been divided between different paralogs, leaving the transient segmental patterns of <italic>prd</italic> and <italic>odd</italic> as evolutionary relics. Consistent with this hypothesis, the roles of <italic>prd</italic> and <italic>gsb</italic> seem to be fulfilled by a single co-ortholog, <italic>pairberry1</italic>, in grasshoppers, with a second gene, <italic>pairberry2,</italic> expressed redundantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Davis et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, of the four pair-rule factors expressed in segmental patterns after gastrulation (Runt, Odd, Prd, Slp), at least three appear to have segment-polarity functions, although they may perform these roles only transiently before handing over the job to their paralogs. (No function has as yet been assigned to late Runt expression.) Because Hairy expression fades away after phase 2, that leaves only the functions of the late, double-segmental expression patterns of Eve and Ftz to be accounted for. Both these factors partake in the segment-polarity network by repressing <italic>slp</italic> and <italic>wg</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Fujioka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Swantek and Gergen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Copeland et al., 1996</xref>). However, unlike canonical segment-polarity factors, their expression fades during germband extension. Functional equivalence with each other explains why, from a patterning perspective, they need not be expressed in every segment. Functional redundancy with En (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Fujioka et al., 2012</xref>) explains why they need not be persistently expressed (indeed, En is the factor responsible for switching off late <italic>eve</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Harding et al., 1986</xref>]). Given that <italic>eve</italic> shows a phase of single-segment periodicity in many pair-rule insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Patel et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Binner and Sander, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Rosenberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Mito et al., 2007</xref>), (although not in <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Nakao, 2010</xref>]), it will be interesting to investigate whether a loss of regular segmental <italic>eve</italic> expression in the lineage leading to <italic>Drosophila</italic> is associated with changes to the roles of Ftz (and/or its cofactor, Ftz-F1) in segment patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Heffer et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Is the role of Opa conserved?</title><p>In light of our data, it will be interesting to characterise the role of Opa in other arthropod model organisms. The best studied short germ insect is the beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, which also exhibits pair-rule patterning. An RNAi screen of pair-rule gene orthologs reported no segmentation phenotype for <italic>opa</italic> knock-down, and concluded that <italic>opa</italic> does not function as a pair-rule gene in <italic>Tribolium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Choe et al., 2006</xref>). However, the authors also state that <italic>opa</italic> knock-down caused high levels of lethality and most embryos did not complete development, indicating that this conclusion may be premature. In contrast to this study, iBeetle-Base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Dönitz et al., 2015</xref>) reports a segmentation phenotype for <italic>opa</italic> knock-down (TC number: TC010234; iBeetle number: iB_04791). The affected cuticles show a reduced number of segments including the loss of the mesothorax (T2). This could indicate a pair-rule phenotype in which the even-numbered parasegment boundaries are lost, similar to the situation in <italic>Drosophila.</italic> If true, this suggests that at least some aspects of the role of Opa are conserved between long germ and short germ segmentation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants and husbandry</title><p>Wild-type embryos were Oregon-R.

In this Appendix, we analyse the expression of the other six pair-rule genes before and after this transition, with particular focus on the inferred regulatory changes involved in mediating the altered expression patterns of <italic>odd, slp, runt</italic> and <italic>eve</italic>. Note that throughout what follows, italicised names (e.g. <italic>eve</italic>) are used to refer to genes and to the distributions of their transcript, whereas capitalised plain text (e.g. Eve) is used to refer to proteins and their distributions. Note also that primary pair-rule stripes shift anteriorly over the course of cellularisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Surkova et al., 2008</xref>), and protein distributions lag slightly behind transcript distributions due to time delays inherent in protein synthesis and decay. This means that slight gaps tend to be present between the anterior border of a stripe and the transcripts of its anterior repressor (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Appendix 1—figure 2C</xref>), whereas slight overlaps may be seen between the posterior border of a stripe and the transcripts of its posterior repressor (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Appendix 1—figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Appendix 1—figure 3C</xref>).</p><sec id="s30"><title><italic>odd-skipped</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Appendix 1—figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>)</title><p>During phase 2, the primary stripes of <italic>odd</italic> have anterior boundaries defined by repression by Eve, and posterior boundaries defined by repression by Hairy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Manoukian and Krause, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Jiménez et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Appendix 1—figure 1A,C</xref>). The primary stripes of <italic>odd</italic> narrow during phase 3, mainly from the posterior, and secondary stripes intercalate between them. It is not known whether all components of the single-segmental pattern observed at phase 3 are driven by a single enhancer, but we think it likely. The following analysis assumes that primary and secondary stripes of <italic>odd</italic> are governed by identical regulatory logic during phase 3.</p><p>The secondary stripes arise within cells expressing both Eve and Hairy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Appendix 1—figure 1B,D</xref>), indicating that repression of <italic>odd</italic> by these proteins is restricted to phase 2. A loss of repression by Hairy during phase 3 is also supported by increased overlaps between <italic>hairy</italic> and the <italic>odd</italic> primary stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Appendix 1—figure 1D</xref>). The posterior boundaries of the <italic>odd</italic> secondary stripes appear to be defined by repression by Runt. In wild-type embryos, these boundaries precisely abut the anterior boundaries of the <italic>runt</italic> primary stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Appendix 1—figure 1F</xref>), whereas in <italic>runt</italic> mutant embryos they expand posteriorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Jaynes and Fujioka, 2004</xref>). However, <italic>odd</italic> is evidently not repressed by Runt during phase 2, because the <italic>odd</italic> primary stripes overlap with the posterior of the <italic>runt</italic> stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Appendix 1—figure 1E</xref>). The anterior boundaries of the <italic>odd</italic> secondary stripes appear to be defined by repression from Prd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), consistent with the observation that these stripes expand anteriorly in <italic>prd</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Mullen and DiNardo, 1995</xref>). Since the <italic>odd</italic> primary stripes overlap with <italic>prd</italic> expression during phase 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), it is possible that repression of <italic>odd</italic> by Prd is restricted to phase 3. However, Prd protein appears relatively late during phase 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Pisarev et al., 2009</xref>), and Prd protein degradation is upregulated specifically in the region of the <italic>odd</italic> primary stripes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Raj et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that Prd would have little effect on <italic>odd</italic> expression during phase 2 either way.<fig-group><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18215.023</object-id><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of <italic>odd</italic> at phase 2 <italic>versus</italic> phase 3.</title><p>Relative expression of <italic>odd</italic> and other pair-rule genes (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold> – <italic>eve</italic>; <bold>C</bold>, <bold>D</bold> – <italic>hairy</italic>; <bold>E</bold>, <bold>F</bold> – <italic>runt</italic>; <bold>G</bold>, <bold>H</bold> - <italic>slp</italic>) is shown in late phase 2 embryos (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>C</bold>, <bold>E</bold>, <bold>G</bold>) and in early phase 3 embryos (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>D</bold>, <bold>F</bold>, <bold>H</bold>).

In contrast to the other pair-rule genes, <italic>slp</italic> stripes are static and stable, with dynamic pattern refinements restricted to the head region. The <italic>slp</italic> locus has a large, complex regulatory region, with many partially redundant enhancer elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Fujioka and Jaynes, 2012</xref>). A detailed study of two of these elements showed that the primary stripes are mediated by one element, while the secondary stripes require an additional enhancer that interacts non-additively with the first element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Prazak et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The primary stripes of <italic>slp</italic> are thought to be patterned by repression from Eve at their posteriors and repression by the combination of Runt and Ftz at their anteriors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Swantek and Gergen, 2004</xref>). There is plentiful evidence for repression of <italic>slp</italic> by Eve throughout segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Appendix 1—figure 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Fujioka et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Riechmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Jaynes and Fujioka, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Swantek and Gergen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Prazak et al., 2010</xref>). However, while the posterior boundaries of the Runt primary stripes do appear to define the anterior boundaries of the <italic>slp</italic> primary stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Appendix 1—figure 2C</xref>), we are not convinced that Runt and Ftz act combinatorially to repress <italic>slp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">Appendix 1—figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We find that in <italic>ftz</italic> mutant embryos, the <italic>slp</italic> primary stripes form fairly normally during phase 2, with their anterior boundaries still seemingly defined by Runt, rather than expanding anteriorly to overlap the (Eve-negative) posterior halves of the <italic>runt</italic> stripes. Ectopic <italic>slp</italic> expression does not appear until phase 3. This indicates that Runt is able to repress <italic>slp</italic> in the absence of Ftz, at least temporarily. We therefore propose that during phase 2, <italic>slp</italic> is repressed by both Eve and Runt, regardless of whether Ftz is present, and that the anterior boundaries of the <italic>slp</italic> primary stripes are initially patterned by Runt alone.</p><p>In wild-type embryos, the <italic>slp</italic> secondary stripes appear at phase 3, in the anterior halves of the <italic>runt</italic> stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Appendix 1—figure 2D</xref>). There are competing models for how they are regulated. One model proposes that they are activated by Runt, but repressed by the combination of Runt and Ftz, so that their anterior boundary is defined by Runt and their posterior boundary is defined by Ftz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Swantek and Gergen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Prazak et al., 2010</xref>).

Therefore, much of the experimental evidence cited in favour of each of these models does not really discriminate between them.</p><p>When we look carefully at the early expression of the <italic>slp</italic> secondary stripes, we occasionally find <italic>slp</italic> expression in a <italic>runt</italic>-negative cell (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Appendix 1—figure 2D</xref>), but we never observe cells expressing both <italic>eve</italic> and <italic>slp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Appendix 1—figure 2B</xref>, and data not shown). This indicates that Eve directly patterns the anterior boundaries of the <italic>slp</italic> secondary stripes, while the regulatory role of Runt is indirect. Consistent with this hypothesis, a reporter study found that Runt did not appear to directly regulate a <italic>slp</italic> enhancer that drives 14 stripes at phase 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Sen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Fujioka and Jaynes, 2012</xref>).</p><p>While <italic>ftz</italic> and <italic>odd</italic> are subject to similar regulation during phase 2 and consequently have similar expression domains, the slightly broader Ftz stripes appear to define the posterior boundary of <italic>slp</italic> secondary stripe expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Appendix 1—figure 2F</xref>). This does not rule out Odd as a repressor of <italic>slp</italic>, however.

There is good evidence for repression of <italic>runt</italic> by Hairy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Gergen and Butler, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Klingler and Gergen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Jiménez et al., 1996</xref>), and it is commonly thought that Hairy defines both the anterior and posterior boundaries of <italic>runt</italic> expression (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Edgar et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Schroeder et al., 2011</xref>). However, we find clear gaps between the posterior boundaries of <italic>runt</italic> expression and the anterior boundaries of <italic>hairy</italic> expression (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Appendix 1—figure 3A</xref>), indicating that some other pair-rule gene must be repressing <italic>runt</italic> from the posterior. We propose that the posterior boundaries of the <italic>runt</italic> primary stripes are defined by repression from Odd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Appendix 1—figure 3C</xref>). This hypothesis is strongly supported by the observations that the <italic>runt</italic> stripes widen slightly in <italic>odd</italic> mutant embryos and are directly repressed by ectopic Odd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Saulier-Le Dréan et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>During phase 3, new <italic>runt</italic> expression appears to the posterior of the primary stripes, and gradually intensifies to form the secondary stripes. At the same time, the primary stripes narrow from the posterior, producing a 'splitting' of the broadened <italic>runt</italic> domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Klingler and Gergen, 1993</xref>). The two sets of stripes are initially driven by different enhancers, although each of the two enhancers later drive 14 segmental stripes during germband extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Klingler et al., 1996</xref>). This indicates that the primary and secondary <italic>runt</italic> stripes are subject to different regulatory logic during phase 3.</p><p>During cellularisation, the anterior of each <italic>runt</italic> stripe overlaps with <italic>eve</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Appendix 1—figure 3E</xref>), and accordingly Eve does not appear to repress <italic>runt</italic> during this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Manoukian and Krause, 1992</xref>). However, Eve starts to repress <italic>runt</italic> at phase 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Manoukian and Krause, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Klingler and Gergen, 1993</xref>). Eve appears to act on both sets of <italic>runt</italic> stripes, defining the posterior boundaries of the secondary stripes as well as the anterior boundaries of the primary stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Appendix 1—figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>It has been hypothesised that the narrowing of the <italic>runt</italic> primary stripes is caused by direct repression by Ftz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Klingler and Gergen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Wolff et al., 1999</xref>). However, this is not supported by Ftz misexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Nasiadka and Krause, 1999</xref>). Indeed, we find that the posteriors of the <italic>runt</italic> primary stripes continue to overlap with the anteriors of the <italic>ftz</italic> stripes for a considerable period during phase 3, ruling out direct repression by Ftz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Appendix 1—figure 3H</xref>). Instead, the posteriors of the <italic>runt</italic> primary stripes appear to be repressed by the even-numbered En stripes, which are activated by Ftz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Klingler and Gergen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">DiNardo and O'Farrell, 1987</xref>). Before the appearance of En protein, the posterior boundaries continue to be defined by repression from Odd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Appendix 1—figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>We have not investigated whether Hairy continues to repress the regulatory element driving the <italic>runt</italic> primary stripes during phase 3, although it is possible it does not. However, it is clear that Hairy does not repress the element driving the <italic>runt</italic> secondary stripes, because they are located within domains of <italic>hairy</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Appendix 1—figure 3B</xref>). The secondary stripes also overlap with Odd expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Appendix 1—figure 3D</xref>), indicating that, unlike the primary stripes, they are not sensitive to repression by Odd.</p><p>It is not clear what defines the anterior boundaries of the <italic>runt</italic> secondary stripes. The locations of these stripes correlate very closely with those of the <italic>slp</italic> primary stripes, in both wild-type and <italic>ftz</italic> mutant embryos (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">Appendix 1—figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, because <italic>runt</italic> expression is not noticeably affected in <italic>slp</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Klingler and Gergen, 1993</xref>), this must result from shared regulation rather than a patterning role for Slp itself. Indeed, Eve defines the posterior boundaries of both the <italic>slp</italic> primary stripes and the <italic>runt</italic> secondary stripes (see above). The anterior boundaries of the <italic>slp</italic> primary stripes are defined by repression by the Runt primary stripes (see above), raising the possibility that the <italic>runt</italic> secondary stripes are regulated in the same way, at least initially. If true, this would be the first example of direct autorepression by a pair-rule gene during segmentation.</p><p>Finally, Prd is required for the expression of the secondary stripes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Klingler and Gergen, 1993</xref>). Prd appears to provide general activatory input to the element driving the stripes, but is unlikely to convey specific positional information, because the expression boundaries of the Prd stripes do not correspond to those of the <italic>runt</italic> secondary stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Prd is also unlikely to provide temporal information to the element: the expression of the <italic>runt</italic> secondary stripes is delayed relative to the appearance of Prd protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Pisarev et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that Prd alone is not sufficient for their activation.</p><p>In summary, there is one important change to the regulation of the <italic>runt</italic> zebra element at phase 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Appendix 1—figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Repression by Eve is gained, and may potentially replace repression by Hairy. In addition, a separate element driving the secondary stripes begins to be expressed at phase 3. This element appears to be repressed by Eve and perhaps Runt, and activated by Prd.</p></sec><sec id="s33"><title><italic>even-skipped</italic></title><p><italic>eve</italic> does not possess a zebra element active during phase 2, and therefore its regulation does not come under control of the pair-rule network until its 'late' element turns on at phase 3. This element generates strong expression in the anterior halves of the pre-existing early <italic>eve</italic> stripes. The posterior boundaries of the late stripes are temporarily defined by repression by Runt, while the anterior boundaries are defined by repression by Slp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Appendix 1—figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Appendix 1—figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Jaynes and Fujioka, 2004</xref>). Odd also represses late <italic>eve</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Saulier-Le Dréan et al., 1998</xref>), and will temporarily compensate for the lack of repression by Slp in <italic>slp</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Jaynes and Fujioka, 2004</xref>). The late <italic>eve</italic> stripes do not persist long after gastrulation, largely owing to the appearance of En protein, another repressor of <italic>eve</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Harding et al., 1986</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the strong 'major' stripes at the anteriors of the odd-numbered parasegments, faint 'minor' stripes of <italic>eve</italic> expression appear during gastrulation in the anteriors of the even-numbered parasegments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Macdonald et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Frasch et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These stripes are also driven by the late element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Fujioka et al., 1995</xref>), and are therefore likely to share the same regulatory logic as the major stripes. They do not appear to play any role in patterning, since deletions of the <italic>eve</italic> late element do not affect the patterning of the even-numbered parasegment boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Fujioka et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Fujioka et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s34"><title>Other pair-rule genes</title><p>In contrast to the other pair-rule genes, <italic>hairy</italic> and <italic>ftz</italic> do not show signs of significantly altered spatial regulation at gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

In wild-type embryos, offsets are observed from late cellularisation onwards for all stripes, including stripe 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Appendix 2—figure 1C,E</xref>), indicating that <italic>ftz</italic> and <italic>odd</italic> must be differentially regulated by pair-rule proteins during these later stages. In <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos, we find that the relative phasing of <italic>ftz</italic> and <italic>odd</italic> appears normal at mid-cellularisation, with offsets present for most stripes, but absent for stripe 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Appendix 2—figure 1B</xref>), as in wild-type. By late-cellularisation, however, the anterior boundaries of the two sets of stripes tend to coincide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Appendix 2—figure 1D</xref>). We therefore do not think that the early Eve stripes can be directly patterning the offsets, because early <italic>eve</italic> expression is normal in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos. Late <italic>eve</italic> expression is lost in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos (see above), but this phase of expression cannot be regulating the pattern either, because <italic>eve</italic> rescue constructs lacking the <italic>eve</italic> late element still produce the offsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Fujioka et al., 1995</xref>). Therefore, the maintenance of offsets in stripes 1–3 and 5–7, and the establishment of the offset in stripe 4, must be patterned by a pair-rule protein other than Eve, by way of an Opa-dependent regulatory interaction.</p><p>Coincident anterior boundaries of <italic>ftz</italic> and <italic>odd</italic> could be produced by a posterior retraction of <italic>ftz</italic> expression, or alternatively by an anterior expansion of <italic>odd</italic> expression. We interpret the patterns in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos as representing the latter scenario. The <italic>odd</italic> stripes still share posterior boundaries with the <italic>ftz</italic> stripes, but appear wider than in wild-type embryos, consistent with de-repression at the anterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Appendix 2—figure 1C,D</xref>). Furthermore, when we compare phasings of the <italic>odd</italic> stripes with those of <italic>eve</italic>, the domains of <italic>odd</italic> expression appear significantly anteriorly expanded in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s1">Appendix 2—figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>)</p><p>Following from this reasoning, it appears that the <italic>ftz/odd</italic> offsets observed at late cellularisation in wild-type embryos must be caused by anterior repression of <italic>odd</italic> (and not <italic>ftz</italic>) by an appropriately-located pair-rule protein in combination with Opa. We suggest that this protein is Runt. Above, we hypothesised that in wild-type embryos, Runt starts to repress <italic>odd</italic> at phase 3 (or more accurately, given the expression data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>, at late phase 2), thus defining the anterior boundaries of the <italic>odd</italic> primary stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Appendix 1—figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also identified Opa as being required for the regulatory changes observed at phase 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>This new model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s2">Appendix 2—figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) explains the observations from <italic>opa</italic> mutants. In the absence of Opa activity, Runt fails to repress <italic>odd</italic>, and the anterior boundaries of <italic>odd</italic> expression presumably continue to be defined by the posterior boundaries of the Eve stripes, which also define the anterior boundaries of the <italic>ftz</italic> stripes. This results in the loss of the <italic>ftz/odd</italic> offsets that pattern even-numbered <italic>en</italic> stripes in wild-type.</p></sec><sec id="s37"><title>Opa spatially patterns odd stripe 7</title><p>We noticed that in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos, <italic>odd</italic> stripe 7 appears to expand both anteriorly and ventrally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Appendix 2—figure 2C,H</xref>). <italic>odd</italic> stripe 7 is both spatially and temporally unusual: it is not expressed dorsally or ventrally, and it first appears considerably after the other six <italic>odd</italic> stripes have been established.

When <italic>odd</italic> stripe 7 first appears, its anterior boundary correlates well with the posterior boundary of <italic>eve</italic> expression, and is likely be patterned by repression by Eve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15s2">Appendix 2—figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The posterior boundary of <italic>eve</italic> stripe 7 then markedly shifts anteriorly, while <italic>odd</italic> stripe 7 remains static, suggesting that its anterior boundary is maintained by repression from some other protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15s2">Appendix 2—figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). However, the seventh stripe of <italic>runt</italic> is abnormally broad and completely encompasses the domain of <italic>odd</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15s2">Appendix 2—figure 2—figure supplement 2B,D</xref>). Consequently, Runt cannot be providing spatial information to <italic>odd</italic> in this region of the embryo. It is therefore not clear which protein spatially delimits the anterior boundary of <italic>odd</italic> stripe 7 at gastrulation.</p><p>We suggest that it is actually Opa that patterns the anterior boundary of <italic>odd</italic> stripe 7. <italic>odd</italic> is repressed by the combination of Runt and Opa, but not by either gene alone. Theoretically, it makes no difference which protein provides the spatial information to pattern an expression domain of <italic>odd,</italic> as long as the repressive activity of the co-expressed proteins is appropriately localised. For <italic>odd</italic> stripes 2–6, Opa is expressed ubiquitously, while Runt is patterned. For <italic>odd</italic> stripe 7, we find that the position of its anterior boundary is prefigured by the posterior boundary of the broad <italic>opa</italic> expression domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–E</xref>). Therefore, in the posterior of the embryo the situation seems to be the other way around: Runt is expressed ubiquitously, while Opa provides the necessary spatial information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15s3">Appendix 2—figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Because <italic>odd</italic> stripe 7 is so delayed relative to the other primary pair-rule stripes, there is only a short time between its appearance and the first signs of Opa regulatory activity in the embryo. Therefore, while the early expression of <italic>odd</italic> stripe 7 is likely to be patterned by Eve, repression by Runt + Opa would soon take over, explaining why <italic>odd</italic> stripe 7 remains static rather than shifting anteriorly in concert with <italic>eve</italic>. Accordingly, we observe that in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos, where the <italic>odd</italic> anterior boundaries are presumably defined by Eve at all times, <italic>odd</italic> stripe 7 expands both anteriorly and ventrally over time, correlating well with the shifting posterior boundary of <italic>eve</italic> stripe 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Appendix 2—figure 2</xref>). Indeed, in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos the anterior boundary of <italic>odd</italic> 7 is located at a similar position to the anterior boundary of <italic>prd</italic> stripe 8 (also likely to be defined by repression by Eve), whereas in wild-type it is offset from it posteriorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Appendix 2—figure 2E,J</xref>).</p><p>The distinctive shape of <italic>odd</italic> stripe 7 can therefore be explained by the curvature of the <italic>opa</italic> posterior boundary. Thus, in the posterior of the embryo, Opa conveys both temporal and spatial information to the segmentation process.</p></sec></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="article-commentary" id="SA1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18215.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Wittkopp</surname><given-names>Patricia J</given-names></name><role>Reviewing editor</role><aff id="aff3"><institution>University of Michigan</institution>, <country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses.

For long time it has been recognized that compared to earlier steps of the segmentation cascade this last step is particularly complex and in essential ways not understood. The paper by Clark and Akam has undertaken a heroic effort by re-addressing this fundamental question. The authors first characterize the transition through detailed description of the dynamic changes in gene expression at the relevant stages (late blastoderm to early germ band extension). The phenomenological part of the paper suggests a coordinated stage-specific rewiring of the pair-rule gene network which cannot be explained solely on the basis hierarchical feed-forward actions of the pair-rule genes, but rather implies an independent element of temporal control. This element is provided by Odd-paired (Opa), the only pair-rule gene with non-striped largely uniform expression, as the authors demonstrate by analyzing the expression changes of striped pair-rule genes in an <italic>opa</italic> mutant background. Opa had been largely neglected in former studies labeling it as a permissive factor without instructive function. By showing that <italic>opa</italic> is required for a temporal switch in regulatory logic the authors place <italic>opa</italic> at the center stage and highlight the importance of temporal control for complex spatial patterning.</p><p>The reviewers agree that this work was very nicely done and a major contribution to the field. It provides a new concept that will be important for modelers who will want to describe fly patterning in its entirety and build on it as the paradigm of a dynamic gene network.

We have also expanded upon the functional roles of the late stripes in the Discussion.</p><p>The role of Opa in mediating stripe doubling does indeed explain the pair-rule phenotype, because the resulting segmental stripes perform segment-polarity functions during germband extension. However, the segmental patterns of the pair-rule genes are not involved in regulating the initial expression of the segment-polarity genes at the end of cellularisation, hence the confusion.</p><p>We did not intend to give the impression that the <italic>opa</italic> pair-rule phenotype is mediated by its effects on the <italic>eve</italic> late element. The <italic>eve</italic> late element plays a role in stabilising the odd-numbered parasegment boundaries, preventing <italic>slp</italic> and <italic>wg</italic> expression from invading the odd-numbered <italic>en</italic> stripes. Flies lacking the <italic>eve</italic> late element may show narrowing or loss of odd-numbered <italic>en</italic> stripes, but a proportion of individuals survive to adulthood, indicating that late Eve expression is not strictly required for segmentation (Fujioka et al., 2002). It is certainly possible that loss of late Eve expression results in similar phenotypic effects in <italic>opa</italic> mutant embryos, but such effects would be subtle relative to the other expression changes seen in these embryos, and we have not looked for them specifically.</p><p>As to how Opa controls the <italic>eve</italic> late element, phenomenologically it seems that Opa provides general activation (perhaps cooperatively with Prd), while Slp, Runt, Odd and En are spatially patterned repressors that override this activation. Concrete mechanistic details will require study of the enhancer element itself.</p><p> <italic>4) Please reduce some of the redundancy within the Discussion section and between the Discussion and Results sections.</italic></p><p>We have streamlined the Results and Discussion by merging sections that covered similar ground, and excising repetitive material.
