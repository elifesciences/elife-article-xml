At the organismal level, growth is coupled with morphogenesis and development, and can also be separated into stages with physical constraints (e.g. molting events). At the organ level, growth is coupled with body growth to ensure relative scaling for proper form and function. At the cellular level, growth is interpreted as the decision to divide or not and to increase in size or not. These three levels of growth are integrated with one another to ensure that cells make appropriate growth choices based on feedback from the other two levels.</p><p>Growth of the body and its organs are controlled in two ways. The rate of growth over time is internally regulated with an upper limit set independent of such environmental factors as nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conlon and Raff, 1999</xref>). The size setpoint when growth ceases is also internally controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leevers and McNeill, 2005</xref>). Typically, the setpoint is reached when the animal transitions to adulthood. The two control processes are linked with one another. For example, <italic>Drosophila</italic> that are deficient in insulin signaling grow slowly and their final size setpoint is smaller than normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rulifson et al., 2002</xref>). However, sometimes the growth-arrest process compensates for an abnormal growth rate to generate a normal size setpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leevers and McNeill, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Penzo-Méndez and Stanger, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The wing of <italic>Drosophila</italic> is a well-established model system to study organ growth control. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, the anlage fated to form the adult wing blade is composed of an epithelial domain embedded within a larger epithelial sheet named the wing imaginal disc or wing disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The anlage, called the wing pouch, is surrounded by wing disc cells that will form the wing hinge and notum, which is the dorsal thorax. Two wing discs reside within the body cavity of a larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). They continuously grow as the larva grows and undergoes three successive molts, from first to second to third instar. Wing discs grow exponentially by asynchronous cell division until the mid-third larval stage, when growth becomes linear-like, and finally stops when the late third instar larva undergoes its transition to the pupal stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fain and Stevens, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Graves and Schubiger, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bryant and Levinson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Neto-Silva et al., 2009</xref>). During pupation, each wing pouch develops into a single adult wing blade.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Allometric growth of the third instar wing pouch in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting relative size of the wing imaginal discs inside a larva starting from 3 days after egg laying (AEL).

Hormones such as insulin-like peptides and ecdysone coordinate wing disc growth with environmental inputs such as nutrition and molting events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colombani et al., 2005</xref>). Paracrine growth factors are secreted from a subset of wing disc cells and are transported through the disc tissue to stimulate cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baena-Lopez et al., 2012</xref>). The BMP morphogen Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Wnt morphogen Wingless (Wg) are two such growth factors.</p><p>Another signal transduction pathway – the Hippo pathway – also operates to regulate growth of the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boggiano and Fehon, 2012</xref>). The Hippo pathway is controlled by two different signals, both of which are locally transmitted. Mechanical stress from local tissue compression caused by differential growth alters the cytoskeletal tension in wing disc cells, which in turn regulates the Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Legoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rauskolb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pan et al., 2016</xref>). Increased tension leads to upregulation of the Yorkie (Yki) transcription factor and growth promotion. A second signal that regulates the Hippo pathway is mediated by two atypical cadherin molecules, Fat and Dachsous (Ds), which are growth inhibitory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pan, 2010</xref>). The two proteins bind to one another on opposing cell membranes at the adherens junction, and binding is modulated by the Golgi kinase Four-jointed (Fj) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ishikawa et al., 2008</xref>). Ds is thought to be a ligand for Fat in many circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matakatsu and Blair, 2004</xref>). However, Ds has receptor-like properties as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matakatsu and Blair, 2006</xref>). When Fat is activated, it induces the destruction of an unconventional myosin called Dachs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rogulja et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). This inhibits Yki from transcribing growth-promoting genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vrabioiu and Struhl, 2015</xref>). A prevailing model for how Ds modulates Fat signaling is not via the absolute concentration of Ds but by the steepness of its local concentration gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pan, 2010</xref>). Ds is expressed across the wing pouch in a graded fashion, and if the gradient is steep, growth is stimulated whereas if the gradient is shallow, growth is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rogulja et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Willecke et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Fat and Ds are thought to regulate growth of the wing pouch by an additional mechanism, termed the feed-forward mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zecca and Struhl, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zecca and Struhl, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zecca and Struhl, 2021</xref>). The transcription factor Vestigial (Vg) is expressed in wing pouch cells, where it promotes their growth and survival. Vg also regulates expression of Fj and Ds, creating a boundary of expression of these proteins at the border between the wing pouch and hinge/notum. At the border, wing pouch cells signal to neighboring hinge/notum cells via Fat / Ds interactions. Yki is activated in receiving cells and it stimulates these cells to express Vg. Since Vg regulates Ds and Fj, a feed-forward loop is created to reiteratively expand the wing pouch domain by recruitment rather than proliferation. However, it remains unclear what fraction of wing pouch growth is due to this mechanism.</p><p>The various molecular models for wing growth control described above have been developed in detail. However, what is unresolved are explanations for how these molecular mechanisms regulate the macroscopic features of growth. How do they regulate the relative scaling of the wing to the body as both are growing in size. How do the different molecular mechanisms precisely regulate the two key growth control processes: growth rate and growth arrest.</p><p>Here, we focus on Ds-Fat signaling and address these questions with the aim of connecting the molecular perspective of growth control to a more macroscopic perspective. We find that during the mid-to-late third instar stage, Ds-Fat signaling tunes a feature of cell proliferation that controls the rate of wing pouch growth during this stage. The duration of the cell cycle increases in direct proportion to the size of the wing pouch, which leads to the observed linear-like growth of the wing pouch. Ds-Fat signaling enhances the rate at which the cell cycle lengthens with wing size, thus diminishing the rate of wing growth. We show that this results in a complex but stereotyped relative scaling of wing growth with body growth during the mid-to-late third instar stage. Finally, we examine the dynamics of Fat and Ds protein distribution in the wing pouch, observing graded distributions that change during growth. However, the significance of these dynamics is unclear since perturbations in expression have negligible impact on wing growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Quantitative properties of <italic>Drosophila</italic> third instar larval wing growth</title><p>Organ growth in animals is coupled to body growth in complex ways that are specific for both the organ and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huxley and Teissier, 1936</xref>). We first sought to determine the relationship between growth of the wing and body in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Although previous work has studied this relationship, none have provided a quantitative description of it. In this study, we focused on growth during the 36 hr-long early-to-late third instar stage since this stage experiences linear-like growth, and its termination coincides with growth cessation.</p><p>We measured body size by both wet weight and volume. As expected, measurements of body weight and body volume showed a strong correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To measure wing pouch volume, we generated a 3D stack of confocal microscopic sections of the wing disc, and we used morphological landmarks (tissue folds) to demarcate the border separating the wing pouch from the surrounding notum-hinge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The landmark method gave wing pouch measurements that were within 95.5% of measurements made by <italic>vg</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Beginning at 3.0 days after egg laying (AEL), we measured third instar larval body weight every 12 hr until the larva-pupa transition. Larval body weight increased linearly from 3.0 to 4.0 days AEL, followed by a 12 hr period of slower growth, and thereafter weight remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The time point at which larvae stopped growing (4.5 days AEL) coincided with the time at which they stopped feeding and underwent a 12 hr non-feeding stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Slaidina et al., 2009</xref>). We also monitored weight as larvae underwent their transition into pupae. Weight remained constant during the one-hr-long white pre-pupal (WPP) stage and also one hr later (WPP + 1 stage; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>We measured wing disc growth for 36 hr during the early-to-late third instar stage. Wing pouch volume appeared to increase linearly over time and continued to grow during the non-feeding larval stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Growth of the wing pouch ceased at the WPP stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). End-of-growth of the wing pouch was confirmed by phospho-histone H3 (PHH3) staining, which marks mitotic cells. At the third instar larval stage, dividing cells were observed throughout the wing pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A and B</xref>), whereas at the WPP stage, dividing cells were only found in a narrow zone where sensory organ precursor cells undergo two divisions to generate future sensory organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nolo et al., 2000</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C and D</xref>).</p><p>We also measured growth of the hinge/notum domain of the wing disc during the early-to-late third instar. A similar linear-like growth trajectory was observed for the notum-hinge as for the wing pouch, although the hinge/notum stopped growing during the non-feeding stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A and B</xref>). Overall, our volumetric measurements are consistent with earlier studies that found wing disc growth is linear-like, as measured by cell number, during the mid-to-late third instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fain and Stevens, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Graves and Schubiger, 1982</xref>).</p><p>The scaling of organ growth relative to body growth during development is known as <italic>ontogenetic allometry</italic>. For most animal species, allometric growth of organs follows a power law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huxley and Teissier, 1936</xref>), such that logarithmic transformation of the organ and body size measurements fits a linear relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). When the organ grows at the same rate as the body, it exhibits isometric growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huxley and Teissier, 1936</xref>). When the organ grows at a faster or slower rate than the body, it has positive or negative allometric growth, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Allometric organ growth in holometabolous insects such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> presents a special situation arising from the fact that many adult organs derive from imaginal discs, which are non-functional in larvae. For this reason, there are fewer constraints on relative scaling, and allometric growth of imaginal discs are potentially freer to deviate from simple scaling laws. For example, in the silkworm, its wing disc grows linearly with its body while the larva feeds, but then continues its linear growth after larvae have ceased feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Williams, 1980</xref>). Thus, its allometric growth has two phases: the first is isometric and the second is positively allometric.</p><p>Since ontogenetic allometric growth of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc has not been studied, we plotted wet-weight body measurements versus wing pouch volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). As with silkworms, allometric growth of the wing pouch had two phases, both of which showed positive allometry. The inflection point was the time when larvae ceased feeding. Allometric growth of the notum-hinge also exhibited two phases, although growth in the second phase was more limited than that observed for the wing pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref>). Therefore, allometric growth control of the wing imaginal disc appears to be composed of multiple mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Global gradients of Fat and Ds in the growing wing pouch</title><p>One mechanism of wing growth control is through the atypical cadherin proteins Fat and Ds.

To test this, we used quantitative confocal microscopy to measure endogenous Ds protein tagged with GFP at its carboxy-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Wing discs were co-stained with antibodies directed against Wg and Engrailed (En) proteins, which mark the wing pouch midlines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Focusing on the mid-to-late third instar stage, we measured Ds-GFP levels along these two midlines to gain a Cartesian perspective of the wing pouch expression pattern. Image processing via surface detection enabled us to specifically measure Ds-GFP present in the wing pouch (disc proper) without bleed-through from Ds-GFP in the overlying peripodial membrane or signal distortion due to tissue curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>There was a graded distribution of Ds-GFP along both anterior-posterior (AP) and dorsal-ventral (DV) axes of the wing pouch. Ds was high near the pouch border and low at the center of the pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). The gradient was asymmetric along the AP axis, being lower along the anterior pouch border than posterior border. As the pouch grew larger, the Ds gradient appeared to become progressively shallower. When we normalized all of the Ds-GFP profiles to their corresponding pouch sizes, the profiles along the AP axis collapsed together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, along the DV axis the normalized profiles remained distinct because both maximum and minimum limits of Ds-GFP progressively diminished as the wing pouch grew (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>We next turned to quantitative analysis of Fat protein expression. Fat was thought to be uniformly expressed in the wing pouch, although it had also been described as enriched along the DV midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garoia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mao et al., 2009</xref>). We measured endogenous Fat protein tagged at its carboxy-terminus with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>). Surprisingly, Fat-GFP had a graded distribution along both the AP and DV axes of the wing pouch; low near the pouch border and high at the center of the wing pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>). The gradient profile was opposite to the one we observed for Ds-GFP. As the pouch grew in size, the Fat gradient appeared to grow shallower, and it became flat along the AP axis at the WPP stage. When we normalized all the Fat-GFP profiles to their corresponding pouch sizes, the profiles did not collapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>). The minimum limit of Fat-GFP was conserved but the maximum limit of Fat-GFP progressively diminished as the wing pouch grew.</p><p>The graded distribution of Fat protein was surprising since it was reported that <italic>fat</italic> gene transcription is uniform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garoia et al., 2000</xref>), which we confirmed by smFISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, we considered the possibility that the gradient is generated by a post-transcriptional mechanism. To test the idea, we expressed Fat under the control of an UAS promoter. Transcription was activated by <italic>da-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), which is uniformly expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilbert et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>da-Gal4</italic> also activated transcription of UAS-Bazooka-mCherry as a control. Bazooka-mCherry protein distribution was uniform along the AP axis, reflecting its faithful expression downstream of <italic>da-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). However, Fat protein was graded in a similar pattern to endogenous Fat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Thus, the Fat gradient is generated by a post-transcriptional mechanism.</p><p>The kinase Fj is known to target Fat protein within cells and so it was possible that the Fat protein gradient was generated by Fj. However, the distribution of Fat was unchanged in a <italic>fj</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Additionally, Ds levels were unchanged in the <italic>fj</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>), and there was no difference in wing pouch volume in <italic>fj</italic> mutants compared to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E</xref>).</p><p>Ds is known to physically interact with Fat protein through their extracellular and intracellular domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hale et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fulford et al., 2023</xref>). These heterophilic interactions affect Fat protein levels within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2003</xref>). To test the effect of Ds on formation of the Fat gradient, we examined Fat-GFP distribution in the wing pouch of a <italic>ds</italic> mutant. The level of Fat-GFP at the wing pouch center was identical to wildtype but the level of Fat-GFP near the pouch border was abnormally high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). Furthermore, we did not observe the flattened Fat-GFP profile at the WPP stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Instead, the Fat-GFP profile remained weakly graded at the WPP stage and was flattened somewhat more by the WPP + 1 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>These observations conflict with a previous study showing that junctional stability of Fat within wing disc cells is reduced in a <italic>ds</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hale et al., 2015</xref>).

Since the wing pouch can be approximated as an ellipse, the scaling we measured was possibly one related to pouch area. However, the wing pouch is a 3D structure and so Ds gradient scaling might be coupled to wing volume rather than area. To test this idea, we altered the dimensions of the wing pouch without changing its volume. Perlecan is a basement membrane proteoglycan required for extracellular matrix functionality across many tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gubbiotti et al., 2017</xref>). Knockdown of perlecan expression by RNAi causes wing disc cells to become thinner and more elongated due to the altered extracellular matrix in the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kirkland et al., 2020</xref>). We used a Gal4 driver under the control of the <italic>actin5C</italic> promoter (<italic>actin5C-Gal4</italic>) to knock down <italic>trol</italic> gene expression via UAS-RNAi. The <italic>trol</italic> gene encodes perlecan. We measured the dimensions of the wing pouch at the WPP stage and observed that <italic>actin5C&gt;trol</italic>(RNAi) caused a reduction in the area of the wing pouch and an increase in the thickness of the wing pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). The overall change in pouch dimensions had no effect on wing pouch volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We then measured the Ds-GFP profile at WPP stage and found <italic>actin5C&gt;trol</italic>(RNAi) had no effect on the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, Ds appears to scale with the volume and not the area of the wing pouch.

In summary, the Ds gradient appears to directly scale to wing pouch volume as the pouch grows in size. Fat gradient flattening also appears to be coupled to pouch volume rather than cell number or pouch area.

Correcting for background fluorescence, we estimated that less than 5% of Fat-GFP remained after RNAi treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Knockdown of Fat-GFP had a weak effect during mid third instar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), but the wing pouch was 15% larger than normal by the WPP stage, and 42% larger than normal by the WPP + 1 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2G</xref>).

This allowed us to measure growth effects by comparing the affected D compartment to the unaffected ventral (V) compartment, serving as an internal control. As expected, RNAi resulted in undetectable Ds protein in the D compartment, though it was detected in the V compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Overall wing pouch size was unaffected by <italic>ap &gt;ds</italic>(RNAi) knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) since there are mechanisms in which the compartments sense overall pouch size, resulting in undergrowth of one compartment when there is overgrowth in the other compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diaz-Benjumea and Cohen, 1993</xref>).

To monitor cell proliferation, we developed a method to infer the average cell cycle time from fixed and stained wing discs. Discs were stained with anti-PHH3, which exclusively marks cells in M phase of the cell cycle. During the third instar larval stage, sporadic PHH3-positive cells are uniformly distributed throughout the wing pouch, as expected for uniform asynchronous proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A and B</xref>). Using manual and computational segmentation of the images, we identified and counted the number of wing cells in M phase and also counted the total number of wing cells.

We found the average time for third instar larval wing pouch cells to transit M phase to be 20.5 min or 0.34 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is highly similar to previous measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>).

We compared model simulations to our measured volumes of the wing pouch over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Strikingly, the model predictions were very close to the observed pouch growth for wildtype wings and for wings in which either Fat or Ds were knocked down by RNAi. This agreement between quantitative model predictions and experiment indicates that during the mid-to-late third instar, cell cycle control primarily accounts for wing pouch growth, and the effects of Fat/Ds on wing pouch growth are primarily exerted by their regulation of cell cycle dynamics.</p><p>In summary, during the third instar, Fat and Ds regulate a mechanism that couples the duration of the cell cycle to overall wing pouch size. They are not essential for the coupling mechanism itself but rather they tune the mechanism so as to ensure the growth rate of the wing is attenuated relative to the body. This coordinates the relative scaling of the wing to the final body size.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The gradients of Fat and Ds protein have little effect on wing pouch growth</title><p>Fat and Ds regulate the mechanism by which the cell cycle progressively lengthens as wing size increases, ensuring a proper allometric growth relationship between wing and body. As the wing grows in size, the complementary gradients of Fat and Ds protein across the wing pouch progressively diminish in steepness. These observations suggest a hypothesis that connects the two; namely, wing growth progressively slows because Fat/Ds expression gradients shallow.</p><p>To test the hypothesis, we first altered the Ds gradient.

This drastically altered the Ds protein gradient (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The altered Ds gradient caused a change in the Fat gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The gradient peak became skewed to the anterior, and the gradient did not flatten at the WPP stage. We then measured larval and wing pouch growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>). The growth curve of the third instar wing pouch was indistinguishable from wildtype, and wing growth ceased normally at the WPP stage of the larva-pupa transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). This result suggests that drastically altering the Ds gradient does not impact wing growth.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The endogenous graded distributions of Fat and Ds are not essential for controlling growth rate of the third instar wing pouch.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the <italic>nub-Gal4</italic> driver expressing <italic>ds</italic> under the UAS promoter.

This was done by overexpressing Ds using a Trojan-Gal4 driver. Trojan-Gal4 transgenes are constructed with a splice acceptor sequence followed by the T2A peptide, the Gal4 open-reading frame, and a stop codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diao et al., 2015</xref>). When the transgene is inserted into the intron of an endogenous gene, it simultaneously inactivates the endogenous open reading frame and hijacks the gene to produce Gal4. When such a Trojan-Gal4 construct drives a UAS version of the disrupted gene, it amplifies expression levels while retaining endogenous transcriptional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). We crossed a line with Trojan-Gal4 inserted into the <italic>ds</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2018</xref>) to a <italic>UAS-ds</italic> line. Ds expression in the wing pouch was strongly amplified while its gradient pattern was preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In such <italic>ds &gt;Ds</italic> wing pouches, the Fat protein gradient resembled wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). Interestingly, the wing pouch was approximately 12% larger than wildtype at the WPP stage, as well as in the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). We also measured the scaling coefficient between cell cycle time and wing pouch volume for <italic>ds &gt;Ds</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Although the scaling coefficient was slightly smaller than wildtype, it was not significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>; p=0.108). Thus, graded overexpression of Ds only weakly affects growth. Overall, cells appear to be relatively insensitive to the levels and pattern of Ds expression in terms of their growth.</p><p>Alternatively, it was possible that growth is controlled by the flattening of the Fat gradient in the wing pouch, since flattening normally occurs at the WPP stage when growth stops. To test this idea, we expressed HA-tagged Fat using the <italic>nub-Gal4</italic> driver without eliminating endogenous Fat-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We monitored both transgenic and endogenous sources of Fat protein, and found both were distributed across the wing pouch in a gradient that was highest at the pouch center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H, I</xref>). Strikingly, both transgenic and endogenous Fat gradients did not diminish in magnitude as larvae approached pupariation. Moreover, the gradients did not flatten at the WPP stage but only did so at the later WPP +1 stage. We then examined the growth properties in <italic>nub &gt;fat</italic> HA animals. The relationship between the cell cycle time in the <italic>nub &gt;fat</italic> HA wing pouch and wing pouch size was indistinguishable from wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). This was consistent with the observation that final wing pouch size in <italic>nub &gt;fat</italic> HA animals was normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In summary, Fat and Ds gradient dynamics do not appear to play a significant role in wing growth control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Growth control of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing utilizes numerous mechanisms, ranging from systemic mechanisms involving insulin-like peptides and ecdysone secreted from other tissues, to autonomous mechanisms involving paracrine growth factors (Dpp and Wg), Hippo signaling, and cadherin molecules such as Fat and Ds. Here, we have focused on the macroscopic features of Fat and Ds that function in wing growth control during the mid-to-late third instar stage. Fat and Ds attenuate the rate of third instar wing growth so that it properly scales with body growth via a complex allosteric relationship. They do so by tuning the rate at which the cell cycle progressively lengthens in a linear fashion as the third instar wing grows in size. This rate of lengthening is enhanced by the actions of Fat and Ds.</p><p>It has been long known that the cell cycle in the wing disc slows down, with a cell doubling time of 6 hr during the second instar increasing to 30 hr by the end of third instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fain and Stevens, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bryant and Levinson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bittig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martín et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>). A link has been found between doubling time of wing disc cells and the morphogen Dpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>). Dpp is continually synthesized in a stripe of cells at the AP midline of the wing disc and is transported to form a stably graded distribution of protein that is bilaterally symmetric around the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Teleman and Cohen, 2000</xref>). The gradient precisely scales to remain proportional to the size of the growing disc by a mechanism involving the extracellular protein Pentagone and tissue-scale transport of recycled Dpp after endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Zvi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hamaratoglu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wartlick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Romanova-Michaelides et al., 2022</xref>). As the gradient scales with the wing, the local concentration of Dpp each wing cell experiences continuously increases over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The doubling time of wing disc cells was found to strongly correlate with this temporal increase in Dpp concentration, such that an average cell divides when Dpp increases by 40% relative to its level at the beginning of the division cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>). The correlation was observed throughout larval development, indicating that the progressive lengthening of the cell cycle may be caused by a slowing rate of increase in local Dpp concentration over time.</p><p>Do Fat and Ds tune this relationship? Fat inhibits apico-cortical localization of the atypical myosin Dachs, consistent with genetically antagonistic roles played by <italic>fat</italic> and <italic>dachs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho and Irvine, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brittle et al., 2012</xref>). Loss of <italic>dachs</italic> also suppresses overproliferation of wing disc cells when a constitutively-active form of the Dpp receptor protein is expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rogulja et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, loss of <italic>fat</italic> enhances Dpp signaling within wing disc cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tyler and Baker, 2007</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that local Ds-Fat signaling between third instar wing cells attenuates their sensitivity to Dpp as a mitogen. It would then require a larger temporal increase in Dpp concentration to trigger cells to divide. This model is consistent with our observation that third instar wing cells do not lengthen their cell cycle as rapidly as normal when Fat or Ds are knocked down.</p><p>Other mechanisms are also possible. Dpp signaling represses Brinker, and it has been proposed that Brinker is the primary mediator of growth control by Dpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwank et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, Fat and Dpp may act in parallel rather than sequentially to regulate growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schwank et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, Ds-Fat signaling via the Hippo pathway may regulate the cell cycle duration of wing pouch cells independent of Dpp. Another known mechanism by which Fat/Ds regulates growth of the wing pouch is by a feedforward recruitment of neighboring hinge/notum cells to become wing pouch cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zecca and Struhl, 2007</xref>). This mechanism does not involve cell proliferation control. Our analysis of Fat/Ds function during the mid-to-late third instar suggests that they are not working through the feedforward mechanism to any large extent. Model simulations of wing pouch growth assuming Fat/Ds only control cell cycle duration strongly fit with our measurements of pouch growth during the third instar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This would argue that any contribution of Fat/Ds towards recruitment of pouch cells must be minor at this stage of larval growth.</p><p>The Ds expression pattern has a graded distribution with a steep slope in the proximal region of the wing pouch (near the pouch border) and a shallow slope in the distal region of the pouch (near the pouch center). We find that Fat protein is distributed in a gradient that is complementary to the Ds protein gradient – Fat is most abundant in cells where Ds levels are minimal and its gradient is most shallow. Global loss of Ds affects Fat distribution across the wing pouch such that Fat is abnormally elevated near the pouch border while remaining unchanged at the pouch center, effectively making a more shallow Fat gradient. This might suggest that cells repress Fat expression if they sense a steep Ds gradient. Alternatively, cells might repress Fat expression in a manner dependent on Ds levels. Indeed, <italic>ds</italic> mutant clones exhibit upregulated Fat localized to junctions between mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2003</xref>). However, these interpretations of loss-of-function experiments are complicated by our results manipulating the Ds gradient. Ectopically increasing Ds expression in central regions of the pouch with <italic>nub &gt;ds</italic> did not repress Fat abundance in those regions. Nor did amplifying the slope of the Ds gradient and boosting the maximal levels of Ds with <italic>ds &gt;Ds</italic> lead to stronger repression of Fat near the pouch border. Thus, the distribution of Fat is insensitive to the absolute level or differential in Ds abundance above some minimal level that is non-zero. Below this minimum and Fat is somehow upregulated. The mechanism behind these interactions remains to be elucidated. It is tempting to speculate that heterophilic binding of Ds to Fat, either in trans or in cis, is responsible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hale et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fulford et al., 2023</xref>). If so, then it is likely distinct from the stabilizing interactions that Ds has on Fat at cell junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hale et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The graded distributions of Fat and Ds proteins across the pouch are not stable over time but become progressively more shallow as the larva-pupa transition is reached. For Ds, its gradient scales with the size of the wing pouch. This occurs because the maximum and minimum limits of Ds-GFP abundance are conserved as the wing pouch grows. It would imply that dividing cells take up intermediate scalar values from their neighbors during growth, and over time the steepness of the Ds gradient consequently diminishes. Such a mechanism would also explain why the Ds gradient scales with pouch volume and not cell number. Whether cells are many or few in number, if they adopt intermediate levels of Ds from their neighbors by local sensing, then the gradient scales as the tissue expands.</p><p>Our observation of shallowing gradients of Fat and Ds expression fits with a long-standing model for growth regulation by Fat and Ds. Based on experiments with clones expressing Ds at different levels than their neighbors, it was suggested that Fat signaling is regulated by the steepness of a Ds gradient across a field of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rogulja et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Willecke et al., 2008</xref>). A steep gradient of Ds inactivates Fat signaling (stimulates growth), whereas a shallow gradient activates Fat signaling (inhibits growth). Thus, a progressively shallowing gradient of Ds would progressively slow down growth, which is what occurs during the third instar. Although the model did not consider a Fat gradient, our finding a shallowing gradient of Fat might also fit within this gradient model of growth control. However, when we manipulated the graded distributions of Fat or Ds protein in the wing pouch, there was little or no effect on its growth. Enhancing the gradient of Fat by its overexpression did not stimulate growth. Nor did amplifying the Ds gradient by severalfold overexpression using <italic>ds &gt;Ds</italic> lead to greatly enhanced growth but only a weak response. These results are not consistent with the gradient model. Moreover, loss of Fat and Ds diminishes the scaling coefficient that couples cell cycle time to pouch size, and this effect is constant over 36 hr of third instar growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, Ds and Fat are not progressively tuning their impact on growth rate of the wing, as the gradient model predicts. Instead, we suggest that third instar wing cells are tolerant of differences in Fat/Ds abundance, and instead, the gradients may be linked to the planar cell polarity functions of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Only males were analyzed in experiments. For staged collections, 100 adult females were crossed with 50 adult males and allowed to lay eggs for 4 hr (6 pm to 10 pm) in egg-laying cages with yeast paste. First-instar larvae that hatched between 7 and 9 pm the following day were collected, thus synchronizing age to a 2-hr hatching window. Approximately 200–300 larvae were transferred into a bottle. Third-instar larvae were collected from the bottle every 12 hours at 8 am and 8 pm, from 3.5 days after egg laying (AEL) until pupariation (i.e. 5 days for wildtype). We also collected animals at the white-prepupae (WPP) stage and the WPP + 1 stage. The WPP + 1 stage is 1 hr after the WPP stage onset, when the pupal case begins to turn brown.</p><p>Collected animals were weighed in batches of five individuals to account for instrument sensitivity. They were individually photographed using a Nikon SMZ-U dissection scope equipped with a Nikon DS-Fi3 digital camera at 1920x1200 resolution with a 8 µm x-y pixel size. Length and width were measured in a custom-built Matlab pipeline as follows. The outline of the body was recorded with manual inputs. The midline was calculated by the Matlab bwskel function and manually corrected. The midline was recorded as the length. At every pixel along the midline, a perpendicular line was computed, and the width recorded. The mean width was then calculated. We approximated the volume of each larva by treating it as a cylinder and using the measured length and average width of the larva for length and diameter, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Genetics</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, wildtype genotype strain corresponded to <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>, which is an eye pigment mutation present in the background of all other genotype strains used in this study. <italic>fat-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hale et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>ds-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brittle et al., 2012</xref>) are tagged at their ORF carboxy-termini within the respective endogenous genes.

The following primary antibodies were used: rat anti-Ds (1:1,000, a gift from Helen McNeill), mouse anti-Wg (1:1000, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank DHSB # 4D4), mouse anti-En (1:15, DHSB # 4D9), rat anti-HA (1:1000, Roche), rat anti-E-cadherin (1:10, DHSB # Dcad2), and rabbit anti-PHH3 (1:400, Sigma # H0412). All antibodies were diluted in PBSTx and 5% (v/v) goat serum and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After five washes in PBSTx, discs were incubated at room temperature for 90 min with the appropriate Alexa-fluor secondary antibodies (Invitrogen #’s A11035, A48255, or A48265) diluted 1:200 in PBSTx and 5% goat serum. After three washes in PBSTx, between 5 and 40 wing discs were mounted in 40 µL of Vectashield Plus between a 18x18 mm number 1.5 coverslip (Zeiss # 474030-9000-000) and a 24x60 mm number 1.5 coverslip (VWR # 48393–251). Mounting between two coverslips allowed the samples to be imaged from both directions. The volume of mounting media used was critical so that discs were not overly compressed by the coverslips. Compression led to fluorescent signals from the peripodial membrane to be too close in z-space to the disc proper, making it difficult to distinguish the two during image processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH)</title><p>A set of 45 non-overlapping oligonucleotide probes complementary to the GFP sense sequence were labeled with Alexa 633.

These were cultured ex-vivo in live imaging chambers following the protocol exactly as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gallagher et al., 2022</xref>. The samples were imaged using an inverted microscope (Leica DMI6000 SD) fitted with a CSU-X1 spinning-disk head (Yokogawa) and a back-thinned EMCCD camera (Photometrics Evolve 512 Delta). Images were captured every 5 min with a 40 x objective (NA = 1.3) at 512x512 resolution with a 0.32 µm x-y pixel size.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Image acquisition of fixed samples</title><p>All experiments with fixed tissues were imaged using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope. Whole wing discs were imaged using a 10 x air objective (NA = 0.4) and 0.75 x internal zoom at 1024x1,024 resolution, with a 1.52 µm x-y pixel size. Wing pouches were imaged using a 63 x oil objective (NA = 1.4) and 0.75 x internal zoom at 1024x1,024 resolution, with a 0.24 µm x-y pixel size and 0.35 µm z separation. Scans were collected bidirectionally at 600 MHz and were 3 x line averaged in the following channels to detect: anti-PHH3 (blue), Fat-GFP and Ds-GFP (green), anti-Wg and anti-En (red), and anti-HA or anti-Ds or anti-E-cadherin (far red). Wing discs of different genotypes and similar age were mounted on the same microscope slide and imaged in the same session for consistency in data quality.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Image processing</title><p>Raw images were processed using a custom-built Matlab pipeline with no prior preprocessing. The pipeline consists of several modules: (1) peripodial membrane removal, (2) wing disc, pouch, and midline segmentation, (3) volume measurement, (4) fluorescence intensity measurement, (5) cell segmentation, (6) mitotic index measurement.</p><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Peripodial membrane removal</title><p>Fat-GFP and Ds-GFP proteins localize to the apical region of cells in the wing disc proper. These proteins are also localized in cells of the peripodial membrane, which is positioned near the apical surface of the disc proper. In order to exclude the peripodial membrane signal, we used an open-source software package called ImSAnE – Image Surface Analysis Environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heemskerk and Streichan, 2015</xref>). The detailed parameters we used have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gallagher et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, we used the MIPDetector module to find the brightest z-position of every xy pixel followed by tpsFitter to fit a single layer surface through these identified z-positions. Using the onionOpts function in ImSAnE, we output a 9-layer z-stack, 4 layers above and below the computed surface that capture the entire signal from the wing disc proper. However, this operation still sometimes includes fluorescence signals from the peripodial membrane. Therefore, we manually masked the residual peripodial signal using FIJI 1.53t.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Wing disc, pouch, and midline segmentation</title><p>Wing discs were counterstained for both Wg and En proteins, which mark the wing pouch dorsal-ventral (DV) midline and anterior-posterior (AP) midline, respectively. Although both Wg and En proteins were stained with the same Alexa 546 fluorescent antibody, the two signals were readily distinguished by their distinct separation in z space. Wg is apically localized in cells of the disc proper and En is nuclear localized more basally in the disc proper. Moreover, the Wg signal was far stronger than En, allowing for detection of its expression.</p><p>We built a semi-automated Matlab script that computationally processed the wing disc images into discrete objects:</p><list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p><italic>Wing disc segmentation</italic>.

ImSAnE not only eliminated signal from z-slices corresponding to the peripodial membrane, but it captured relevant fluorescence signals in z-slices through the disc-proper and computationally eliminated all other signals. The captured complex 3D region-of-interest (ROI) was fit to a surface spline, and the resulting ROI was sum-projected in z space to form a 2D surface projection of the wing disc proper. This surface projection captured the signal not as a max projection but as a 2D translation of the curved surface of the 3D disc, much like surface projections of the earth are made. This processing was essential because of the complex 3D morphology of the wing disc, which possesses narrow and deep tissue folds that encompass the wing pouch anlage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). The border between the wing pouch domain and the hinge-notum domain is located deep within the folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In an early third instar wing disc, the folds are not deep. This allowed us to capture the entire 3D pouch of immature discs as a continuous 2D surface using ImSAnE. The ring of Wg expression at the pouch border was then used to demarcate the wing pouch border. The Matlab script recorded user-derived mouse-clicks that defined the wing pouch border. In older third instar and prepupal wing discs, the wing pouch folds are deep such that portions of both the dorsal and ventral compartments are folded underneath themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). Therefore, the wing pouch domain, although continuous, was computationally separated into an apical region, that is tissue closer to the objective, and a basal region, that is tissue located within the folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The original z-stack that spans the entire tissue was split into two smaller z-stacks at the z-slice corresponding to the outer crease of the folds (green dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The outer crease of the folds was determined in XZ or YZ in FIJI using the orthogonal views tool. The upper z-stack was processed with ImSAnE and the apical pouch region volume was calculated using surface detection in ImSAnE. The lower z-stack was analyzed using the orthogonal views tool in FIJI to identify the inner crease of the fold. This sharp crease was used to define the wing pouch border. If the crease was ambiguous, then the ring of Wg expression was used to segment the pouch, although this was rarely needed. The Matlab script recorded user-derived mouse-clicks that defined the wing pouch border. There are two basal pouch regions, one for the dorsal compartment and one for the ventral compartment. Both of these regions were segmented using the lower z-stack and the volumes were calculated using surface detection in ImSAnE. WPP and WPP +1 wing discs were undergoing eversion, a process in which the apical region of the pouch bulges outwards and the folds unfold. We also subdivided the pouch signals into apical and basal segments followed by use of ImSAnE to render the dome-like pouch into a 2D surface projection. Using the above methodology to segment the wing pouch, we judged the method to be 95.5% accurate when compared to a wing pouch segmentation that was defined by the expression boundary of the <italic>vestigial</italic> quadrant enhancer reporter, <italic>5x-QE-DsRed</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>DV midline segmentation</italic>. The expression stripe of Wg was used to segment the DV midline running through the segmented wing pouch. Since the Wg and En signals are distinguishable in z space, the upper third of the z-stack was max projected to segment Wg. An adaptive threshold of 0.6 was used to binarize the image into Wg-positive pixels. The binarized and raw images were used to inform manual input of the DV midline.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>AP midine segmentation</italic>. En expression in the P compartment was used to segment the AP midline running through the segmented wing pouch. The lower two-thirds of the upper z-stack was max projected and binarized in En +pixels.

Notum-hinge area was calculated by subtracting the segmented pouch area from total segmented wing disc area. The thickness of the wing pouch was measured at the intersection of the AP and DV midlines using the orthogonal views tool in FIJI. The first layer is defined by the initial signal of Fat-GFP or Ds-GFP at this xy position. The last layer is defined by the first appearance of background signal in the composite image. Thickness of the object was calculated by multiplying the sum of z-slices by the z-separation. To calculate the volume of segmented objects, we multiplied the thickness of the object (in µm) by the object’s surface area (in µm<sup>2</sup>). Surface area was measured for the entire wing pouch. Older third instar and prepupal wing discs begin to evert such that both the dorsal and the ventral compartments are partially folded underneath themselves As described in the previous section, the apical and two basal surface areas were independently measured and summed for total surface area. Conversion from µm<sup>3</sup> to nL units was performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-4"><title>Fluorescence intensity measurement of Fat-GFP and Ds-GFP</title><p>Fluorescence intensity values were averaged across a vector of 50 pixels length that was orthogonal to the segmented boundary of interest and having 25 pixels residing on each side of the segmented line. These values were then averaged in a sliding window of 100 pixels length that moved along the segmented boundary of interest. Physical distance along the boundaries were measured using ImSAnE function Proper_Dist to account for the curvature of the segmented objects. The intersection of the segmented DV and AP midlines was defined as the center (0,0 µm) of the wing pouch, with the anterior/dorsal annotated in units of negative µm and the posterior/ventral annotated in units of positive µm. A minimum of three wing discs of the same age and genotype were aligned by their (0,0) centers and their fluorescent measurements were averaged along the AP and DV midlines.</p><p>As mentioned in the previous sections, older wing discs have deep folds encompassing the pouch border and when they evert, the ventral compartment is partially folded underneath the dorsal compartment. For GFP intensity measurements, the folded specimens had dimmer fluorescent signals emanating from the regions farthest from the objective due to tissue thickness and light scattering. Thus, GFP intensity measurements were limited to the apical region of the wing pouch closest to the objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>To measure the efficacy of RNAi knockdown of endogenous Fat-GFP in the wing pouch, average fluorescence intensity was calculated throughout the segmented wing pouch as well as in the wing hinge region dorsal to the wing pouch.

Wing discs were immunostained for PHH3, which labels nuclei undergoing mitosis. These nuclei were manually recorded by user-defined mouse clicks at or near the center of each nucleus. Their Euclidean distances relative to the segmented AP and DV midlines were calculated as was the number of PHH3 + cells. To estimate the total cell number in a wing pouch, we used E-cadherin to computationally segment cells as described above. Each imaged wing pouch had a subset of cell boundaries segmented in a subdomain of the pouch. This was then used to calculate cell density: number of segmented cells divided by subdomain area. The density value was multiplied by total wing pouch area to estimate the total number of wing pouch cells for that sample. We then derived an averaged conversion factor to apply to each volume measurement in order to estimate total cell number. This was done by plotting the estimated total cell number versus wing pouch volume for all discs of a given genotype. Linear regression of the data produced an equation to convert pouch volume to cell number (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary statistics of linear regressions.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="2">Total Cell Number = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub>Pouch Volume</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="2"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genotype</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">β<sub>0</sub></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">β<sub>1</sub></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">p</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>nub-Gal4</italic></td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">352.0±187.7</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">7261.3±355.2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.95</td><td align="char" char="hyphen" valign="bottom">8.43E-16</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>nub &gt;ds</italic>(RNAi)</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">653.9±191.0</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">4533.5±221.5</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.95</td><td align="char" char="hyphen" valign="bottom">8.19E-16</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>nub-Gal4</italic></td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">637.3±200.9</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">4793.3±269.5</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.96</td><td align="char" char="hyphen" valign="bottom">5.24E-11</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>fat-GFP; nub &gt;fat</italic>(RNAi)</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">648.3±319.9</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">4359.0±364.3</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.91</td><td align="char" char="hyphen" valign="bottom">4.50E-9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>nub &gt;fat</italic> HA</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">2321.5±324.4</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">5212.9±516.4</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.80</td><td align="char" char="hyphen" valign="bottom">2.65E-10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>ds-Gal4</italic></td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">–1875±3,293</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">7726±2970</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.63</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.059</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>ds &gt;ds</italic></td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">725.9±1688.4</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">4839.7±1382.3</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.58</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.0067</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The number of PHH3 + cells in a wing pouch was divided by the estimated cell number in that wing pouch to obtain the mitotic index, the fraction of cells in M phase at the time of fixation.

The authors developed a new method for measuring growth of the wing imaginal disc during late larval development and then used this approach to examine the effects of disruption of Fat/Dachsous function on disc growth. The authors show that during mid to late third instar the wing imaginal disc normally grows in a linear rather than exponential fashion and that this occurs due to slowing of the mitotic cell cycle as the disc grows during this period. Consistent with their known role in regulating Hippo pathway activity, this slowing of growth is disrupted by loss of Fat/Dachsous function. The authors also observed a previously unreported gradient of Fat protein across the wing blade. However, graded expression of Fat or Dachsous is not necessary for proper growth regulation in the late third instar because ectopic Dachsous expression, which affects gradients of both Dachsous and Fat, has no growth phenotype.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91572.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Carthew</surname><given-names>Richard W</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northwestern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Evanston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northwestern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Evanston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>McConnell</surname><given-names>Jessica</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northwestern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Evanston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wall</surname><given-names>Farley</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northwestern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Evanston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p><bold>Response to Reviews</bold></p><p>All reviewers were positive about the rigor and impact of our work and offered a number of very helpful suggestions. We have done a number of suggested experiments, whose results have been added to the revision. We have also used their suggestions to improve the clarity and precision with which we describe and interpret our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1 found the paper to be clearly written, with novel results, and the conclusions relevant and solid. This review offered many insights and thoughtful suggestions, which we have adopted to greatly improve the manuscript. The referee’s points are listed below with our responses.</p><p>The study chooses to examine growth only in the prospective wing blade (the &quot;pouch&quot;) rather than the wing disc as a whole. This can create biases, as fat and ds manipulations often cause stronger effects on growth, and on Hippo signaling targets, in the adjacent hinge regions of the disc. So I am curious about this choice.</p></disp-quote><p>Actually, several experiments described in the manuscript measured growth in regions of the wing disc that did not include the pouch (Fig 1 supplement 4). We found that in the second phase of allometric growth, growth of the pouch was greater than growth of the hinge-notum (Fig.1G and Fig 1 supplement 4). We also looked at the effect of Ds and Fat on growth of the hinge-notum (Fig 4 supplement 1 and Fig 5 supplement 2). Loss of Ds or Fat also affected allometric growth of the pouch differently from their effects on allometric growth of the hinge-notum. We therefore treated analysis of each region independently. Greater focus was given to wing pouch growth because it was in this region that we detected the interesting gradient properties in Fat and Ds expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The limitation to the wing region also creates some problems for the measurements themselves. The division between wing and pouch is not a strict lineage boundary, and thus cells can join or leave this region, creating two different reasons for changes in wing pouch size; growth of cells already in the region, or recruitment of cells into or out of the region. The authors do not discuss the second mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this assessment that pouch growth can occur via lineage-restricted growth or by recruitment of cells into the region. This has now been clarified in the Introduction and the Discussion with discussion of the second mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not at all clear that the markers for the pouch used by the authors are stable during development. One of these is Vg expression, or the Vg quadrant enhancer. But the Vgexpressing region is thought to increase by recruitment over late second and third instar through a feed-forward mechanism by which Vg-expressing cells induce Vg expression in adjacent cells. In fact, this process is thought to be driven in part by Fat and Ds (Zecca et al 2010). So when the authors manipulate Fat and Ds are they increasing growth or simply increasing Vg recruitment? I would prefer that this limitation be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>There is the possibility that the feedforward recruitment of disc cells to express Vg leads to some expansion of the measured pouch domain. However, we argue that the recruitment mechanism may not be contributing significantly to the phenomena we measured in this study. (1) We limited our analysis of pouch growth to the third instar stage. In Fig.2, Zecca and Struhl (2007 doi 10.1242/dev.006411) found that recruitment was much stronger in clones induced at first instar rather than third instar, and so they limited their clonal analysis throughout the paper to first instar induced clones. Thus, it is unclear how much the feedforward recruitment mechanism contributes to pouch growth in the mid-to-late third instar. (2) We detected an effect of Ds and Fat on how rapidly the cell cycle slows down over time in pouch cells. The effect is entirely consistent with it having a causal effect on wing pouch growth. For example, nub&gt;Ds(RNAi) causes the average third instar pouch cell to divide ~25% more rapidly than normal, when comparing the slopes in Figure 6. Note that at the beginning of the third instar, the average pouch cell has a similar doubling time whether lacking Ds or not (Figure 6). When we measured the final size of the wing pouch at the end of the third instar, nub&gt;Ds(RNAi) caused the pouch to be ~30% larger than normal (Figure 5). This effect is quite comparable to the effect of Ds RNAi on cell doubling.</p><p>To provide more rigorous evidence that the effect of Fat and Ds on cell cycle dynamics is primarily responsible for their effects on wing growth that we measured, we have adapted the simple growth modeling framework from Wartlick et al (2011) and fit our cell cycle measurements made for different genotypes. These fits give us estimates for instantaneous cell growth rates over time, and using these estimates, we simulated the theoretical growth trajectory of the entire wing pouch for wildtype and ds / fat RNAi animals. When we compare these model predictions of wing growth to our pouch volume measurements over time, they agree very well with one another. These</p><p>analyses and results are now discussed in the Results and presented in Fig. 6 supplement 2. Overall, it supports a model that Fat and Ds regulate cell cycle dynamics in the wing pouch during third instar and this effect is primarily responsible for Fat and Ds’s effect on overall wing pouch growth in that timeframe. It does not rule out that Fat and Ds might also affect Vg recruitment at third instar, but such effects must be small relative to the primary effect on the cell cycle. It is feasible that Fat and Ds work via the feedforward mechanism at earlier larval stages. We have now discussed all this in detail in the Discussion considering the limitation of recruitment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second pouch marker the authors use is epithelial folding, but this also has problems, as Fat and Ds manipulations change folding. Even in wild type, the folding patterns are complex. For instance, to make folding fit the Vg-QE pattern at late third the authors appear to be jumping in the dorsal pouch between two different sets of folds (Fig 1S2A). The authors also do not show how they use folding patterns in younger, less folded discs, nor provide evidence that the location of the folds are the same and do not shift relative to the cells. They also do not explain how they use folds and measure at later wpp and bpp stages, as the discs unfold and evert, exposing cells that were previously hidden in the folds.</p></disp-quote><p>The primary marker we used for the pouch boundary were the folds. We agree with the reviewer that our original description of how we defined the pouch boundary using the folds was inadequate. We now have substantially expanded the Methods section describing how we defined the boundary at all stages using the folds, including a supplementary figure (Fig 1 supplement 2). Importantly, in our measurements, we did not exclude the pouch regions within the folds but included them (see also the next point). Our microscopy detected fluorescence in the folds, and surface rendering allowed us to visualize fold structure and its contents. In younger discs with less folding, we defined the boundary by the location of the Wg inner ring. The folds were more prominent in older L3 larval discs and in the WPP and later stages since the wings had not fully everted yet. Therefore, we used accepted morphological definitions of the pouch boundary from the literature to define the boundaries. We were able to do so even though, as the reviewer notes, the fold architecture evolves as the larvae age. We agree with the reviewer that defining a boundary based on morphology could be error prone, especially prone to systematic error based on age. It is the main reason we directly compared the morphologically defined boundaries to boundaries defined by the Vg quadrant expression domain for many wing discs across all ages. As seen in Fig 1 supplement 3C, the two methods are in strong agreement with one another for discs of all ages. There is a slight overestimate of the pouch boundary using the morphological method, but the error is small (2.5%) and independent of disc size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors limit their measurements to cells with exposed apical faces and thus a measurable area but apparently ignore the cells inside the folds. At late third, however, a substantial amount of the prospective wing blade is found within the folds, especially where they are deepest near the A/P compartment boundary. Using the third vein sensory organ precursors as markers, the L3-2 sensillum is found just distal to the fold, the L3-1 and the ACV sensilla are within the fold, and the GSR of the distal hinge is found just proximal to the fold. That puts the proximal half of the central wing blade in the fold, and apparently uncounted in their assays. These cells will however be exposed at wpp and especially bpp stages. How are the authors adjusting for this?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not describing the methods of measurement thoroughly in the original submission. In fact, we did make measurements of cells located within the folds of the wing pouch at all stages. Z stacks of optical sections were collected that transversed the disc, including the folds. Using surface detection algorithms, we could make spatial measurements (xyz distances and areas) of the material within the folds enveloping the apical pouch. Therefore, we could measure the surface area and volume of the wing pouch that included the folds. This was indeed what we did and reported in the original submission. A much more complete description of the process has now been added to the Methods.</p><p>On the other hand, we could not reliably measure Fat-GFP or Ds-GFP fluorescence intensity in cells deep in the folds due to light scattering. Therefore, we did not assay the entire gradient across the pouch. Of the cells we did measure, we know their relative distance to the center of the pouch, defined as the intersection of the AP and DV boundaries. Therefore, fluorescence intensities could be directly compared across stages since they were calibrated by the centerpoint of the pouch. We have added text to the Methods to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Stabilizing and destabilizing interactions between Fat and Ds- The authors describe a distal accumulation of Fat protein in the wing, and show that this is unlikely to be through Fat transcription. They further try to test whether the distal accumulation depends on destabilization of proximal Fat by proximal Ds by looking at Fat in ds mutant discs. However, the authors do not describe how they take into account the stabilizing effects of heterophilic binding between the extracellular domains (ECDs) of Fat and Ds; without one, the junctional levels and stability of the other is reduced (Ma et al., 2003; Hale et al. 2015). So when they show that the A-P gradient of Fat is reduced in a ds mutant, is this because of the loss of a destabilizing effect of Ds on Fat, as they assume, or is it because all junctional Fat has been destabilized by loss of extracelluarlar binding to Ds? The description of the Fat gradient in Ds mutants is also confusing (see note 6 below), making this section difficult for the reader to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not intend to imply that Ds actively inhibits Fat. We now describe the implications of the result more clearly in the Results and Discussion with reference to the prior Hale and Ma study of heterophilic stabilization. It is worth noting that Ma et al 2003 saw elevated junctional Fat in ds mutant cells if they were surrounded by other ds mutant cells. This is consistent with our results. We also apologize for the confusion in describing the Fat gradient and have reworded the section in the Results to make it more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors do not propose or test a mechanism for the proposed destabilization. Fat and Ds bind not only through their ECDs, but binding has now also been demonstrated through their ICDs (Fulford et al. 2023)</p></disp-quote><p>We now discuss possible mechanisms in the Discussion and include the Fulford reference in the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ds gradient scales by volume, rather than cell number - This is an intriguing result, but the authors do not discuss possible mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added discussion of possible mechanisms in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fat and Ds are already known to have autonomous effects on growth and Hippo signaling from clonal analyses and localized knockdowns. One novelty here is showing that localized knockdown does not delay pupariation in the way that whole animal knockdown does, although the mechanism is not investigated. Another novelty is that the authors find stronger wing pouch overgrowth after localized ds RNAi or whole disc loss of fat than after localized fat RNAi, the latter being only 11% larger. The fat RNAi result would have been strengthened by testing different fat RNAi stocks, which vary in their strength and are commonly weaker than null mutations, or stronger drivers such as the ap-gal4 they used for some of their ds-RNAi experiments or use of UAS-dcr2. Another reason for caution is that Garoia (2005) found much stronger overgrowth in fat mutant clones, which were about 75% larger than control clones.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Indeed, the weak effect of Fat RNAi had been due to the specific RNAi driver. We followed the reviewer’s suggestion and tested other RNAi stocks. We had in hand an RNAi driver against GFP that we had found in unrelated studies to be a very potent repressor of GFP expression. Since we had been using a knock-in allele of GFP inserted in frame to Fat throughout this study, we applied nub&gt;Gal4 UAS-GFP RNAi to knock down homozygous Fat-GFP. The effect of the knockdown was very strong, as measured by residual 488nm fluorescence above background autofluorescence after knockdown. Correcting for background autofluorescence, we estimate that only 4.5% of Fat-GFP remained under RNAi conditions (Figure 5 - figure supplement 3).</p><p>Using the more potent RNAi reagent, we repeated the various experiments related to</p><p>Fat. We observed a 42% increase in wing pouch growth, which is similar to that of Ds RNAi. We also observed an effect of Fat RNAi on the average cell cycle time of wing pouch cells. There was still a linear coupling between the cell cycle duration and wing pouch size, but the slope of the coupling was smaller with Fat RNAi. This was very similar to what Ds RNAi does to the cell cycle. Therefore, we have replaced the data from the original Fat RNAi experiments with the new data and modified the text throughout the manuscript to describe the new results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Flattening of Ds gradient does not slow growth. One model suggests that the flattening of the Ds gradient, and thus polarized Ds-Fat binding, account for slowed growth in older discs. The difficulty in the past has been that two ways of flattening the Ds gradient, either removing Ds or overexpressing Ds uniformly, give opposite results; the first increases growth, while the latter slows it. Both experiments have the problem of not just flattening the gradient, but also altering overall levels of Ds-Fat binding, which will likely alter growth independent of the gradients. Here, the authors instead use overexpression to create a strong Ds gradient (albeit a reversely oriented one) that does not flatten, and show that this does not prevent growth from slowing and arresting.</p><p>To make sure that this is not some effect caused by using a reverse gradient, one might instead induce a more permanent normally oriented Ds gradient and see if this also does not alter growth; there is a ds Trojan gal4 line available that might work for this, and several other proximal drivers.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We followed the reviewer’s suggestion and generated Trojan-Gal4 mediated overexpression of Ds. The Ds protein gradient was strongly amplified by Trojan-Gal4 but remained normally oriented. However, it only caused a modest (12%) increase in wing pouch volume. It did not significantly alter Fat expression dynamics nor the dynamics of cell cycle duration. This new data has been added to the Results (Fig. 7 and Fig 7 supplement 2) and discussed at length in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another possible problem is that, unlike previous studies, the authors have not blocked the Four-jointed gradient; Fj alters Fat-Ds binding and might regulate polarity independently of Ds expression.

The authors state in the Discussion &quot;The significance of these dynamics is unclear, but the flattening of the Fat gradient is not a trigger for growth cessation.&quot; While the Discussion mentions the effects of Ds on Fat distribution in some detail, this is the only phrase that discusses growth, which is surprising given how often the gradient model of growth control is mentioned elsewhere. The reader would be helped if details are given about what experiment supports this conclusion, the effect on not only growth cessation but cell cycle time, and why the result differs from those of Rogjula 2008 and Willecke 2008 using Ds and Fj overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten the Discussion to better reflect the results and incorporate the reviewer’s criticisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors spend much of the discussion speculating on the possibility that Fat and Ds control growth by changing the wing's sensitivity to the BMP Dpp. As the manuscript contains no new data on Dpp, this is somewhat surprising. The discussion also ignores Schwank (2011), who argues that Fat and Dpp are relatively independent. There have also been studies showing genetic interactions between Fat and signaling pathways such as Wg (Cho and Irvine 2004) and EGF (Garoia 2005).</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the discussion to be more inclusive of mechanisms connecting Fat and other signaling pathways, and we deleted some of the speculation about Dpp. However, since Dpp is the only known growth factor whose local concentration linearly scales with average cell doubling time (the process we found Ds/Fat regulates), there is a logical connection that readers deserve to know about. Therefore, we have retained some discussion of the hypothesis that the two might be linked through cell cycle duration. It is for future studies to test that hypothesis as it is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>That said, there are studies that discount the work of Wartlick’s Dpp model, eg. Schwank et al 2012, arguing that Dpp regulates growth permissively by limiting an antigrowth factor, Brinker.

This review offered many insights and thoughtful suggestions, which we have adopted to greatly improve the manuscript. The referee’s points are listed below with our responses.</p><p>Although the approach used to measure volume is new to this study, the basic finding that imaginal disc growth slows at the mid-third instar stage has been known for some time from studies that counted disc cell number during larval development (Fain and Stevens, 1982; Graves and Schubiger, 1982). Although these studies did not directly measure disc volume, because cell size in the disc is not known to change during larval development, cell number is an accurate measure of tissue volume. However, it is worth noting that the approach used here does potentially allow for differential growth of different regions of the disc.</p></disp-quote><p>We had cited the older literature in reference to our results. We have now noted the approach’s usefulness in measuring different disc regions such as the pouch.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to point 1, a main conclusion of this study, that cell cycle length scales with growth of the wing, is based on a developmentally limited analysis that is restricted to the mid-third instar larval stage and later (early third instar begins at 72 hr - the authors' analysis started at 84 hr). The previous studies cited above made measurements from the beginning of the 3rd instar and combined them with previous histological analyses of cell numbers starting at the beginning of the 2nd instar. Interestingly, both studies found that cell number increases exponentially from the start of the 2nd instar until mid-third instar, and only after that point does the cell cycle slow resulting in the linear growth reported here. The current study states that growth is linear due to scaling of cell cycle with disc size as though this is a general principle, but from the earlier studies, this is not the case earlier in disc development and instead applies only to the last day of larval life.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not making this distinction clearer in the original manuscript. Indeed, growth is initially exponential and shifts to a more linear-like regime in the mid third instar. Our focus in the manuscript is primarily this latter phase. We have now rewritten the text in the Introduction, Results and Discussion to make this very clear.</p><p>While cell number and pouch volume increase exponentially from the start of the 2nd instar, the cell cycle already begins to slow down during the 2nd instar, as found with mitotic index measurements done by Wartlick et al 2011. Using their data to model cell cycle duration as a function of pouch area, we find that during the 2nd instar, cell cycle duration also increases as the size of the wing pouch increases. This is shown in the figure (panel C) below. Note that this relationship appears nonlinear and is quantitatively distinct from the relationship for third instar wing growth.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91572-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The analysis of the roles of Fat and Dachsous presented here has weaknesses that should be addressed. It is very curious that the authors found that depletion of Fat by RNAi in the wing blade had essentially no effect on growth while depletion of Dachsous did, given that the loss of function overgrowth phenotype of null mutations in fat is more severe than that of null mutations in dachsous (Matakatsu and Blair, 2006). An obvious possibility is that the Fat RNAi transgene employed in these experiments is not very efficient. The authors tried to address this by doubling the dose of the transgene, but it is not clear to me that this approach is known to be effective. The authors should test other RNAi transgenes and additionally include an analysis of growth of discs from animals homozygous for null alleles, which as they note survive to the late larval stages.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

It is also surprising that they find that expression of Nubbin Gal4 is graded across the wing blade given that previous studies indicate that it is uniform (ie. Martín et al. 2004). These two surprising findings raise the possibility that the quantification of fluorescence could be inaccurate. The curvature of the wing blade makes it a challenging tissue to image, particularly for quantitative measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>Fat protein expression not being uniform has been observed before but not carefully quantified (see Mao et al., 2009, Strutt and Strutt 2002). Martin et al. 2004 (doi 10.1242/dev.013) claimed that Nub-Gal4 is uniform without actually measuring it. Please consult Fig 1A and 2A in their paper, which clearly shows stronger expression in the center/distal region of the pouch.</p><p>Regarding systematic errors in quantification, we took great pains to minimize them. We carefully divided the complex folded disc’s z stack into an apical region of interest (ROI) that included the distal domain of the wing pouch and a basal ROI that included the folds encompassing the pouch. We then used a published and widely used surface detection algorithm (ImSAnE) that captures a 3D region of interest (ROI) that can be curved and complex in shape (in z space) because the user creates a surface spline of the ROI. The resulting output treats the ROI as a virtual 2D object. This obviates the need to perform max projections of confocal stacks, which often create artifacts that the reviewer speaks of. Instead, ImSAnE eliminates such artifacts, and it is the gold standard for image processing of ROIs with 3D curvature.</p><p>Moreover, our pipeline does detect uniform expression if it is there. We used a da-Gal4 driver in Fig. 2K,L - this driver is widely acknowledged to be uniformly expressed in tissues of the fly. When it drives a control fluorescent marker (Bazooka-mCherry), our analysis pipeline detects a uniform expression pattern across the wing pouch (Fig. 2L). When the same Gal4 transgene drives Fat-HA in the same tissue, our pipeline detects a graded expression pattern of Fat-HA (Fig. 2L). In fact, this experiment co-expressed both Fat-HA and the control marker in the same disc. Thus, we feel confident that our analysis is not inaccurate.</p></body></sub-article></article>
