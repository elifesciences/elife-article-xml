These components are expressed in diverse combinations in different cell types, interact in a many-to-many fashion, both within the same cell (in cis) and between cells (in trans), and their interactions are modulated by Fringe glycosyltransferases. A fundamental question is how the strength of Notch signaling depends on which pathway components are expressed, at what levels, and in which cells. Here, we used a quantitative, bottom-up, cell-based approach to systematically characterize trans-activation, cis-inhibition, and cis-activation signaling efficiencies across a range of ligand and Fringe expression levels in Chinese hamster and mouse cell lines. Each ligand (Dll1, Dll4, Jag1, and Jag2) and receptor variant (Notch1 and Notch2) analyzed here exhibited a unique profile of interactions, Fringe dependence, and signaling outcomes. All four ligands were able to bind receptors in cis and in trans, and all ligands trans-activated both receptors, although Jag1-Notch1 signaling was substantially weaker than other ligand-receptor combinations. Cis-interactions were predominantly inhibitory, with the exception of the Dll1- and Dll4-Notch2 pairs, which exhibited cis-activation stronger than trans-activation. Lfng strengthened Delta-mediated trans-activation and weakened Jagged-mediated trans-activation for both receptors. Finally, cis-ligands showed diverse cis-inhibition strengths, which depended on the identity of the trans-ligand as well as the receptor. The map of receptor-ligand-Fringe interaction outcomes revealed here should help guide rational perturbation and control of the Notch pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Notch signaling</kwd><kwd>systems biology</kwd><kwd>quantitative biology</kwd><kwd>cell signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HD7335C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuintzle</surname><given-names>Rachael</given-names></name><name><surname>Santat</surname><given-names>Leah A</given-names></name><name><surname>Elowitz</surname><given-names>Michael B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 HD100185</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuintzle</surname><given-names>Rachael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santat</surname><given-names>Leah A</given-names></name><name><surname>Elowitz</surname><given-names>Michael B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Notch signaling pathway can use its various ligands, receptors, and Fringe proteins to generate diverse intra- and intercellular signaling behaviors.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Notch signaling pathway controls stem cell differentiation and proliferation, plays key roles in numerous diseases, and represents a major drug target. It uses multiple membrane-bound ligands and receptors that interact with one another in a many-to-many fashion, as well as Fringe glycosyltransferases (Fringes) that modulate those interactions. In mammals, the Notch pathway consists of four receptors (Notch1â4), four canonical activating ligands (Dll1, Dll4, Jag1, and Jag2), at least one predominantly inhibitory ligand (Dll3), and non-canonical ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DâSouza et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Falix et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fiddes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gera and Dighe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ladi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Serth et al., 2015</xref>). Ligands and receptors interact both within the same cell (in cis) and between adjacent cells (in trans). Either configuration has the potential to activate or inhibit signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">del Ãlamo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nandagopal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>). The level of signaling in a Notch-expressing cell generally depends on which ligand, receptor, and Fringe variants are expressed in the cell and its neighbors. These components are expressed in various combinations in different cell types, often including coexpression of ligands, receptors, and at least one Fringe enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Granados et al., 2022</xref>). However, it remains difficult to predict signaling strengthâhow strongly a given cell will signal to another cellâbased on the expression profiles of Notch pathway components. It similarly remains challenging to rationally and predictably perturb signaling for therapeutic and tissue engineering purposes.</p><p>Transcriptional responses are sensitive to the amplitude and duration of Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Falo-Sanjuan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kuang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nandagopal et al., 2018</xref>). In the canonical trans-activation mechanism, binding of ligands on one cell to receptors on an adjacent cell triggers ligand endocytosis, which generates mechanical strain on the receptor, exposing a metalloproteinase recognition site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Langridge and Struhl, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lovendahl et al., 2018</xref>). S2 cleavage by ADAM10 results in shedding of the receptor extracellular domain (NECD) and permits a subsequent S3 cleavage by Î³-secretase to release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The free NICD directly translocates into the nucleus and binds cofactors MAML and RBPjÎº to activate target genes. Downstream target genes respond similarly to NICD originating from the Notch1 or Notch2 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kraman and McCright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). However, they respond differently to distinct concentrations of NICD. In pancreatic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ninov et al., 2012</xref>) and central nervous system stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guentchev and McKay, 2006</xref>), complete Notch inhibition permitted differentiation, low levels of NICD promoted proliferation, and higher levels induced quiescence. Notch signaling amplitude can also influence the timing of developmental transitions, with higher NICD concentrations activating master transcription factors earlier than lower concentrations, depending on the targetâs enhancer architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Falo-Sanjuan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The Notch pathway provides numerous ways to tune signaling amplitude. Fringe enzymes can alter receptor-ligand binding and activation strengths, sometimes in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kakuda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kakuda and Haltiwanger, 2017</xref>). Upregulating expression of a ligand can suppress Notch signaling cell-autonomously, through a process termed cis-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fiuza et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Thambyrajah et al., 2024</xref>), or trans-activate receptors on neighboring cells. In some cases, ligands can also activate signaling by receptors in the same cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nandagopal et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, growing evidence suggests that some ligands can inhibit signaling intercellularly (âtrans-inhibitionâ) by binding receptors strongly without activating them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Luna-Escalante et al., 2018</xref>), as may be the case for Jag1 and Lunatic Fringe (Lfng)-modified Notch1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kakuda and Haltiwanger, 2017</xref>). Thus, the Notch pathway architecture allows for receptor-ligand interactions to result in either activation or inhibition of signaling, in either cis or trans. However, for the majority of possible receptor-ligand interaction pairs, the relative activation and inhibition strengths have not been measured in both cis and trans orientations, making it difficult to predict signaling outcomes in natural contexts and in applications such as tissue engineering.</p><p>Here, to address these challenges, we developed a set of engineered cell lines and coculture reporter assays that allow systematic characterization of trans-activation, cis-inhibition, and cis-activation efficiencies across a range of cis-ligand and Fringe expression levels. We focused on interactions among four ligandsâDll1, Dll4, Jag1, and Jag2âwith two receptorsâNotch1 and Notch2âand their modulation by Lfng. We verified that key features are consistent between two distinct cell lines: Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts. Each receptor and ligand had a unique profile of Lfng-dependent cis- and trans-interactions with other components. In trans, all ligands were capable of activating Notch1 and Notch2. However, Jag1 trans-activated Notch1 inefficiently, despite the strong Notch1-activating ability of recombinant Jag1 fragments. In cis, with competition from trans-activating ligands, Dll1 and Dll4 inhibited Notch1 and further activated Notch2 signaling, while Jagged ligands cis-inhibited both receptors. Lfng modulated most receptor-ligand interactions. It increased Jag1âs inhibitory potential by strengthening binding but weakening activation of Notch1, as seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kakuda and Haltiwanger, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, Lfng potentiated trans-activation for Delta-Notch combinations, but attenuated Jagged-Notch signaling. It also had diverse receptor- and ligand-specific effects on cis-activation, which in general differed from those on trans-activation for Notch2 but not for Notch1. Together, this map of relative cis and trans receptor-ligand-Fringe interactions should be useful to explain Notch signaling behaviors in diverse developmental and physiological contexts, and guide more rational, targeted perturbation of Notch signaling activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Engineered âreceiverâ and âsenderâ cell lines enable quantitative comparison of receptor-ligand-Fringe interactions</title><p>To systematically analyze pairwise cis and trans receptor-ligand interactions, and their dependence on Fringe enzyme expression, we engineered a set of over 50 different stable cell lines (Key resources table). Collectively, they provide quantitative readouts of Notch signaling activity, receptor level, and ligand level. They also enable precise modulation of ligand expression. As a base cell line, we used CHO-K1 cells, which exhibit negligible endogenous expression levels of Notch receptors and ligands, and no endogenous Notch signaling activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Singh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>). In this background, we constructed three types of cell lines, described below.</p><p>First, to read out Notch signaling, we created monoclonal âreceiverâ cells, similar to those described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">LeBon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nandagopal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These cells expressed a chimeric human Notch receptor, whose intracellular domain was replaced with a minimal Gal4 transcription factor (âGal4esnâ, henceforth denoted Gal4). This coding sequence was followed by H2B-mTurq2, with an intervening ribosomal skipping T2A sequence, for cotranslational readout of receptor expression. This construct was stably integrated in the host cell genome using piggyBac transposition (Methods). Expression of the cotranslational mTurq2 reporter was broadly comparable between different receiver clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), and correlated with surface receptor expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). The cells also contained an insulated UAS promoter driving expression of H2B-mCitrine, such that mCitrine production reflects Notch activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Engineered âreceiverâ and âsenderâ cells enable quantitative comparison of receptor-ligand interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Engineered cell lines enable systematic analysis of trans-activation, cis-activation, and cis-inhibition. Receiver cells contain chimeric Notch receptors (gray) composed of Notch extracellular and transmembrane domains fused with a minimal Gal4 transcription factor (Gal4) in place of the endogenous intracellular domain, co-transcribed with a T2A-H2B-mTurq2 cassette for quantitative readout of receptor expression. Receptor activation releases Gal4, which activates expression of a stably integrated UAS-H2B-mCitrine reporter (yellow). Some strains also contained a stably integrated ligand and reporter (second cartoon). These sender cell lines were constructed by integrating plasmids containing each of the four activating ligands fused to 2xFLAG, followed by T2A-H2B-mCherry for cotranslational readout of ligand expression, either under Tet-OFF control (to allow induction by 4-epiTc) or expressed from the constitutive CBh promoter.

The exception was Dll4, which signaled more strongly to Notch1 than Notch2 in the dLfng condition, but activated Notch1 and Notch2 to similar levels with Lfng. Second, Notch1 and Notch2 responded in a qualitatively similar way to Lfng, as can be seen by plotting signaling strengths for the Lfng condition vs. those for dLfng (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Lfng significantly enhanced Notch1 and Notch2 trans-activation by both Dll1 and Dll4. Its greatest effect was on Dll1-Notch1 (3-fold increase) followed by Dll4-Notch2 (2.5-fold increase). Lfng significantly decreased trans-activation of both receptors by Jag1 (&gt;2.5-fold) and, to a lesser extent, Jag2 (~1.4-fold). (Note that while Jag1-Notch1 signaling was low, it was still possible to detect further reductions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).) Thus, the two receptors differed in their responses to the four ligands but responded similarly to Lfng, which strengthened Delta-mediated trans-activation and weakened Jagged-mediated trans-activation for both receptors.</p><p>Next, we focused on the difference in trans-activation by Dll1 and Dll4 in the two Fringe conditions. In the absence of Fringe expression (i.e. with dLfng), Dll1-Notch1 signaling strength was only slightly above background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). By contrast, Dll4 activated Notch1 9-fold more strongly than Dll1 in the dLfng condition, consistent with previous results from E14TG2a mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tveriakhina et al., 2018</xref>), possibly reflecting the ~10-fold greater binding affinity of Notch1 to the Dll4 extracellular domain (ECD), compared to the Dll1 ECD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrawes et al., 2013</xref>). Lfng expression increased Dll1 signaling more than Dll4, reducing the difference in signaling strengths between the ligands to 2.7-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). With Notch2, Dll1 signaling exceeded Dll4 signaling, with or without Lfng.</p><p>Similar to the Delta ligands, the Jagged ligands also showed diverse signaling activities. Strikingly, Jag1 activated Notch1 poorly in both the dLfng and Lfng conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This lack of signaling was not due to a defect in the ligand, which was properly trafficked to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and which signaled to Notch2 at levels comparable to those of Dll1 in the dLfng condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to Jag1, Jag2 was the strongest trans-activating ligand for both receptors with dLfng, and remained among the strongest with Lfng. Taken together, these results establish unique patterns of activity for the four ligands across different receptor and Fringe contexts.</p><p>In addition to signaling strength, another key feature of signaling is ultrasensitivity, which plays a pivotal role in developmental patterning circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gozlan and Sprinzak, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sprinzak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yasugi and Sato, 2022</xref>). Ultrasensitivity could in principle emerge from clustering of Notch ligands and receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bardot et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cattoni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duke and Graham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Narui and Salaita, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Radhakrishnan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tetzlaff et al., 2018</xref>). To quantify ultrasensitivity, we titrated ligand expression in 4-epi-Tc-inducible sender cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>) and measured signaling activity in a cocultured minority of CHO-K1 receiver cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Signaling levels increased monotonically to levels that varied by ~1.5-fold across most ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, there were two exceptions: First, Dll1-Notch signaling was biphasic, declining at high trans-ligand expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Second, Jag1-Notch1 signaling was much weaker than other signaling interactions, as expected, preventing analysis of ultrasensitivity in this case. Most dose-response curves showed ultrasensitive responses in which signaling activity increased approximately as the square of the ligand concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

During the ligand preinduction phase, the Î³-secretase inhibitor DAPT prevents S3, but not S2, receptor cleavage. Thus, intercellular contacts between receivers during preinduction culture could in principle generate an S2-cleaved receptor, also known as the Notch extracellular truncation (NEXT). NEXT could then undergo S3 cleavage after DAPT removal, contributing to the total observed signal in the cis-activation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>To test this possibility, we carried out a control cis-activation assay in which receivers were cultured at both sparse and confluent densities during the 48 hr cis-ligand preinduction phase, and then replated sparsely or densely after 24 hr of preinduction to maintain the initial low or high cell density conditions (Methods).

In all other ligand-Notch2 conditions, trans-ligands failed to increase signaling, suggesting that cis-activation alone is sufficient to explain the observed level of signaling in these cis+trans conditions.

Additionally, they share similar ligand-dependent responses to Rfng, which increases both cis-activation and trans-activation by Dll1 but not Dll4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kakuda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nandagopal et al., 2019</xref>).

For example, Jag2 was the most effective Notch1 cis-inhibitor across all trans-ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Ligandsâ relative cis-inhibition strengths did not correlate well with trans-activation strengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In general, combinations with modest or strong cis-activating potentials, such as Dll4-Notch1, Dll1-Notch2, and Dll4-Notch2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), showed relatively poor cis-inhibition efficiencies relative to trans-activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Notably, each cis-ligand inhibited signaling from the trans-ligand of the same identity with an equal or greater efficiency than it inhibited other trans-ligands. For example, Dll1 cis-inhibited trans-Dll1 signaling more efficiently than either trans-Jag2 or -Dll4. Similarly, Jag2 cis-inhibited trans-Jag2 signaling more efficiently than trans-Dll1 signaling, and Dll4 cis-inhibited trans-Dll4 signaling more efficiently than trans-Jag2 signaling. In contrast to the variability of Notch1 cis-inhibition, Jag-Notch2 cis-inhibition was relatively uniform across different cis- and trans-ligand combinations, varying by no more than 2-fold between the strongest and weakest cis-inhibiting combinations. Together, these results suggest that cis-inhibition strengths for Notch1, and to a lesser extent, Notch2, depend on the interplay of trans-ligand, cis-ligand, and receptor.</p><p>Finally, we estimated the ultrasensitivity of cis-inhibition by fitting Hill functions to most of the dose-response curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>.

Also similar to their behavior in CHO-K1 cells, Dll4 and Jag2 cis-inhibited Notch1 reporter activity in C2C12-Nkd cells relative to the NGFR cis-ligand negative control. Furthermore, Jag2 did not cis-activate Notch1 in this background. However, in contrast to CHO-K1, where Dll4 weakly cis-activated Notch1 even without Fringe expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), we observed no cis-activation by Dll4 in C2C12-Nkd.</p><p>Together, these results indicate that key signaling behaviors are similar between the CHO-K1 and C2C12 backgrounds.

However, the functional consequences of this component diversity have remained difficult to understand. This is due in part to a lack of comprehensive measurements of signaling outcomes across ligand-receptor pairs, signaling modes (cis vs. trans), and Fringe modification states. Here, systematic mapping of interactions revealed that each ligand and receptor is unique in terms of its profile of cis- and trans-activation and cis-inhibition activities, and the dependence of these activities on Lfng (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Each receptor-ligand combination has a unique activity profile.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic summary of productive signaling interactions observed here.

Ligand class (Delta vs. Jagged) did not predict the signaling level with either receptor. However, it did correlate strongly with the sign of response to Lfng, which respectively increased or decreased signaling by Delta or Jagged ligands to both receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Amid variability in trans-signaling efficiencies, there was striking uniformity in the ultrasensitivity of Notch responses, which was roughly constant across ligand-receptor-Fringe combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>).</p><p>Including cis-interactions revealed additional differences among ligand and receptor variants. All ligands interacted with both Notch1 and Notch2 in cis, but did so with effects that varied across ligand-receptor-Fringe combinations. Broadly, Delta ligands cis-inhibited only Notch1, and cis-activated Notch2 at levels exceeding the maximal Notch2 trans-signaling observed here, while Jagged ligands cis-inhibited both receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Overall, the effects of cis-ligands were complex, with signaling activity often exhibiting Fringe dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), a biphasic dependence on ligand level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and, in some cases, sensitivity to trans-activating ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Notably, Lfng had different impacts on cis- and trans-interactions for some ligand-receptor combinations such as Jag1-Notch2 and Jag2-Notch2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting the possibility that cis- and trans-activation may involve different molecular mechanisms.</p><p>Lfng-dependent trans-inhibition of Notch1 by Jag1 has been shown to play a key role in some contexts such as angiogenesis, where it inhibits Dll4-Notch1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pedrosa et al., 2015</xref>) and the embryonic pancreas, where it inhibits Dll1-Notch1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golson et al., 2009</xref>). Our results explain how trans-inhibition could result from the combination of strong binding with weak activation, which was most pronounced for Jag1-Notch1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Further, this effect was enhanced by Lfng, which increased binding strength in the ligand binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), while decreasing signaling in both the coculture and plated ligand assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3I</xref>), consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kakuda and Haltiwanger, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). No other ligand exhibited this combination of strong binding and weak activation. These results suggest that Notch1 trans-inhibition may be a core function of Jag1, and could help explain the sometimes divergent behavior of Jag1 mutants compared with other ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chrysostomou et al., 2020</xref>). However, it is possible that positive Jag1-Notch1 signaling is also functionally important in some contexts, since weak signaling from Jag1-expressing OP9 cells prevents T-cell progenitors from differentiating into the B-cell lineage, in contrast with no-ligand controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lehar et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>A major question is how Notch receptors integrate information from cis- and trans-ligands. Previous work introduced a general model in which cis- and trans-ligands compete to form different ligand-receptor complexes. In this model, each complex may have a distinct binding strength and a distinct signaling efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Formosa-Jordan and IbaÃ±es, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sprinzak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>). The competitive binding model is indirectly supported by previous observations that the same conserved domain of the Serrate ligand is required for both cis-inhibitory and trans-activating Notch interactions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cordle et al., 2008</xref>), that interdomain flexibility in receptors and ligands could facilitate antiparallel binding in both cis and trans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Luca et al., 2015</xref>), and that synthetic synNotch ligands can cis-inhibit their receptors when expressed in the same cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morsut et al., 2016</xref>). However, it has not been tested systematically.</p><p>Our results are broadly consistent with the competitive binding model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). For example, when strongly cis-activating ligands compete with strongly trans-activating ligands, they cause no net decrease in signaling, as observed when cis-Delta ligands interact with Notch2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). By contrast, when a strongly binding cis-ligand produces a weak or inactive complex, it can cis-inhibit. In general, combinations that did not cis-activate (Jagged-Notch1) showed relatively stronger cis-inhibition than combinations that cis-activated weakly (Delta-Notch1, Jag1-Notch2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Cis-Jag2-Notch1 was the strongest cis-inhibiting combination overall. Because of its unique attributes of strong binding and weak cis-activation, cis-Jag2-Notch1 could operate in a âmutual inactivationâ regime in which a cis-ligand titrates the receptor levels available to potential trans-activating ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">LeBon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). Linear titration of this type is consistent with the roughly linear logarithmic sensitivity observed in dose-response experiments for Notch1 with cis-Jag2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>Our results revealed additional complexities in cis-inhibition. Existing models describe competitive inhibition of Notch signaling in terms of pairwise cis and trans receptor-ligand binding affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">del Ãlamo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Formosa-Jordan and IbaÃ±es, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">LeBon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Luna-Escalante et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sprinzak et al., 2010</xref>). However, in our data, cis-inhibition strength depended on the identity of the receptor, the activating trans-ligand, and the cis-ligand. Strikingly, for Notch1, each type of ligand had a comparative advantage in its ability to cis-inhibit trans-activation by itself compared to other ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). For example, Dll1 cis-inhibited trans-Dll1 signaling more efficiently than trans-Jag2, while Jag2 cis-inhibited trans-Jag2 signaling more efficiently than trans-Dll1. These results hint at the possibility of multi-way interactions, possibly involving oligomeric structures.</p><p>Overall, our results were broadly consistent with earlier work for previously analyzed receptor-ligand pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benedito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kakuda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Song et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stanley and Guidos, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tveriakhina et al., 2018</xref>). However, there were some notable discrepancies. While we observed a negative effect of Lfng on trans Jag1-Notch2 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), consistent with one previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shimizu et al., 2001</xref>), other studies showed either positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hicks et al., 2000</xref>) or no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kakuda et al., 2020</xref>) with this combination. A second notable discrepancy was our observation that Delta-like ligands cis-activate but cannot cis-inhibit Notch2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This conflicts with a report that wt Dll4 cis-inhibited Notch2 in U2OS osteosarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). It is possible that cell type-specific factors prevent Dll4 cis-activation of Notch2 in U2OS cells or that Dll4 cis-inhibition requires some interaction between Dll4 and the N2ICD (absent from our N2ECD-Gal4 receptors). Third, we found that Dll1 trans-activated Notch2 more efficiently than Notch1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), consistent with results from a previous plated ligand assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kakuda et al., 2020</xref>), but conflicting with a coculture assay showing equivalent activation of both receptors by Dll1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tveriakhina et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Looking ahead, a major question is how to understand and predict the behavior of complex pathway profiles involving multiple receptors, ligands, and Fringe proteins. For example, one of the most prevalent Notch component expression profiles, found in cell types within the heart, trachea, forelimb, and other tissues, exhibits high levels of Notch1 and Notch2 as well as moderate levels of all four activating ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Granados et al., 2022</xref>). What signaling properties does this combination of components produce? Which cell types can it signal to or receive signals from? Expanding the approach developed here to allow simultaneous analysis of multiple receptor activities could help to address these questions. On the other hand, directly measuring the signaling properties of all prevalent profiles may be infeasible with current techniques. Therefore, it will be critical to develop quantitative models that predict signaling behaviors among cells based on their pathway expression profiles. The data and analysis provided here should help to create such models, and thereby improve our ability to understand, predict, and control Notch signaling in diverse contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>The pEV-2xHS4-UAS-H2B-Citrine-2xHS4 reporter construct is the same base construct used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nandagopal et al., 2019</xref>, with the modification of the 2xHS4 insulating elements flanking each side of the expression cassette.

First, we analyzed transcription dynamics with a qRT-PCR time course. CHO-K1 senders with integrated Dll1 or Dll4 ligands driven by the Tet-OFF promoter were seeded at a density that would reach confluence in a 24-well plate at the indicated time of collection. Seeded senders were induced to express ligand by reducing 4-epi-Tc concentration in the culture medium from 500 ng/mL to 5 or 10 ng/mL for Dll4 and Dll1 senders, respectively. Media was changed every 24 hr to replenish the proper 4-epi-Tc concentration, and cells were passaged every 72 hr, where applicable. At collection time, cells were spun down and RNA was extracted, followed by cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR analysis. Ligand mRNA expression reached steady-state levels within 24 hr of 4-epi-Tc addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>Second, we analyzed the Tet-OFF promoterâs dependence on cell density. 25,000 CHO-K1 Dll1 or Dll4 sender cells were seeded in a 24-well, 12-well, or 6-well plate (for high, medium, and low density, respectively) and induced to maximal ligand expression by removing 4-epi-Tc from the culture medium.

Notch ligand protein was detected with anti-FLAG tag staining, while GAPDH and NAK ATPase staining served as negative and positive controls, respectively, for detection of surface protein isolation. Dll4 surface levels were undetectable despite cotranslational expression levels similar to a Dll1 cell line with positive signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>), as others have observed in OP9 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shah et al., 2012</xref>). However, this disparity could also reflect a potential dependence of surface protein pulldown efficiency on the number of primary amines (lysines) available for biotinylation in the ECD (Dll1 has 17, while Dll4 has only 9). Similarly, Jag1âs high extracellular lysine count (44) could explain, at least in part, why its surface abundance exceeded that of the other ligands.

For Notch1, single-cell data were not sorted into mCherry bins, but averaged by 4-epi-Tc concentration, because mCherry binning yielded anomalous reporter activities with the NGFR control, possibly due to selection of abnormally large cells when sorting into the high mCherry bins.</p></list-item></list></list-item><list-item><p>Background subtraction was performed by subtracting âleakyâ reporter activity of the receiver (using high 4-epi-Tc concentrations to minimize cis-ligand expression, where applicable) in coculture with âblankâ senders (CHO-K1 wt or C2C12-Nkd parental cells, according to the receiver cell type).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Y-axis normalization was performed as described in each Figure caption. The term, âmax normalizedâ, refers to signaling activities that were divided by trans-signaling in coculture with excess senders expressing relatively high ligand levels (with cis-ligand expression suppressed by high 4-epi-Tc, where applicable.) When signaling activities were background subtracted first, they are referred to as âmin-max normalizedâ. Note: the maximum trans-signaling activity used in these normalizations may not reflect the true reporter activity maximum, especially in cases where cis-activation exceeds trans-activation strength. Additionally, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, maximal trans-signaling used in normalization was relatively weak for Notch2 (only 1.3- to 2.2-fold above background).</p></list-item><list-item><p>In some cases, average signaling activity (from steps #6 and #8 above) was further normalized to average cotranslational ligand expression (mCherry, A.U.) to define a signaling strength metric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4B</xref>). In such cases, saturated data points, defined as those with normalized signaling activity over 0.75 in both dLfng and Lfng conditions, were excluded. Only senders with mCherry levels &lt;75% of the maximum sender expression were used, due to nonlinearities in normalized signaling activity with extremely high ligand expression. This simple normalization method reduced variance in normalized signaling activity, but does not reflect the independently observed ultrasensitivity with respect to ligand expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>).</p></list-item></list><p>Note: all uses of âhistogramâ to describe single-cell fluorescence distributions refer to kernel density estimates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>At least three biological replicates were used for each flow cytometry and qRT-PCR experiment, where biological replicates are distinct samples prepared separately, sometimes in parallel on the same day and sometimes on different days. Two biological replicates were used for RNA-sequencing. Least squares regressions to fit data to lines or Hill functions were computed using scipy.optimize.leastsq.

We note that fits of activating responses to Hill functions could exhibit systematic errors in estimation of maximal signaling activity where observed responses are biphasic (e.g. Dll1 curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) or do not fully saturate (e.g. Jag2 curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). For the biphasic Dll1 curves, only data points in the increasing phase were fit to Hill functions.</p><p>Signaling strength metrics were based on the ligand concentration at which the fitted Hill function crossed a y-axis threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These thresholds were defined as the half-maximum signaling measured for each receptor (separately, due to differences in reporter dynamic range) from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> trans-activation data with Jag2, which signaled most strongly to both receptors. However, Jag2 curves were not fully saturated for either receptor, and errors in the estimation of relative maximum signaling for the two receptors (used to define half-maximal thresholds) could potentially skew relative signaling strengths computed for Notch1 vs. Notch2.</p><p>For linear regressions to compute a fold-change between two conditions, y-intercepts were fixed to (0,0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5âfigure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). For statistically robust comparison of the relative trans-signaling strengths of Dll1 and Jag1 in C2C12-Nkd cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), we pooled data from control and Rfng siRNA treatment conditions (Rfng is reported to potentiate Notch1 signaling but have no effect on Notch2 signaling for both Dll1 and Jag1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kakuda et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>All mean values and 95% confidence intervals were computed based on 10,000 bootstrap replicates with at least n=3 biological replicates.

To evaluate whether the correlation between two paired variables had a slope greater or less than 1, we used one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests implemented in scipyâscipy.stats.wilcoxon.

Although well-studied there remain many puzzling aspects. One is the fact that as well as activating the receptor through a trans-activation, the transmembrane ligands can interact with receptors present in the same cell. These cis-interactions are usually inhibitory, but in some cases, as in the assays used here, they may also be activating. With a total of 6 ligands and 4 receptor there are potentially a wide array of possible outcomes when different combinations are co-expressed in vivo. Here the authors set out to make a systematic analysis of the qualitative and quantitative differences in the signaling output from different receptor ligand combinations, generating sets of &quot;signaling&quot; (ligand expressing) and &quot;receiving&quot; (receptor +/- ligand expressing cells).</p><p>The readout of pathway activity is transcriptional, relying on the fusion of GAL4 in the intracellular part of the receptor. Positive ligand interactions result in proteolytic release of Gal4 that turns on expression of H2B-citrine. As an indicator of ligand and receptor expression levels, they are linked via TA to H2B mCherry and H2B mTurq expression respectively. The authors also manipulate expression of the glycosyltransferase Lunatic-Fringe (LFng) that modifies the EGF repeats in the extracellular domains impacting on their interactions. The testing of multiple ligand receptor combinations at varying expression levels is a tour de force, with over 50 stable cell lines generated, and yields valuable insights although as a whole, the results are quite complex.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Taking a reductionist approach to test systematically differences in the signaling strength, binding strength and cis-interactions from the different ligands in the context of the Notch1 and Notch 2 receptors (they justify well they choice of players to test via this approach) produces a baseline understanding of the different properties and leads to some unexpected and interesting findings. Notably:</p><p>- Jag1 ligand expressing cells failed to activate Notch1 receptor although were capable of activating Notch2. Conversely, Jag2 cells elicited the strongest activation of both receptors. The results with Jag1 are surprising also because it exhibits some of the strongest binding to plate bound ligands. The failure to activate Notch1 has major functional significance and it will be important in future to understanding the mechanistic basis.</p><p>- Jagged ligands have the strongest ciis-inhibitory effects and the receptors differ in their sensitivity to cis-inhibition by Dll ligands. These observations are in keeping with earlier in vivo and cell culture studies. More referencing of those would better place the work in context but it nicely supports and extends previous studies that were conducted in different ways.</p><p>- Responses to most trans-activating ligands showed a degree of ultrasensitivity but this was not the case for cis-interactions where effects were more linear. This has implications for the way the two mechanisms operate and for how the signaling levels will be impacted by ligand expression levels.</p><p>- Qualitatively similar results are obtained in a second cell line, suggesting they reflect fundamental properties of the ligands/receptors.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>One weakness is that the methods used to quantify the expression of ligands and receptors rely on co-translation of tagged nuclear H2B proteins. These may not accurately capture surface levels/correctly modified transmembrane proteins. In general, the multiple conditions tested partly compensate for the concerns - for example as Jag1 cells do activate Notch2 even if they do not activate Notch1 some Jag1 must be getting to the surface. But even with Notch2, Jag1 activities are on the lower side, making it important to clarify, especially given the different outcomes with the plated ligands. Similarly, is the fact that all ligands &quot;signalled strongest to Notch2&quot; an inherent property or due to differences in surface levels Notch 2 compared to Notch1?.. The results would be considerably strengthened by calibration of the ligand/receptor levels (and ideally their sub-cellular localizations). Assessing the membrane protein levels would be relatively straightforward to perform on som eof the basic conditions because their ligand constructs contain Flag tags, making it plausible to relate surface protein to H2B, and there are antibodies available for Notch1 and Notch2</p><p>In the revised version this has been addressed to some extent. A figure showing the relationship between co-translated mTurquiose and surface receptor expression for some clones (Figure 1-figure supplement 1B) goes some way to address the concerns that differences in Notch1 and Notch 2 could be due to the receptor levels. The data analyzing surface ligand levels is more equivocal, (a Western blot for biotinylated surface proteins), as the levels detected vary substantially between Dll1 and Dll4 (the latter barely detectable). But as a signal for surface expression of Jag1 was obtained this rules-out one concern that this ligand was failing to reach the surface. A discussion of the caveats of the approach is warranted, to make clear the limitations.</p><p>Cis-activation as a mode of signaling has only emerged from these synthetic cell culture assays raising questions about its physiological relevance. Cis-activation is only seen at the higher ligand (Dll1, Dll4) levels, how physiological are the expression levels of the ligands/receptors in these assays? Is it likely that this would make a major contribution in vivo? Is it possible that the cells convert themselves into &quot;signaling&quot; and &quot;receiving&quot; sub-populations within the culture by post-translational mechanism. Again some analysis of the ligand/receptors in the cultures would be a valuable addition to show whether or not there are major heterogeneities.</p><p>It is hard to appreciate how much cell to cell variability in the &quot;output&quot; there is. For example, low &quot;outputs&quot; could arise from fewer cells becoming activated or from all cells being activated less. As presented, only the latter is considered. That maybe already evident in their data, but not easy for the reader to distinguish from the way they are presented. For example, in many of the graphs, data have been processed through multiple steps of normalization. Some discussion/consideration this point is needed.</p><p>Impact:</p><p>Overall, cataloguing of the outcomes from the different ligand-receptor combinations, both in cis and trans, yields a valuable baseline for those investigating their functional roles in different contexts. There is still a long way to go before it will be possible to make a predictive model for outcomes based on expression levels, but this work gives an idea about the landscape and the complexities. This is especially important now that signaling relationships are frequently hypothesised based on single cell transcriptomic data. The results presented here demonstrate that the relationships are not straightforward when multiple players are involved.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91422.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors extend their previous studies on trans-activation, cis-inhibition (PMID: 25255098) and cis-activation (PMID: 30628888) of the Notch pathway.

As the reviewer points out, the ability of Jag1 to activate Notch2 demonstrates that expressed Jag1 is competent for signaling. Further, in some cases, Jag1-Notch2 activation can be comparable to Dll1-Notch2 activation (Figure 2A). Following the reviewerâs suggestion, we performed a Western blot for multiple expression levels for each of three surface ligands (Dll1, Dll4, Jag1) (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2). This blot revealed a signal for surface expression of Jag1. Interpretation is complicated by the expected dependence of the efficiency of surface protein purification on the number of primary amines in the protein, which varies among these ligands, and qualitatively correlates with the staining intensity. While this makes quantitative interpretation difficult, this result further supports the notion that Jag1 is present on the cell surface. Finally, we note that high signaling activity need not, in general, directly correlate with surface expression levels. In fact, one study showed an example in which increased ligand activity occurred with decreased basal ligand surface levels (Antfolk et al., 2017). While one would ideally like to know all parameters of the system, including surface protein levels, rates of recycling, etc. the perspective taken here is that the net effect of these many post-translational processing steps can be subsumed into the overall relationship between the expression of the protein (which, in our case, is read out by the co-translational reporter) and its activity, which is relevant for the behavior of developmental circuits, among other systems. To address this comment, we now explicitly mention the limitation of mCherry as a proxy for surface protein, and add a reference to previous work highlighting the relationship between surface levels and ligand activity.</p><p>In terms of the dependence of signaling on Notch levels, the metric of signaling activity used here is explicitly normalized by the mTurquoise co-translational reporter of Notch expression to account for differences in receptor expression across receiver clones. We have added a new figure to show the variation in expression (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A) and to demonstrate this normalization (Figure 1âfigure supplement 5). Having said that, as the reviewer correctly points out, we cannot directly address the dependence on surface receptor levels with mTurquoise alone. To address this comment, we have added a figure that shows cotranslational and surface receptor expression for a subset of our receiver clones (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B). Although antibody binding strengths may vary, it appears unlikely that higher surface levels could explain most ligandsâ preferential activation of Notch2 over Notch1, since Notch2 levels were lower than Notch1 levels in both surface expression and cotranslational expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Cis-activation as a mode of signaling has only emerged from these synthetic cell culture assays raising questions about its physiological relevance.

Cis-activation is observed across a large dynamic range of ligand expression, possibly including non-physiologically high levels. However, our previous work (Nandagopal et al, eLife 2019) showed that cis-activation does not require over-expression, as it occurred in unmodified Caco-2 and NMuMG cells with their endogenous ligand and receptor expression levels. As shown here in Figure 4B, cis-activation for Notch2 increases monotonically and is substantial even at intermediate ligand concentrations. In other cases, cis-activation is maximal at intermediate concentrations. We agree that the in vivo role remains unclear, and is difficult to determine due to the typical close contacts among cells in tissues. Therefore, these assays do not speak to in vivo relevance. Note that we can, however, rule out the possibility of trans signaling between well-mixed cell populations at these densities (Figure 4A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is hard to appreciate how much cell-to-cell variability in the &quot;output&quot; there is.

The methods described here are a step towards generating cells expressing more complex arrays of ligands, receptors, and Fringes to better mimic in vivo effects on Notch function.</p><p>In addition, the fact that their transactivation results with most ligands on Notch1 and 2 in the presence or absence of Lfng were largely consistent with previous publications provides confidence that the author's assays are working properly.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the thoughtful comments and feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>It was unusual that the engineered CHO cells expressing Notch1-Gal4 were not activated at all by co-culture with Jag1-expressing CHO cells. Many previous reports have shown that Jag1 can activate Notch1 in co-culture assays, including when Notch1 was expressed in CHO cells. Interestingly, when the authors used Jag1-Fc in a plate coating assay, it did activate Notch1 and could be inhibited by the expression of Lfng.</p></disp-quote><p>In our assays, we do in fact also see some signaling of Jag1 to Notch1, especially when dLfng is coexpressed (Figure 2âfigure supplement 4, formerly Figure 2âfigure supplement 3). While these levels are lower than those observed for other ligand-receptor combinations, they are significantly elevated compared to baseline. In specific natural contexts, it will be important to determine whether the weak but non-zero Jag1-Notch1 signaling acts negatively to suppress signaling from other ligands, or provides weak but potentially functionally important levels of signaling. Evidence for both modes exists in the literature. To address this, we have expanded the discussion of Jag1-Notch1 signaling and added references to other work on Jag1-Notch1 signaling to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The cell surface level of the ligands was determined by flow cytometry of a co-translated fluorescent protein.

Measurements</p><p>encompassed signaling activity for ligand trans-activation, cis-activation, cis-inhibition, and activity modulation by Lfng. The most striking observations of the study are that JAG1 has no detectable activity as a Notch1 ligand when presented on a cell (though it does have activity when immobilized on a surface), even though it is an effective cis-inhibitor of Notch1 signaling by other ligands, and that DLL1 and DLL4 exhibit cis-activating activity for Notch1 and especially for Notch2. Notwithstanding the artificiality of the system and some of its shortcomings, the results should nevertheless be a valuable resource for the Notch signaling community.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The work is systematic and comprehensive, addressing questions that are of importance to the community of researchers investigating mammalian Notch proteins, their activation by ligands, and the modulation of ligand activity by LFng.</p><p>(2) A quantitative and thorough analysis of the data is presented.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The manuscript is primarily descriptive and does not delve into the underlying, mechanistic origin or source of the different ligand activities.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the goals of this paper were largely to discover the range of signaling modes that occur.

However, the cells divide within the cultured period of 22-24 h and can potentially trans-activate each other.</p></disp-quote><p>If measured cis-activation signal arises solely from trans-activation, then the measured cis-activation signal per cell should increase with cell density, since trans-activation per cell does depend on cell density (Figure 4A). However, for the strongest cis-activators (Dll1- and Dll4-Notch2), signaling magnitude is similar when these cells are cultured sparsely or at confluence, which would otherwise allow efficient trans signaling (Figure 5A). Thus, for Dll1- and Dll4-Notch2 receivers, total signaling strength per cell depends little or not at all on the opportunity to signal intercellularly. Moreover, cis-activation signal for the Dll1- and Dll4-Notch2 combinations exceeded the maximum trans-signaling levels we could achieve for the same receivers when cis-ligand was suppressed (Figure 4B). These results argue that cis interactions dominate signaling in this context. However, we have not ruled out the possibility that trans-signaling between sister cells after division contributes to the comparatively weak cis-activation observed for Notch1 receivers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>As outlined in the public review, there is a question of whether the nuclear H2B accurately reflects the surface levels of the transmembrane proteins (ligand and receptor).

The authors should add some text to the Discussion to explain why they think this is happening in their engineered cells. One possibility is that the CHO cells express Manic fringe (Mfng) which is known to reduce Jag1-Notch1 activation. Data for Mfng levels in CHO cells were not included in Supplemental Table 2. Knocking down all three Fringes in CHO cells might increase Jag1-Notch1 activation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is already addressed in a sentence in the results: âStrikingly, while Jag1 sender cells failed to activate Notch1 receivers above background (Figure 2D), plate-bound Jag1-ext-Fc activated Notch1 only ~3-fold less efficiently than it activated Notch2 (Figure 3B-D). This suggests that the natural endocytic activation mechanism, or potential differences in tertiary structure between the expressed and recombinant Jag1 extracellular domains, could play roles in preventing Jag1-Notch1 signaling in coculture.â Regarding the point about Mfng, we added a note to Supplementary Table about other CHO-K1 expression data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 1-supplemental figure 1: Both the Notch1-Jag1 and Notch1-Jag2 cells show high expression of Jag1 in low 4epi, but any higher concentration reduces to control levels.

This is explained by the sensitivity of the Tet-OFF promoter to culture density (Figure 4âfigure supplement 2).
