growth. Sestrins are stress-inducible proteins, which suppress both mTORC1 and ER stress; however, the role of Sestrins in colon physiology and tumorigenesis has been elusive due to the lack of studies in human tissues or in appropriate animal models. In this study, we show that human <italic>SESN2</italic> expression is elevated in the colon of ulcerative colitis patients but is lost upon p53 inactivation during colon carcinogenesis. In mouse colon, Sestrin2 was critical for limiting ER stress and promoting the recovery of epithelial cells after inflammatory injury. During colitis-promoted tumorigenesis, Sestrin2 was shown to be an important mediator of p53’s control over mTORC1 signaling and tumor cell growth. These results highlight Sestrin2 as a novel tumor suppressor, whose downregulation can accelerate both colitis and colon carcinogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12204.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12204.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12204.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>An organ that is inflamed has an increased risk of developing cancer. Inflammation can be elicited in various ways; and intestinal inflammation and colon cancer development are often associated with a protein complex – called mTORC1 – being overactive in the tissue. This protein complex has been studied in other contexts and is known to instruct cells to produce more proteins. However, when too much protein is made too quickly, cells cannot carry out their routine quality checks. This, in turn, can lead to unfolded proteins accumulating in the cell, which is stressful and damaging, and can cause inflammation. Increased production of proteins and other biomolecules can also allow the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells.</p><p>Other recently discovered proteins – called sestrins – can counteract the cancer-promoting effects of overactive mTORC1. Sestrins achieve this via several mechanisms, but as yet almost nobody had studied the role of these proteins in intestinal inflammation and colon cancer.</p><p>Ro, Xue et al. deleted the genes for two members of the sestrin family, called Sestrin2 and Sestrin3, in mice and showed that their colons were more prone to inflammation. Additional analysis showed that people with ulcerative colitis – a condition in which the colon is chronically inflamed – have elevated levels of Sestrin2, whereas very low levels of Sestrin2 could be detected in tissue samples from patients with colon cancers. These data suggested that Sestrin2 might be trying to protect cells from injury and acts as a barrier to cancer formation.</p><p>Ro, Xue et al. then used biochemical techniques in human cancer cells grown in the laboratory to show that Sestrin2 inhibits mTORC1, making these cells grow less. Colon cancer cells with little or no Sestrin2 were also more resistant to chemotherapy than control cells with normal levels of Sestrin2. Lastly, a type of colon cancer that is associated with inflammation grew faster in mice that lacked the gene for Sestrin2. Taken together these findings represent evidence that Sestrin2 acts as a tumor suppressor in the colon. Future experiments might investigate how losing Sestrin2 makes these cells more resistant to chemotherapy and whether sestrins act as tumor suppressors in other tissues as well.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12204.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12204.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Sestrin2</kwd><kwd>colitis</kwd><kwd>colon cancer</kwd><kwd>tumor suppressor</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA148828, DK095201, DK102850, AG024824, AG013283, DK034933, DK089503, CA046592, GM008322</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Allison</given-names></name><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Yatrik M</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Jun Hee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009160</institution-id><institution>Lawrence Ellison Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG-NS-0932-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Jun Hee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>276556</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Xiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>American Gastroenterological Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Xiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sestrin2 loss could be a universal mechanism of human colon carcinogenesis that allows for barrier dysfunction, mTORC1 hyperactivation, unrestricted tumor growth and chemoresistance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is an important contributor to cancer mortality and morbidity.

ER stress has been shown to be critically involved in the pathogenesis of colitis and colon inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertolotti et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaser et al, 2008</xref>), which is an important risk factor of CRC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thorsteinsdottir et al, 2011</xref>) and a well-characterized tumor promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grivennikov et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Terzic et al, 2010</xref>). Mechanisms of how the mTORC1 and ER stress signaling pathways are regulated in the colon, especially during colon injury, inflammation and tumorigenesis, are poorly understood.</p><p>Sestrins are a family of stress-inducible proteins that are widely conserved throughout animal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al, 2013</xref>). Sestrins were originally identified as a target of the tumor suppressor p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Budanov et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Velasco-Miguel et al, 1999</xref>). Sestrins have two important functions, suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Budanov et al, 2004</xref>) and inhibiting mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Budanov and Karin, 2008</xref>). The ROS-suppressing effect of Sestrins is dependent, at least partially, on mTORC1 inhibition, which promotes autophagic degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria or an Nrf2 inhibitor Keap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bae et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Woo et al, 2009</xref>). However, Sestrin can also function as an active oxidoreductase that can directly detoxify ROS such as alkylhydroperoxides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al, 2015a</xref>). Sestrins inhibit mTORC1 through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the subsequent inactivation of Rheb GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Budanov and Karin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanli et al, 2012</xref>). Independently of AMPK, Sestrins can also inhibit Rag GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chantranupong et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al, 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parmigiani et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peng et al, 2014</xref>), which are essential for mTORC1 activity. Sestrin-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 is also critical for limiting protein synthesis upon unfolded protein accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruning et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al, 2014</xref>) or amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peng et al, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wolfson et al, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ye et al, 2015</xref>), thereby suppressing ER stress or nutrient crisis.</p><p>In light of these important cellular functions, the present study assessed if Sestrin functions as a coordinator of mTORC1 and ER stress signaling pathways in the colon during intestinal inflammation and carcinogenesis. Our data collected from patient samples, mouse models of colitis and colitis-associated cancer, cultured colon cancer cell lines as well as data mining of large-scale transcriptome analyses, concertedly indicate that Sestrin2, a member of the Sestrin family, is important for proper regulation of mTORC1 and ER stress pathways during colon injury, and thereby functions as a suppressor of colitis and colon cancer development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of Sestrin2 sensitizes mice to colon injury</title><p>Increased ER stress and excessive ROS accumulation are hallmarks of colon inflammation and colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fritz et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu and Li, 2012</xref>).

Therefore, we analyzed mTORC1 downstream target proteins in colon cancer and normal colon tissues from WT and <italic>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice through immunohistochemistry. Phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, which is mediated by an mTORC1 target p70 S6 kinase (S6K), is dramatically increased in tumors isolated from <italic>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Indeed, SW480 cells, a human colon cancer cell line that displays very low p53 activity, demonstrated a strong downregulation of Sestrin2 expression, while RKO and HCT116 cells, which have wild-type p53 activity, expressed a relatively high amount of Sestrin2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

(<bold>F</bold>) Current model of how Sestrin2 suppresses colon cancer progression. During colitis, Sestrin2 promotes restoration of colon homeostasis after injury through limiting ER stress. However, during carcinogenesis, p53 is inactivated and Sestrin2 expression is downregulated, which subsequently causes hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling and promotes colon cancer development and growth. The p53-Sestrin2 axis may also be important for the effect of chemotherapy in attenuating colon cancer growth.

To understand if Sestrin2, acting as a p53 target, has an essential role in regulating mTORC1 and colon cancer cell growth, Sestrin2 was overexpressed in p53-deficient HCT116 cells and SW480 cells, which have low <italic>SESN2</italic> expression and high mTORC1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Restoration of Sestrin2 suppressed serum-induced phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates, S6K and 4E-BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>), but not mTORC2 substrate AKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Sestrin2 silencing in RKO cells enhanced the mTORC1 signaling in both starved and serum-stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), indicating that endogenous Sestrin2 indeed functions to inhibit mTORC1 signaling in human colon cancer cells.</p><p>As mTORC1 is known to control cell growth, we examined the effect of Sestrin2 on clonogenic growth of RKO and SW480 cells. A colony forming assay of Sestrin2-silenced RKO cells demonstrated an increase in clonogenic growth compared to the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), suggesting that Sestrin2 is an inhibitor of cancer cell growth. To further investigate if this Sestrin2 activity is dependent on mTORC1 hyperactivation, we treated control and Sestrin2-silenced cells with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1. Rapamycin inhibited clonogenic growth in both control and Sestrin2-silenced cells, and interestingly, the growth difference between control and Sestrin2-silenced cells was diminished upon rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). These results indicate that Sestrin2 attenuates cancer cell growth primarily through inhibition of a hyperactive mTORC1. On the other hand, expression of Sestrin2 in SW480 cells substantially inhibited clonogenic growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), supporting the idea that Sestrin2 is critical for inhibition of colon cancer cell overgrowth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Sestrin2 loss confers chemotherapy resistance to colon cancer cells</title><p>As a stress-inducible cell growth regulator, Sestrin2 may be also important for the responsiveness of colon cancer cells to chemotherapeutic treatments. To examine this possibility, we treated control and Sestrin2-silenced RKO cells with two representative chemotherapeutic agents, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and irinotecan (CPT-11). Although control cell growth was strongly suppressed by 5-FU or CPT-11, Sestrin2 silencing rendered cells less susceptible to the chemotherapeutic drug treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>), suggesting that Sestrin2 loss may confer chemotherapy resistance to colon cancer cells.</p><p>We also examined Sestrin2 expression and mTORC1 signaling in RKO cells when treated with 5-FU and CPT-11. After 5-FU or CPT-11 treatments, Sestrin2 expression was slightly elevated in WT cells (sh-Luc; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D,E</xref>). Interestingly, mTORC1 signaling, monitored by p-S6K and p-4E-BP1, was prominently upregulated in sh-<italic>SESN2</italic> cells after 5-FU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D</xref>), suggesting that Sestrin2 suppresses mTORC1 activation after 5-FU treatment. In contrast, CPT-11 treatment reduced mTORC1 signaling, and Sestrin2 silencing led to modest but persistent mTORC1 upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2E</xref>). This mTORC1 upregulation as a result of Sestrin2 loss could have conferred chemoresistance to RKO cells against 5-FU and CPT-11.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The current study reveals how the stress-inducible protein Sestrin2 can coordinate ER stress and mTORC1 signaling pathways to maintain epithelial homeostasis and limit colitis and colon cancer development during colon injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Yet, it is still possible that the mechanisms underlying increased susceptibility to colitis and colon cancer are separate from each other. During colitis stress, Sestrin2 functions to suppress ER stress and to promote regeneration of colon epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). However, Sestrin2 expression is lost during human colon carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) through inactivation of tumor suppressor p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Because expression of Sestrin2 is important for suppressing hyperactive mTORC1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and tumor outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), loss of Sestrin2 expression in human colon cancer serves as a critical tumorigenic mechanism. Indeed, Sestrin2 negatively controlled cell growth in various human colon cancer cell lines, which was dependent on mTORC1 regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, inactivation of Sestrin2 conferred chemoresistance to colon cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), rendering them difficult to treat with conventional chemotherapeutic methods.</p><p>In addition to mTORC1 regulation, Sestrin2 is also known to reduce oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Budanov et al, 2004</xref>) by functioning as an activator of anti-ROS transcription factor Nrf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bae et al, 2013</xref>) or as an alkylhydroperoxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al, 2015a</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the loss of Sestrin2 can contribute to cellular accumulation of ROS, which can promote DNA damage and genomic mutations that facilitate tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sablina et al, 2005</xref>). However, analysis of γ-H2AX did not show a significant increase in DNA damage between colon tumors of WT and <italic>Sesn2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J,M</xref>). This result suggests that the mTORC1-regulatory function, rather than the ROS-inhibiting function, is the main contributor of Sestrin2’s tumor suppressive activity in colon tissues. Nevertheless, it is still possible that Sestrin2 attenuates tumor growth, at least partially by inhibiting tumor-associated epithelial damage and inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), which are well-characterized promoters of colon cancer growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grivennikov et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Terzic et al, 2010</xref>). It is also possible that Sestrin2 exerts tumor suppressive activity additionally through its apoptosis-inducing function, which was recently discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The mTORC1-suppressing and ROS-reducing activities are shared between all members of the Sestrin family (Sestrin1-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nogueira et al, 2008</xref>). However, only Sestrin2 was shown to be downregulated in human colon cancer tissues, and expression of Sestrin1 and Sestrin3 was unchanged or slightly upregulated in the colon cancer tissues. Nevertheless, Sestrin1 and Sestrin3 are strongly downregulated in several types of cancer tissues, such as lung cancers and lymphomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that they may be involved in anti-tumorigenic processes in tissues other than the colon. <italic>Drosophila</italic> Sestrin, which is the only Sestrin homologue expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, was formerly shown to be a feedback inhibitor of mTORC1, which can suppress hyperplastic tissue growth provoked by oncogenic mTORC1 hyperactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al, 2010</xref>). As the current study demonstrates Sestrin2 to be an inhibitor of colon cancer growth, future studies on the role of Sestrin1 and Sestrin3 in carcinogenic processes of other tissues may reveal a conserved tumor-suppressive role of Sestrin-family proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>For immunoblotting, we obtained S6K (sc-230), PERK (sc-13073) and p-PERK (sc-32577) antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, human Sestrin2 (10795-1-AP) antibody from Proteintech, Chicago, IL, BiP (3177), CHOP (2895), p-Thr389 S6K (9234), p-Ser235/236 S6 (2211), S6 (2317), p-Thr37/46 4E-BP (2855), 4E-BP (9452), p-Ser473 AKT (9273) and AKT (4691) antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology, Danverse, MA, actin (JLA20) antibody from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB, Iowa city, IA), and tubulin (T5168) antibody from Sigma, St. Louis, MO.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Tumor suppressive role of Sestrin2 during colitis and colon carcinogenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The current paper by Ro et al. demonstrates a tumor suppressive role for the SESN2 gene in colorectal cancer. Using a plethora of complementary approaches, the authors propose that loss of SESN2 is a key event during the development of colorectal cancer. The paper includes a number of mechanistic investigations depicting a tumor suppressive pathway whereby stress induces p53, which then induces SESN2, which then represses mTOR activity to suppress tumor growth.</p><p>The reviewers discussed the manuscript and decided to encourage resubmission of a revised manuscript addressing several major concerns:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-C</xref>: It is not clear where these samples were obtained from and how they were analyzed. What was used as a control? Although there was a trend for mRNA increase of Sesn2 and Sesn3 in patients (n=10), the error bar is pretty big, which makes the data weak. If the authors really want to make this point, more patients samples are needed.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. According to the working hypothesis, Sesn2 protects from ER stress and inflammation. Nevertheless, there is no significant difference between 2 mouse strains in body weight during first 7 days of treatment indicating that Sesn2 is not directly involved in control of inflammation and the observed phenotype might be a residual effect of Sesn2 inactivation. The effects of Sesn2 have to be assessed immediately after DSS treatment, and the impact of the DSS treatment on tissue morphology, regulation of Sesn2 protein expression, mTORC1 activity, ER stress levels and the inflammation should be addressed.</p><p>3) The mice used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> are different ages and are not comparable. It is not clear why the authors used 6-month old mice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> rather than the younger mice as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Please clarify.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>/F only DSS-treated mice are analyzed. To prove their claim the authors should compare the levels of ER stress in untreated and DSS-treated mice analyzing Sesn2 expression and the expression of the ER markers. Moreover, the protein extracts were not well normalized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and the actin marker is overexposed. Also the role of Sesn2 and ER stress in regulation of cell death is not addressed directly and not quantitated.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: The subtle difference in mRNA levels between normal tissue and in tumors can be explained by compositions of different cell types in normal and tumor samples. Surprisingly, there is no significant downregulation of Sesn2 expression during cancer progression. Did the authors carry out an analysis of Sesn2 locus to find if Sesn2 locus has undergone LOH in tumors? Also related to this figure, unlike TP53, which is mutated in about half of all colorectal cancers, SESN2 is rarely mutated. The authors mined several public datasets demonstrating that SESN2 expression is lower in tumors relative to normal tissues. Is this lower expression in human tumors due to mutation or loss of p53? How is SESN2 expression between tumors expressing wild type versus mutant p53? Reanalysis of the various datasets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> partitioning tumors based on p53 status would be a significant addition to the paper and overall model. Since the p53 field is heavily debating which of tis transcriptional targets carries tumor suppressive activity, this would be a good contribution to the field.</p><p>6) The experiments on cancer are not compatible with the experiments on colitis as different conditions were used for these experiments. What is the mouse age? Does Sesn2 protects from colitis, ER stress and cell death in the mice treated with 1.5% DSS in the colitis study. It is also not clear how tumor sizes and tumor load were analyzed.</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> there is no evidence that Sesn2 expression and mTORC1 activity is somehow affected in tumor samples in control mice. Also the data on 4E-BP1 staining look odd because several differently phosphorylated forms of 4E-BP1 usually appear when cells are stained with 4E-BP1 antibody. Moreover, to analyze mTORC1 activity S6K phosphorylation data should be added to the experiment and several samples should be presented.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: It was recently published by Agarwal et al., Mol. Can. Res 2015 that p53 inactivation in colon cancer cells led to strong suppression of Sesn2 expression as well as expression of some other p53-dependent mTORC1 regulators such as TSC2. Moreover, the control of mTORC1 in HCT116 cells was attributed to regulation of lysosomal dynamic of TSC2 and Rheb but not Sesn2 activity.</p><p>9) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and D</xref> are inconsistent. The number and size of colonies look similar between sh-Luc and sh-Sesn2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and quite different in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>. Moreover, it is not clear how the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is relevant to the other parts of the paper. Does 5-Fu and CPT-11 treatments affect mTORC1 activity? Is mTORC1 responsible for the potential effect of Sesn2 on colony formation?</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>: Despite the observed phenotypes on colon morphology, it is not clear which mechanisms are responsible for these phenotypes: whether they involve ER stress and mTORC1 regulation or both. To study whether inhibition of inflammation and colon carcinogenesis by Sesn2 is mediated by mTORC1 the authors should verify that the effects observed in Sesn2-null cells can be reversed by treatment with mTORC1 inhibitors.</p><p>11) If Sestrin level were modulated during colitis, the authors should examine the expression levels of Sestrins in DSS-induced colitis model. Are there any changes of Sestrins expression (both mRNA and protein level) before and after DSS treatment in mice?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12204.041</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers discussed the manuscript and decided to encourage resubmission of a revised manuscript addressing several major concerns: 1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-C</xref>: It is not clear where these samples were obtained from and how they were analyzed.

The normal tissue is adjacent, non-inflamed tissue. These tissues were histologically confirmed and described previously (Gastroenterology 145:831-41). We have clarified this information and cited proper references in the revised manuscript.</p><p>In addition, we realized that the presented data are somewhat misleading because the error bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-C</xref> of the original manuscript represented standard deviation (SD) in patient samples, which is large in nature. Specifically, SD does not reflect the power of the sample size; therefore, analyzing more patients would not help reduce this error bar. With n=10 per group, which is a reasonable sample size, we were able to detect strong statistical significance in the changes in expression of Sestrin2 and Sestrin3 between control and ulcerative colitis groups (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01 and <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, respectively), and error bars made from the standard error of the mean (SEM) did not overlap between these samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-C</xref>).</p><p>To eliminate the possibility of this potential confusion, we have used SEM error bars, which do reflect the power of the sample size, throughout the manuscript. We also wanted to note that we have eliminated the Crohn’s disease group from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-C</xref>, because they did not show any statistically significant differences from control group samples.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: According to the working hypothesis, Sesn2 protects from ER stress and inflammation. Nevertheless, there is no significant difference between 2 mouse strains in body weight during first 7 days of treatment indicating that Sesn2 is not directly involved in control of inflammation and the observed phenotype might be a residual effect of Sesn2 inactivation. The effects of Sesn2 have to be assessed immediately after DSS treatment, and the impact of the DSS treatment on tissue morphology, regulation of Sesn2 protein expression, mTORC1 activity, ER stress levels and the inflammation should be addressed.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that Sestrin2 may not be directly involved in the control of inflammation. Indeed, our bone marrow transplantation results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) suggest that Sestrin2 in epithelia, rather than in inflammatory cells, is more important for colon homeostasis during DSS insults. Therefore, we performed the reviewer’s suggested experiment by examining the colons of WT and <italic>Sesn2</italic>- KO mice right after the 7 days of DSS treatment (DSS – 7D ONLY; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with the observation that DSS-induced body weight losses were not significantly different between WT and <italic>Sesn2</italic>-KO mice at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), there were no detectable changes in colon length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), which quantitatively represents tissue damage. Histological degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), inflammatory gene expression (<italic>TNFα</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and ER stress target gene expression (<italic>Xbp1s</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>) also did not show any significant difference between the two groups.</p><p>According to these new results and the reviewer’s suggestion, we have clarified that Sestrin2 is more important in the recovery process, rather than in the initial response to injury, by rewriting text in the Abstract and subtitles.</p><p> <italic>3) The mice used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> are different ages and are not comparable. It is not clear why the authors used 6-month old mice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> rather than the younger mice as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Please clarify.</italic> </p><p>As the reviewer indicated, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> was done with 6-month old mice, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> was done with 4-month old mice (1 month after bone marrow transplantation). Both ages are considered to be within the same stage of development/aging, and the mice are age-matched within each experimental set.</p><p>The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> should be interpreted in a separate context because the mice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> have undergone bone marrow transplantation, which is a severe intervention involving a lethal dose of irradiation. We believe that this procedure made a larger impact than the age difference, and the severe procedure is the reason why the colitis-inducing effect of DSS is different between these two experiments. Still, both of these results solidly support our conclusion that Sestrin2 in the non-hematopoietic compartment is more important for protecting the colon from DSS-induced damage.</p><p>In addition, one of our cancer cohorts (n=7) demonstrated that one week of 2.5% DSS treatment killed all two-month-old <italic>Sesn2</italic>-KO mice within the following two weeks, but not WT mice of the same age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Therefore, the DSS sensitivity of Sestrin2-deficient mice does not appear to be age-dependent.</p><p> <italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>/F only DSS-treated mice are analyzed. To prove their claim the authors should compare the levels of ER stress in untreated and DSS-treated mice analyzing Sesn2 expression and the expression of the ER markers. Moreover, the protein extracts were not well normalized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and the actin marker is overexposed. Also the role of Sesn2 and ER stress in regulation of cell death is not addressed directly and not quantitated.</italic> </p><p>As the reviewer suggested, we have analyzed the <italic>Sesn2</italic> expression and ER stress signaling in mice during the course of DSS treatment. Consistent with what was formerly reported (Gastroenterology 144:989-1000), DSS treatment induced prolonged ER stress signaling (monitored by expression of <italic>Xbp1s</italic> and other ER stress target genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) that was accompanied by modestly increased Sestrin2 expression in the recovery phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Although the actin blot of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> was densely exposed, the protein loading was normalized according to the total protein concentration, and non-specific bands in the full image of the same blots (e.g. see CHOP blots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) indicate that the general protein loading was normalized well. In the revised manuscript, we have included additional immunoblot images, in which the actin marker was more lightly exposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In addition, analyses of qRT-PCR data, which was quantitatively normalized by <italic>β-actin</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), further confirmed that ER stress is indeed increased in <italic>Sesn2</italic>-KO mice when compared to WT mice. Quantification of colon length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) unequivocally demonstrated that colons of <italic>Sesn2</italic>-KO mice do not recover from DSS treatment and remain severely damaged. However, it is beyond the scope of our research to determine whether ER stress directly regulates apoptotic cell death or indirectly induces tissue degeneration through disruption of colonic homeostasis.</p><p> <italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The subtle difference in mRNA levels between normal tissue and in tumors can be explained by compositions of different cell types in normal and tumor samples. Surprisingly, there is no significant downregulation of Sesn2 expression during cancer progression. Did the authors carry out an analysis of Sesn2 locus to find if Sesn2 locus has undergone LOH in tumors? Also related to this figure, unlike TP53, which is mutated in about half of all colorectal cancers, SESN2 is rarely mutated. The authors mined several public datasets demonstrating that SESN2 expression is lower in tumors relative to normal tissues. Is this lower expression in human tumors due to mutation or loss of p53? How is SESN2 expression between tumors expressing wild type versus mutant p53? Reanalysis of the various datasets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> partitioning tumors based on p53 status would be a significant addition to the paper and overall model. Since the p53 field is heavily debating which of tis transcriptional targets carries tumor suppressive activity, this would be a good contribution to the field.</italic> </p><p>We wanted to stress that the Sestrin2 mRNA difference between normal colon and tumors is not subtle, considering that these data are collected from a variety of different human samples. In many different analyses, the magnitude of Sestrin2 suppression in tumors is among the top 1-5% of all suppressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The extent of the difference was also exceptionally strong (all studies indicate <italic>P</italic>&lt;10<sub>-4</sub> or much lower; in TCGA analysis, <italic>P</italic>=1.6 x 10<sub>-30</sub>). None of the other cell type markers, such as Villin (VIL1, enterocytes), DLL1 (progenitor cells), F4/80 (EMR1, macrophages), Gr-1 (LY6G5B, leukocytes), or β-catenin (CTNNB), showed such strong changes in expression as observed for Sestrin2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-1E</xref>). Only some stem cell markers, such as Lgr5, were upregulated (not downregulated) in tumor samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A- 1E</xref>). These new analyses were included in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Regarding the LOH, we did perform a copy number analysis for the <italic>Sesn2</italic> locus; it appeared that copy number of the Sestrin2 locus generally, and significantly, decreases with cancer progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). However, the extent of copy number loss was very small (~10%), suggesting that transcriptional downregulation (which is through p53 loss – see below), rather than the LOH, is the major mechanism of Sestrin2 loss during colon cancer progression.</p><p>It is a very insightful suggestion to analyze the correlation between p53 status and Sestrin2 expression in human colon cancer samples. We were able to perform this analysis using the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) dataset, as it has comprehensive information regarding the genomic status of each tumor, determined by whole genome/exome sequencing. From this database, we were able to classify all the colon tumor samples into the two groups. One group (designated as “p53-mutated”) has one or more missense or nonsense coding sequence mutations in the <italic>p53</italic> gene. The other group does not reveal any coding sequence mutations in the <italic>p53</italic> gene; however, it is still possible that these tumors contain <italic>p53</italic> mutations in essential non-coding regions (e.g. promoters, enhancers or introns) or other genomic or epigenetic alterations that can lead to functional p53 inactivation (e.g. MDM2 overexpression). Therefore, this second group was designated as “p53-unknown”.</p><p>Expressions of <italic>SESN2</italic> and other known p53 target genes were analyzed in three different groups: normal colons, “p53-unknown” tumors and “p53-mutated” tumors.</p><p>The analyses gave us very interesting results. First, we found that <italic>SESN2</italic> expression is significantly reduced in “p53-mutated” tumors compared to “p53-unknown” tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting a role of p53 in controlling <italic>SESN2</italic> expression. This difference was consistently observed in three independent <italic>SESN2</italic> probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-C</xref>). Strikingly, there were almost no overlaps of <italic>SESN2</italic> expression levels between the normal colon and “p53-mutated” tumor groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>), while <italic>SESN2</italic> levels in “p53-unknown” tumors overlap with both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>). None of the other known p53 target genes, such as <italic>p21, GADD45A</italic> and <italic>MDM2</italic>, showed this strong correlation: for these genes, considerable overlaps were found between the normal colon and “p53-mutated” tumor groups in individual samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-F</xref>). Nevertheless, expression levels of these genes have a general positive correlation with expression of <italic>SESN2</italic> in individual samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-F</xref>), suggesting that <italic>SESN2, p21, GADD45A</italic> and <italic>MDM2</italic> are all regulated through the same p53-dependent mechanism. Indeed, all of these genes are differentially expressed between “p53-unknown” and “p53-mutated” tumor groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, some p53 target genes, such as apoptosis mediators <italic>BAX, PUMA</italic> and <italic>p53AIP1</italic> or mTORC1 regulators <italic>TSC2, AMPKβ</italic> and <italic>PTEN</italic>, did not show any differential expression between the “p53-unknown” and “p53-mutated” tumor groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-J</xref>), suggesting that the effects of p53 mutations on these genes are minimal in the pathological context of colon carcinogenesis.</p><p>These results collectively highlight <italic>SESN2</italic> as a clinically relevant target of p53 during colon carcinogenesis. As the reviewer indicated, there has been a heavy debate in the p53 field about which of its transcription targets is important for its tumor suppressive activity. As we have demonstrated that <italic>SESN2</italic> is one of the most significant p53 targets in colon carcinogenesis, we agree with the reviewer that this is a very important contribution to the field.</p><p> <italic>6) The experiments on cancer are not compatible with the experiments on colitis as different conditions were used for these experiments. What is the mouse age? Does Sesn2 protects from colitis, ER stress and cell death in the mice treated with 1.5% DSS in the colitis study. It is also not clear how tumor sizes and tumor load were analyzed.</italic> </p><p>As indicated in our original manuscript, the colitis condition (3% or 2.5% DSS) cannot be used for the tumor experiment because it killed the <italic>Sesn2</italic>-KO mice. Also, in the tumor study, we do multiple rounds of DSS treatment and allow the mice to age for an extended period, as it takes time for a tumor to develop. The timeline for both experiments begins with an AOM injection when the mice are 2 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) or 4 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, after bone marrow transplantation) of age. After the DSS treatments and tumor incubation periods (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), the mice in these studies reach the end of the experiment at around 6 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) or 8 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), at which point the analyses were performed. Therefore, regardless of the DSS concentration, the DSS colitis experiment and the AOM/DSS experiment should be considered as separate experiments.</p><p>The mechanisms underlying increased susceptibility to colitis and colon cancer may be different from each other. For example, resolution of ER stress and subsequent recovery from DSS insult may be important for the increased colitis phenotype of <italic>Sesn2</italic>-KO mice, while Sestrin2-dependent suppression of mTORC1 and cell growth could be more critical for increased susceptibility of <italic>Sesn2</italic>-KO mice to colon cancer development. In the revised manuscript, we have discussed these possibilities in the Discussion section.</p><p>In addition, we have clarified the methods of how we analyzed tumor sizes and tumor load in the cancer studies. A dissecting microscope (4x magnification) was used to assess the tumor number and size. Tumor size was defined as the mean of the two largest diameters measured with digital calipers. Tumor volume was derived from tumor size. Consistent with their histological appearance, a spherical shape was assumed for colon polyps, thus tumor volume = 4/3πr<sub>3</sub>, where r = radius. Tumor burden/load is defined as the total polyp volume per animal, that is the product of polyp number and polyp volume.</p><p><italic>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> there is no evidence that Sesn2 expression and mTORC1 activity is somehow affected in tumor samples in control mice. Also the data on 4E-BP1 staining look odd because several differently phosphorylated forms of 4E-BP1 usually appear when cells are stained with 4E-BP1 antibody. Moreover, to analyze mTORC1 activity S6K phosphorylation data should be added to the experiment and several samples should be presented.</italic> </p><p>As discussed in our former manuscript, mouse AOM/DSS colon tumors do not typically lose p53 (Cancer Res 64: 6394-6401, Cancer Sci 95: 475-480), unlike what is seen in human colon cancers. Therefore, it is expected that Sestrin2 expression and mTORC1 activity are not strongly affected in tumor samples of control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). However, we have demonstrated that p53 loss in mouse colon tumor can also inhibit Sestrin2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) as observed in human colon cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The PAGE gel resolution of mouse tissue samples (especially the colon samples) is relatively poor (see the whole blots presented in supplemental figures). For this reason, the phosphorylation-induced 4E-BP1 shifts are not evident from this specific western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). We do see clear 4E-BP1 shifts in cultured cell lysates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In the revised manuscript, we have shown additional immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) and immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>) results to demonstrate that these changes are reproducible in tissues from different mice. The 4E-BP1 shifts were visible in some of these additional blots, although with a lower resolution when compared to the results from cultured cell lysates.</p><p>We agree that S6K is another good readout of mTORC1 activity; however, for an unknown reason, the antibody worked very poorly in these mouse colon samples due to the presence of strong non-specific bands. Still, S6 and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation data (in both immunoblotting and immunostaining) consistently support that mTORC1 is strongly upregulated in Sestrin2-deficient mouse tumors. According to recent studies about mTORC1 signaling in colon (Nature (2015) 517:497-500; J Clin Invest (2013) 123:767-781; PLoS One (2014) 9:e96023), p- S6 and p-4E-BP1 antibodies are reliable reporters of mTORC1 signaling activity in colon tissue. These studies did not include p-S6K analyses.</p><p><italic>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. It was recently published by Agarwal et al., Mol. Can. Res 2015 that p53 inactivation in colon cancer cells led to strong suppression of Sesn2 expression as well as expression of some other p53-dependent mTORC1 regulators such as TSC2. Moreover, the control of mTORC1 in HCT116 cells was attributed to regulation of lysosomal dynamic of TSC2 and Rheb but not Sesn2 activity.</italic> </p><p>We and others have recently shown that Sestrin2 controls lysosomal localization of mTORC1 through modulation of the GATOR complexes (Sci Rep. 2015 5:9502; Cell Rep. 2014 9:1; Cell Rep. 2014 9:1281). In addition to this mechanism, Sestrin2 controls the TSC2-Rheb axis through AMPK activation (Cell 2008 134:451; Science 327:1223). Therefore, the Agarwal et al. findings that p53 affects Rheb signaling do not contradict our conclusion that Sestrin2 controls mTORC1 signaling as a p53 target.</p><p>In response to the reviewer’s comment, we made a note in the revised manuscript that p53 has other possible targets that can control mTORC1 signaling, such as <italic>TSC2, AMPKβ</italic> and <italic>PTEN</italic> (Cancer Res 67:4043-53). However, these targets were not differentially expressed between “p53-unknown” and “p53-mutated” colon cancer tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G-J</xref>), while <italic>SESN2, p21, GADD45</italic> and <italic>MDM2</italic> are all differentially regulated between these groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). We have included these new analyses in the revised manuscript.</p><p> <italic>9) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and D</xref> are inconsistent. The number and size of colonies look similar between sh-Luc and sh-Sesn2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and quite different in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>. Moreover, it is not clear how the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is relevant to the other parts of the paper. Does 5-Fu and CPT-11 treatments affect mTORC1 activity? Is mTORC1 responsible for the potential effect of Sesn2 on colony formation?</italic> </p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have addressed this issue by repeating both experiments in a single batch, and replacing the old figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A-C</xref>, in the revised manuscript). The new results are consistent with the former results and clearly show that sh-Sesn2 cells grow faster and are more resistant to 5-FU and CPT-11 treatments.</p><p>We have also examined Sestrin2 expression and mTORC1 signaling in RKO cells treated with 5-FU and CPT-11. After the 5-FU or CPT-11 treatments, Sestrin2 expression was slightly elevated in WT cells (sh-Luc; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D, E</xref>). Interestingly, mTORC1 signaling, monitored by p-S6K and p-4E-BP1 was prominently upregulated in sh-Sesn2 cells after 5-FU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D</xref>), suggesting that Sestrin2 functions to suppress mTORC1 activation after 5-FU treatment. In contrast, CPT-11 reduced mTORC1 signaling, and Sestrin2 silencing led to persistent mTORC1 upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2E</xref>). This mTORC1 upregulation as a result of Sestrin2 loss could have conferred chemoresistance to RKO cells against 5- FU and CPT-11.</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewers that, although these results are interesting and potentially important in the field of tumor chemoresistance, they are peripheral to the main story. Therefore, we have removed these data from the main figure and moved them into the figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p> <italic>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>. Despite the observed phenotypes on colon morphology, it is not clear which mechanisms are responsible for these phenotypes: whether they involve ER stress and mTORC1 regulation or both. To study whether inhibition of inflammation and colon carcinogenesis by Sesn2 is mediated by mTORC1 the authors should verify that the effects observed in Sesn2-null cells can be reversed by treatment with mTORC1 inhibitors.</italic> </p><p>We have shown that increased colony growth phenotypes of either Sestrin2-silenced or p53-mutated (SW480; therefore Sestrin2-downregulated) cells can be suppressed by treatment with rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, the role of Sestrin2 in inhibiting colon tumor growth seems to be mainly dependent on mTORC1 suppression.</p><p><italic>11) If Sestrin level were modulated during colitis, the authors should examine the expression levels of Sestrins in DSS-induced colitis model. Are there any changes of Sestrins expression (both mRNA and protein level) before and after DSS treatment in mice?</italic></p><p>We have shown that Sestrin2 level, in both mRNA and protein levels, was moderately increased after DSS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). This observation is consistent with the findings from the human colitis samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-C</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
