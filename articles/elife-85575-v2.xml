At its core is the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC), a region of the medulla, necessary for the generation of rhythmic breathing in mammals.

Breathing relies on a respiratory network located in the brainstem to promote gas exchange and maintain life. Although these neural circuits are critical for life, they can be adjusted to coordinate with behaviors such as pain response and vocalization. At the core of the respiratory network is the preBötC, a collection of neurons essential to produce and sustain breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 1991</xref>). The preBötC region is comprised of diverse populations of neurons encompassing inhibitory and excitatory neurons. Glutamatergic excitatory neurons form roughly half of the preBötC neurons with critical roles in the generation of inspiration. Excitatory preBötC neurons express various proteins, receptors, and neuropeptides, including the transcription factor developing brain homeobox 1 protein (Dbx1), vesicular-glutamate transporter 2 (<italic>Slc17a6</italic>), neurokinin-1 receptors (encoded by the tachykinin 1 receptor gene <italic>Tacr1</italic>), µ-opioid receptors (µOR), and somatostatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gray et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stornetta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouvier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2010</xref>). A subpopulation of glutamatergic neurons expresses the neuropeptide substance P (encoded by the tachykinin precursor 1 or <italic>Tac1</italic> gene). Substance P in the preBötC stimulates breathing through activation of its cognate receptor neurokinin-1 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Montandon et al., 2016a</xref>), and the destruction of neurokinin-1 receptor-expressing neurons abolishes breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gray et al., 2001</xref>). However, the biological function of preBötC <italic>Tac1</italic> (substance P)-expressing neurons in the regulation of breathing is not known in vivo.</p><p>Substance P plays an important role in rhythmic breathing, but it is also a key-molecule involved in nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mantyh, 2002</xref>), locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farrell et al., 2021</xref>), and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reitz et al., 2021</xref>). Substance P is released in response to nociceptive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mantyh, 2002</xref>), is expressed in circuits regulating nociception such as the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2019</xref>) and the rostral ventromedial medulla, and modulates descending pain circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khasabov et al., 2017</xref>). Descending <italic>Tac1</italic> circuits in the brainstem mediate behavioral responses, such as the fight-or-flight response, associated with brisk locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barik et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuwaki, 2021</xref>). To anticipate the body’s metabolic demand in the event of a locomotor nocifensive response, nociceptive stimuli elicit cardio-respiratory responses, such as increased heart rate and augmented breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jafari et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Tac1</italic>-expressing medullary circuits involved in nociception or breathing share similar properties: they are sensitive to opioid drugs and expressed neurokinin-1 receptors. Here, we aim to identify the role of <italic>Tac1</italic>-expressing preBötC cells in regulating breathing and motor behaviors, which constitute different components potentially linked to nocifensive behaviors.</p><p>By combining optogenetics, respiratory, and locomotion assays, we determined the role of <italic>Tac1</italic> preBötC cells in regulating rhythmic breathing and locomotion. Using photostimulation, we first showed that <italic>Tac1</italic> preBötC neurons, a subpopulation of glutamatergic neurons, increased respiratory rhythm by promoting inspiration or reducing expiration in both anesthetized and freely behaving mice. In freely moving mice, photostimulation was mostly effective when mice were in calm, but not active, state. Interestingly, stimulation of <italic>Tac1</italic> preBötC cells directly elicited a strong locomotor response suggesting that <italic>Tac1</italic> preBötC cells play a dual role in promoting breathing and locomotion. Rhythmic breathing is dampened by opioid drugs and preBötC cells mediate a major component of respiratory depression by opioid drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Montandon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Montandon, 2022b</xref>). Because most <italic>Tac1</italic> preBötC cells co-expressed µ-opioid receptors (encoded by the gene <italic>Oprm1</italic>) in the preBötC, their stimulation reversed the effects of opioid drugs on breathing, suggesting that <italic>Tac1</italic> preBötC neurons constitute a robust excitatory neuronal population promoting breathing during calm states and that can overcome respiratory depression with narcotics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stimulation of <italic>Tac1</italic>-expressing cells in anesthetized mice</title><p>Using a Cre-lox recombination-based approach, we expressed ChETA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) in the medulla of <italic>Tac1</italic> cre mice. A series of five photostimulations was produced containing frequencies ranging between 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). As no changes in respiratory rate were observed in animals which received the virus 2 weeks prior to the experimental day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), experiments were also performed on animals 4 weeks following virus injections. In this group, laser stimulation increased respiratory rate compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>; group effect: p<italic>=</italic>0.0003, n=25; F<sub>(2,22)</sub>=11.68). Absolute values for respiratory rate are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.

Laser stimulations at 30 Hz with power of 1, 3, 5, and 10 mW significantly increased respiratory rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>; laser power effect: p<italic>=</italic>0.0018, n=38; F<sub>(3,34)</sub>=6.201). Importantly, a minimal power of 5 mW at the tip of the optical fiber was sufficient to stimulate rhythmic breathing. According to Monte Carlo simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2015</xref>), a laser power of 5 mW at the tip of the optical fibre resulted in a power density of 5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> about 470 µm away from the optical fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The power density to activate 50% of ChETA channels is 5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mattis et al., 2011</xref>). To determine whether laser light may stimulate other respiratory neurons located outside the preBötC, we looked at the co-expression of <italic>Tac1</italic> and <italic>eYFP</italic> (for ChETA) in the medulla and determined whether it overlapped with light diffusion. Rostral to the preBötC, co-expression was found in the facial nucleus where light power was too low to activate ChETA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). The laser light was powerful enough to activate Bötzinger Complex (BötC) neurons, but co-expression was low in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). In the preBötC region, substantial expression was found in preBötC and the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>), but CVLM neurons are involved in cardiovascular control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lima et al., 2002</xref>). Although co-expression was found caudal to the preBötC, light power was too low to activate ChETA in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d</xref>). In summary, photostimulation of <italic>Tac1</italic> preBötC neurons promoted breathing by increasing respiratory rate in anesthetized mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Photostimulation of tachykinin precursor 1 (<italic>Tac1)</italic> preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) cells increases the respiratory rate in anesthetized mice.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) ChETA was expressed in <italic>Tac1</italic> preBötC cells by injecting the AAV-ChETA<sup>fl/fl</sup> virus in <italic>Tac1</italic> cre-expressing mice.

In the preBötC, most inspiratory-related excitatory cells are glutamatergic, and their activation is essential to initiate synchronized rhythmic activity and produce a breath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wallén-Mackenzie et al., 2006</xref>).

However, much remains unknown about the different subclasses of glutamatergic preBötC neurons and how they produce rhythmic breathing. A large subset of excitatory preBötC neurons derive from the transcription factor developing brain homeobox 1 protein (Dbx1) and are potential drivers of rhythmic breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baertsch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vann et al., 2018</xref>). In the present study, we focused on a limited group of excitatory neurons expressing the neuropeptide substance P (encoded by the <italic>Tac1</italic> gene). Substance P is widely spread in the central and peripheral nervous system including the brainstem and the preBötC.

Neurokinin-1 receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors stimulating rhythmic breathing through various ion channels including GIRK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Montandon et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yeh et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Tacr1</italic>-expressing preBötC cells are predominantly glutamatergic and mediate inspiratory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guyenet et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, the destruction of neurokinin-1 receptor-expressing preBötC cells using saporin-Substance P progressively disrupts breathing and eventually stops it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gray et al., 2001</xref>), with this effect more pronounced during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McKay and Feldman, 2008</xref>). Substance P expression is also consistent with the immunohistochemical distribution of Dbx1-derived neurons in the preBötC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study, activation of <italic>Tac1</italic>-expressing preBötC cells promoted inspiration to similar levels than photostimulation of glutamatergic preBötC.

Most cells expressing eYFP-ChETA were found ventral to the nucleus ambiguus and were not found in other regions involved in the generation of rhythmic breathing such as the post-inspiratory complex (PiCo) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, cells expressing eYFP-ChETA were found ventral and rostral to the preBötC in regions containing C1 adrenergic cells which are known to modulate respiratory rate and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burke et al., 2014</xref>). Considering the role of C1 cells in active expiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Malheiros-Lima et al., 2018</xref>) combined with the strong inspiratory activity observed following photostimulation, our study strongly suggests that <italic>Tac1</italic>-expressing preBötC cells constitute a population of glutamatergic preBötC cells sufficient to generate inspiratory activity in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Phase-dependent role of <italic>Tac1</italic>-expressing cells</title><p>Photostimulation of <italic>Tac1</italic>-expressing preBötC cells produced inspiratory activity only during discrete periods of the respiratory cycle. <italic>Tac1</italic> photostimulation had no effect during the first 20% of the respiratory cycle but triggered inspiratory activity when applied during post-inspiration or expiration.

Outside of this region, activation of <italic>Tac1</italic> neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus promoted arousal and enhanced locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reitz et al., 2021</xref>). Substance P is also a key-neuropeptide involved in nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mantyh, 2002</xref>) and locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farrell et al., 2021</xref>).

To anticipate the body’s metabolic demand in the event of locomotor nocifensive response, nociceptive stimuli elicit cardio-respiratory responses, such as augmented breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jafari et al., 2017</xref>) and cardiovascular response in conscious rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Unger et al., 1988</xref>) In our study, stimulation of <italic>Tac1</italic> cells promoted locomotion. It is plausible that this locomotor response was due to photostimulation of adjacent motor nuclei. ChETA-eYFP expression was observed in the caudal ventrolateral reticular nucleus which is involved in nociceptive-cardiovascular integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lima et al., 2002</xref>) suggesting that this nucleus may not contribute directly to the increased locomotor activity. The Ventral SpinoCerebellar tract and the Lateral ParaGigantocellular nucleus are both involved in locomotor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Capelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chalif et al., 2022</xref>), but their low ChETA-eYFP expression and their relative distance from the optical fiber suggest that these regions did not mediate the locomotive effects observed with photostimulation.

However, both regions show very low eYFP<italic>-</italic>ChETA and are not within the range of light diffusion. In conclusion, stimulation of <italic>Tac1</italic> neurons induced a strong locomotor response that is likely due to photostimulation of preBötC cells, but it cannot be fully excluded that some motor nuclei may also partially contribute to this response.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Reversal of respiratory depression by opioid drugs</title><p>Opioid drugs present unwanted side effects such as respiratory depression.

Interestingly, preBötC neurons expressing neurokinin-1 receptors, the cognate receptors of substance P, are preferentially inhibited by opioid drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Montandon et al., 2011</xref>). In our study, we found co-expression of <italic>Oprm1</italic> (the gene coding for MORs) and <italic>Tac1</italic> in preBötC neurons, and stimulation of <italic>Tac1</italic> preBötC cells entirely reversed respiratory depression by fentanyl. Consistent with these results, opioid drugs directly inhibit substance P-expressing cells and substance P production in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukazawa et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, an excitatory <italic>Tac1</italic> spinal-brainstem circuit mediates noxious responses in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barik et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gutierrez et al., 2019</xref>) and deletion of the <italic>Tac1</italic> gene in mice increases the inhibitory effects of opioid drugs, suggesting that substance P could reverse respiratory depression by opioid drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takita et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berner et al., 2012</xref>).

Consistent with this hypothesis, we showed that stimulation of <italic>Tac1</italic> preBötC cells alleviated respiratory depression by fentanyl in intact animals. Interestingly, stimulation of breathing by neurokinin-1 receptor activation in the preBötC is regulated by GIRK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Montandon et al., 2016a</xref>), which also regulates respiratory rate depression by opioid drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montandon et al., 2016b</xref>).

and virus acquisition</title><p>All procedures were carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and were approved by St. Michael’s Hospital animal care committee (animal use protocols #981 and #988). Experiments were performed on 63 adult mice of either sex, aged between 3–4 months old and weighing between 20 g and 40 g. Animals were kept on a 12 hr light–dark cycle with unrestricted food and water and all experiments were performed during the day. Slc17a6-ires-cre (STOCK <italic>Slc17a6</italic><sup>tm2(cre)Lowl</sup>/J; Strain # 016963) and <italic>Tac1</italic>-IRES2-Cre-D (B6;129S-<italic>Tac1</italic><sup>tm1.1(cre)Hze</sup>/J; Strain # 021877) breeders were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (600 Main Street, Bar Harbor, ME USA 04609). Litters generated were separate and used randomly by the investigators. An adeno-associated virus (AAV<sub>5</sub>-EF1a-DIO-ChETA-eYFP; qPCR titer of virus (vg/ml)=3.9 × 10<sup>12</sup>) that expresses ChR2-E123T Accelerated (ChETA) and the ﬂuorescent protein eYFP was purchased from University of North Carolina (UNC vector core, Chapel Hill, NC, USA). The same serotype virus that expresses eYFP but lacks expression of the light-sensitive protein (AAV-EF1a-DIO-eYFP-WPRE-pA; UNC vector core, Chapel Hill, NC, USA) was also used at the same concentration for control experiments. Fentanyl citrate (50 μg/mL, Sandoz) was used with Health Canada exemption and obtained from the St. Michael’s Hospital In-Patient Pharmacy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Surgical procedures</title><p>All surgeries were performed using standard aseptic techniques. Before surgery, mice were given pain medication: Anafen (5 mg/Kg), Dexamethazone (5 mg/Kg), and saline for a total volume of 1 ml subcutaneously. Mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane (2–3% in 100% oxygen) and placed in the prone position in a stereotaxic apparatus (model 940, KOPF instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA) with blunt ear bars where anesthesia was maintained through a nose cone. Adequate depth of anesthesia was determined via breathing and reflex responses to toe pinch and adjusted if necessary. Animal temperature was monitored through a rectal probe and was maintained at 36.5 °C via a heating pad (Kent Scientific corporation, Torrington, CT, USA). An incision was performed in the skin to expose the dorsal skull, which was then leveled horizontally between bregma and lambda. A small craniotomy was made to access the preBötzinger Complex. A needle (C315I-SPC Internal 33GA; P1 technologies,6591 Merriman Rd., Roanoke, VA, USA) containing the adeno-associated virus (AAV<sub>5</sub>-EF1a-DIO-ChETA-eYFP) was slowly lowered in the preBötC 6.8 mm posterior, 1.2 mm lateral, and 6.4 mm ventral to bregma. Coordinates were chosen based on the Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates (3<sup>rd</sup> Edition, Paxinos, and Franklin) combined with preliminary mapping of viral injections from our team. Needle was lowered with an infusion rate of 80 nl/min provided by a programmable syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA) to avoid any clogging. Once in the targeted region, virus was infused at 50 nl/min reaching a total volume of 300 nl. Control animals were injected with a sham virus that lacks expression of the light-sensitive protein (AAV-EF1a-DIO-eYFP-WPRE-pA). Following infusion, the needle was maintained in position for 10 min before it was slowly removed and skin was sutured over the skull.</p><p>For unanesthetized/freely behaving experiments, an optic fiber was fixed over the preBötC following virus injection. Before the skin was sutured, two sterile stainless-steel screws (P1 Technologies, Roanoke, VA, USA) were implanted in the bone, one near the bregma and one near the preBötC craniotomy. A custom-made sterile cannula containing the optical fiber (200 μm, 0.5 NA; FP200ERT, Thor Labs, New Jersey, USA) was then positioned on top of the preBötC 6.8 mm posterior, 1.2 mm lateral, and 5.5 mm ventral to bregma. The cannula was then fixed in position resting on top of the skull using dental cement (Co-oral-ite dental MFG. CO., Diamond Spring, CA, USA). Cement was spread on both stainless-steel screws to firmly hold the cannula and skin was later sutured over it.</p><p>In the 3 days post-surgery, mice were given pain medication: Anafen (5 mg/Kg), Dexamethazone (5 mg/Kg), and saline for a total volume of 1 ml subcutaneously. Animals were kept for 2–4 weeks before experiments were performed to allow ChETA expression in the targeted region. Rostro-caudal histology of coronal medullary sections was performed to determine the expression of ChETA-eYFP in <italic>Tac1</italic> neurons. The location of the injection was confirmed by combining in situ hybridization for the expression of <italic>Tacr1</italic> (gene coding for neurokinin-1 receptors) and eYFP (marking ChETA). To determine whether ChETA expression was limited to Tac1-expressing cells, in situ hybridization was also performed for eYFP and <italic>Tac1</italic> genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Optogenetic stimulation in anesthetized mice</title><p>Optogenetic stimulation was used to selectively activate tachykinin precursor 1 (<italic>Tac1</italic>) and vesicular-glutamate transporter 2 (<italic>Slc17a6</italic>) expressing cells in the preBötC. Three <italic>Tac1</italic>-IRES2-Cre-D and two <italic>Slc17a6</italic>-ires-cre ( threemales and 2 females) received the sham virus and served as controls while twenty <italic>Tac1</italic>-IRES2-Cre-D (14 males and 6 females) and five <italic>Slc17a6</italic>-ires-cre (3 males and 2 females) received the AAV<sub>5</sub>-EF1a-DIO-ChETA-eYFP virus. Two or 4 weeks after surgery, mice were anesthetized with 2–2.5% isoflurane and were spontaneously breathing (50% oxygen gas mixture, balance nitrogen). Adequate depth of anesthesia was determined via breathing and reflex responses to toe pinch and adjusted if necessary. Animal temperature was monitored through a rectal probe and was maintained at 36.5 °C via a heating pad (Kent Scientific corporation, Torrington, CT, USA). Diaphragm muscle activity was recorded using bipolar electrodes sutured to the upper right abdominal wall adjacent to the diaphragm. Electromyography signals were amplified (AM Systems Model 1700, Sequim, Washington, USA), band-pass filtered (300–5000 Hz), integrated, and digitized at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz using PowerLab 4/26 acquisition system and LabChart Version 8 (ADInstruments, Colorado Spring, CO, USA).</p><p>Mice were placed in the prone position in a stereotaxic frame (model 940, KOPF instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA) with blunt ear bars where anesthesia was maintained through a nose cone. As this group did not have a fixed optical fiber over the preBötC, incision was again performed in the skin to expose the bregma and lambda. The dorsal skull was levelled horizontally between bregma and lambda and a small craniotomy was made to access the site of virus injection in the preBötC. An optical fibre (200 μm, 0.5 NA; CFMC52L10, Thor Labs, New Jersey, USA), connected to a laser source (Laserglow technologies, North York, ON, Canada) was then positioned 6.8 mm posterior, 1.2 mm lateral, and 5.5 mm ventral to bregma. These coordinates positioned the optical fibre 0.2 mm dorsal to the preBötC. The location of the optical fibre was also confirmed by occasionally activating the laser (50 pulses of 20 ms repeated at 20 Hz, power 10 mW). Once breathing was stable (~10 min; average breathing rhythm = 20–30 breaths/min), laser stimulation (blue, wavelength = 473 nm) was performed using various settings. Settings included 20ms pulses repeated 10 times at frequencies of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 Hz and power of 1, 3, 5, and 10 mW. Duration of each stimulation train of 10 pulses (1.82, 0.92, 0.48, 0.32, 0.24 s) depended on the respective frequency (5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 Hz). For all stimulations, each train of 10 pulses was repeated five times with 1 s pause between them. A 3D Monte Carlo simulation platform was used to assess the theoretical spread of the laser light in brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Following stimulation phases under control conditions, diaphragm activity was recorded for 10 min as a baseline sequence before mice were getting an intramuscular injection of the μ-opioid receptor agonist fentanyl (5 μg/Kg). 5 min were then given for fentanyl to elicit a respiratory rate depression and laser stimulation was once again performed using various settings. Settings included 20 ms pulses repeated 10 times with a frequency of 20, 30, and 40 Hz and power of 10 mW. For all stimulations, each train of 10 pulses had 1 s pause between them. Total duration of each photostimulation protocol was 1 min. Mice were then euthanized with the intracardiac injection of T-61 and the brain was harvested for post-mortem histology.</p><p>Data was extracted from LabChart Version 8 (ADInstruments, Colorado Spring, CO, USA) and exported to Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 9 (Version 9.3.1; GraphPad Software) for analysis. For each laser stimulation, respiratory rate (breaths/min) and amplitude (volts) as well as inspiratory and expiratory durations were obtained from rectified diaphragm EMG recordings, averaged over the whole stimulation period, and normalized according to the preceding baseline period (rate and amplitude; an average of 1 min) or the average of the five preceding breathing cycles (inspiratory and expiratory durations). Since respiratory rate, amplitude and inspiratory/expiratory durations varied from one animal to another, these parameters were expressed as percentage changes in the values of the preceding baseline period. Figures with absolute values and means are provided in Supplementary Materials. Timing of the laser stimulation inside the respiratory cycle was also determined to measure the induced period. To do so, we calculated the duration between the initiation of inspiration and the start of laser stimulation and normalized it according to the preceding respiratory cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Optogenetic stimulation in freely behaving mice</title><p>Respiratory variables in freely behaving mice were recorded using the whole body, flow-through plethysmography (Buxco Electronics, DSI, New Brighton, Minnesota, USA). Two <italic>Tac1</italic>-IRES2-Cre-D and Two Slc17a6-ires-cre (3 males and 1 female) received the sham virus and served as controls while 10 <italic>Tac1</italic>-IRES2-Cre-D (7 males and 3 females) received the AAV<sub>5</sub>-EF1a-DIO-ChETA-eYFP virus. Plethysmography chambers measured 21.5 cm in diameter and allowed enough room for mice to move freely during physiological recordings. Chambers were continuously ventilated using room air at a rate of 0.9 L/min (normoxia; F<sub>I</sub>O<sub>2</sub>=0.21) at room temperature. Mice were habituated to the plethysmography chamber and optic fiber cable for three days prior to experiments between 9:00 and 12:00 or 13:00 and 16:00. Experiments took place the next day during the same time of day as the habituation phase. On the day of the experiment, calibration of the system was performed by rapidly injecting 5 ml of air into the chamber with a syringe. Unanesthetized mice were gently handled to measure body temperature (Physitemp, Clifton, NJ, USA) and were tethered to the fiber optic cable and placed in the plethysmograph chamber. Animals were given 1 hr to acclimatize to the environment. Pressure changes inside the chamber were recorded with a pressure transducer, amplified (PS100W-2, EMKA Technologies, France), and digitized using PowerLab 4/26 in LabChart Version 8 (ADInstruments, Colorado Spring, CO, USA). Respiratory frequency (ƒ<sub>R</sub>) and tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) were obtained from the plethysmograph signal. Barometric pressure, body temperature (Tb), chamber temperature, and humidity were measured to correct and standardize V<sub>T</sub> and values were expressed in ml BTPS (body temperature and pressure when saturated with water vapor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drorbaugh and Fenn, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartlett and Tenney, 1970</xref>). Once the mouse appeared calm (respiratory rate ~150–200 breaths/min), laser stimulation (blue, wavelength = 473 nm) was performed using various settings under control conditions. Settings included 20ms pulses repeated five times with a frequency of 30, 40, 50, 60, and 80 Hz and power of 10 mW to surpass the normal respiratory rate of the animal. Each train of five pulses was repeated for 10 s.</p><p>Following stimulation phases under control conditions, respiratory variables were recorded for 10 min as a baseline condition before mice were getting an intraperitoneal injection of either saline or the μ-opioid receptor agonist fentanyl (0.3 mg/Kg). This dose of fentanyl is considered a high dose in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fujii et al., 2019</xref>). Five minutes were then given for fentanyl to create a respiratory rate depression and laser stimulation was once again performed using various settings. Settings included 20 ms pulses repeated five times with a frequency of 40 Hz and power of 10 mW. Each train of five pulses wase repeated for 10 s. Mice were then anesthetized with isoﬂurane (3% in 50% oxygen + 50% medical air), euthanized with the intracardiac injection of T-61 and the brain was harvested for post-mortem histology.</p><p>Data was extracted from LabChart Version 8 (ADInstruments, Colorado Spring, CO, USA) and exported to Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 9 (Version 9.3.1; GraphPad Software) for analysis. For each laser stimulation, respiratory frequency, tidal volume, and inspiratory/expiratory durations were averaged over the whole stimulation period and normalized according to the preceding baseline period (frequency and tidal volume; average of 1 min) or the average of the five preceding breathing cycles (inspiratory and expiratory durations). These parameters were once again expressed as percentage changes infor the entire duration the values of the preceding baseline period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Respiratory and behavioral profiling</title><p>Whole-body plethysmography chambers with transparent platforms were mounted on a box with an HD 1080 P high-definition camera placed at the bottom of the box. Mouse movements were tracked from below for the entire duration of the experiments. Videos were recorded using Pinnacle Studio 24 MultiCam Capture software (Corel, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada), resized using Pinnacle Studio 24, and exported to EthoVision XT Version 14 (Noldus, Wageningen, the Netherlands) for analysis of movement parameters. Mouse velocity (cm/s) and activity (% of pixel change) were quantified and exported to Microsoft Excel for analysis in parallel with the respiratory parameters during stimulation in freely behaving mice. Video data was aligned with plethysmography recordings using video time stamps. The behavioral state of the animal was defined before each stimulation using respiratory recording and video monitoring. The animal was considered in a calm state if respiratory rate was ≤125% of baseline respiratory rate, velocity (cm traveled per second) was ≤0.1 cm/s, and when activity (% of pixel changed in frame) was ≤0.4%. The animal was considered in an active state if respiratory rate was &gt;125% of baseline respiratory rate, velocity was &gt;0.1 cm/s, and activity was &gt;0.4%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In situ hybridization</title><p>To determine the expression of <italic>Tac1</italic>, <italic>Slc17a6,</italic> and <italic>Oprm1</italic> and confirm virus position through <italic>eYFP</italic> and <italic>Tacr1</italic> expression, in-situ hybridization was performed in C57BL/6 J, <italic>Tac1</italic>-IRES2-Cre-D, and Slc17a6-ires-cre mice which received a viral injection. Mice were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by formalin and the brain was harvested and placed into formalin solution overnight at room temperature. Brains were then soaked in 20% sucrose in PBS for 24 hr followed by 30% sucrose for 24 hr. Fixed brains were frozen using Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (Sakura) and dry ice and stored at –80 °C. Coronal sections containing the preBötC were cut at 20 μm thickness using a cryostat (Model CM3050S, Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and mounted on superfrost plus slides (VWR International, Radnor, PA, USA). Sections were scanned using the Axio Scan.Z1 slide scanner (ZEISS, Germany) to confirm optical fibre location. The manufacturers’ protocol was used to perform in-situ hybridization (RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent v2 Assay, Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, California, USA) and sections were counterstained with DAPI. Target probes used included combinations of Mm-<italic>Tac1</italic> (Cat No. 410351-C2) targeting <italic>Tac1</italic> gene mRNA, Mm-<italic>Slc17a6</italic> (Cat No. 319171-C2) targeting <italic>Slc17a6</italic> gene mRNA, Mm-<italic>Oprm1</italic> (Cat No. 315841) targeting <italic>Oprm1</italic> gene mRNA, Mm-<italic>Tacr1</italic> (Cat No. 428781) targeting NK1 receptor gene mRNA and Mm-<italic>eYFP</italic> (Cat No. 551621-C3) targeting the gene coding for eYFP. Genes are indicated in italics and with the first letter in the capital in this manuscript. Tissue sections 40 μm apart were scanned using the Axio Scan.Z1 slide scanner (ZEISS, Germany). As previously described, to identify sections containing the preBötC, the Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates (3<sup>rd</sup> Edition, Paxinos, and Franklin) was consulted, and anatomical markers used included (1) the nucleus tractus solitarius, (2) the nucleus ambiguus, (3) the facial nucleus, (4) the hypoglossal nucleus, (5) the external cuneate nucleus as a surface landmark, and (6) the overall shape of the section. To quantify mRNA expression, 3 brains were used and 3 sections from each brain containing the preBötC (extending approximately 240 μm rostral-caudal) were exported from Zen (ZEISS, Germany) to Adobe Illustrator (Creative Suite 5, Adobe) where regions of interest were drawn. Images were then exported to Fiji (ImageJ) for counting. Cells count from the three sections of each brain were averaged. Counts were obtained for total DAPI, <italic>Tac1</italic> mRNA, <italic>Slc17a6</italic> mRNA, and <italic>Oprm1</italic> mRNA. mRNA expression was expressed either as a percentage of total DAPI cells, total <italic>Tac1</italic> cells, total <italic>Slc17a6</italic> cells, or total <italic>Oprm1</italic> cells. Images were produced using ZEN (ZEISS, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analysis and graphs were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 (Version 9.3.1; GraphPad Software). Figures were prepared using Adobe Illustrator (Creative Suite 5, Adobe). Data in all figures and text are reported as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM) with individual data points also displayed. Data from male and female pups were combined as preliminary statistical analyses revealed no sex speciﬁc responses to laser stimulation. Data was first tested for normality by using a Shapiro-Wilk test. Normally distributed data were analyzed with ANOVAs (one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, or two-way repeated measures ANOVA) or a mixed effects analysis if there were missing values. Factors considered in the analyses were the effect of group (control, <italic>Tac1</italic>, <italic>Slc17a6</italic>), laser stimulation, laser power (mW), and stimulation phase. A simple linear regression was used to determine the relationships between percentage changes in respiratory rate, velocities, or baseline respiratory rates. When ANOVA results indicated that a factor (or a factorial interaction) was signiﬁcant (p≤0.05), a Tukey’s multiple comparisons test or Šidàk’s multiple comparisons test was performed for <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis. ANOVA results are mainly reported in the text while results from <italic>post hoc</italic> tests are reported in figures using symbols.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures were carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and were approved by St. Michael's Hospital animal care committee (animal use protocols #981 and #988).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-85575-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jeffrey C Smith as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Luis Rodrigo Hernandez-Miranda (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Evidence for some of the most important conclusions, particularly those regarding locomotion and state-dependence that suggest Tac1 neurons represent a &quot;new&quot; functional population of preBötC neurons, is incomplete/inadequate. The experimental evidence presented suggesting a novel respiratory role of these neurons, a state-dependence to their function, or a direct role in opioid-induced respiratory depression is limited. Furthermore, the evidence for preBötC neuron site-specificity for promoting locomotion is also limited. The addition of new experiments and analyses that better support these suggestions and the authors' conclusions is needed.</p><p>2) The authors should provide more detailed anatomical reconstructions of the spatial extent including rostrocaudal distribution of the virally transduced expression of ChETA-eYFP in Tac1 neurons to more clearly convey the regions in which Tac1 neurons were expressing ChETA-eYFP and potentially photostimulated. Also, regarding anatomical reconstruction, where cell counts are provided for various labeling patterns (Figures 3 and 7), please indicate the number of serial sections used in each case. How have the authors determined that their representations of cell count accurately convey the actual labeling patterns through the total region of interest?</p><p>3) The claim of state dependence is not adequately justified, because the distinction between &quot;calm&quot; and &quot;active&quot; states has little rationale and seems arbitrarily based only on respiratory frequency. Since the only criterion is respiratory rate, if the data are separated in this way, the terminology used should reflect this. It would be more appropriate to remove &quot;calm or active&quot; throughout the manuscript and more appropriately state that the respiratory effects were frequency dependent, based upon the respiratory frequency at the time of stimulation, etc. Moreover, this analysis seems misleading since it is not surprising that the stimulations appear to have a larger effect on breathing when baseline frequency was slow (calm state) when the effect on breathing is quantified as a % change from baseline. To further illustrate this, since mice have a maximum frequency they can breathe, there is likely a ceiling effect, e.g., if the mouse is already breathing close to that maximum at baseline (active state), it would not be surprising that stimulation would be unable to increase it further.</p><p>4) The authors' conclusion that photostimulating specifically preBötC Tac1-expressing neurons induces locomotion needs to be strengthened by incorporating additional control studies on the site specificity of this effect since Tac1-expressing neurons and the viral-induced expression of ChETA in these neurons is not strictly confined to the preBötC region, and nearby regions of the medulla oblongata that are labeled are also locomotion producing. The authors suggest in the Discussion that non-site-specific activation of Tac1 neurons is unlikely to account for the induction of locomotor behavior, but how has this been established as a control? The optical fiber used is large (200 µm) relative to the regions of interest as well as the high laser power (10 mW), probably illuminating large areas of the medullary ventrolateral and ventromedial reticular formation. Does repositioning the optical fiber fundamentally change the results? Related to this, the authors state (p. 7, line 271) that position was confirmed through continuous high-frequency laser stimulation at 10 mW. Optical fiber position would ideally be confirmed by post hoc anatomical reconstruction. Was this routinely done?</p><p>5) The authors should discuss the possibility of off-target labeling of neurons known to be involved in the modulatory control of breathing and potentially expressing Tac1. The large viral injection volume (300 nl) seems much too large to achieve specific targeting of the preBötC. This off-target labeling could include C1 neurons of the RVLM and IVLM that are glutamatergic and some of which express substance P (see also the comments of Reviewer #2 regarding other possible off-target neuronal populations). The authors should discuss this issue and describe how site specificity was achieved in the experiments. Please also provide the viral titers used.</p><p>6) The authors need to address all other issues listed by the reviewers in their recommendations for the authors.</p><p>7) If you have not already done so, please include a key resource table and clarify the distribution of sexes across groups.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This valuable study expands the current understanding of the neuronal composition and functions of the region of the brainstem called the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC)-the site where the rhythm of breathing in mammals originates.

Also, their results from behavioral measurements demonstrate that stimulation of the Tac1 preBötC cells promotes substantially respiratory rate during the &quot;calm&quot; state, but only moderately during the &quot;active&quot; state, defined respectively, by the respiratory frequency at rest and during activity in freely behaving mice.</p><p>Evidence is presented that photostimulation of Tac1-expressing neurons promotes locomotor behaviors.

One group of such neurons is the preBötzinger complex that contains cells responsible for generating the respiratory rhythm. Neurons in the preBötzinger complex are heterogeneous and the physiology of such cells are not yet fully understood. In this work, the authors set to characterize a subgroup of preBötzinger neurons in respiration using a variety of anatomical, physiological, and behavioral assays. The reported results show that the investigated neurons are not only key for respiratory rhythmic patterns but also critical for overcoming the characteristic respiratory depression caused by opioid drugs. This is perhaps the most exciting part of this work. Furthermore, the authors provide evidence that might also link these neurons to locomotion.</p><p>Strengths/weaknesses</p><p>In my view, this work is well-conducted and most of the conclusions are supported by strong experimental data. One methodological point that deserves attention is related to potential off-target effects of the performed viral injections. The injected area contains in addition to the studied cells, other populations of neurons known to contribute to respiration. The authors correctly discuss potential off-targets for locomotion but perhaps those in connection to respiration are less discussed.</p><p>The work by Rousseau and colleagues entitled &quot;A tachykinin precursor 1 medullary circuit promoting rhythmic breathing&quot; centers at the characterization of a subpopulation of preBötzinger neurons expressing substance P (Tac1). These neurons are key in the generation of the respiratory rhythm and might constitute a link between respiration and locomotion. This work is thus valuable for the respiratory research field.</p><p>In general, I have no major problems with this manuscript. However, there is an issue that I believe needs small anatomical clarification or at least more discussion.</p><p>Can the authors exclude the transduction of PiCO neurons (dorsally located to the nucleus ambiguous) and A1 adrenergic neurons by their viral infections? From Figures2e and 4h, it seems that several neurons in the &quot;PiCO&quot; and &quot;A1&quot; areas are also transduced. A1 (TH<sup>+</sup>) and PiCO (ChAT+) neurons share (or have a history of) vGlut2 expression and might be also Tac1+. It might be worth discussing potential off-target transductions in these areas and their potential influence in the described physiological results. This is particularly relevant as some changes are seen in the early expiration (or postinspiration) phase.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The preBotzinger Complex in the ventral medulla is critical for generating respiratory rhythm. Rhythmic activity of this bilaterally distributed network of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons is regulated by many neuromodulators including Substance P, a neuropeptide encoded by the Tac1 gene. Substance P is known to facilitate the respiratory rhythm and counteract the depressive effects of opioids in vitro. However, how Substance P regulates network function in vivo is less well understood. Using an optogenetic approach to allow activation of Tac1-expressing neurons with light, Rousseau et al., investigate how manipulating the activity in these neurons within or near the pre-Bot affects breathing and locomotion. The authors show that Tac1 neurons in the pre-BötC are also glutamatergic, and that stimulation of this Tac1+ glutamatergic subpopulation in anesthetized mice elicits similar, but weaker, effects on breathing compared to stimulation of glutamatergic pre-Bot neurons in general. A limitation is that the experiments presented here do not determine the relative roles of substance P and glutamatergic signaling, and therefore the functional significance of Tac1 expression in this subgroup of pre-Bot neurons remains unclear. Stimulation of Tac1 pre-BotC neurons in awake mice also increases average breathing frequency over the course of the stimulation period, but breathing patterns are highly variable during stimulation and effects on breathing are associated with changes in locomotor activity, which could indicate that some changes in breathing are secondary to stimulation induced changes in behavior. The authors suggest a potential state-dependent role of Tac1 pre-Bot neurons because average changes in breathing frequency relative to baseline (% change) are more pronounced when stimulations occurred during periods of slow vs fast baseline breathing (referred to as &quot;calm&quot; vs. &quot;active&quot; states). However, this interpretation is limited by unclear justification for parameters used to define these states and by misleading data analysis. The study also demonstrates that the ability of Tac1 pre-Bot neurons to increase breathing rate remains present in the context of opioid-induced respiratory depression. A strength of the study is ISH experiments demonstrating that many Tac1 pre-Bot neurons express Oprm1. However, the role of these neurons in opioid induced respiratory depression and the significance of this role relative to other pre-Bot neurons remains inferred or unknown since experiments to e.g. knockout Oprm1 from Tac1 neurons are not performed.</p><p>This manuscript investigates on the role of Tac1 expressing neurons within the preBötzinger complex of the ventral brainstem. The authors show that some of the glutamatergic neurons in the pre-BötC co-express Tac1, the precursor to substance P. Compared to the known effects of glutamatergic pre-Bot neurons in general, stimulation of this Tac+ glutamatergic subpopulation elicits similar, but weaker, effects on breathing in anesthetized mice. Stimulation of Tac1 pre-BotC neurons in awake mice also increases average breathing frequency over the course of a ~10s stimulation period, with breathing patterns being highly variable and associated with changes in locomotor activity. Increases in average breathing frequency relative to baseline (% change) are more pronounced when stimulations occurred during periods of slow vs fast baseline breathing (referred to as &quot;calm&quot; vs. &quot;active&quot; states), which is interpreted as state-dependence. The study also demonstrates that the ability of Tac1 pre-Bot neurons to increase breathing rate remains present in the context of opioid-induced respiratory depression. The observations that some pre-BotC neurons express Tac1, that this subpopulation contributes to respiratory function, and that many of these Tac1 neurons express Oprm1 are important. However, evidence indicating a unique respiratory role of these neurons, a state-dependence to their function, or a direct role in opioid induced respiratory depression is limited, reducing the overall significance of the study.</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>Line 50: Is this a new population? If so, how? Are these Tac1 neurons functionally different than other glutamatergic pre-BotC neurons?</p><p>Line 67: This seems overstated – What is evidence that blocking SP alters rhythmic breathing? The role of Tac1 or NK1R expressing neurons is much different that the role of SP signaling. This should be considered throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Line 129: An injection volume of 300nl seems much too large to achieve specific targeting of the pre-BotC. The authors should comment on this and describe how specificity was achieved in their experiments. Also, what was infused at 80nl/min during insertion of the needle? What type of needle was used?</p><p>Line 297: What is baseline respiratory rate in anesthesia? What is anesthesia used? It would be helpful to mention this in Results. Is there a difference in viral expression at 2 vs 4 wks that explains the different results at these two timepoints?</p><p>Line 304: Breathing was significantly affected when normalized to baseline, but not when raw breathing frequency was compared. This should be noted in the results.</p><p>Line 346: Figure 2e,f – The images seem to show clear examples of cells that express EYFP that DO NOT express Tac1… If so, this either suggests that the ISH for Tac1 is not labelling all Tac1 neurons, or the viral vector is not 100% specific for Tac1 neurons. Please comment.</p><p>Line 430: suggest alternative to &quot;in vivo&quot;. Studies in anesthetized mice also considered in vivo.</p><p>Line 431: RE the distinction between calm and active &quot;states&quot;: &quot;Based on baseline respiratory rate&quot; – please elaborate on this here. How can baseline breathing rate be more or less than 125% baseline breathing rate? This seems somewhat arbitrary and needs justification. Since the only criteria is respiratory rate, if the data are separated in this way, the terminology used should reflect this. It would be more appropriate to remove &quot;calm or active&quot; throughout the manuscript and more appropriately state that the respiratory effects were frequency dependent, based upon the respiratory frequency at the time of stimulation, etc. Moreover, this analysis seems misleading since it is not surprising that the stimulations appear to have a larger effect on breathing when baseline frequency was slow (calm state) when the effect on breathing is quantified as a % change from baseline. To further illustrate this – since mice have a maximum frequency they can breathe, there is likely a ceiling effect. E.g. if the mouse is already breathing close to that maximum at baseline (active state), it would not be surprising that stimulation would be unable to increase it further.</p><p>Line 437: The raw frequency values are not included in the supplemental figures as stated in the text. This should be included.</p><p>Line 442: Again, this may not be surprising if mice have a maximum frequency they can breathe. E.g. if they are already breathing close to that maximum at baseline, stimulation will be unable to increase it further.</p><p>Why were stimulations delivered in 200 ms &quot;bouts&quot;?</p><p>Figure 5- what about other breath parameters – e.g. amplitude/volume that seem to change with stimulations in awake mice in addition to frequency?</p><p>Figure 6d,e, – velocity and activity should not be expressed as a % baseline since in both cases the baseline value is ~0. Raw values would be more appropriate i.e. cm/s.</p><p>Line 483-486: cannot make this conclusion based on the data presented, because control mice did not move fast or breath fast during the recordings. Therefore, the data do not demonstrate whether or not fast breathing and movement are also correlated in control mice.</p><p>Line 496: Should 38% be considered a &quot;small fraction&quot;?</p><p>Discussion Line 588: &quot;Tac1 role on breathing depends on the state of the animal (calm vs. active), and therefore the overall excitability of the respiratory network, as a minimal effect of Tac1 stimulation was observed when the animal was behaviorally active.&quot; The claim of state-dependence does not seem justified. The distinction between calm and active states has little rationale and is based only on respiratory frequency.</p><p>Line 696: Entrainment of breathing by Tac1 neurons is not demonstrated here.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A tachykinin precursor 1 medullary circuit promoting rhythmic breathing&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

As the authors state elsewhere, these neurons are very likely the same glutamatergic neurons that have been previously manipulated and functionally described using Vglut2-cre, Dbx1-cre, etc. The new insight is that some of these neurons express Tac1 and manipulating them has very similar consequences for breathing as manipulating the larger glutamatergic preBotC population.</p><p>Line 73: This is still overstated. There is very little data that substance P is &quot;pivotal&quot; for respiratory rhythm, and this could be confusing for the reader as it conflates the role of the neurons with the role of the neuropeptide.

Optogenetics allow stimulation of discrete populations of neurons. By combining virus injection in the preBötC, local expression of ChETA and focused laser photostimulation, we can ensure that only preBötC <italic>Tac1</italic> neurons are activated. To this aim, we have included in-situ hybridization sections of the rostro-caudal distribution of ChETA-eYFP and <italic>Tac1</italic> neurons in the medulla (Supplementary Figure 1). These sections contain various respiratory circuits around the location of the optic fiber. Using a 3D Monte Carlo simulation platform, we determined that a laser power of 5mW (the minimal power to produce an effect on breathing) produced a power of 5mW/mm<sup>2</sup> in a region 470 µm beyond the optic fiber (See Supplementary Figure 1). This power density of 5mW/mm<sup>2</sup> is the light power density required to achieve half-maximal ChETA activation (EPD50 or effective power density for 50% activation). According to our histology, ChETA is almost exclusively found within a small region including the preBötC and the rostro-ventral lateral medulla.</p><p>For the effect of <italic>Tac1</italic> preBötC stimulation on locomotion, we used a power 10 mW which increases the power density of the laser and enlarges the region where the laser light can activate ChETA (Supplementary Figure 4). In-situ hybridization showed that <italic>eYFP</italic>-ChETA and <italic>Tac1</italic> are highly expressed in the preBötC, moderately expressed in the CVLM, the LPGi, and the BotC, which are regions not known to be involved in locomotion. Considering the low expression in regions away from the preBötC, and the diffusing and fading light beyond the preBötC, we think that photostimulation mostly acts on preBötC neurons. However it cannot be excluded than other regions are stimulated and it is now addressed in the Discussion.</p><p>Cell counts for Tac1, Vglut2, and Oprm1. Regarding the cell count for the labeling patterns (Figures 3 and 7), cell count was done on 3 sections of each brain for a total of 3 mice. We then averaged the numbers from the 3 sections for each animal and inserted in the figure. This is further explained in the revised text and details can be found in the excel file for data of figures 3 and 7. Regions of interest were drawn based on the Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates (3<sup>rd</sup> Edition, Paxinos and Franklin).

It would be more appropriate to remove &quot;calm or active&quot; throughout the manuscript and more appropriately state that the respiratory effects were frequency dependent, based upon the respiratory frequency at the time of stimulation, etc. Moreover, this analysis seems misleading since it is not surprising that the stimulations appear to have a larger effect on breathing when baseline frequency was slow (calm state) when the effect on breathing is quantified as a % change from baseline. To further illustrate this, since mice have a maximum frequency they can breathe, there is likely a ceiling effect, e.g., if the mouse is already breathing close to that maximum at baseline (active state), it would not be surprising that stimulation would be unable to increase it further.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point. To better define active and calm states, we classified states according to velocity and activity using video tracking. An active state was defined when velocity was &gt;0.1 cm/s and when activity (% of pixel changed in frame) was &lt; 0.4%. When velocity and activity were lower than these values, the animal was considered in calm state. It is now described in Methods and in Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors' conclusion that photostimulating specifically preBötC Tac1-expressing neurons induces locomotion needs to be strengthened by incorporating additional control studies on the site specificity of this effect since Tac1-expressing neurons and the viral-induced expression of ChETA in these neurons is not strictly confined to the preBötC region, and nearby regions of the medulla oblongata that are labeled are also locomotion producing. The authors suggest in the Discussion that non-site-specific activation of Tac1 neurons is unlikely to account for the induction of locomotor behavior, but how has this been established as a control? The optical fiber used is large (200 µm) relative to the regions of interest as well as the high laser power (10 mW), probably illuminating large areas of the medullary ventrolateral and ventromedial reticular formation. Does repositioning the optical fiber fundamentally change the results? Related to this, the authors state (p. 7, line 271) that position was confirmed through continuous high-frequency laser stimulation at 10 mW. Optical fiber position would ideally be confirmed by post hoc anatomical reconstruction.

The large viral injection volume (300 nl) seems much too large to achieve specific targeting of the preBötC.

From Figures2e and 4h, it seems that several neurons in the &quot;PiCO&quot; and &quot;A1&quot; areas are also transduced. A1 (TH<sup>+</sup>) and PiCO (ChAT+) neurons share (or have a history of) vGlut2 expression and might be also Tac1+.
