However, it remains challenging to establish a causative connection between early-life exposure to mild head trauma and late-life emergence of neurodegenerative deficits, nor do we know how sex and age compound the outcome. Using a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, we demonstrate that exposure to mild head trauma causes neurodegenerative conditions that emerge late in life and disproportionately affect females. Increasing age-at-injury further exacerbates this effect in a sexually dimorphic manner. We further identify sex peptide signaling as a key factor in female susceptibility to post-injury brain deficits. RNA sequencing highlights a reduction in innate immune defense transcripts specifically in mated females during late life. Our findings establish a causal relationship between early head trauma and late-life neurodegeneration, emphasizing sex differences in injury response and the impact of age-at-injury. Finally, our findings reveal that reproductive signaling adversely impacts female response to mild head insults and elevates vulnerability to late-life neurodegeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>sex differences</kwd><kwd>fruit flies</kwd><kwd>mild TBI</kwd><kwd>mild brain injury</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54AG062334</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>James Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A head concussion model in fruit flies reveals that early-life exposure to mild concussions significantly increases the risk of late-life neurodegeneration, with females especially vulnerable due to reproductive factors.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurodegenerative disorders affect millions of people worldwide, and this number is expected to increase substantially with rising life expectancy and population growth. Major efforts have been directed toward understanding the etiology of neurodegenerative conditions, but the challenge remains to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of neurodegeneration. Recent studies have identified multiple genetic mutations and risk factors associated with dementia and neurodegeneration, but additional causes are likely involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fu and Ip, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">PihlstrÃ¸m et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertram and Tanzi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hardy and Orr, 2006</xref>). Aging is a major risk factor for many neurodegenerative disorders and plays a key role in disease emergence and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Saikumar and Bonini, 2021</xref>). Other significant risk factors include environmental insults that can evoke neuropathological processes, which may be latent at first but surface with aging to disrupt various aspects of brain structure and function, leading to neurodegenerative conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gupta and Sen, 2016</xref>). Physical blows to the head are known to cause symptoms related to immediate brain injury, but even seemingly innocuous head impacts are strongly linked to brain dysfunction and degeneration later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gupta and Sen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brett et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ntikas et al., 2022</xref>). It is thus crucial to understand the aberrant processes triggered by these mild physical insults that may be initially âhiddenâ but can give rise to later neurodegenerative conditions. Furthermore, sex differences have been documented in many degenerative diseases, including chronic brain degeneration following mild traumatic brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yue et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gupte et al., 2019</xref>). How sex and age contribute to an individualâs response to mild brain disturbances and modify the risk for neurodegeneration remains to be fully understood.</p><p>The fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, represents an excellent and tractable model organism for dissecting fundamental disease mechanisms, including neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hirth, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lessing and Bonini, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Petersen and Wassarman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McGurk et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, the fruit flyâs relatively short lifespan enables longitudinal interrogation of disease progression from the initial trigger to the late-life emergence of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimerâs disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McGurk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pandey and Nichols, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yuva-Aydemir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bolus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">PrÃ¼Ãing et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, several <italic>Drosophila</italic> head injury models have been developed that recapitulate key findings from traumatic brain injury (TBI) in humans and other preclinical models, revealing significant insights into the potential molecular and genetic underpinnings of injury responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barekat et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Katzenberger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sun and Chen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saikumar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van Alphen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ye et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behnke et al., 2021b</xref>). We recently developed a novel <italic>Drosophila</italic> model (HIFLI: Headfirst Impact FLy Injury) in which mild repetitive head-specific impacts can be delivered to multiple awake and unrestricted adult flies of both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behnke et al., 2021b</xref>). In this study, we utilized the HIFLI model to deliver a milder version of repetitive head trauma, which eliminates potentially confounding effects from injury-induced death and enables us to interrogate sex and age-at-injury contributions to the emergence of brain deficits throughout the entire lifespan. Our data show that exposure to this milder form of head trauma elicits minimal acute deficits but causes profound brain-associated behavioral deficits and brain degeneration that only emerge later in life. These late-life neurodegenerative conditions are further exacerbated by increasing age-at-injury and disproportionately elevated in mated females. We further identify that sex peptide signaling involved in female reproduction plays a key role in elevated female neurodegeneration after mild head trauma. Finally, RNA sequencing data suggest that the chronic suppression of innate immune defense networks in mated females may mediate the elevated vulnerability to neurodegeneration after mild head trauma. Together, our results further establish <italic>Drosophila</italic> as an excellent model system to investigate lifelong neurodegenerative conditions, highlight that sex and age significantly contribute to trauma recovery and outcome, and support the notion that physical insults to the head, even very mild ones, pose a major threat for brain health.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exposure to a milder form of head impacts elicited no mortality but resulted in age-related acute sensorimotor deficits</title><p>The HIFLI system delivers head-first impacts to multiple adult flies at ~5 m/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behnke et al., 2021b</xref>). Our previous study employing the HIFLI model delivered two separate sessions of 15 iterative impacts, with a 1-day interval between the two sessions. Young flies exposed to this injury paradigm exhibited a small percentage of acute mortality and a significant reduction in lifespan, but flies subjected to one session exhibited little to no acute mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behnke et al., 2021b</xref>). To enable lifelong investigation of the age-at-injury as a risk factor for neurodegeneration with minimal deaths, we reduced the severity of our paradigm to only one session of 15 impacts, hereafter referred to as very mild head trauma (vmHT). We then quantified survival, sensorimotor deficits, and brain pathology at various timepoints after exposure to vmHT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As reported in our previous publication, around 50% of flies exhibit concussive-like behaviors immediately after receiving headfirst impacts, including uncoordinated movements, freezing, and loss of postural stability, but all flies recovered fully within the first 5 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behnke et al., 2021b</xref>). Importantly, vmHT had no significant effects on both short- and long-term survival when delivered on post-eclosion day 3, 17, or 31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), confirming the very mild nature of our injury paradigm.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Exposure of adult fruit flies to a very mild form of repetitive head impacts at different ages elicits minimal acute effects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of the experimental design.

A total of nine videos were used for each condition: three experimental repeats of three trials, number of flies in each video n â¥ 10. Error bars: standard error (Â±se).

We performed mNGA at 90 min and 1 day post-injury (1 dpi) following vmHT exposure to examine acute injury effects and potential short-term recovery. Using fly positional data, we calculated a Climbing Index (CI) for each second of the 10 s trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Male and female flies injured on day 3 post eclosion (D3<sub>Inj</sub>) did not exhibit any acute deficits in climbing behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), though this was not the case for flies injured on day 17 (D17<sub>Inj</sub>) or day 31 (D31<sub>Inj</sub>). We noted a significant reduction in CI in D17<sub>Inj</sub> females at 90 min post-injury, but not in males of the same age cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These females appeared to have mostly recovered by 24 hr post-injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In comparison, both male and female D31<sub>Inj</sub> cohorts exhibited a substantial reduction in CI at 90 min as well as 1 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating age-related acute sensorimotor deficits after vmHT exposure and impaired recovery. These results are consistent with the notion that aging worsens post-head injury recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Katzenberger et al., 2016</xref>) and that older populations are at a higher risk of developing negative consequences following mild head injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdulle et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peterson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mosenthal et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the short-term effects of vmHT on brain structure using a previously described protocol to stain whole fly brains and to detect vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behnke et al., 2021a</xref>). Vacuolation, as seen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> models of neurodegenerative diseases, is a marker for frank tissue degeneration in the fly brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Heisenberg and BÃ¶hl, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sunderhaus and Kretzschmar, 2016</xref>). These roughly round lesions can range from 1 to 50 Î¼m in diameter and are largely located within the neuropil. Though aging alone can increase the number and size of vacuoles in the brain, we demonstrate that vmHT did not generate any changes in vacuolation at 1 dpi in all injury groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâC</xref>). Examination of the mushroom body of the central nervous system and the pigment dispersing factor (PDF) neurons in the optical lobe of D3<sub>Inj</sub> flies also found no obvious structural alterations shortly after vmHT exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, the observed acute climbing deficits were unlikely caused by acute structural disruptions of the brain after vmHT. Additionally, we performed TUNEL staining at 1 dpi to investigate whether vmHT causes apoptosis within the brain. As a positive control, we subjected a group of flies to an eye-stabbing procedure aimed at producing a very severe injury capable of inducing apoptotic cell death within the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sanuki, 2020</xref>). We found that brains from the eye-stabbing injury group clearly displayed TUNEL-positive signals near primary injury regions, validating our TUNEL stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). However, TUNEL staining was faint in the brains of both the shams and vmHT-exposed groups. Consistently, we did not observe any exoskeletal or eye damage immediately following injuries, nor did we observe any retinal degeneration and pseudopupil loss at the chronic stage of these flies. These data further support the mild nature of our head trauma model and suggest that acute sensorimotor deficits were not a direct result of neuronal death nor caused by gross brain disruptions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Exposure to very mild head trauma (vmHT) does not acutely increase vacuole formation in the brain.</title><p>(<bold>AâC</bold>) Two-photon whole brain imaging and quantification of vacuoles in D3<sub>Inj</sub> (<bold>A</bold>), D17<sub>Inj</sub> (<bold>B</bold>), and D31<sub>Inj</sub> (<bold>C</bold>) flies.

While exposure to vmHT did not generate obvious short-term brain-associated deficits in our younger cohorts (D3<sub>Inj</sub> and D17<sub>Inj</sub>), we hypothesized that they could develop neurodegenerative conditions late in life. We quantified sensorimotor behavior and brain vacuolation for sham, D3<sub>Inj</sub>, D17<sub>Inj</sub>, and D31<sub>Inj</sub> cohorts on day 45 post-eclosion (D45). In this age-matched comparison, we found that vmHT exposure decreased CI regardless of age-at-injury, though injury at older ages induced greater sensorimotor decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Importantly, sensorimotor deficits were sexually dimorphic as female flies appeared to perform worse than males in the same injury condition. To better visualize the sex differences, we plotted the accumulated CI (summation of CI values over the 10 s trial) and normalized the value to that of the respective sham groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

For male flies, only the oldest injury cohort (D31<sub>Inj</sub>) showed a significant increase in vacuolation. When vacuole number and area were normalized to the respective sham groups and compared between sexes, we found that female brains exhibited a higher percentage of injury-induced increase in vacuolation overall, but particularly in younger injury cohorts D3<sub>Inj</sub> and D17<sub>Inj</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>In congruence with our previous finding that aging increases vacuolation, we found that flies aged to D45 exhibited a higher extent of brain vacuolation compared to younger flies, even without injury. To further probe the origin of brain vacuolation, we examined the distribution of vacuoles by quantifying the percentage of vacuoles within the cell-body-rich cortex and the axon-rich neuropil for sham, D3<sub>Inj</sub>, and D31<sub>Inj</sub> flies on D45. We confirmed that regardless of injury condition, most vacuoles can be found in the neuropil and not in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Interestingly, D31<sub>Inj</sub> females have a higher percentage of cortical vacuoles compared to sham and other injury cohorts, but males have a consistent neuropil-to-cortex ratio in all cohorts. Overall, this finding further suggests that neuronal death is not the major contributor of vacuole formation. Indeed, TUNEL staining at this time point (D45) did not yield significant signals for sham, D3<sub>Inj</sub>, D17<sub>Inj</sub>, or D31<sub>Inj</sub> flies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>The above age-matched comparison highlighted that though vmHT exposure early in life has minimal acute effects, it can result in neurodegenerative conditions in advanced ages. While it inherently makes sense to compare flies at the same age (D45), different injury groups technically experienced different post-injury recovery times in such a comparison. Therefore, we also compared the groups by matching their recovery time of 2 weeks. We found that within the same timeframe, flies injured at younger ages exhibit a smaller decrease in sensorimotor abilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>). This was true for both male and female flies, although sex difference existed in this 2-week comparison as well. Out of all injury groups, D3<sub>Inj</sub> males were the only cohort of flies that displayed no change in climbing ability 2 weeks after vmHT exposure. On the other hand, all injured females, as well as D31<sub>Inj</sub> males, exhibited an increase in vacuole formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1CâF</xref>).

Thus, injury-induced deficits could manifest in both the speed and angle of climbing. Speed analyses revealed that in both male and female flies vmHT exposure resulted in a shift in the distribution of speed to slower speeds. Female flies exhibited a progressively larger shift from D3<sub>Inj</sub>, D17<sub>Inj</sub>, to D31<sub>Inj</sub>, and males only see this decrease in D17<sub>Inj</sub> and D31<sub>Inj</sub> cohorts, with D31<sub>Inj</sub> flies exhibiting the slowest speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Next, we quantified the directionality of each fly at every frame of each trial and presented the data in angular histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Here, vertical direction to the top is defined by an angle of 0Â°, whereas angles of â90Â° and 90Â° indicate that the fly is moving horizontally. We arbitrarily defined those flies moving with an angle between â30Â° and 30Â° as climbing normally in the vertical direction. vmHT exposure caused a significant portion of fly movement to fall outside the normal angular range, especially in flies injured at older ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>).

It is thus plausible that the elevated brain deficits observed in females had resulted from a larger impact force from vmHT. To test this possibility, we first reduced the impact force for female flies to match the impact force that the male flies experienced, which was accomplished by reducing the acceleration distance of the injury apparatus. We found that exposure to the reduced injury elicited similar behavioral deficits and brain pathology as exposure to regular vmHT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Since virgin females are similar in size and mass to mated females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), we next investigated the long-term responses of virgin females to vmHT.

Together, these data suggest that the difference in body size/mass between male and female flies is unlikely the cause for the observed vulnerability to late-life neurodegeneration in mated females.

It should be noted that the SPR RNAi line has been previously validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yapici et al., 2008</xref>) and its effectiveness in SPR knockdown is evident in female flies as they exhibit dramatically reduced egg laying and, importantly, lack typical post-mating behaviors (such as the rejection of male flies after the initial mating) observed in the wildtype-mated female flies. In fact, female flies with RNAi-mediated SPR knockdown behave identically to females mated with SP-null male flies, confirming the effective disruption of the SP-SPR signaling pathway.

In this study, we take advantage of the short lifespan and powerful genetic tools of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, in combination with our headfirst impact model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behnke et al., 2021b</xref>), to investigate how early exposure to a very mild form of repetitive head trauma leads to late-life neurodegeneration. Previously, we showed that mild repetitive injuries can elicit degenerative phenotypes in both male and female flies, but female flies appear more vulnerable to the injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behnke et al., 2021b</xref>). Our current study has further substantiated the previous findings by examining different age-at-injury cohorts and demonstrating their age-dependent and sexually dimorphic responses to a very mild form of repetitive head impacts. Furthermore, we discovered a strong link between SP signaling and injury-induced neurodegeneration in females. Compared to males, virgin females, and SP<sup>0</sup>-mated females, female flies mated to wildtype males were much more vulnerable to developing sensorimotor deficits and brain degeneration following injury exposure. This demonstrates, for the first time, the convergence and interaction of two supposedly separate pathways, namely the pathophysiological mechanisms elicited by mild head injury and the post-mating responses mediated by SP exposure. While activation of either one of these pathways was insufficient to generate neurodegenerative effects in females, their combination facilitated the emergence of quantifiable brain deficits. These findings provide an important foundation to further investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying sex differences in injury responses and neurodegeneration.</p><p>Sex-related differences have been documented in many medical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vegeto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cerri et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nebel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Podcasy and Epperson, 2016</xref>) and neurotrauma of various severities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yue et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gupte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rauen et al., 2021</xref>). Sex differences include anatomical differences, sex gonadal hormones, and immunological responses, all of which presumably affect vulnerability to injury. In fact, there seems to be a growing consensus concerning sex-dependent effects in response to TBI, though clinical and preclinical findings are inconsistent. While female sex is more often associated with worse outcomes in human TBI studies, in preclinical TBI studies it is more frequently associated with better outcomes and neuroprotection after TBI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gupte et al., 2019</xref>). Part of this disparity may be attributed to differences in injury severity and animal model, but the underlying drivers of sex differences in brain injury responses and neurodegenerative conditions remain to be fully elucidated. While sex differences in insects inherently differ from that in humans, there are some similarities associated with reproduction and hormone regulation. Therefore, it is likely that some of the fundamental mechanisms revealed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> may be conserved in humans.</p><p>Mating elicits two major types of changes in female flies; increase in egg-laying and reduction in receptivity to mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu and Kubli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chapman et al., 2003</xref>). Sperm alone can induce a short-term post-mating response, but a sustained response (&gt;7 days) requires SP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu and Kubli, 2003</xref>). SP signaling via SPR activation is believed to switch the female to a state that maximizes reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yapici et al., 2008</xref>), which is considered evolutionarily beneficial. However, SP exposure can jeopardize female survival by decreasing daytime sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Isaac et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garbe et al., 2016</xref>), altering the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schwenke and Lazzaro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Short and Lazzaro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Short et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peng et al., 2005</xref>), and increasing female susceptibility to age-dependent tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Regan et al., 2016</xref>). To our knowledge, the current study is the first to directly show that SP-signaling can elevate vulnerability to injury-induced neurodegeneration in female flies. While mammals do not have SP, reproduction in females is known to dramatically alter metabolism, immune system, hormones, and neurobiology, all of which are vital for maintaining pregnancy. A connection between increased risk for neurodegeneration and hormonal changes associated with reproduction has been suggested in humans and other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xiong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gilsanz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jang et al., 2018</xref>). There are also contradictory findings, where female sex hormones are found to be neuroprotective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ha et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Song et al., 2020</xref>). These findings highlight the need for further animal studies with better controls of hormonal and reproductive cycles.</p><p>The current study also examines how aging affects response to mild head injury. In humans, age is one of the strongest outcome predictors for complications following head trauma, including mild trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moretti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jacobs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bittencourt-Villalpando et al., 2021</xref>). Though the cause of injury may differ, older age is consistently associated with an increased incidence of head trauma, a slower overall recovery process, as well as greater morbidity and mortality following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdulle et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mosenthal et al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with these observations, we show that flies exposed to vmHT at older ages developed neurodegenerative deficits at a much faster rate than flies injured at younger ages. Our finding that aging accelerates injury-induced neurodegeneration is also supported by findings in humans and other animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Doust et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rowe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ojo et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting conserved pathways underlying aging-induced vulnerability. Previous studies have suggested that mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chistiakov et al., 2014</xref>) and immune function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weyand and Goronzy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haynes, 2020</xref>) decline with aging. Given that mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 2017</xref>) and compromised immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Needham et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Verboon et al., 2021</xref> have also been implicated in TBI-induced brain dysfunction and degeneration, future work using our mild injury paradigm should investigate their contributions to aging-increased vulnerability and the development of neurodegeneration in response to head trauma.</p><p>Sex differences in aging are conserved across species. In line with this, we demonstrated sex differences in aging-associated vulnerability. While increasing age-at-injury in mated females is generally associated with more severe neurological deficits, females injured on D17 exhibit similar degrees of climbing deficits and vacuolation to those injured on D31, suggesting a possible plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). On the other hand, male flies are very resilient to vmHT at younger ages (D3 and D17), displaying little to no phenotypes even on D45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, at the advanced age of 31 days post-eclosion, exposure to vmHT drastically accelerates neurodegeneration in the male brain, resulting in deficits similar to that of mated females of the same injury group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and E</xref>). As flies age, male flies seem to show a larger decline in resistance to injury-induced neurodegeneration than females. This finding is supported by work studying sex differences in immune senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kubiak and Tinsley, 2017</xref>). In males, this is believed to occur principally due to age-related deterioration in barrier defenses, whereas in females this largely manifests in decreases in innate immunity. Older males may have a weaker exoskeletal defense system, making them more vulnerable to the effects of injury.</p><p>To gain some insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the sexually dimorphic, late-life emergence of neurodegenerative conditions after early exposure to vmHT, we surveyed the transcriptomic landscapes of fly brains with and without vmHT exposure. We were specifically interested in identifying genes whose changes in expression might underlie the observed sex differences between male and mated females, as well as between females of varying reproductive status. Across all conditions and timepoints, we found that the injuries (regardless of age) elicited a very small number of differentially expressed genes that skewed toward decrease in expression. This was initially surprising, because previous <italic>Drosophila</italic> TBI work using the same RNA extraction protocol and sequencing company had reported large numbers of both immediate and lasting gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Byrns et al., 2021</xref>). When we compared sham males and females at the acute timepoint, we found robust sex-specific gene expression (data not shown) and distinct clustering by sex in our PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This confirmed the validity of our data and subsequent analyses and suggested that the small number of differentially expressed genes was likely due to the mild nature of our injury paradigm. Furthermore, it is possible that not all flies experienced increased neurodegeneration following the mild injuries, which could mask transcriptomic changes due to injury-induced neurodegeneration. Unlike other work utilizing a more severe injury paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Byrns et al., 2021</xref>), we did not find any acute gene changes that persisted until the very chronic timepoint of 6 weeks following injury, suggesting that mild injury may induce dynamic transcriptomic changes throughout a flyâs lifespan. Additionally, cellular mechanisms that directly contribute to the development of neurodegenerative conditions may not be immediately active following injury; instead, they may be revealed by aging. To better understand the connections and interactions between acute and chronic changes in the transcriptome, future studies may further characterize these dynamic changes at multiple timepoints throughout the flyâs lifespan.</p><p>Previous work using a mild injury model has shown that AMP expression is elevated in the brain immediately following injury (in the first 12 hr), returned to baseline at 24 hr post-injury, and then elevated again 1 week post-injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barekat et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that persistent elevation of AMP expression levels and the activation of the innate immune system at a chronic timepoint contributes to neurodegeneration. For both mated females and males, our results comparing injured and sham flies at the acute timepoint (1 dpi) do not show any elevation of AMP or AMP-like genes, which is congruent with previous data. A small percentage of immune-related gene changes were identified at this time, but these changes were all biased towards an injury-induced suppression. However, at 6 weeks post-injury, we find that the injury paradigm overwhelmingly depressed AMP and AMP-like gene expression in both male and mated female brains but not in virgin and SP-null mated female brains. Interestingly, injury-induced suppression of <italic>Metchnikowin</italic> and <italic>Diptericin</italic> and increased expression of <italic>PPO2</italic> observed at the chronic timepoint is correlated with female-specific late-life behavioral deficits and brain pathology. This finding is supported by a recent report that mated female flies exhibited decreased markers of oxidative stress following trauma, which could be due to immune suppression following a TBI-induced immune challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jones et al., 2024</xref>). Additionally, work comparing bacterial infection in virgin, SP<sup>0</sup>-mated, and wildtype-mated females suggests that mating and particularly egg-laying reduce the femaleâs overall ability to defend against bacterial infections, leading to decreased expression of AMP genes after infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Short et al., 2012</xref>). This process is mediated by increases in Juvenile Hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schwenke and Lazzaro, 2017</xref>), which is known to suppress innate immune processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flatt et al., 2008</xref>). SP exposure also acutely activates the Toll-like receptor and immune deficiency (Imd) pathways in females, altering levels of <italic>Metchnikowin</italic> and <italic>Diptericin (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peng et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, even one instance of mating is sufficient to induce chronic immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gordon et al., 2022</xref>). These changes may compound injury-induced changes to disrupt immune homeostasis, leading to observed immunosuppression in mated females. At an advanced age, a decreased expression of AMPs suggests that the mated female flyâs innate defense may be worsened by injury, making them unable to mount a sufficient immune response to pathological insults and therefore more susceptible to infections and disease.</p><p>Our finding of the decreased expression of AMP genes at this very chronic timepoint of 6 weeks post-injury, in combination with other groupsâ findings of short-term elevation of AMP genes, also suggests a temporally dynamic gene expression pattern in response to head injury. Though immune suppression in mated females seems to contribute to neurodegenerative phenotypes, it is not immediately clear why suppression of a different set of AMP genes was not sufficient for neurodegenerative phenotypes in males. Future work can utilize males injured at older ages or with a more severe paradigm to understand male-specific transcriptome changes that contribute to injury-induced neurodegenerative conditions. Finally, though our RNA-seq data is informative, we acknowledge that there is limited correlation between mRNA and protein levels. Clearly, future studies are needed to dissect the genetic components and molecular players involved in the sex-different development of neurodegenerative conditions after mild head trauma.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly husbandry</title><p>Flies were maintained at 25Â°C, with 60% humidity on a 12 hr:12 hr light:dark cycle and kept in vials containing fresh fly media consisting of cornmeal, yeast, molasses, agar, and <italic>p</italic>-hydroxy-benzoic acid methyl ester.

Briefly, multiple flies were contained within a custom plastic injury vial designed to fit within an injury rig consisting of a cradle connected to a pulley system with a counterweight. To ensure consistency across injuries, each injury trial consisted of pulling the cradle downward to the base of the injury rig, followed by lightly tamping the cradle three times for all the flies to fall to the bottom of the vial before releasing it for upward acceleration. When the cradle and injury vial stopped at the top, the momentum of the fruit flies continued to propel them upward to the glass ceiling, where they sustained headfirst impacts. In this study, we modified the injury paradigm such that it consisted of one session of 15 impacts spaced 10 s apart (referred to as vmHT). Flies were injured at 3 days (D3<sub>Inj</sub>), 17 days (D17<sub>Inj</sub>), or 31 days post eclosion (D31<sub>Inj</sub>). Sham flies (control) were placed into the injury vials for the duration of an injury session (2.5 min) but did not receive any injuries.

Climbing was assessed at the following timepoints after injury: 90 min, 1 day, 1 week, and weekly until D45. Flies were placed in plastic vials with a soft bottom consisting of 5% agar. Custom 3-D-printed caps wrapped in parafilm were used to contain the flies. Up to four vials were assayed at the same time, using a custom 3-D polylactic acid (PLA) printed rig. A lightboard was placed behind the apparatus to enhance background contrast for the video recordings. For each trial, the rig was lightly tamped three times, and fly movement was recorded using a Panasonic HC-V800 digital video recorder at 60 frames per second. Three trials were conducted for each video, spaced 1 min apart. Using FIJI, videos were cropped to fit individual vials, and then trimmed to the first 601 frames (10 s) after flies fell to the bottom. The 10 s videos then underwent manual fly behavior tracking or idTracker.ai and subsequent analyses.

They find age and sex differences: older age is susceptible to mild TBI and females are also more susceptible. In particular, they pursue a finding that virgin vs mated females show different responses: virgins are protected but mated females succumb to TBI with climbing deficits. In fact, virgin females compared to mated females are largely protected. They discover this is associated with exposure of the females to Sex Peptide in the reproductive neurons of the female reproductive tract. When they extend to RNAseq of brains, they show that there are very few genes in common between males, mated females, virgins and females mated with males lacking sex peptide. But what the few chronic genes associated with mated females seem associated with the immune system. These findings suggest that mated females have a compromised immune system, which might make them more vulnerable.

Importantly, the effectiveness of SPR knockdown is evident in female flies as they exhibit dramatically reduced egg laying and, importantly, lack the typical post-mating behaviors (such as rejection of male flies after initial mating) observed in the wild type mated female flies.

However, in Figure 3, the authors found that female flies have a lower climbing index, more brain vacuolation, and neurodegeneration in the late phase. It's not very convincing that having a lower climbing index at the late phase is due to neurodegeneration. Is it possible that females suffered from more severe acute effects, at least in D17 injury?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. Female flies injured on D17 displayed acute climbing deficits at 90 minutes post-injury. Since we did not observe significant structural changes in the brain at this time, we believe that this short-term functional deficit is not due to acute neuronal death. Here it is important to note that males did not display any acute climbing deficits when injured on D17, which suggests that the females suffered from more severe acute effects than males. However, these injured female flies recovered fully at 24 hours post-injury and displayed no climbing deficits. At two weeks post-injury, we observe climbing deficits and increased vacuole formation as a direct result of the injuries on D17 (see Supplemental Figure 3). When we assessed sensorimotor behavior and brain vacuolation on D45, we found that the injured females had significantly lower climbing indices and more brain vacuolation than the non-injured females of the same age. In this case, the concurrent observance of decreased climbing ability and increased brain vacuolation suggests chronic neurodegeneration in aged, injured females. This is not to be confused with the acute neuronal death observed by other groups using injury models of stronger severity. Overall, our data are consistent with the current view that in many neurodegenerative diseases, functional deficits often precede observable brain degeneration, which may take years to manifest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors determined lateâlife brain deficits and neurodegeneration purely based on climbing index and vacuole formation. These phenotypes are not really specific to TBIârelated neurodegeneration and the significance and mechanisms of vacuole formation are not clear. Indeed, in Figures 3 A and B, male flies especially D31inj tend to have a much larger variation than any other groups. What could be the reasons? The authors should perform additional analyses on TBIârelated neurodegeneration in flies, which have been shown before, such as retinal degeneration and loss, neuronal degeneration, and loss, neuromuscular junction abnormalities, etc (Genetics. 2015 Oct; 201(2): 377â402).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thorough evaluation of our manuscript. The reviewer raised a very important question: whether the neurodegeneration observed in our model is specific to TBI. As the reviewer rightly pointed out, the neurodegenerative phenotypes are unlikely to be specific to TBI-related neurodegeneration. Throughout the manuscript, we have tried to convey the notion that the mild physical impacts to the head represent one form of environmental insults, which in combination with other risk factors such as aging can lead to the emergence of neurodegenerative conditions. It should be noted that the negative geotaxis assay and vacuolation quantification are two well-established approaches to assess sensorimotor deficits and frank brain degeneration in fly brains.</p><p>It is important to emphasize that the head-specific impacts delivered to the flies in our study are much milder than those used in previous studies. As we showed in our figure 1, this very mild form of head trauma (referred to as vmHT) did not cause any death, nor affected the lifespan of the injured flies. Our supplemental data also show very minimal structural neuronal damage and no acute and chronic apoptosis induced by vmHT exposure. Consistently, we did not observe any exoskeletal or eye damage immediately following injuries, nor did we observe any retinal degeneration and pseudopupil loss at the chronic stage of these flies. We have incorporated these important points in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 4, it would be important to perform the behavior test fly speed and directional movement in the acute phase as well to determine whether the females have reduced performance at the acute phase.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Please note that our modified NGA has already improved the spatiotemporal resolution over the classic NGA. The data presented in Fig.3 show that there are no acute deficits for young cohorts. Therefore, we do not believe that the detailed analysis of the direction and speed of these flies is essential.</p><p>Unfortunately, the current setup for the AI-based analysis requires manual corrections of tracking errors, which are time-consuming and tedious. We are building a newly designed AI-based NGA (NGA.ai) that will allow automatic tracking and quantification with minimal manual interventions. Once it is completed, we will perform some of the analyses that the reviewer suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 8, the authors performed an RNAâseq analysis and identified some dysregulated gene expressions. However, it is really surprising to see so few DEGs even in wildâtype males and mated females, and to see that none of DEGs overlap among groups or related to the SPâsignaling. This raises questions about the validity of the RNAseq analysis. It is critical to independently verify their RNAâsequencing results and to add some more molecular evidence to support their conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that future studies are needed to independently validate our RNA sequencing results. We believe that the small number of DEGs are likely due to two unique features of our study: (1) the very mild nature of our injury paradigm and (2) the chronic examination timepoint that was long after the head injury and SP exposure, which distinguish our study from previous fly TBI studies. As pointed out in the manuscript, our study was aimed to understand how early life exposure to repetitive head traumatic insults could lead to the latelife onset of neurodegenerative conditions. We hope to further validate our results in our next phase of experiments using single-cell RNA sequencing and RT-qPCR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The current results raise a series of interesting questions: what implication of female fly mating and its associated Sex Peptide signaling would be to mammalians or humans? Would mammalian female animals mating with wildâtype or sex hormoneânull male animals have different effects on their postâinjury behavior tests or neuropathological changes? What are the mechanisms underlying the sexual dimorphism?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer pointed out, it would be very interesting to explore the possible roles of sex peptide-signaling in other animals and humans. As far as we know, there is no known mammalian ortholog to the insect sex peptide, so it would be difficult to study SP or an SPlike molecule in mammalian models. However, we believe that prolonged post-mating changes associated with reproduction in female fruit flies contribute to their elevated vulnerability to neurodegeneration. In this regard, drastic changes within the biology of female mammals associated with reproduction can potentially lead to vulnerability to neurodegeneration. We agree that this demands further study, which may be done with future collaborators using rodent or large animal models. We have discussed this point in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
