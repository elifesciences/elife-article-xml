Outside of these frequent moments of unconsciousness, approximately a third of people living with the disorder experience treatment-resistant attention impairments. Convergent evidence suggests prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction may underlie attention impairments in affected patients. To examine this, we use a combination of slice physiology, fiber photometry, electrocorticography (ECoG), optogenetics, and behavior in the <italic>Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mouse model of absence epilepsy. Attention function was measured using a novel visual attention task where a light cue that varied in duration predicted the location of a food reward. In <italic>Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice, we find altered parvalbumin interneuron (PVIN) output in the medial PFC (mPFC) in vitro and PVIN hypoactivity along with reductions in gamma power during cue presentation in vivo. This was associated with poorer attention performance in <italic>Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice that could be rescued by gamma-frequency optogenetic stimulation of PVINs. This highlights cue-related PVIN activity as an important mechanism for attention and suggests PVINs may represent a therapeutic target for cognitive comorbidities in absence epilepsy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>People who experience absence seizures may go through brief lapses in consciousness hundreds of times a day. They also often have difficulties engaging and remaining focused on a task, which can severely limit their ability to study, work and go through their day-to-day life. These impairments in attention persist even when medication puts a stop to the seizures, suggesting that they are not directly linked to the epileptic episodes. In fact, recent work has indicated that these deficits may be caused instead by alterations in the activity of the prefrontal cortex, the brain area which helps to regulate attention and impulsivity. However, the exact nature of these changes remains unclear, making it difficult to design treatments that could improve patients’ quality of life.</p><p>To explore this question, Ferguson et al. developed a new behavioral test that allowed them to measure the attention levels of mice genetically engineered to have absence seizures. The experiments confirmed that these animals had impaired attention even when brain activity recordings showed that they were not experiencing seizures.</p><p>Further work revealed that poor performance on the behavioral test was linked to decreased activity in parvalbumin interneurons, a group of cells in the prefrontal cortex which can inhibit many other types of neurons. In mutant mice, this change was associated with alterations in network activity broadly in the cortex, including in electrical patterns which are linked to cognitive processes. Promisingly, increasing the activity of the interneurons during the attention task improved performance, suggesting that this type of cell could represent a therapeutic target for attention deficit in absence epilepsy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>attention</kwd><kwd>epilepsy</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>interneurons</kwd><kwd>PV</kwd><kwd>gamma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1K99MH128892</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferguson</surname><given-names>Brielle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F32NS112764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferguson</surname><given-names>Brielle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005492</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Dean's Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferguson</surname><given-names>Brielle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders &amp; Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01NS034774</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huguenard</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Targeting reductions in prefrontal PV interneuron activity and gamma power during cue presentation can rescue attention impairments in a mouse model of absence epilepsy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Attention is required for most aspects of moving through the world, from holding a conversation in a crowded room, to crossing a busy intersection. Disrupted attention presents as a persistent comorbidity across several disease states, even when certain hallmark symptoms respond to treatments or are in remission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Meeren et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rock et al., 2014</xref>). One such example is absence epilepsy, where attention deficits do not respond to current treatments and are a significant predictor of adverse long-term outcome across patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Masur et al., 2013</xref>). Absence seizures are diagnosed by a distinct EEG pattern: bilateral synchronous 3–4 Hz spike-and-wave discharge (SWD), which manifests as brief periods of unconsciousness accompanied by a lapse in motor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gibbs et al., 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Panayiotopoulos, 1999</xref>). Typical absence seizures are present in 10–15% of all epilepsy syndromes, and can occur hundreds of times throughout the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Panayiotopoulos, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Posner, 2008</xref>). While animal models reliably capture many aspects of the absence seizure phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coenen and Van Luijtelaar, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Meeren et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Papale et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Vergnes et al., 1982</xref>), there has been little direct exploration of attention performance in rodent models of absence epilepsy or of the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Components of attention include the initiation or engagement of attention, vigilance or sustained attention, and attentional shifting or flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mirsky, 1987</xref>). Several studies point to the dorsolateral PFC supporting many of these components in humans and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barceló et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gregoriou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rossi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zanto et al., 2011</xref>). This is strengthened by lesion data from rodents of the closest functional homolog of human dorsolateral PFC, the prelimbic medial PFC (mPFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chudasama and Muir, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kahn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Muir et al., 1996</xref>). Recent advances have allowed for more exploration into cell-type-specific mechanisms of attention, revealing that fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons, or parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVINs), show attention-related activity. Medial PFC PVINs have been shown to represent rule information in a flexible attentional shifting task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rikhye et al., 2018</xref>), while population increases in PVIN activity during the delay period prior to cue onset are associated with correct choices in a sustained attention task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>Here, we utilized in vitro local field potential (LFP) and whole-cell recordings in mPFC slices, and in vivo fiber photometry, electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings, optogenetics, and behavior to explore circuit mechanisms of attention disruption in the <italic>Scn8a</italic> mutant mouse model of absence epilepsy. In wild-type (WT) and <italic>Scn8a</italic> mutant mice, we observed that cue-evoked increases in mPFC PVIN activity occurred before correct choices during a novel attentional engagement task (AET). <italic>Scn8a</italic> mutant mice however, exhibited attenuated cue-evoked PVIN activity, reduced gamma band activity, and poorer performance on the AET that was independent of seizure pathology. This was associated with reduced putative feedforward inhibition in slice recordings of mPFC LFPs and increased synaptic failure rate during gamma-frequency stimulation of PVINs. Promisingly, we found that gamma frequency optogenetic activation of PVINs during the cue period was sufficient to recover attention performance in <italic>Scn8a</italic> mutant mice. This suggests that cue-related increases in mPFC PVIN activity support basic attentional processes and may provide both a regional and cell-type-specific therapeutic target for attention dysfunction in absence epilepsy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Scn8a mutant mice exhibit attention deficits on the Attentional Engagement Task</title><p>To examine the mechanisms of attention impairments in absence epilepsy, we used mice with a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in <italic>Scn8a (Scn8a<sup>med</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kohrman et al., 1996</xref>) henceforward referred to as <italic>Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>.

Still, the implications of partial <italic>Scn8a</italic> loss for cortical circuit function, including in the mPFC and its role in attentional processing, remain unexplored.</p><p>To measure attention, we developed a novel assay, combining training and testing strategies from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kahn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Turner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wimmer et al., 2015</xref>). Mice (<italic>Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>and <italic>Scn8a<sup>+/+</sup></italic> littermates referred to as WT) were food-restricted to 85% of their free-feeding weight and habituated to the operant chamber. Using behavioral shaping, mice were trained to nose-poke in two distal ports to obtain a food reward (10 µL of evaporated milk). Then, mice learned to initiate trials by nose-poking in a center port, and that a visual cue, a white LED present for 5 seconds (s) in one of the two reward ports, would indicate the location of a food reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). On average, mice learned this association in 6 training sessions, and there were no group differences in how long it took mice to reach stable performance or criterion (3 days at greater than 70% correct or 2 days greater than 90% correct, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom). Then, testing began, and while the cue still indicated the reward location, the cue length was varied pseudorandomly between 5 s, 2 s, 1 s,.5 s, or.1 s. We chose this range of cue lengths, hypothesizing that the long 5 s cue would require little attention due to the ease of detectability and prior exposure to this cue length during training. By contrast, the shorter cue lengths would be unexpected and significantly more difficult to report correctly, thus increasing cognitive and attentional load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Parasuraman and Mouloua, 1987</xref>). Additionally, by including the shortest cue lengths, .5 s and.1 s, we could approach a floor effect where most mice would have difficulty detecting the cue and we would expect them to perform poorly. With this design, we could identify specific intermediate cue lengths that would generate variable performance rates across mice and genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dinstein et al., 2015</xref>). We also hypothesized that performance at these intermediate cue lengths would be accompanied by related functional differences in brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Faisal et al., 2008</xref>). To isolate basic processes related to attentional recruitment, referred to here as engagement, rather than vigilance or selective attention such as is described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">St Peters et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Young et al., 2009</xref>), we did not incorporate any delays after trial initiation or between the cue and the response period, distractors throughout the trial, or abstraction. In all mice, we observed a performance decrement with cue length, approaching chance levels at the 0.1 s cue. However, <italic>Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice performed significantly worse than WT mice at intermediate cue lengths (2 s and 1 s), suggesting an impairment in attentional engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice exhibit attention deficits on the Attentional Engagement Task (AET).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top, AET task design.

We also quantified omissions, trials in which the animal took longer than 5 s following cue termination to make a choice (likely because the animals failed to perceive the presence of the cue) and found no differences between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This lack of difference in performance during single cue-length blocks or omissions suggests that observed differences on the AET are specific to increases in attentional load rather than an effect of reduced <italic>Scn8a</italic> on visual perception or discrimination. There was no effect of group on reaction time (seconds between cue termination and port selection); however, all mice had increased reaction time for incorrect trials, which has been correlated with impaired attention in other paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fitzpatrick et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Weissberg et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To explore whether mice showed signs of behavioral inflexibility in their responses, we quantified repetitive responding, defined here as the number of blocks of five consecutive trials in which the animal selected the same port. We observed that <italic>Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice had a higher repetitive responding in comparison to WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Finally, to examine whether <italic>Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice might exhibit broad behavioral impairments, we assayed sociability utilizing the three-chamber task and the hippocampal-dependent object recognition task and observed no significant differences between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–L</xref>). For subsequent AET experiments we utilized only three cue lengths in our analysis, 5 s as the long cue, 2 s as our intermediate (int) attention-related cue, and 0.5 s as the short cue to simplify the task interpretation, data presentation, and reduce the number of statistical comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>AET performance deficits are unrelated to acute seizure activity in Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup> mice</title><p>Absence epilepsy patients experience attention impairments during interictal periods and even when seizures are well controlled with anti-epileptic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barone et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that attention dysfunction is not purely due to the periodic losses of consciousness associated with SWDs. Additionally, absence seizure prevalence is highest in periods of quiet waking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barone et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that seizure burden would be low while animals were actively performing the task and would not influence task performance. To examine this, we implanted <italic>Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice with screws for cortical surface (ECoG) recordings over the seizure-prone somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fogerson and Huguenard, 2016</xref>) and recorded ECoG signals while animals were either engaged in the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) or in their home cage. Engaging in the task reduced seizure frequency in <italic>Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice in comparison to that recorded in their home cage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To assess whether SWDs may contribute to reduced performance in <italic>Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice, we compared the ECoG spectral power using wavelet decomposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Torrence and Compo, 1998</xref>), between correct trials and incorrect trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). We found no difference in the Ø (7–10 Hz) or β (10–20 Hz) range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>) which encompass the fundamental and 2<sup>nd</sup> harmonic frequency bands for absence seizures, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sorokin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In <italic>Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice, there were no differences in power across cue lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–K</xref>). As we would expect a spectral power <italic>increase</italic> with any seizure activity (example SWD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), the lack of difference in seizure band power during correct versus incorrect trials suggests that seizures do not contribute to AET errors in <italic>Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice. On average, in <italic>Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice, ~1% of trials had seizures within 10 s of the trial, and in fewer than 1% of trials (0.24%) were we able to detect seizures during the cue (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

This was corroborated by network electrophysiology experiments both in vitro and in vivo, providing a novel circuit-level mechanism for attention impairments in absence epilepsy.

ECoG recordings have the advantage of reflecting a larger spatial range of neural activity compared to LFP and likely are more reflective of network synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ray et al., 2008</xref>). Conversely, ECoG can obscure the ability to observe local rhythms in Layer 2/3 or 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee and Jones, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yazdan-Shahmorad et al., 2013</xref>).

Regardless of their mechanisms of regulation or recruitment, broadly elevated mPFC PVIN activity seems to provide an optimal cortical state for improved information processing during attention and other higher order cognitive behaviors. This may be due to their ability to suppress neurons representing distracting information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ferguson and Gao, 2018a</xref>) and their role in facilitating gamma oscillations which have been linked enhancing neuronal representations and improving information transfer across cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benchenane et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Beyond cognitive deficits in patients with absence epilepsy and animal models</title><p>Somewhat surprisingly, our behavioral tests revealed that other behaviors were essentially unaffected.

PV-Cre<italic>;Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>-eYFP<sup>-/-</sup> mice were also utilized in an optogenetic validation control experiment described below. All pups were genotyped at postnatal day 21 using a commercial service (Transnetyx), and only mice of the desired genotypes were selected and randomly assigned to experimental groups. All mice were maintained on a reverse 12 hr dark/light cycle, and all experiments occurred during their active cycle. Males and females were used all experiments and were 2–4 months of age. No experimental differences due to sex were observed. Food and water were available ad libitum, except for during training and testing for the AET. For the AET and variable delay-to-signal task (VDST), mice were food restricted to approximately 85% of their free-feeding weight, 2 weeks prior to beginning experiments. All experiments were approved by the Stanford Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care (APLAC, Protocol #12363) and were performed in accordance with the National Institute of Health guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Method details</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Surgery</title><p>Mice aged postnatal day 40–50 were used for all surgeries. For the fiber photometry experiments, <italic>Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>or WT mice received a unilateral injection of a AAV5-CAG-FLEX-GCaMP6s (Addgene, #100842-AAV5) tagged with GFP into the prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) using the coordinates (AP: –2.6, ML:+0.25, DV: –1.0). Briefly, a Hamilton syringe was slowly lowered to the target region, and the virus (300 nL) was infused at a rate of 50 nL/min. The cannula remained in place for 5 min post injection, then an optical fiber (400 μm, 0.48-NA, 1.25 mm-diameter stainless steel ferrule, Doric Lenses) was implanted slowly directly above the viral infusion site. For optogenetics, the virus used was an AAV5-FLOX-ChR2-mCherry (Addgene, #20297-AAV5) or a AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-eYFP (UNC Vector Core). The viral injection and optical fiber (200 μm, 0.22-NA, 1.25 mm-diameter stainless steel ferrule, Doric Lenses) insertion procedure was the same, except it was bilateral rather than unilateral. VGAT:ChR2 mice also were implanted with bilateral optical fibers into the mPFC. Following optical fiber insertion, the optical fiber was stabilized, and the incision was closed using dental cement. After surgery, animals recovered for one week before food restriction, and a week later, experiments began. Following experiment completion, animals were sacrificed for histological verification of viral expression and optical fiber placement. Animals with insufficient viral expression or improper optical fiber placement were excluded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Behavior</title><p>Attentional Engagement Task (AET). For the AET, mice were food restricted for at least one week prior to experiments to increase motivation for the task. First, mice were habituated to the chamber, that was modeled from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wimmer et al., 2015</xref> and consisted of a center initiation port, and two reward ports on the left and right side. During training, mice learned to use visual cues (a white LED positioned below each reward port) to locate a food reward. During each session, mice remained in the chamber until 80 min had passed, or they had completed 100 trials, whichever came first. To initiate trials, mice learned to place their nose in a center portal, breaking an infrared light-emitting diode (IR LED) beam between an IR LED-photodiode pair. Following the visual cue (5 s LED flash), doors blocking access the two reward ports would raise. A correct choice would trigger reward delivery (10 µl of condensed milk) from a syringe pump (World Precision Instruments) connected to the reward port. Following an incorrect choice, the doors would close, leading to a 30 s timeout, where the animal could not initiate another trial. All mice had to reach a criterion of at least 70% correct for 3 consecutive training days, or 90% correct for 2 days. During testing, after trial initiation, a visual cue of either 5 s, 2 s, 1 s,.5 s, and.1 s, or 5 s, 2 s, or.5 s, indicated the correct location of the food reward. The cue length and correct side varied pseudorandomly, and performance was averaged over 3 test days. Omissions were quantified as trials in which the animal took longer than 5 s following cue termination to make a choice. Reaction Time was the time between trial initiation and making a response in one of the reward ports. In single-cue length blocks, trials were organized on to 10-trial blocks of each cue length from longest to shortest that repeated until the end of the session. Repetitive responding was quantified by counting the number of blocks of five consecutive trials in which the animal selected the same port normalized by the total trial number in a session. For the VGAT:ChR2 experiments, training for the VDST began immediately following the final AET test day. Animals were trained using the same strategy of reinforcement and punishment as described above to respond to fixed 1 s cue following a 2 s delay. To avoid overtraining, mice had to complete only one day at 60% correct to continue to the testing stage. During testing, the delay prior to the cue varied between 3 s, 4 s, and 5 s while the cue length remained fixed at 1. Trial logic was controlled by a microcontroller (Arduino Mega 2650), and custom MATLAB scripts were used to analyze data and determine the percentage correct at each cue length.</p><p>Sociability. To measure sociability, mice were tested in a three-chamber social interaction task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moy et al., 2004</xref>). For the three-chamber paradigm, the apparatus was partitioned into three zones, with a small walkway so the mouse could move freely between chambers. A camera was mounted directly above the apparatus to capture video that was used for later analysis. Animals were habituated to the entire apparatus for ten minutes. Then, an empty cage was positioned in one chamber, a cage containing a novel mouse was placed in the opposite chamber, and the mouse was given ten minutes for exploration. Videos were scored by the experimenter, and active interaction, time spent oriented toward, sniffing, or interacting with the empty cage versus the cage with the novel mouse was measured.</p><p>Object Recognition. Object recognition was tested as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barker et al., 2007</xref>) in a clear plastic chamber (14x16 x 6”) in which mice were habituated to for 5 min on the day prior to beginning testing. One object pair was a set of four stacked bottle caps, alternating between purple and orange caps. The other was a glass jar of equal height as the tower of caps, filled with purple sand. The testing day consisted of a sample phase and a test phase, with a 2-hr delay between. During the sample phase, mice were given 3 min to explore two identical objects placed in the center of the arena. For the test phase, one of the objects was replaced, and the animal was allowed to explore both objects freely for 5 min, while video was acquired from above the testing arena. The experimenter scored the videos by measuring the total time spent exploring each object within the first 20 s of total exploration. A difference score was calculated by taking the time exploring the object in phase 2 from phase 1, then dividing that difference by the total time (20 s).

Data were acquired using the OpenEphys data acquisition board and software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Siegle et al., 2017</xref>). Data were bandpass filtered using a Butterworth filter (0.1–100 Hz) and sampled at 30 kHz. We recorded ECoG from animals over three sessions where they were initiating trials at a rate of at least 1 trial per minute (engaged in task). For the S1 recordings, this was compared to 3 one-hour home cage sessions. All data processing and analysis were performed using custom MATLAB scripts. Continuous wavelet transformation was used for spectral analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Torrence and Compo, 1998</xref>) as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sorokin et al., 2017</xref>. For seizure detection, we utilized the full power spectrogram to detect seizures and events were only included if they were between 2 and 30 s in duration. Additionally, events that exhibited maximum power beyond the typical absence seizure spectrums (7–10 Hz) were discarded. Seizures were normalized to session length and displayed as seizures/minute. For power analysis, data was segregated by cue length and accuracy, and mean power in the modified theta (Ø, 7–10 Hz) or β (10–20 Hz) range which encompass the fundamental and second harmonic frequency bands for absence seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sorokin et al., 2017</xref>) was extracted, and displayed as mean power and variance in relation to the cue.</p><p>For the mPFC recordings, we extracted data from the cue period across trials and separated data by cue length and accuracy. We generated ECoG power spectrograms (1–100 Hz) using the continuous wavelet transform (Morlet wavelet in the MATLAB wavelet toolbox). The spectrograms were normalized to peak and log<sub>10</sub> transformed, then power was averaged within bands of interest (4-8, 8-12, 12-30, 30-50, 60-90).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Slice electrophysiology</title><p>Extracellular Multi-Unit. To measure differences in network activity, extracellular recordings were obtained from mice who had been previously used for fiber photometry experiments. Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) and perfused with ice-cold sucrose buffer containing (in mM): 234 sucrose, 2.5KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 11 glucose, equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, pH 7.4. Mice were decapitated, the brain was extracted, and coronal slices (400 μm) were collected using a Leica VT1200S vibratome. Slices were transferred to oxygenated ACSF (containing in mM: 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>,2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>), that bubbled continuously with 95% O2 and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and incubated at 32 °C for 1 hr. Then, slices were incubated at room temperature for 1–5 hr before they were placed in an interface recording chamber, in which they were continuously perfused with oxygenated ACSF (30–32°C) at a flow rate of 2–3 ml/min. A linear silicon multichannel probe (16 channels, 100 μm inter-electrode spacing, NeuroNexus Technologies) was placed in the prelimbic mPFC perpendicular to the laminar plane, such that the electrode array collected local field potentials (LFPs) from each cortical lamina. A bipolar tungsten electrode was placed immediately ventral to the recording array in layer II/III to deliver electrical pulses (0.1ms, 100–500 μA in 100 μA increments) to evoke synaptic responses. Signals from all sixteen channels were digitized at 25 kHz, using a 3000 Hz lowpass filter, amplified and stored using a RZ5D processor multichannel workstation (Tucker-Davis Technologies). To better examine the location, direction, and magnitude of currents evoked in response to electrical stimulation, a current source density (CSD) analysis was performed by calculating the second spatial derivative of the LFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Freeman and Nicholson, 1975</xref>). When net positive current enters a cell, this creates an extracellular negativity that is reflected in a current ‘sink’, and appears as a negative deflection in the CSD. Conversely, current ‘sources’ indicate net negative current flowing into a cell and will create positive CSD responses. DNQX (25 μM, Sigma, D0540) and CPP (1 μM, Sigma, C104) were used to determine disynaptic and post-synaptic components. Peak amplitudes were quantified using trial-averaged responses at each stimulation intensity (10 trials each). LFP and CSD plots were generated using custom MATLAB scripts.</p><p>Whole-Cell Patch Clamp. Slices were collected as described above for LFP recordings, with slice thickness of 300 μm from adult animals (P60-90). Pipette solutions contained (in mM): 120 K-gluconate, 11 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, and pH was adjusted to 7.4 with KOH (290 mOsm). For VGAT:ChR2 continuous light experiments, we generated a noisy current injection of 5 s, 2 s, and 0.5 s lengths to mimic naturalistic synaptic input using a stimulus waveform generator (noise waveform, 150 pA DC, 10 pA white gaussian noise stim amplitude, 3ms alpha tau, 100 Hz noise filter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995</xref>). This allowed us to evoke spikes that were variable throughout the traces but consistent across trials. We recorded evoked spikes from Layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in current clamp mode and alternated between no light and continuous light (GABAergic inhibition) conditions during the current injection (5 trials of each per cell). We also recorded the membrane potential (mV) change in pyramidal neurons in response to continuous blue light (5 trials). To measure whether continuous light could provide sustained inhibition, we restricted our analysis window to the last.5 s bin for our measurements of spike counts and membrane potential. Spikes were detected using a thresholding procedure, and membrane potential was averaged across the.5 s bin and compared to the 0.5 s prior to light stimulation (baseline). For the PVIN optogenetic whole-cell experiments, mPFC slices were collected from PV:Ai32<italic>-eYFP<sup>+/+</sup>;Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup></italic>or PV:Ai32<italic>-eYFP<sup>+/+</sup>;</italic>WT mice with endogenous expression of ChR2 in PVINs. Evoked inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSP) trains were recorded from Layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in current clamp while providing a 0.5 s duration 40 Hz TTL train to trigger blue LED light pulses (5ms pulse length). To determine failure rate, we aligned each response to the TTL pulse recorded in Clampfit (indicating the signal to the LED driver) and measured the peak response compared to the baseline within a 0.025 s window. Responses smaller than 0.25 mV were considered failures. Then, we found the percentage of failures within each train and averaged that across 5 trials. To look at PVIN regulation of pyramidal neuron spiking we delivered a 0.5 s 40 Hz train and simultaneous noisy current injection with parameters described above and measured spiking in Layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons with and without the light stimulus train. Spikes were again detected using a thresholding procedure and compared within cells between light and no light conditions to generate a spike reduction rate (number spikes no light - number spikes light / number spikes in light). No difference in resting membrane voltage, membrane capacitance, or series resistance was observed between any control and experimental groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>Fiber photometry</title><p>Fiber Photometry was used to measure aggregate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals from GCaMP6s-expressing PVINs during the AET. The set up was designed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2016a</xref>. Briefly, an implanted optical fiber (1.25 diameter stainless steel ferrule) was coupled to a patchcord with ceramic sleeves (Thorlabs, ADAL1). The patchcord terminated in an SMA connector (Thorlabs, SM1SMA), which was focused onto the sensor of an sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu, ORCA-Flash4.0). A series of emission filters and dichroic mirrors were arranged such that 470 or 405 nm light from two LEDs could be transmitted through the patchcord, and 535 nm light would be collected at the working distance of the objective. A custom MATLAB GUI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kim et al., 2016c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2016b</xref>) triggered the LED drivers (Thorlabs, LEDD1B) through a National Instruments Data Acquisition device (NIDA, PCIe-6343-X). This GUI triggered alternating pulses of the GCaMP activating or control wavelength (470 and 405 respectively) at a frequency of 40 Hz to result in collection of Ca2 +and isosbestic signals at a 20 Hz sampling rate. To account for motion-artifacts, the reference trace (405 nm) was scaled to the GCaMP (470 nm) using a least-squares regression, then we subtracted the scaled reference from the GCaMP signal to get a normalized trace. To obtain the change in fluorescence over time (dF/F), we subtracted the median of the normalized 470 nm signal from the continuous signal at each point in time, divided by the median (f(continuous) - f(median)/f(median)). To align the dF/F to behavior, the Arduino sent TTL pulses at the start of each trial to the NIDA device for storage in a MATLAB file along with the fiber photometry data. The dF/F was separated into trials by cue length and accuracy, and peak, average, and time-to-peak were quantified using custom MATLAB scripts. Representative heatmaps of individual trial data were generated using the MATLAB function imagesc.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-6"><title>Modeling</title><p>Trial Prediction Analysis was performed in python 3.8 using a combination of the <italic>numpy, scipy, sklearn, pandas, imblearn,</italic> and <italic>xgboost</italic> toolkits.

The data was modeled via an optimized implementation of Extreme Gradient-Boosted Classification and Regression Trees (XGBoost from the <italic>xgboost</italic> toolkit). Trials and features were randomly sampled (fraction = 80% and 30% respectively) every iteration of XGBoost in order to combat over-fitting.

Forty µm sections were collected using a vibratome, and sections were mounted and cover slipped with VECTASHIELD Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were acquired with a ZEISS ApoTome 2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analysis was performed using MATLAB, Prism 6 (GraphPad), and python using the Spyder IDE. We determined sample sizes using a power analysis along with our previous studies and literature. All measures are presented as mean ±SE (mean represented with a line and average point in bold with individual data points and SE box at 50% transparency) or individual data points. For all behavior experiments, n represents individual animals. In slice experiments, n represents number of slices with no more than 2 slices per animal. For fiber photometry, electrocorticography (ECoG), and optogenetics experiments, n represents AET data averaged over 3 days from individual animals. Normality was determined using the Shapiro-Wilk test to direct the usage of parametric versus non-parametric tests. Outliers were determined using the mean absolute deviation method and any data set where outliers were identified is noted in the source data files. For normal data, the comparisons of two independent groups were done using a Student’s t test, while paired samples were compared using paired t tests. For data without a normal distribution, a Mann-Whitney U test (independent) or Wilcoxon Signed Rank test (paired) was used. For comparisons of multiple groups and cue lengths, a two-way ANOVA was used followed by post-hoc Holm-Sidak’s test with correction for multiple comparisons. p&lt;0.05 was considered significant and was represented by a one asterisk (‘*’), while p&lt;0.01 and 0.001 was represented with two and three asterisks, respectively (‘**’ and ‘***’). The experimenter was blinded to group identity during data all data collection and analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Source data files</title><p>Source data files for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, along with , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>, , and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref> are available at the following link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HYY2MB">https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HYY2MB</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Provided revised modeling analysis and figures during the second revision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were approved by the Stanford Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care (APLAC, Protocol #12363) and were performed in accordance with the National Institute of Health guidelines.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-78349-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Source data to recreate figures presented in this manuscript has been uploaded to Dataverse and can be found here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HYY2MB">https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HYY2MB</ext-link>.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some straightforward issues raised by one of the reviewers that we would like you to address, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The revision completely and thoroughly addressed all of my previous concerns. The revised manuscript, as it stands, is acceptable for publication at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed some, but not all, of my concerns,</p><p>1. As I wrote in my initial review, collapsing animals across genotypes for regression of PV activity vs behavior when there are behavioral differences across genotypes is statistically invalid. See https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27843795/ This same concern applies to machine learning. Addressing this statistical concern is crucial for making one of the key claims of the paper, that changes in PV activity correlate with behavior. As it stands, all that can be claimed is that there are group differences in both behavior and PV activity between the wt and scn8a+/- mice. This issue affects figure 6, E, F, G, and I and corresponding supplements 1-3</p><p>2. I understand that the authors want to reserve characterizing the clonazepam for another manuscript. However, they cannot make claims based on single example data. If they do not wish to provide group data and corresponding statistics, they can remove the data and claims about clonazepam from the manuscript.</p><p>Typo: line 189 clean copy &quot;less than 1%&quot; should be &quot;fewer than 1%&quot;.</p><p>Typo: line 254 clean copy &quot;thoe&quot; should be &quot;the&quot;.</p><p>Please also address the additional points below: 1. Figure 1B add a p-value for 5s.</p><p>2. Figure 1 E, remove the extra semicolon at the end of the sentence.</p><p>3. In line 164 (attentional load rather than an effect of the loss of Scn8a on visual perception or discrimination), please replace &quot;loss of&quot; with reduced.</p><p>4. Please double-check the statistics associated with Figure 3D. Is the p-value listed for the short interval from a post hoc test or does it refer to an effect of group on performance? If the latter, please remove the * and clearly indicate the group effect in the legend. If it is a post hoc test, please also state the test used.</p><p>5. Line 250 should be amended to (observed a small reduction in performance with continuous light stimulation (Figure 3D) without a significant).</p><p>6. Depending on the result of your statistical assessment of data for Figure 3D please amend the figure title (Photoinhibition of mPFC during cue presentation reduces accuracy in the AET but not the VDST) accordingly.</p><p>7. The use of &quot;critical&quot; in line 271 (time. This suggests that the AET is linked to the mPFC, and that mPFC activation is critical during cue) is overstated, especially since performance appears to remain above chance level. Please replace it with &quot;plays some role&quot; or &quot;functions&quot; or another appropriate term.</p><p>8. Same comment for line 275 (time. This suggests that the AET is linked to the mPFC, and that mPFC activation is critical during cue). The use of &quot;critical&quot; in line 275 is overstated, as % accuracy is minimally affected and remains above chance performance.</p><p>9. On line 319 (endogenously in PVINs (PV:Ai32; Scn8a+/- or PV:Ai32;WT). Given the link between PVINs and gamma), please correct the typo.</p><p>10. In figure 4I, please remove references to the clonazepam data as this is an n=1 or increase the number of animals to at least 3.</p><p>11. Data in figures 6E-G, the data needs to be separated by genotype and analyzed as such. If the previous data conclusions cannot be consistently reached for data analyzed this way, then please remove claims about the PV activity predicting behavioral response.</p><p>12. In Figure 6E, please separate the data by genotypes and analyze it accordingly. Incorrect trials could be included in a separate figure. It is very difficult to see the data points of each genotype in the current form. Is the P-value (p &lt; 0.0001) from a post hoc test? Please list the test.</p><p>13. In Figures 6F and G, only 9 points are represented. One point appears to be missing (see Figure 6E where n=10).</p><p>14. In Figure 6H, there seems to be more than 5 points from each genotype. What is the source of the additional data? Please clarify in the text.</p><p>15. If the training data was randomly selected, please consider revising lines 396-397 to state:</p><p>We trained a classifier using randomly selected, training data with the features peak amplitude and time to peak from all trials at each cue length, and evaluated its performance on a subset of held-out data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78349.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>(1) The abstract could be improved: The novel behavior paradigm the authors developed based on previous cue-based tasks is crucial for the author's claim however, they did not describe this in the abstract.

As this is a primary focus of this future manuscript we chose not to focus on or describe this in detail here. We do consistently observe that the seizures appear almost simultaneously in both frontal cortices during quiet waking and similar to S1, little to no seizure activity is observed in mPFC during the task or during trials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Some neural data to demonstrate that 0.5 mW, continuous stimulation is effective would strengthen the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is referring to the ability of continuous light, as was used in our VGAT-ChR2 experiments to demonstrate that mPFC disruption could alter performance on the AET. To address this, we conducted a whole-cell physiology experiment where we used continuous light stimulation in brain slices from VGAT-ChR2 mice and measured its effectiveness on reducing spikes induced in pyramidal neurons from a noisy current injection. Light was given continuously for 5s, 2s, and.5s to mimic the cue length conditions in vivo. We observed that spikes were reduced on average for each cue length. We also found that for light stimulation that mimicked that of the long 5s and short 2s cues, spikes were reduced throughout, even at the end of the light stimulus as defined as the last 0.5 seconds. In other experiments, we observed reductions in membrane potential throughout the light stimulation. This data is presented below and now included as two supplemental figures to figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The in vitro electrophysiology data could probably all go in to supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s sentiment, but the goal of this figure was to show in the context of the larger paper that we’ve explored the network from a systems to cell level and back again. We felt that this figure was an important network level step to prompt further investigation into inhibitory neurotransmission and PVINs during behavior. To further motivate these experimental results, we also looked at PVIN output to pyramidal neurons during whole-cell recordings. Together, Figure 4 (network in vitro electrophysiology data) and Figure 5 (whole-cell physiology data) provide an even stronger motivation for examining PVIN activity in vivo during behavior. An excerpt from the revised text is included below along with the new Figure 5 and legend.</p><p>“Given PVINs link to driving network activity in the gamma range (Cardin et al., 2009a; Sohal et al., 2009a), we stimulated PVINs with brief.5s 40 Hz blue light trains and recorded the evoked inhibitory post-synaptic potential (IPSP) train in pyramidal neurons at rest in current clamp mode (Figure 5B). We measured synaptic failures by looking at the percentage of IPSPs within the train that were smaller than a.25 mV threshold to determine a failure rate for each neuron. We recorded significantly more failures in Scn8a+/- mice in comparison to WT (Figure 5 C). Additionally, to look at whether gamma-frequency activation of PVINs was capable of regulating pyramidal neuron spiking, we gave a.5s noisy current injection as described above to evoke spikes, and measured the spike number without light in comparison to that recorded with a 40 Hz stimulus train (Figure 5D). We observed that the spike reduction rate with 40 Hz PVIN activation was not changed in Scn8a+/- mice (Figure 5E), suggesting that PVINs are still capable of inhibiting pyramidal neuron output when stimulated optogenetically.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

It remains unclear how cross-hemispheric synchrony or the lack thereof may function in our observed deficits but given the propensity for the altered Scn8a network to hypersynchrony, we might speculate that this particular mechanism of network dysfunction might be unaffected in <italic>Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Quantify the currently vague criteria for discarding high power events &quot;beyond the typical&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been clarified.

If the latter, please remove the * and clearly indicate the group effect in the legend. If it is a post hoc test, please also state the test used.</p></disp-quote><p>The p value refers to the effect of group on performance. We moved the star from the short interval to figure legend to better indicate a group effect and have stated this clearly in the figure legend. We re-ran the stats and included them below:</p><p>Two-way RM ANOVA, group effect F<sub>(1,18)</sub> = 6.990, p = 0.0165, n = 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Line 250 should be amended to (observed a small reduction in performance with continuous light stimulation (Figure 3D) without a significant).</p></disp-quote><p>We added in small, as this is a small change, but it is significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Depending on the result of your statistical assessment of data for Figure 3D please amend the figure title (Photoinhibition of mPFC during cue presentation reduces accuracy in the AET but not the VDST) accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>This was left as originally written (see response to point 4 above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The use of &quot;critical&quot; in line 271 (time. This suggests that the AET is linked to the mPFC, and that mPFC activation is critical during cue) is overstated, especially since performance appears to remain above chance level. Please replace it with &quot;plays some role&quot; or &quot;functions&quot; or another appropriate term.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected and revised to say the following, “This suggests that the AET is linked to the mPFC, and that mPFC activation plays a role during cue presentation in an attention-dependent manner.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Same comment for line 275 (time. This suggests that the AET is linked to the mPFC, and that mPFC activation is critical during cue). The use of &quot;critical&quot; in line 275 is overstated, as % accuracy is minimally affected and remains above chance performance.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected and revised to say the following, “Our optogenetic experiments indicated the AET is linked to mPFC function, suggesting a potential frontal locus for performance impairments in Scn8a<sup>+/-</sup> mice.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

Data in figures 6E-G, the data needs to be separated by genotype and analyzed as such. If the previous data conclusions cannot be consistently reached for data analyzed this way, then please remove claims about the PV activity predicting behavioral response.</p></disp-quote><p>This individual groups are not sufficiently powered to look at correlations within separate groups so these graphs have been removed with the exception of the classifier data. Here we repeated the analysis on the two groups independently and reached similar conclusions. In both groups activity during the cue could predict choice and the separate ROC curves are presented in figure 6 showing classifier performance across all three cue lengths. We have also included a supplemental figure illustrating the classifier performance one each cue length separately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. In Figure 6E, please separate the data by genotypes and analyze it accordingly. Incorrect trials could be included in a separate figure. It is very difficult to see the data points of each genotype in the current form. Is the P-value (p &lt; 0.0001) from a post hoc test? Please list the test.</p></disp-quote><p>The data has been separated by genotypes and re-analyzed. We have also now plotted the correct and incorrect data on separate graphs.

We could have made this more clear, and have clarified that in the methods.
