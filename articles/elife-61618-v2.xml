of the largest cerebral commissure. Remodelling of the interhemispheric fissure (IHF) provides a substrate for callosal axons to cross between hemispheres, and its failure is the main cause of complete CCD. However, it is unclear whether defects in this process could give rise to the heterogeneity of expressivity and phenotypes seen in human cases of CCD. We identify incomplete IHF remodelling as the key structural correlate for the range of callosal abnormalities in inbred and outcrossed BTBR mouse strains, as well as in humans with partial CCD. We identify an eight base-pair deletion in <italic>Draxin</italic> and misregulated astroglial and leptomeningeal proliferation as genetic and cellular factors for variable IHF remodelling and CCD in BTBR strains. These findings support a model where genetic events determine corpus callosum structure by influencing leptomeningeal-astroglial interactions at the IHF.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The corpus callosum (CC) is the largest white matter tract that mediates information transfer between brain hemispheres in placental mammals. In humans, it fails to form normally in approximately 1:4000 live births, resulting in a group of conditions collectively termed CC dysgenesis (CCD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glass et al., 2008</xref>). CCD incorporates complete and partial congenital absence of the CC, as well as hypo- and hyperplasia (thinning or thickening, respectively) of the CC. Each of these structural phenotypes can variably impact brain function and organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown and Paul, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edwards et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paul et al., 2007</xref>), but the precise developmental mechanisms that could give rise to these diverse CCD phenotypes remain unknown.</p><p>CC formation is dependent on a prior sequence of developmental processes: cellular proliferation, migration, axonal elongation, guidance, and targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donahoo and Richards, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edwards et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morcom et al., 2015</xref>). Callosal axons derived from cells within the cingulate and neocortices elongate and cross the telencephalic midline in a region of the septum termed the commissural plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moldrich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rakic and Yakovlev, 1968</xref>). We previously demonstrated that in order for callosal axons to cross the midline, the interhemispheric fissure (IHF) that separates the telencephalic hemispheres must be remodelled to form a permissive substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gobius et al., 2016</xref>). IHF remodelling is mediated by intercalation of specialised astroglia, known as the midline zipper glia (MZG), across the IHF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Silver et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gobius et al., 2016</xref>). This process does not occur in naturally acallosal mammalian marsupial and monotreme species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gobius et al., 2016</xref>), and its failure appears to be a major cause of complete CCD in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gobius et al., 2016</xref>). When IHF remodelling does not proceed normally in placental mammals, callosal axons do not cross the midline and can instead form longitudinal tracts in the ipsilateral hemisphere that are known as Probst bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Probst, 1901</xref>). Although IHF remodelling is a prerequisite for CC formation, our understanding of the cellular and genetic factors involved is incomplete. Moreover, it is unknown whether disruptions to this process could account for the spectrum of commissural phenotypes seen in CCD or whether these are due to independent developmental mechanisms.</p><p>Absence or dysgenesis of the hippocampal commissure (HC) is frequently observed to co-occur with CCD in humans, indicating that these commissures rely on common developmental programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetts et al., 2006</xref>). Analogously, the BTBR T + Itpr3 tf/J (BTBR) mouse has a severe commissural phenotype incorporating complete CCD and HC dysgenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wahlsten et al., 2003</xref>). Using the F2 generation of BTBR × C57Bl/6J (C57) intercross, which displays variable CCD and HC dysgenesis, we previously demonstrated that a highly penetrant locus on chromosome 4 was associated with CC and HC size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones-Davis et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that the degree of dysgenesis of two major telencephalic commissures may result from disruption of a single developmental process. Candidate gene analysis based on filtering for variants predicted to affect functionally relevant genes identified <italic>Draxin</italic> as a favourable gene candidate that might underlie variable CC and HC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones-Davis et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Draxin</italic> encodes a known ligand to the axon guidance receptor DCC and is required for CC and HC formation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hossain et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Islam et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigate the underlying genetic and developmental mechanisms leading to diverse CCD phenotypes in BTBR mice and the BTBR × C57 cross. CCD severity and the extent of HC dysgenesis in these mouse strains is strongly associated with abnormal retention of the IHF, and thus the degree to which IHF remodelling is incomplete. Moreover, we describe an eight base-pair deletion in <italic>Draxin,</italic> which truncates and ablates normal DRAXIN protein expression in BTBR mice. Inheritance of the <italic>Draxin</italic> mutation is a driver of defective IHF remodelling and subsequent CCD and HC dysgenesis in BTBR and BTBR × C57 mice. Mis-regulated cellular proliferation of MZG and leptomeningeal cells were both identified as the cellular correlates for failed MZG-mediated IHF remodelling and interhemispheric tract formation in BTBR mice. Finally, we identify incomplete IHF remodelling in a cohort of human individuals with partial CCD. Together, our results suggest that diverse CCD phenotypes can arise from a single genetic event that variably disrupts IHF remodelling and, consequently, the amount of substrate available for CC and HC axons to cross the midline, and therefore provides the first aetiology associated with partial CCD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The CC and HC are variably malformed in BTBR × C57 N2 mice</title><p>We previously demonstrated that BTBR × C57 N2 littermates display a spectrum of CCD phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones-Davis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Edwards et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we further classified these phenotypes into full CC (CC length ≥3 mm, according to typical C57 wildtype CC lengths in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones-Davis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>), partial CCD (CC length &gt;0 and &lt;3 mm), and complete CCD (CC length = 0 mm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). We identified variable HC size in animals with complete CCD, suggesting that distinct subpopulations of CCD with variable HC dysgenesis may occur within the BTBR × C57 N2 mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). Furthermore, the severity of CCD was correlated with HC dysgenesis; HC length was reduced in complete CCD compared to full CC littermates, and was reduced in complete CCD compared to partial CCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These results demonstrate that the BTBR × C57 N2 mice display a range of CC phenotypes suitable for further investigation of underlying aetiologies.

We previously demonstrated that remodelling of the IHF is a critical developmental step required for subsequent midline crossing of callosal axons, and that failure of this process to occur results in an unfused septum; an MRI feature that is strongly associated with complete CCD in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gobius et al., 2016</xref>). To determine whether incomplete IHF remodelling may underlie the spectrum of CCD seen in the BTBR × C57 N2 mouse, we acquired high-resolution structural MRI scans of adult C57 and complete CCD BTBR mice, as well as a subset of BTBR × C57 N2 mice with complete and partial CCD.</p><p>C57 adult mice demonstrated a fused septum and IHF positioned anteriorly and superiorly to the CC and HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, the acallosal BTBR adult mouse demonstrated an unfused septum and an IHF that is aberrantly retained across almost the full extent of the telencephalic midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, yellow bracket). Consistent with what has been shown previously, the only crossing white matter identified in the dorsal telencephalon of the BTBR mouse was a small, ventrally positioned HC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wahlsten et al., 2003</xref>). Full CC BTBR × C57 N2 mice demonstrated similar midline anatomy to the C57 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Partial CCD mice demonstrated an intact HC; however, the anterior-posterior extent of the CC was reduced and was associated with dorsal retention of the IHF, suggesting that the IHF had not been fully remodelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In support of an aetiological link between an IHF remodelling defect and CCD severity, complete CCD mice had a more severe IHF remodelling defect, with near complete retention of the IHF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). A subset of complete CCD mice displayed a more severe IHF phenotype with an associated dysgenesis of the HC that recapitulates that seen in the BTBR parental strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, left panels) compared to complete CCD mice with an intact HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, right panels). Together, these data suggest that the underlying pathogenesis of CCD in the BTBR × C57 N2 mouse is incomplete IHF remodelling, leading to aberrant retention of the IHF. This further suggests that the severity of the HC and callosal phenotypes is related to the degree of IHF remodelling that occurs.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Axial structural MRI slices and insets (white rectangles) of telencephalic midline anatomy in adult wildtype.</title><p>C57 (<bold>A</bold>) and acallosal BTBR parental mice (<bold>B</bold>), as well as adult BTBR × C57 N2 mice with distinct commissural phenotypes (<bold>C–E</bold>).

To determine whether a similar effect may underlie increased somal translocation of MZG in BTBR mice, we performed birth-dating of MZG progenitors by performing ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU) injections and co-labelling with cell cycle marker, KI67. This analysis revealed an increase in MZG progenitors undergoing division in BTBR mice at E13 and E14, leading to significantly increased labelling of EdU-positive MZG at E14 and E15, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–D, F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We find that increased proliferation and cell cycle exit of MZG progenitors in BTBR mice leads to an over-abundance of NESTIN-positive MZG fibres and increased somal translocation of MZG to the IHF surface prior to IHF remodelling. Since we previously found that precocious generation of MZG is associated with disrupted IHF remodelling in mice with altered FGF8 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gobius et al., 2016</xref>), our results here suggest that disrupted IHF remodelling in BTBR mice could be due to precocious generation of MZG.

For example, humans with pathogenic variants in the DRAXIN receptor, <italic>DCC</italic>, display a range of CC phenotypes and associated HC malformations even across family members carrying the same pathogenic variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jamuar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marsh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marsh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vosberg et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we provide a comprehensive view of the genetic and cellular aetiology of CCD in a mouse model of variable CC and HC dysgenesis and demonstrate that a common structural aetiology might account for a wide range of human CCD phenotypes.</p><p>Our current and previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gobius et al., 2016</xref>) findings indicate that the postnatal morphology of the CC in CCD is dependent on the available substrate formed by MZG-mediated IHF remodelling. IHF remodelling typically progresses in a ventral-to-dorsal and posterior-to-anterior manner, such that an earlier or more severe interruption of this process would be expected to result in a more severe reduction in available midline substrate, confined to the more ventral regions of the septum. It follows that later developing dorsal segments of the CC and HC will be more frequently disrupted than ventral segments, considering that the availability of a dorsal midline substrate for dorsal commissural axons depends on the earlier establishment of a permissive ventral substrate. Variable absence of a midline substrate has been previously associated with incomplete penetrance of CCD and HC dysgenesis in BALB/cWah1 and 129P1/ReJ inbred mouse strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bohlen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wahlsten et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we find that the CC and dorsal HC are most commonly affected in BTBR and BTBR × C57 N2 mice, whereas the ventral HC, which spans the midline within the ventral septum in the mouse, is less affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gobius et al., 2016</xref>). Whilst the ventral HC is phylogenetically reduced or absent in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gloor et al., 1993</xref>), we observed an analogous correlation between the length of IHF in partial CCD adults, which had not undergone remodelling during development, and the presence of a ventrally and anteriorly positioned CC remnant. Likewise, the posterior CC, which develops later than the anterior CC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hewitt, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rakic and Yakovlev, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ren et al., 2006</xref>), was severely reduced in size in our human partial CCD cohort, with only one individual registering a near-normal CC width in this region. This suggests that milder perturbations of IHF remodelling in humans may still permit ventral crossing of callosal axons through a spatially restricted and ventrally positioned midline substrate, resulting in partial CCD. However, the progression of IHF remodelling during posterior CC development has not yet been characterised, so the extent to which these later-crossing axons are dependent on midline substrate formed by further MZG-mediated IHF remodelling remains to be investigated. Moreover, the anatomical position of callosal remnants in partial CCD can be diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tovar-Moll et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wahl et al., 2009</xref>) and may not be fully represented in our cohort. Thus, a longitudinal study on IHF remodelling in normal human CC development and further investigation of IHF remodelling defects as a structural correlate for partial CCD with a variety of callosal remnants are needed to answer these questions. Nonetheless, our findings indicate that investigating the impact of candidate genetic causes for CCD on the competency of MZG to mediate IHF remodelling will potentially yield improvements in the precision of diagnosis and prognosis of CCD.</p><p>We identified an eight base-pair <italic>Draxin</italic> mutation as a predictor for severe CCD in BTBR mouse strains with incomplete penetrance. <italic>Draxin</italic> knockout mice display variable penetrance of CCD on a mixed or C57 genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hossain et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Islam et al., 2009</xref>). The penetrance of CCD in our BTBR × C57 N2 mice carrying the <italic>Draxin</italic> mutation showed a similar penetrance to <italic>Draxin</italic> knockout mice on a C57 background suggesting that <italic>Draxin</italic> drives the CCD phenotype which is modified by additional genetic factors. A similar locus on chromosome 4 has previously been implicated in CC size of an intercross between NZB/BINJ and C57Bl/6By mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roy et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, mutations influencing <italic>Draxin</italic> function may underlie CCD in additional inbred mouse strains. While pathogenic variants in <italic>DRAXIN</italic> have not yet been reported in humans with CCD, humans with mutations resulting in haploinsufficiency in its receptor, <italic>DCC</italic>, display incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity of CCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marsh et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marsh et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vosberg et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Dcc</italic> and <italic>Draxin</italic> interactions can determine the severity of CCD in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2011</xref>). It is therefore possible that DRAXIN-DCC signalling also regulates IHF remodelling in humans through mechanisms similar to those elucidated here in mice.</p><p>DRAXIN has been classically described as an axon guidance ligand, which acts as a chemorepulsive cue for axons derived from cortical explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Islam et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we show a distinct, earlier role for DRAXIN during CC formation in the astroglial-dependent formation of an interhemispheric substrate for axonal midline crossing. IHF remodelling is a multistep process involving (1) the generation and specification of MZG; (2) anchoring and extension of their (MZG) radial glial processes to both the third ventricle (apical) and to the IHF pial surface (basal); (3) MZG migration via somal translocation to the IHF; (4) MZG differentiation into multipolar astrocytes, including the elaboration of processes that penetrate the fissure; (5) the elimination of the leptomeninges within the IHF; and finally (6) the midline crossing of callosal and HC axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>). Most of these steps are disrupted in the absence of DRAXIN, but we propose that the greatest impact on the overall phenotype of BTBR mice comes from its regulation of the earliest steps of IHF remodelling (steps 1–3). More MZG are generated early in development which accumulate at the third ventricle and migrate a shorter distance along the midline pial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8M</xref>). These cells also have disorganised Nestin-positive radial processes, attached to an enlarged fissure that is filled with more leptomeningeal cells that increase their proliferation at early stages in the BTBR mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8M</xref>). Midline glial populations were previously reported to be abnormal in acallosal <italic>Draxin</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Islam et al., 2009</xref>), further supporting <italic>Draxin</italic> as the main genetic mediator of the BTBR midline phenotype. We previously demonstrated that dysfunction of these processes within MZG is causally associated with failed IHF remodelling in mice with altered expression of astrogliogenesis factors, FGF8, NFIA, and NFIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gobius et al., 2016</xref>). Whether DRAXIN acts downstream of FGF8-NFI signalling to regulate MZG development and IHF remodelling could be investigated in a future study. Moreover, DRAXIN could also regulate other aspects of MZG development, such as cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion and signalling, or matrix metalloproteinase activity required for elimination of the leptomeninges.</p><p>In a companion study, we demonstrate that DCC and its chemoattractive ligand, NTN1, also regulate MZG morphology and migration to the IHF, and are therefore crucial for CC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morcom et al., 2021</xref> and HC formation in mice, as well as in humans with <italic>DCC</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morcom et al., 2021</xref>). That study demonstrated that DCC and NTN1 promoted the extension of radial MZG fibres along the IHF and the migration of MZG to the IHF surface for remodelling. DRAXIN is a known antagonist of both NTN1 and DCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Islam et al., 2009</xref>) and could therefore normally inhibit NTN1/DCC-mediated actin remodelling required for MZG morphology and somal translocation to the IHF. Under this model, loss of DRAXIN function in MZG would cause increased MZG somal translocation/migration, which we found to be the case in BTBR mice that do not express DRAXIN.</p><p>We found a significant increase in the proliferation of both MZG cells and leptomeningeal cells in BTBR mice homozygous for the <italic>Draxin</italic> mutation. This phenotype was not seen in DCC and NTN1 mutant mice and these molecules are not expressed or localised within the fissure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morcom et al., 2021</xref>) whereas DRAXIN protein (but not mRNA) was observed on leptomeningeal cells. Together, this data suggests that DRAXIN may regulate cellular proliferation independent of NTN1/DCC signalling. DRAXIN is known to interact with the canonical WNT receptor LRP6 and antagonise canonical WNT signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miyake et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, canonical WNT signalling within cortical radial glia controls cell proliferation and astrogliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gan et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, if LRP6 is also expressed by MZG or leptomeningeal cells, it may be the molecular link between DRAXIN and the regulation of cell proliferation and elevated generation of MZG and leptomeninges, which we observed in BTBR mice.</p><p>BTBR mice demonstrate an abnormally large IHF at the time of CC development that was directly associated with the increased proliferation of cells within the base of the IHF. DRAXIN is known to regulate the migration of cranial neural crest cells at earlier stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hutchins and Bronner, 2018</xref>) and is also involved in basement membrane remodelling during cranial neural crest epithelial to mesenchyme transition in chicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hutchins and Bronner, 2019</xref>). Considering these roles, DRAXIN may directly regulate the leptomeninges, which are thought to arise from the neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batarfi et al., 2017</xref>), by controlling their proliferation or even repelling them from the site of IHF remodelling. Moreover, increased leptomeningeal cell-mediated expansion of the IHF in BTBR mice could prevent the intercalation of astroglial processes, impeding IHF remodelling further. Thus, DRAXIN plays multiple roles in CC formation, beginning with its role in MZG development, midline morphogenesis, and IHF remodelling before controlling callosal axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edwards et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Islam et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morcom et al., 2015</xref>). Whether the effect of the <italic>Draxin</italic> null-allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Islam et al., 2009</xref>) and the BTBR-specific <italic>Draxin</italic> mutation on CC and HC formation is the same is yet to be determined.</p><p>Regarding the role of DRAXIN in partial versus complete CCD, our work suggests that the cumulative success of multiple processes under the control of DRAXIN may determine the extent of IHF remodelling. Moreover, the dysfunction of one or more of these processes associated with <italic>Draxin</italic> variants and co-inherited gene variants in signalling partners like DCC may instead determine the severity of the callosal phenotype. Conditional strategies that impact DRAXIN function in axons versus MZG versus leptomeninges and identification of further signalling partners in these cell populations are necessary to dissect these possibilities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

tested at The University of Queensland according to the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes and with prior ethics approval from The University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee. To generate BTBR × C57 N2 mice with varying degrees of CCD, an N1 intercross was produced and N1 females were crossed with BTBR males to generate N2 mice for analysis. The day of birth was designated postnatal day (P)0. Time-mated females were obtained by housing male and female mice together overnight and the following morning was designated embryonic day (E)0. Animals were anaesthetised and collected as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Suárez et al., 2014</xref>). For EdU labelling, pregnant dams were given an intraperitoneal injection of 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU; 5 mg per kg body weight at E14 or 7.5 mg per kg body weight at E12 and E13, Invitrogen) and embryos were collected 24 hr later. Sex was not determined for embryonic studies. A total of 112 adult BTBR × C57 N2 mice were analysed (n = 47 males, n = 65 females). For the analysis of adult mouse tissue, mice were perfused at 12 weeks of age.</p><p>Genotyping of BTBR × C57 N2 mice was performed by PCR of SNPs associated with CC size in the BTBR × C57 F2 intercross as previously described by us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones-Davis et al., 2013</xref>).

Briefly, skulls were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for at least 48 hr after perfusion. Following this, each BTBR × C57 N2 adult mouse skull (with brain in situ) was washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 0.2% sodium azide. Skulls were immersed in Fomblin Y-LVAC fluid (Solvay Solexis, Bollate, Italy), and air was actively removed from each sample via vacuum pumping prior to MRI scanning. All skulls (n = 112) initially underwent two-dimensional scans measuring diffusion in the mediolateral direction to identify the commissural phenotype. From this analysis, a subset of brains of each of complete CCD (n = 10), partial CCD (n = 11), and full CC (n = 10) phenotypes were dissected from skulls, incubated for 4 days in 0.2% gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist, Berlex Imaging, Wayne, NJ, USA), and scanned with a 16.4 Tesla Bruker Avance MRI scanner using a FLASH sequence that was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schanze et al., 2018</xref>): FLASH sequence (voxel size = 0.03 × 0.03 × 0.03 mm, MTX 654 × 380 × 280, FOV 19.6 × 11.4 × 8.4 mm, TR = 50 ms, TE = 12 ms, flip angle of 30°).

Anteroposterior CC length was measured using the straight length tool from the most anterior point to the most posterior point of the CC. HC length was measured using the straight length tool from the dorsal-most aspect of the HC (inferior to the CC) to the ventral-most aspect of the HC.

The IHF width was measured from LAMININ and GLAST stained tissue sections in two different regions: (1) ~5 μm from the base of the IHF and (2) at the most rostral region where GLAST-positive MZG fibres attach to the IHF surface which coincided with the corticoseptal boundary. The IHF width at the base (region 1) was then expressed as a ratio over the IHF width at the corticoseptal boundary (region 2) in order to reflect changes in the compression of the IHF at the base prior to IHF remodelling. Fluorescence intensity of GLAST-positive and NESTIN-positive MZG fibres in a region of interest ~100 × 200 μm (medial-lateral × rostral-caudal) along the IHF surface was measured in ImageJ v1.52i freeware from multiple intensity projection 2D images generated from 3D z-stacks. The number of SOX9-positive MZG cell bodies was counted manually using the Cell Counter plugin in ImageJ v1.51s freeware from a region of interest at the surface of the IHF measuring ~10 × 200 μm (medial-lateral × rostral-caudal). For cell proliferation assays, the telencephalic hinge was outlined as a region of interest in Imaris from 3D z-stacks. The number of DAPI-positive, EdU-positive, KI67-positive cells was automatically counted using the Imaris spots function as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Faridar et al., 2014</xref>). The colocalisation function was used to determine co-labelled spots within 4 μm (MZG) or 5 μm (leptomeninges) of each other. All counts were performed blind to the experimental conditions and normalised to the number of DAPI-positive cells or the volume of the region of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Experimental design and statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical tests were performed in GraphPad Prism (v.7 and v.8), and p&lt;0.05 was considered significant.

the diversity of corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD) phenotypes and associated hippocampal commissure (HC) malformations in humans with pathogenic variants in the DRAXIN receptor, DCC , in comparison to a mouse model with this mutation. This study extends your work over the years revealing that interhemispheric fissure (IHF) fusion is critical for proper formation of the corpus callosum and its failure is the main cause of complete CCD, and that the extent of aberrant IHF remodeling correlates with commissure dysgenesis severity. The range of CC phenotypes and associated HC malformations in the mouse mirror those in humans and are also variable, perhaps related to stochasticity on the mechanisms involved, or to the dependency on other allelic variants. In all, this is a fine study.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;DRAXIN regulates interhemispheric fissure remodelling to influence the extent of corpus callosum formation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Cecilia Flores (Reviewer #1); Thomas Pratt (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Your manuscript is an excellent account of the cellular and genetic mechanisms involved in the diversity of corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD) phenotypes in humans and in a mouse model. Your work over the years has revealed that interhemispheric fissure (IHF) fusion is critical for proper formation of the callosum and its failure is the main cause of complete CCD. Here you nicely show that the extent of aberrant interhemispheric fissure (IHF) remodeling does in fact correlate with commissure dysgenesis severity, in inbred and outcrossed BTBR mouse strains, as well as in humans with partial CCD.

As Reviewing Editor: You say that contrary to published evidence on Draxin as a known regulator of axon guidance, &quot;Draxin was not found to regulate axon guidance in this context, but rather impacted the proliferation of astroglia and leptomeninges; two cell populations that are also not yet considered to play a major role in formation of commissures&quot;. And &quot;while pathogenic variants in DRAXIN have not yet been reported in human individuals with CCD, a similar effect may underlie the spectrum of phenotypes observed in humans with DCC mutations, since Dcc and Draxin have been demonstrated to interact to determine the severity of CCD in mice (Ahmed et al., 2011)&quot;. In the Introduction and/or in the Discussion it would be welcome to mention the relationship of Draxin to DCC as receptors for Netrin , as well as your other submitted study that is on BioRxiv and submitted to <italic>eLife</italic> on Dcc and Netrin1 regulating intrahemispheric fusion and the midline zipper glia.</p><p>5.

A central contention of this study is that variable penetrance of the commissure phenotypes in the BTBR x C57 mice stems from an earlier midline fusion phenotype.

Most of these steps are disrupted in the absence of DRAXIN, but we propose that the greatest impact on the overall phenotype of BTBR mice comes from its regulation of the earliest steps of IHF remodelling (steps 1-3). More MZG are generated early in development which accumulate at the third ventricle and migrate a shorter distance along the midline pial surface. These cells also have disorganised Nestin-positive radial processes, attached to an enlarged fissure that is filled with more leptomeningeal cells that increase their proliferation at early stages in the BTBR mouse.</p><p>Comparing these data with those in DCC/NTN1 mutant mice (see our companion paper), DRAXIN may mediate steps 2-5 above via DCC signalling, but since DCC/NTN1 mutant mice do not show disrupted cellular proliferation of MZG or an expanded IHF, these effects must be mediated via a different pathway, such as by antagonizing canonical WNT signalling to elicit these effects.</p><p>We have modified the discussion on pages 19-21 to draw parallels between the phenotype of our BTBR <italic>Draxin</italic> mutation model and <italic>Draxin</italic> knockout mice, as well as to further clarify our model while also discussing other potential mechanisms.

The figure (Figure 1) has been amended to reflect the minor changes in statistical significance and the figure legend (page 27) has been updated.

You could perform additional experiments on the glial cells in which Draxin is expressed, to better understand mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that this is a central question that remains from our study. There are a number of technical issues that do not make this possible in the short term. Firstly, we have not found a feasible system for ease of manipulation of genes in these glia. We have not found a Cre-expressing transgenic-line that is well expressed in these cells, that is not otherwise expressed in all progenitors in the forebrain. We have not yet been able to efficiently isolate and dissociate these cells into a culture system, since they become reactive and revert to a progenitor state. In slice culture, these glia also become reactive and do not behave in an in vivo state. We have had some success with in utero electroporation of the progenitors of these cells before, but have had issues with efficiency of knockdown of proteins in sufficient time to have an effect. We have been working on developing a better experimental paradigm to study these glia in more depth. We would like to perform single cell sequencing on these glia in order to identify candidate genes that are enriched in MZG to develop cell-specific driver lines for these cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

It would have been useful to discern whether the (embryonic) midline fusion phenotype also showed the same partial penetrance in BTBR x C57 mice, perhaps also correlated with the WT/MUT Draxin alleles (as in Figure 5). This would be a testable prediction of the hypothesis that midline fusion mediates the Draxin phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We have considered this experiment, but our current data suggest there are unpredictable variables (genetic, cellular, developmental time) that would limit the accuracy of testing this hypothesis. Given the incomplete penetrance of complete and partial CCD in the BTBR x C57 N2 cross, it is not possible to predict on an individual animal level, based on genotype, the final postnatal CC phenotype. It follows that the way in which we would test this hypothesis is to determine whether the ratios of CCD phenotypes detected postnatally (i.e. partial CCD, complete CCD or normal CC) correspond to similar ratios of embryonic cellular phenotypes (i.e. moderately impaired MZG competency, severely impaired, or unimpaired). This presupposes that the measurable cellular phenotypes in embryos can be disaggregated into categorical variables, or clearly delineated quantitative measures, which correspond to adult phenotypes. Given the multifactorial nature of CCD in this model, which could incorporate multiple modulatory genetic factors (as additional QTL have appeared promising but failed to reach significance in either Jones-Davis et al. 2013 or our current study), and multiple cellular factors (MZG, leptomeninges, axon plasticity), we anticipate that such a neat outcome would be unlikely and any measures of cellular phenotypes for a given genotype will fall into a distribution without clear boundaries between expected subgroups. We would anticipate that there would indeed be cut-offs within this cellular phenotype distribution which correspond to final callosal phenotype, but these would need to be inferred from the ratios observed from the final genotypes, and so the logic in identifying these would be circular. A final consideration is that the number of mice required for testing the hypothesis with this number of expected variables is expected to be in the hundreds.</p></body></sub-article></article>
