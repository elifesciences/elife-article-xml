filaments remains poorly understood. To address this, we conducted a principal component analysis based on available filamentous actin (F-actin) and C-actin (cofilins were excluded from cofilactin) structures and compared to monomeric G-actin. The results strongly suggest that C-actin, rather than F-ADP-actin, represented the favourable structure for binding preference of cofilin. High-speed atomic force microscopy explored that the shortened bare half helix adjacent to the cofilin clusters on the pointed end side included fewer actin protomers than normal helices. The mean axial distance (MAD) between two adjacent actin protomers along the same long-pitch strand within shortened bare half helices was longer (5.0–6.3 nm) than the MAD within typical helices (4.3–5.6 nm). The inhibition of torsional motion during helical twisting, achieved through stronger attachment to the lipid membrane, led to more pronounced inhibition of cofilin binding and cluster formation than the presence of inorganic phosphate (Pi) in solution. F-ADP-actin exhibited more naturally supertwisted half helices than F-ADP.Pi-actin, explaining how Pi inhibits cofilin binding to F-actin with variable helical twists. We propose that protomers within the shorter bare helical twists, either influenced by thermal fluctuation or induced allosterically by cofilin clusters, exhibit characteristics of C-actin-like structures with an elongated MAD, leading to preferential and cooperative binding of cofilin.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Actin</kwd><kwd>Cofilin</kwd><kwd>high-speed AFM</kwd><kwd>principal component analysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19K06581</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ngo</surname><given-names>Kien Xuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#23H02452</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uyeda</surname><given-names>Taro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20H00327</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kodera</surname><given-names>Noriyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.52926/JPMJCR1762</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kodera</surname><given-names>Noriyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23K05713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ngo</surname><given-names>Kien Xuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23H02452-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ngo</surname><given-names>Kien Xuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>HS-AFM and Principal Component Analysis provide experimental evidence to substantiate the 'proof of principle' regarding the flexible helical twists of actin filaments that regulate the functions of actin-binding proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cofilin is a member of the actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilin (ADF/cofilin) family that is present in all eukaryotes. There are two major isoforms of cofilin in mammals: cofilin 1 and cofilin 2, predominantly found in non-muscle and muscle tissues, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bamburg and Bernstein, 2010</xref>). Cofilin is widely recognized as a key regulator of actin filament dynamics, particularly in nonequilibrium assembly and disassembly processes. Cofilin promotes the depolymerization and severing of actin filaments in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Andrianantoandro and Pollard, 2006</xref>) and collaborates or competes with other actin binding proteins (ABPs) in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bibeau et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grintsevich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lappalainen and Drubin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ngo et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The structure of an actin filament has traditionally been represented as a simplistic atomic model derived from the G-actin structure in the Holmes model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holmes et al., 1990</xref>) without considering the conformational changes occurring within each protomer during actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kasai et al., 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rich and Estes, 1976</xref>). The rigid-body rotation of the G-actin crystal structure used in the Holmes model prompted the development of accurate models that consider structural changes within protomers, such as the X-ray diffraction Lorenz model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lorenz et al., 1993</xref>) and Oda model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oda et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The actin protomer consists of two domains, the inner domain (ID) and the outer domain (OD), with relatively limited contact between them. The polypeptide chain traverses between these domains twice: at the loop centered around residue Lys336 and at the linker helix Gln137-Ser145, which functions as the axis of a hinge between the domains. As a result, two clefts are formed between these domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dominguez and Holmes, 2011</xref>). The upper cleft, located between subdomain (SD2) and SD4, serves as a binding site for nucleotides and divalent ions like Mg<sup>2+</sup>. On the other hand, the lower cleft, located between SD1 and SD3, is characterized by residues Tyr143, Ala144, Gly146, Thr148, Gly168, Ile341, Ile345, Leu346, Leu349, Thr351, and Met355, which are predominantly hydrophobic. This cleft serves as the primary binding site for most ABPs including cofilin and is also responsible for critical longitudinal contacts between actin protomers within the filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dominguez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujii et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oda et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The actin filament is a double-stranded helical structure formed by the crossover of two long-pitch helices; the distance between the crossover points is known as the half helical pitch (HHP), which is approximately 36 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujii et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holmes et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lorenz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oda et al., 2009</xref>). A canonical half helix is composed of 13 actin protomers (6.5 protomer pairs). Thus, the mean axial distance (MAD) between two adjacent protomers along the same long-pitch strand is 5.5 nm [36 nm/(13/2)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Egelman, 1994</xref>). However, long actin filaments exhibit variable helical twists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Egelman et al., 1982</xref>). Recent cryo-EM studies have demonstrated the atomic structures of short actin segments with cofilin (referred to as cofilactin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Galkin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huehn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>). When cofilin binds to actin in a 1:1 ratio to form a cofilactin segment, the helices became supertwisted, and the HHP is decreased by approximately 25% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McGough et al., 1997</xref>), reducing the number of actin protomers to ~11 in each half helix (5.5 protomer pairs) (PDB 3J0S; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Galkin et al., 2011</xref>). In a simple model, assuming that the MAD remains unchanged in both bare actin and cofilactin segments, the difference in the number of actin protomers impacts the formation of short and long HHPs. Nonetheless, whether the alterations in MAD dynamics are comparable between normal and supertwisted half helices remains uncertain. Therefore, additional research is needed to investigate this particular issue.</p><p>In this study, we utilized several techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA) and high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). We aimed to understand how the allosteric conformational changes induced by cofilin clusters in neighboring bare actin filaments contribute to the preferential binding of additional cofilin molecules toward the pointed-end (PE) side, as reported in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ngo et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we generated pseudo AFM images representing long bare actin filaments (referred to as F-actin structures) and cofilactin filaments without cofilin molecules (referred to as C-actin structures) using available protein data bank (PDB) structures such as 6VAU (bare actin filament from a partially cofilin-decorated sample) and 6VAO (human cofilin-1 decorated actin filament; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huehn et al., 2020</xref>). We measured the HHPs and the number of actin protomers per HHP in pseudo-AFM images and used them as the reference values for the data obtained from our real HS-AFM analyses. In principle, we classify that filament regions with supertwisted half helices and a reduced number of protomer pairs per HHP, as detected in our AFM measurements, are indicative of C-actin-like structure. We aimed to address several issues: (<bold>i</bold>) Does the number of actin protomers per HHP vary between typical F-actin and C-actin-like structure regions? (<bold>ii</bold>) Does the MAD change, and do these changes affect cofilin binding within the unbound actin regions adjacent to cofilin clusters on the PE and barbed-end (BE) sides? Are these changes quantitatively similar or distinct? (<bold>iii</bold>) Can we evaluate the impact of Pi on torsional flexibility during helical twisting of actin filaments to elucidate how they influence the preferential cooperative binding and expansion of cofilin clusters?</p><p>An innovative and previously unexplored facet of this study is the visualization of the actin protomer’s structure within a bare half helix adjacent to small cofilin clusters on the PE and BE sides using HS-AFM. Our findings elucidate the dynamic structural changes in half helices and the number of actin protomers per HHP in normal F-actin. Our results deviated from the conventional ensemble-averaged helical twists usually observed in EM and X-ray diffraction, depicting a rigid half helix. Moreover, we show that shortened bare half helices adjacent to the cofilin clusters on the PE side contain less actin protomers than conventional half helices. The MAD within the shortened bare HHP (C-actin-like structure) is longer than the MAD within the canonical HHP (F-actin structure). This elongated MAD can be interpreted as resulting from the allosteric transmission of structural changes originating in the cofilactin region, extending beyond the boundary between cofilactin and bare actin regions. This extended influence affects the structure of the shortened bare half helix on the PE side. Additionally, our findings suggest that the cooperative binding of cofilin is significantly impacted by the torsional flexibility of actin filaments. The inhibition of torsional motion during helical twisting, achieved via physical perturbation, inhibited cofilin binding and the expansion of larger clusters more than Pi binding.</p><p>We also verify our previous hypothesis, which supports cofilin’s initial binding to the favorable structure of actin protomers because F-actin, without ADF/cofilin proteins, could exist in the 162° twist state observed for cofilin-decorated F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Galkin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galkin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ngo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ngo et al., 2015</xref>). Our hypothesis focuses on the evidence of decreasing the number of protomers within the bare half helix adjacent to the cofilin cluster on the PE side. This reduction leads to a shorter HHP but paradoxically results in a longer MAD in the C-actin-like structure area. The protomers within a shortened bare half helix near cofilin clusters are converted to C-actin-like structures via our proposed F-actin to C-actin transition pathway, thereby facilitating the expansion of clusters on the PE side. If cofilin molecules fail to promptly attach to protomers within the shortened bare region, the protomers resembling the C-actin structure in that region can quickly change the closed nucleotide binding clefts to the open state and transition to a G-actin state. This transition (C-actin-like to monomer G-actin-like structure) ultimately results in severing of the filament at or near the boundary of cofilactin and bare actin regions. Furthermore, this study suggests that Pi binding mainly inhibits the initial binding of cofilin by reducing the fraction of supertwisted half helices in F-ADP.Pi-actin, whereas the removal of Pi enhances the initial binding of cofilin by elevating the fraction of supertwisted half helices in F-ADP-actin. Nevertheless, Pi binding only slightly inhibits the propagation of the supertwisted helical structure within cofilin clusters to bare half helices on the PE side in F-ADP.Pi-actin when compared to F-ADP-actin. Together, this clarifies that the initial interactions of cofilin with F-actin and the subsequent expansion of clusters are closely linked to the variability in helical twists.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Principal component analysis suggests C-actin-like structure as the optimal actin structure for cofilin binding</title><p>To investigate the relationship between actin structure and cofilin binding, we explored the collective changes in actin conformations as they transitioned from G-actin to F-actin and then to C-actin.

Our analysis included an array of actin chains sourced from 41 available PDB structures of filamentous actin protomers bound to cofilin, profilin, DNAse I, and various nucleotides (ATP, AMPPNP, ADP.Pi, ADP, and Apo). We then compared these findings with five additional PDB structures featuring free G-actin and twinfilin-1-bound G-actin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The significant movements of the OD during F-actin to C-actin to G-actin transitions, as revealed by PCA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PCA of actin chains reported in 46 PDB structures (referred to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) reveals collective transition pathway between different actin conformations: G-actin (soluble monomer – blue box), F-actin (filamentous protomer reported with no cofilin bound – green box), C-actin (filamentous protomer reported within cofilactin after removal of cofilin – red box), tilted actin (reported in 3J8J and 3J8K – magenta box) and single-cofilin-bound actin, where one cofilin molecule bound to an actin protomer within an actin filament (reported in 6UBY – orange box).

Furthermore, the PC2 results demonstrate notable similarities between Mg<sup>2+</sup>-F-ADP-actin (8A2T) and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-F-ADP.Pi-actin (8A2S), as well as Mg<sup>2+</sup>-F-ADP.BeF<sub>3</sub>-actin (8A2R).

outer domain (OD, SD1 + SD2), the inner domain (ID, SD3 + SD4), and the entire actin structure. In all cases, we observed clustering of different groups of actin chains. Interestingly, aligning only the IDs of all actin chains yielded the most meaningful PCs. Importantly, PCA can elucidate the conformational transition between C-actin and G-actin structures, and vice versa, through PC1, while PC2 delineates the pathway between F-actin and C-actin structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To visualize the conformational changes associated with each PC, we back-calculated and depicted the PCs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, respectively. These illustrations revealed two outer domain motion modes. The first mode (PC1, accounting for 45% of the structural variance) involved rotations of the OD around the hinge region to seal the nucleotide binding cleft by reducing the SD2-SD4 distance (as indicated by the yellow arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), depicting the transformation between G-actin and C-actin. Structures with higher PC1 values such as F-actin and C-actin are associated with conformations featuring a closer nucleotide binding cleft. Conversely, structures with lower PC1 values, including tilted-actin and G-actin, are related to conformations featuring a more open nucleotide binding cleft. The second prominent mode (PC2, accounting for 28% of the structural variance) included the twisting of the OD during the transition between F-actin and C-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). A higher PC2 value indicates that the OD is more flattened or untwisted, as seen in the tilted-actin and F-actin. On the other hand, a lower PC2 value suggests that the OD is more twisted, as observed in G-actin and C-actin.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-95257-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Possible transition pathways from G-actin to C-actin (constructed by +PC1) and C-actin to F-actin (constructed by +PC2), and vice versa, constructed by -PC1 and -PC2, respectively.</title><p>The transition from G-actin to F-actin ultimately requires both +PC1+PC2. Related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p></caption></media><p>Our PCA results indicated that the structure of an actin filament with singly bound cofilin – 6UBY (orange box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) was in the transition pathway between the F-actin and C-actin conformations, particularly along PC2. This cluster also includes structures of two protomers positioned at the BE side near a cofilactin cluster including chains E&amp;H combined as E and F&amp;G combined as F in PDB: 6UC4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Galkin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>), our analysis suggests that the attachment of a single cofilin to an actin filament induces a slight twisting of the OD relative to the ID (~5°). Furthermore, this effect was cumulative, with more extensive cofilin binding leading to larger OD twisting angles (~10°), thus representing the C-actin state. Throughout this transition, the nucleotide binding cleft remains closed as observed through the minimal variations in PC1 values. This suggests that cofilin prefers to bind to the C-actin structure and the transitional actin states featuring structures resembling C-actin within the actin filaments. However, we also predicted that cofilins do not preferentially bind to the tilted structural state of actin, as tilted actin structures exhibited opened nucleotide-binding clefts, but without the twisting of the OD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Galkin et al., 2015</xref>) (indicated by lower PC1 and higher PC2 values, as represented by the magenta box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Additionally, these tilted actin structures did not align with the conformational transition pathway between F-actin and C-actin.</p><p>Noticeably, PCA analysis revealed higher structural flexibility in F-ADP-actin (red dots), exploring a larger space than F-ADP-Pi-actin structures (orange dots) within the F-actin cluster (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This included the F-ADP-actin structure (3MFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujii et al., 2010</xref>), which notably exhibited a PC2 value significantly approaching that of C-actin structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, upon comparison of structures simultaneously resolved in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chou and Pollard, 2019</xref>, a slightly smaller PC2 value for the F-ADP-actin (6DJO) was observed in contrast to F-AMPPNP-actin (6DJM) and F-ADP.Pi-actin (6DJN; inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Significantly, the magnified views in the F-actin cluster highlight structural resemblance between F-ADP-actin and F-ADP.Pi-actin in recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oosterheert et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reynolds et al., 2022</xref>). The F-ADP-actin structure (8D13) and F-ADP.Pi-actin structure (8D14) exhibit remarkably similar PC2 values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, the PC2 results demonstrate notable similarities between Mg<sup>2+</sup>-F-ADP-actin (8A2T) and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-F-ADP.Pi-actin (8A2S), and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-F-ADP.BeF<sub>3</sub>-actin (8A2R; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Altogether, we suggest that the conformation adopted by actin in the cofilactin region, different from actin-nucleotide-solely dependent state, is the most favorable one for binding cofilin.</p><p>In order to better understand the effect of the collective PC2 movements of individual ODs on the global half helices of filaments, we compared the side views and outer views of F-actin and C-actin protomers in their filamentous structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). The twisting movement of OD that we found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> is best represented again from the side views with the rotation axes (marked as red stars in blue boxes of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). We identified that cofilin clusters rotate the ODs approximately 10°, burying the SD2 including D-loops deeper into the core of the filament. As a result, the twisting angles between two adjacent protomers in the same strand appears to increase from approximately 26° to around 36° if viewed from the outer side (black boxes of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>), as reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Galkin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>). Such change in the twisting angles from the outer views can be represented as the change of the OD lines on 2D surfaces of imaginary cylinders of the filaments, unwrapped along imaginary lines that an AFM tip would scan through (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). Such diagrams depict the varying twisting angles of OD domains within F-actin and C-actin (PC2 mode), leading to the formation of HHPs with different numbers of detected protomer pairs. Hence, collective movements of individual ODs that decrease PC2 values would lead to a globally shorter HHPs and fewer number of protomer pairs per HHP. Thus, this clearly demonstrates that the global shortened HHP is directly related to the OD twists of the local actin protomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C and E</xref>), which represent the C-actin structure.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The variations in half helices and the number of protomer pairs per HHP in F-actin, C-actin, and cofilactin structures in relationship with PC2 analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Side-views (represented by blue boxes, similar to the right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and outer-views (represented by black boxes) of F-actin, C-actin protomers without and with cofilins along long filaments are depicted.

The most commonly observed numbers of protomer pairs per HHP were 6.5 and 7.5, accounting for 60.9% (n=1355 HHPs) and 28.0% (n=624 HHPs) of the samples, respectively. Conversely, the least frequently observed numbers of protomer pairs per HHP were 4.5, 5.5 and 8.5, accounting for 0.2% (n=5 HHPs), 8.2% (n=182 HHPs) and 2.7% (n=60 HHPs) of the samples, respectively. Subsequently, we computed the MAD by dividing the length of each measured HHP by the corresponding number of protomer pairs per HHP, thereby establishing a correlation between these variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The MAD values (mean ± SD) for HHPs containing 6.5 and 7.5 were 5.1±0.2 nm (n=8807.5 pairs) and 5.0±0.3 nm (n=4,680 pairs), respectively. Corresponding values for HHPs with 5.5 and 8.5 protomer pairs were 5.3±0.3 nm (n=1001 pairs) and 4.6±0.3 nm (n=510 pairs) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Notably, we observed that HHPs with fewer protomer pairs exhibited elongated MADs. Our analysis also indicates an extremely uncommon occurrence, with approximately 0.2% of the actin protomers within the F-actin structure (4.5 protomer pairs per HPP) demonstrating elongated MADs (6.0–6.6 nm).</p><p>We next conducted a temporal autocorrelation function (ACF) analysis aimed at estimating the time constants governing the decaying self-correlation in the axial distance (AD) between two adjacent actin protomers along the same long-pitch strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). The core objective of this analysis was to determine the temporal extent of AD similarity and elucidate the dynamic behaviors and conformational changes in the distance between adjacent actin protomers over time. The results revealed that self-correlation of the ADs within actin filaments, immobilized on lipid membrane, rapidly decreased within a few hundred milliseconds and then gradually decayed within a few seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This analysis provides an indirect measure of the degree to which height values near each other in space are similar to one another in actin filaments. If protomers can change the shape and/or rotate around the axis parallel to the filament axis, the individual protomers may have slightly different thickness and/or orientations, leading to variations in the heights of protomers and, consequently, variations in the slopes in heights between protomers (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, Methods). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>, the spatial ACF curves were effectively modelled using an exponential decaying sinusoidal function. The decay constant (<italic>D1</italic>) values (mean ± SD) were determined to be 26.8±6.8 nm. This result provided an indirect measure of the degree to which height values near each other in space are similar to one another in canonical actin filaments. Because our AFM images provide detailed surface topography along a longitudinal section profile with outstanding spatial resolution in height (z-axis:~1 Å), we suggest that the similarity in height among protomers in F-actin persists within a region encompassing approximately 5 pairs (~10 actin protomers). However, the limited lateral resolution (x- and y-axis) in our AFM images, restricted to 1–3 nm, prevented us from delving further into the structural details of actin protomers within this distance decay.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The shortened bare HHP adjacent to the cofilin clusters on the PE side includes fewer actin protomers than the normal HHP, resulting in MAD elongation</title><p>Using HS-AFM, we aimed to simultaneously capture the helical structures and distribution of actin protomers in the bare F-actin, cofilactin, and hybrid cofilactin/bare actin segments within the same imaging area (see Methods). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, we successfully distinguished cofilactin and bare F-actin structures based on a height difference of approximately 1–1.6 nm and a length difference in the half helices of approximately 25%. A bare F-actin segment consisting of two consecutive half helices (HHP1, HHP2) exhibited the expected normal lengths of 36 nm (6.5 pairs) and 36.5 nm (6.5 pairs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, a cofilactin segment with two consecutive half helices (HHP3, HHP4) displayed shorter lengths of 28.6 nm (4.5 pairs) and 29.8 nm (4.5 pairs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Next, we presented a typical segment of the hybrid bare actin/cofilactin structure containing two consecutive half helices (HHP5, HHP6), both showing comparably shortened lengths of 27.9 nm (4.5 pairs) and 30.5 nm (4.5 pairs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Based on our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ngo et al., 2015</xref>), we judged that the bare half helix with the shorter HHP adjacent to the cofilin cluster is on the PE side and that the normal HHP is located on the BE side. These typical data suggest that, similar to cofilactin segments, shortened bare half helices adjacent to cofilin clusters on the PE side include fewer actin protomers than normal half helices. We next analyzed the MAD variation in this hybrid filament over time and made interesting observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We discovered that MAD5 in bare actin HHP5 was elongated similarly to that in cofilactin HHP6 and HHP7. Notably, MAD5 (5.7±0.5 nm, n=13) was extended and closely resembled MAD6 (5.9±0.3 nm) and MAD7 (6.1±0.3 nm). This finding suggests that the MAD elongation in the cofilactin region was transmitted beyond the cofilactin/bare actin boundary to extend MAD5 in the shortened bare half helix.</p><p>We then conducted similar analyses on the hybrid cofilactin/bare actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). First, we observed the minimal impact of the lipid membrane on the half helices (HHP1, HHP2), number of protomer pairs per HHP, and MADs (MAD1, MAD2) in normal actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We examined the bare half helices (HHP3–HHP6) and the number of protomer pairs within each HHP on either side of a small cofilin cluster and found that the shortened bare half helix on the PE side includes fewer actin protomers than the normal half helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>). For example, the cofilin cluster (estimated as 2–4 molecules) shortened one adjacent bare half helix (HHP6) on the PE side (25.5 nm, 4.5 pairs), while the half helix (HHP5) on the BE side was similar to the normal half helix (37.9 nm, 7.5 pairs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In this case, the MAD6 calculated within the shortened bare half helix (HHP6) was 5.7 nm and was larger than the MAD5 value of 5.1 nm calculated within the normal half helix (HHP5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Despite a complete decoration requiring 9–11 cofilin molecules in a half helix, the observation that 2–4 molecules can initiate the supertwisting of a half helix, achieved by reducing the number of protomer pairs per HHP, strongly implies the presence of allosteric transitioning in the supertwisting structures from the bound to the unbound region on the PE side. We anticipate that the unbound region may contain approximately 1–2 pairs (2–4 protomers) resembling C-actin structures. When analyzing the fluctuation in the MADs over time in this hybrid filament, we observed that MAD6 (5.4±0.3 nm, n=12) was significantly greater than MAD5 (5.0±0.2 nm, n=12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Our analysis suggests that the MADs are longer in the shorter bare half helices than in the normal half helices (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). Furthermore, we analyzed the fluctuation of the MAD in the F-ADP-actin segments on both sides of large cofilin clusters over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>).

We analyzed the time-dependent changes in the peak heights and HHPs of representative actin filaments under each condition to track the growth of the cofilin clusters. We made actin filaments incubated with different nucleotides (ADP and ATP +Pi), leading to the formation of F-ADP-actin and F-ADP.Pi-actin, and subsequently mixed with cofilin. We consistently observed the preferential binding of cofilin to shortened bare HHPs toward the PE side. However, we noted that in rare instances, cofilin clusters also grew on both sides in the regular bare half helices when only ADP was present. The histograms of the peak heights and HHPs followed Gaussian distributions corresponding to the cofilactin and normal bare actin regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7">Table 7</xref>). The growth rates of the cofilin clusters within the shortened bare half helices adjacent to the cofilin clusters in both F-ADP.Pi-actin and F-ADP-actin were not significantly different, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–B</xref>. Currently, we have no experimental data to discuss about whether and when bound Pi is released during this process. However, three major processes could be considered once a cofilin cluster with a critical size has formed, the allosteric transmission of the supertwisted structure of the half helices within the cofilactin region to an adjacent bare half helix on the PE side results in C-actin-like protomers. First, Pi is released accompanying (preceding) supertwisting structural change in the bare region near cofilin clusters on the PE side. Because most structural studies suggest that cofilin binding promotes Pi release, leading to the formation of C-actin with ADP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we anticipate that protomers within the shortened bare half helix adjacent to cofilin clusters in F-ADP.Pi-actin rapidly converts to F-ADP-actin and C-actin-like structures, thereby facilitating the expansion of cofilin clusters toward the states of actin bound to ADP. Second, Pi remains bound to protomers within the supertwisted bare section. The successive interactions with cofilin molecules promote Pi release. Third, similar to the process described in the second one, but in this case, subsequent interactions with cofilin molecules do not induce the release of Pi. Consequently, numerous actin protomers within the newly formed cofilactin region remain bound to ADP.Pi. When we observed neighboring bare half helices on both sides of a cofilin cluster in F-ADP-actin and F-ADP-Pi-actin within one imaging field, the HHP was always shorter on one side, while the HHP was essentially normal on the other side in both F-ADP-actin and F-ADP.Pi-actin. These results suggest that bound Pi has a minor effect, hindering the propagation of the supertwisted helical structure within cofilin clusters to the neighboring bare half helices on the PE side.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the growth rate of cofilin clusters within the shortened bare half helices that resemble the C-actin structure adjacent to cofilin clusters on the PE side, for both F-ADP-actin and F-ADP.</title><p>Pi-actin.(<bold>A</bold>) In this cartoon representation, hybrid cofilactin/bare actin filaments are depicted, consisting of four half helices.

P1-P5 were labels indicating peak heights at individual crossover points. To make a meaningful comparison, the lag time measurements were initiated exclusively when a bare half helix between P1 and P2 experienced shortening, and they continued until a newly matured cluster emerged in P1 within the shortened bare half helix (<bold>P1–P2</bold>) adjacent to the preformed cofilin cluster (<bold>P2</bold>). Each fully decorated supertwisted half helix contains 11 cofilin molecules (referred to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>).

In all cases, the histograms followed typical HHP distributions. The mean HHPs were nearly identical. However, the variances of the HHPs in F-ADP.Pi-actin and phalloidin-stabilized F-actin were significantly smaller than that in F-ADP-actin. Consequently, the proportion of naturally supertwisted half helices with HHPs shorter than 30 nm was 5.8% for F-ADP-actin but only 1.1% and 0.2% for F-ADP.Pi-actin and phalloidin-stabilized F-actin, respectively. Our finding provides the structural support for earlier research that the nucleotide state of actin could influence F-actin’s flexibility and its ability to undergo rearrangements that mediate ABP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blanchoin and Pollard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Okura et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suarez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zimmermann et al., 2015</xref>). This is in line with measurements of micrometer-scale persistence length, indicating that F-ADP.Pi-actin is more rigid than F-ADP-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Isambert et al., 1995</xref>), and with the mechanical control of twisting and bending of actin’s nucleotide-bound states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De La Cruz et al., 2010</xref>). Assuming that initial cofilin binding occurs at sites with naturally supertwisted helical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galkin et al., 2001</xref>), we suggest that bound Pi in F-ADP.Pi-actin mainly inhibits initial cofilin binding by reducing the fraction of supertwisted helical structures in comparison to F-ADP-actin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We investigated the dynamic conformational changes in half helices of F-actin and C-actin-like structure segments by observing the fluctuations in the number of actin protomers per HHP and MAD. The results provide robust support for a prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Egelman et al., 1982</xref>), which reported variable helical twisting within actin filaments. Nonetheless, the Cryo-EM and X-ray diffraction findings depict the rigid and inflexible helical twists of actin filaments (HHP = 36 nm). Certainly, HS-AFM captures the dynamic structural changes of proteins during functional processes in solution, offering a trade-off with lower spatial resolution but superior temporal resolution compared to Cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ando et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ando et al., 2024</xref>). We leverage the advantage of this technique to capture the torsional flexibility during helical twisting of actin filaments and elucidate their adaptable structure as a variable helical twist, which plays crucial roles in the binding and cluster expansion of cofilin. While it was previously believed that the interaction between the upper and lower clefts establishes the structural basis for how nucleotide-dependent conformation changes in F-actin structure modulate the binding affinities for ABPs including cofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dominguez and Holmes, 2011</xref>), recent structural analyses have revealed a remarkable similarity in the average structure of actin protomers bound with ADP.BeF<sub>3</sub>, ADP.Pi, and ADP in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oosterheert et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reynolds et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), significantly challenging the hypothesis regarding the modulation of ABP binding affinities through nucleotide-dependent conformational changes. So, why is the flexibility in torsion during helical twisting crucial for the preferential cooperative binding of cofilin to actin filaments toward the PE side? Unfortunately, we currently lack the atomic structures of actin protomers adjacent to cofilin clusters on the PE side to fully address this question.</p><p>Nonetheless, our PCA results reveal that key longitudinal interactions between the D-loop of SD2 positioned in the pocket of the next protomer’s SD1 contribute to keeping the nucleotide binding cleft closed and the OD untwisted in the F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). When cofilin binds and sits on the sides of SD1 and SD2 of two adjacent actin protomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>), the OD (SD1, SD2) in bound protomers becomes more twisted (a decrease in PC2), but without significantly affecting the closing of the nucleotide binding cleft (nearly unchanging PC1). This transformation ultimately leads to the conformational changes from F-actin to C-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The transition from the C-actin to breaking the filament into monomer G-actin structure additionally requires the opening of the nucleotide binding cleft (decreasing PC1). However, this process is normally hindered in the presence of cofilin, as the bridging between two protomers can compensate for all the losses in the disrupted interactions between the SD2 D-loop and SD1 pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Strikingly, the HS-AFM results suggest that cofilin clusters can convert bare protomers within the shortened bare half helices on the PE side into C-actin-like structures. Unless additional cofilin molecules quickly bind to the protomers with C-actin-like structures on the PE side, the disrupted interactions would readily lead to the nucleotide binding cleft transitioning from the closed to open states, resembling C-actin to G-actin transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Our proposed hypothesis regarding the shift from C-actin-like structure to G-actin aligns with earlier studies suggesting that the binding sites of cofilin encompass a region that overlaps with G-actin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlier et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mannherz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Narita, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>). The dissociation of the D-loop from an adjacent actin subunit directly causes the transition to the G-form of actin, which is regarded as the most stable configuration for the actin molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oda et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, the protomers within the shortened bare half helix near a cofilin cluster on the PE side of F-ADP.Pi-actin may be quickly converted to F-ADP-actin and C-actin-like structure through F-actin to C-actin transition. Together, this explains the preferential binding of cofilin to ADP-actin on the PE side and why filament breakages are more commonly observed at or near the boundary of cofilactin and bare actin on the PE side, rather than where actin protomers are fully bound with cofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bibeau et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ngo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suarez et al., 2011</xref>). However, our finding regarding the structure partially contradicts the existing Cryo-EM structure, which suggested that conformational changes induced by cofilin clusters, shifting from F-actin to C-actin, are restricted to the protomers directly in contact with bound cofilin. According to this model, cofilin tunes adjacent protomers, resembling F-ADP-actin structure on the PE side, to expand the clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huehn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suarez et al., 2011</xref>). Also, cofilin binding may be facilitated by a shortening of the helix pitch, independent of any transition to the C-form of actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Narita, 2020</xref>). Nonetheless, their hypotheses are insufficient to explain the PCA results supporting the structural evidence obtained from our AFM measurements that a cofilin cluster not only has the capacity to convert F-actin to C-actin but also allosterically expands the C-actin structure from the bound to unbound region on the PE side. Thus, additional cofilin molecules preferentially bind to actin protomers resembling C-actin within the shortened bare zone than F-ADP-actin structure near a cofilin cluster on the PE side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). Even though HS-AFM did not allow for the direct observation of the different nucleotide states of actin, these unidirectional propagation of the supertwisted structure in cofilin clusters to the neighboring bare zone on the PE side and preferential and cooperative bindings of cofilin to those bare sections were consistently and unequivocally observed in the presence of ADP and ADP.Pi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ngo et al., 2015</xref>). Further studies are needed to identify the source of this discrepancy between HS-AFM and Cryo-EM observations.</p><p>Our aim is to understand the underlying mechanism driving the preferential and cooperative attachment of cofilin to actin filament. This mechanism is largely influenced by the preferred helical twisting structure within the actin filament, as opposed to an alternate theory that suggests cofilin binding depends on the nucleotide state of actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). While both hypotheses might explain biased cofilin binding along the actin filament, they propose different mechanisms underlying cofilin’s cooperative behavior and binding preference.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>The hypothesis regarding the actin structure-dependent preferential cooperative binding of cofilin.</title><p>For simplicity, a single actin protofilament comprising six protomers labelled from –2 to 8 is shown, both without and with cofilin.

In the lower model of C-actin, the binding of a single cofilin molecule to an actin filament induces a small movement of SD2, causing a rotational shift of approximately 5° in the OD relative to the ID. In the upper one, when the cofilin clusters bind, they induce a larger rotation of approximately 10° in the OD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Galkin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>).

Actin conformational changes induced by cofilin clusters are local and limited to protomers directly contacting bound cofilin. The cofilin bindings accelerate a rapid transition from F-ATP-actin to F-ADP.Pi-actin and F-ADP-actin states of protomers on the PE side. Cofilin tunes adjacent protomers, resembling F-ADP-actin structure on the PE side, to expand the clusters. The cooperative binding of cofilin requires a critical size of a cofilin cluster set at 2. Notably, the severing of the actin filament is predominantly observed at the junction between cofilactin and bare actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huehn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suarez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>). (<bold>E–F</bold>) A single protofilament of an actin filament bound to cofilin clusters in the authors' previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ngo et al., 2015</xref>) and in the current study. Our hypothesis supports that actin conformational changes induced by cofilin clusters are not local and not limited to protomers directly contacting bound cofilin (C-actin) on the PE side. Cofilin clusters have the ability to shorten a half helix by reducing the number of protomers. Additionally, cofilin cluster not only has the capacity to convert F-actin to C-actin within cofilactin region but also allosterically expands the C-actin structure from the bound to unbound region on the PE side (<bold>E</bold>). The MAD<sub>c</sub> in the undecorated C-actin-like structure region are elongated compared to MAD<sub>f</sub> in F-actin region. The shortening of half helices and the elongated MAD<sub>c</sub> play a pivotal role in facilitating the preferential cooperative binding of cofilin to actin protomers via F-actin to C-actin transition pathway. If cofilin does not promptly attach to protomers in shortened bare half helix region (as depicted in E-F), the protomers within C-actin-like structure regions can readily open the nucleotide binding clefts and transition back to G-actin state via C-actin to G-actin transition, ultimately severing the filament at or near boundaries (broken lines).

The F-ADP-actin has increased the fractions of naturally supertwisted helical structures and the torsional flexibility during helical twisting, thereby creating some proposed C-actin-like structures to facilitate the initial binding and cluster expansion of cofilin, compared to F-ADP.Pi-actin. To emphasize the inhibitory effect of Pi on the initial binding of cofilin, we depict a simplified model of F-ADP.Pi-actin, featuring very infrequent structures resembling C-actin. As a result, the initial binding of cofilin and growing of critical cluster set at 2–4 cofilin molecules are more challenging compared to F-ADP-actin.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95257-fig10-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Our hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E–H</xref>) aligns with the results in the cofilactin region, where actin protomers are fully decorated by cofilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A, C and D</xref>). However, it is partially incongruent with the structures of actin protomers near cofilin clusters on the PE side, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>. Additionally, we propose two potential hypotheses that require further verification in the near future to explain the preferential cooperative bindings and cluster expansion of cofilin to undecorated C-actin-like structure within the shortened bare half helix on the PE side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E–F</xref>): (i) Because of the disrupted connections between the BE-protomer’s SD2 D-loop and PE-protomer’s SD1 pocket in the area resembling the C-actin structure, where cofilins are not bound, the SD2 could change between untwisted and twisted states (F-actin to C-actin transition) and the nucleotide-binding cleft could shift between the closed and open states (C-actin to G-actin transition). These transitions might prompt the rapid transformation of protomers within the shortened bare half helix adjacent to the cofilin clusters on the PE side of F-ADP.Pi-actin to F-ADP-actin and C-actin-like structure. This phenomenon also explains the binding preference of cofilin for ADP-actin on the PE side; (ii) In the canonical actin protofilament, the SD2 D-loop of BE-protomer is inserted between the tips of SD1 and SD3 of PE-protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, the SD2 D-loop of BE protomer does not directly interact with the tips of SD1 and SD3. Instead, it is deeply buried within the core of the cofilactin protofilament, representing the C-actin structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). Conversely, in the region representing the C-actin-like structure, where cofilins are unbound, the SD2 D-loops in twisted OD might exhibit various dynamic conformations, potentially allowing flexible interaction with the tips of SD1 and SD3 including that of the neighboring protomers on the PE side. The collective movements of individual ODs that decrease PC2 values would lead to a shorter HHP and fewer number of protomer pairs per HHP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These changes cause an extended MAD in C-actin-like structure area with optimal conformational changes in lower cleft between SD1 and SD3 of the protomers on the PE side, thereby facilitating the preferential binding and expansion of cofilin clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E–F</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we experimentally demonstrated that helical twisting, the number of protomers per half helix, and MADs are intrinsically dynamic and fluctuate around their mean values over time. Our findings support the variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Egelman et al., 1982</xref>) and irregularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fineberg et al., 2024</xref>) in helical twists and dynamics of actin filaments both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ivanova et al., 2024</xref>), challenging the traditional view, based on Cryo-EM and X-ray diffraction, that these parameters remain unchanged. Furthermore, we observed a significant correlation between the nucleotide-bound states of actin and the proportion of naturally supertwisted half helices in F-ADP-actin and F-ADP.Pi-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We suggest that the bound Pi reduces the fraction of naturally supertwisted half helices and hinders the initial binding of cofilin and/or initial growth to a critical size of cluster set at two to four molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) that can induce allosteric conformational changes to the neighboring bare zone on the PE side for cooperative bindings of cofilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10H</xref>). This discovery aligns with previous research, which showed that achieving the most effective cooperative binding of cofilin also requires a critical size for a cofilin cluster set at two molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huehn et al., 2020</xref>). However, Pi only minimally impedes the propagation of the supertwisted helical structure within the cofilin cluster to the bare actin zone in F-ADP.Pi-actin compared to F-ADP-actin. This transition is pivotal in driving the preferential cooperative binding and expansion of the cofilin cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In terms of structure, the PCA results also strongly agree with previous research indicating that ADP.BeF<sub>3</sub>, ADP.Pi, and ADP F-actin structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) display a striking resemblance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oosterheert et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reynolds et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, the reduction in torsional flexibility during helical twisting resulted in a significant hindrance to the cooperative binding and expansion of cofilin clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that the reduction in torsional flexibility associated with variable helical twists, rather than the large conformational change in F-actin’s protomers linked to ATP hydrolysis, accounts for the inhibition of cofilin binding by Pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10H</xref>). Nonetheless, it remains plausible that the structural flexibility exhibited by ADP-bound actin protomers could result in subtle variations in the conformations of the DNase binding loop (D-loop) G46-M47-G48-N49, as suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chou and Pollard, 2019</xref>. The crystal structure of the F-form revealed that Pi in ADP.Pi connects the two large domains of the actin molecule, thereby stabilizing the F-form. When Pi is released, this connection is significantly weakened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kanematsu et al., 2022</xref>).

However, HCA serves only for clustering and lacks the capability to clearly visualize or map back to the original structural data to derive further meaningful insights. In contrast, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is typically used to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets, retaining essential information. Through this dimension reduction, data clusters naturally form, and critical information can be mapped back to the original data, revealing collective movements between clusters. PCA has previously been applied to analyze actin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xue et al., 2014</xref>) using a small set of PDBs.</p><p>The process involves aligning the original data in three-dimensional space to remove trivial movements, calculating the displacement covariance matrix between common atoms, and performing eigendecomposition.

First, we repeatedly rotated and translated two actin chains from the selected PDBs to generate the coordinates of 62 consecutive protomers. Since not all of the selected PDBs had reported BIOMT matrices, we used transformation matrices that minimized the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the two chains. To construct long filaments featuring C-actin and cofilactin, a similar process was followed, but it involved two chains of actin protomers and two chains of cofilins.

A probe radius of 2.0 nm with an angle of 5.0° was set, and the image resolution was configured to be 1.0 nm in the xy plane and 0.64 Å on the z-axis, with a noise level of 0.1 nm. To analyze the structures, we calculated longitudinal section profiles of the HHPs by determining the average height within ±3 nm around the center line (red and blue lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The offset values of the height profile were set to zero by referring to virtual mica surface, where filament was placed in the pseudo-AFM images.</p><p>In our AFM analyses, we determined the HHPs by measuring the distances between major peaks observed in longitudinal section profiles along the filament axis (red markers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B,D,E,G,H</xref>). These major peaks likely represent two distinct actin protofilaments that are successively probed by the AFM tips (red markers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,F,I</xref>). Thus, the number of actin protomers within each HHP is odd, leading to a noninteger number of actin pairs. For example, in canonical actin filaments, each HHP is typically composed of 13 actin protomers (equivalent to 6.5 protomer pairs). To account for this, we determined the number of protomer pairs within each HHP by counting the major and minor peaks (noted by the red and green markers within each HHP subtracted by 0.5) in the same longitudinal section profiles. This adjustment was applied for both the pseudo and experimental AFM images of the filaments representing F-actin and C-actin. Our pseudo-AFM image displayed the challenge of accurately detecting actin pairs within filaments representing the cofilactin structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>) due to the presence of cofilin decorations and the tip-sample dilation effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ando, 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>High-speed atomic force microscopy</title><p>We used a laboratory-built high-speed atomic force microscope (HS-AFM), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ando et al., 2013</xref>).

As noted in the section of Results, when we were able to observe bare sections on both sides of a cofilin cluster, one of them had shorter HHP while the other was close to normal HHP, and based on our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ngo et al., 2015</xref>), we judged the bare section with shorter HHP is on the PE side of an actin filament. It is important to clarify that the collected data did not include the growth rates of cofilin within the normal half helices on the PE or BE sides, in order to exclude the random binding events of cofilin to actin filaments under various nucleotide conditions. By employing HS-AFM, we were able to monitor changes in the length of a half helix adjacent to a cofilin cluster and the peak height at individual crossover points. The lag time measurements were performed at the precise moment when the bare half helix adjacent to the cofilin cluster on the PE side began to shorten and continued until a newly saturated cluster emerged within this neighboring bare half helix. This determination was made by analyzing the increase in the peak heights (P1) before and after forming a newly matured cofilin cluster adjacent to a preformed cofilin cluster (P2) (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).

To calculate the mean growth rate of the cofilin cluster within a shortened bare half helix adjacent to a cofilin cluster, we divided 11 cofilin molecules by the lag time in seconds.</p><p>We assessed torsional flexibility of actin filaments by measuring the HHPs in control actin filaments incubated with 1 mM ADP, 1 mM ATP +10 mM Pi, or 1 mM ATP +phalloidin saturated to actin, resulting in F-ADP-actin, F-ADP.Pi-actin, or phalloidin-stabilized F-actin, respectively, using our previous method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ngo et al., 2015</xref>). Because, we did not examine the nucleotide-bound actin states when actin filaments were incubated with 1 mM ATP and phalloidin excess, we simply labelled them as phalloidin-stabilized F-actin and used as the control. The fraction of naturally supertwisted half-helices with HHPs less than 30 nm was determined by computing the areas under the curves derived from single Gaussian fitting curves (referred to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C–D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>HS-AFM data analysis and processing</title><p>The AFM data were analyzed using custom software, including Kodec, UMEX Viewer, and Umex Viewer for Drift Analysis, as described in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hayakawa et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ngo et al., 2015</xref>).

Additionally, AFM images and videos were processed using Fiji-ImageJ (NIH, USA) and After Effects (Adobe, USA).</p><p>To quantitatively analyze the HHPs and count the number of protomer pairs per HHP, we employed Umex Viewer for Drift Analysis, which enabled the semiautomatic determination and measurement of the distance between the highest ‘cross-over’ points between two long-pitch strands. This involved creating a topographical line profile along the actin filaments, similar to previous studies conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amyot et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hayakawa et al., 2023</xref>. Specifically, one HHP was measured between the two highest cross-over points, while one helical pitch (HP) was measured between the three highest cross-over points. In brief, we drew a longitudinal section profile line along the actin filament, covering a length of 1–4 consecutive HHPs. The offset values were set to zero with reference to the height of the lowest position along the longitudinal section lines. Before analysis, we corrected the nonlinearity of the XY piezos by applying nonlinear image scaling and reduced image noise using a Gaussian smoothing filter with a standard deviation of 0.76 nm. The profile was obtained by averaging the signal within a 5–8 nm bandpass filter along the filament. To ensure correct detection of axial distance (AD) between two adjacent protomers within the same long-pitch strand, we set a range of 3–6.6 nm for minor pitches. To facilitate correct detection of the HHPs between two crossover points, we set a range of 15–25 nm for minimum major pitches for cofilactin and bare actin segments. These allow the software to automatically penalize incorrect peaks. In some rare cases, the analyst also made the decisions to add missing peaks or to remove incorrect peaks caused by noise. Typically, we selected 30–61 actin filaments and measured the HHPs for approximately 20 consecutive time frames. To minimize measurement errors in the HHP and the number of protomer pairs per HHP, we specifically chose straight actin segments with clearly discernible protomers and drew line profiles (with an average width of 3%) to measure 1–4 consecutive HHPs. This method was consistently applied to analyze normal bare actin, cofilactin, and hybrid cofilactin/bare actin filaments. We distinguished normal F-actin and cofilactin structures based on differences in the peak height and HHP, as described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ngo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To calculate the number of protomer pairs per HHP and the mean axial distance (MAD) between two adjacent protomers along the same long-pitch strand, we semiautomatically detected AD and counted the number of protomer pairs per HHP, as mentioned in other parts and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.

First, we converted raw AFM images containing actin filaments into Laplacian-filtered images by applying a Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter (typically with sigma ~1.27 pixel/nm) to eliminate low-frequency and high-frequency noise signals. Second, we selected a short segment of the actin filament (~4 HHPs) located at the center of the AFM image and used a segmented line running along the axis of the actin filament to measure the distance between actin protomer pairs, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. To facilitate the semiautomatic analysis and determine the peak-to-peak distance between individual ADs, we applied a bandpass filter to remove noise by setting the low-pass frequency (LPF) cutoff at 3 nm and the high-pass frequency (HPF) cutoff at 6 nm for all analyses. To ensure correct detection of AD between two adjacent protomers within the same long-pitch strand, we set a range of 3–6.6 nm for minor pitches, allowing the software to penalize incorrect peaks. Typically, the variation in the AD within each actin filament over time was assessed using a series of AFM images (including 258 images captured at a rate of 2 frames per second (fps)).

The helical twist exhibits a typical height of 3 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which is three times larger than the 0.5–1.5 nm height of the protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To explore the spatial self-correlation among protomers, we applied a fast Fourier transform (FFT) and utilized a low-pass filter (LPF) and high-pass filter (HPF). The filters isolated heights using LPF and HPF within a range of 5–8 nm in the Fourier domain, corresponding to the actin protomer height along the filament (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To ensure correct detection of AD between two adjacent protomers within the same long-pitch strand, we set a range of 3–6.6 nm for minor pitches, allowing the software to penalize incorrect peaks. Then, we derived the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the protomer heights by obtaining the complex conjugate (magnitude) and then performed an inverse FFT. Additionally, we applied the Hilbert transform in the Fourier domain by doubling the positive frequency data, zeroing the negative frequency data, and applying an inverse FFT. This process produced an envelope curve. As a result, the envelop curves of the height profiles with and without the BPF exhibit alternating positive and negative values at half helical pitch and protomer periodicities, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). In contrast, the envelope curve consistently shows positive values; thus, this curve is suitable for evaluating spatial autocorrelations. In the main text, we compared the envelope curves representing the spatial ACF results, measured at multiple time points and different conditions.</p><p>By visualizing the spatial ACF curves with distance (<italic>d</italic>) derived from F-actin and hybrid cofilactin/bare actin segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>), along with sparsely decorated cofilin-actin filaments strongly attached on lipid surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), we predicted that the curves could be modelled using an exponential decaying sinusoidal function. This function, characterized by two primary components (exponential decay and sinusoid frequencies), enables us to derive parameters for the decay constant (<italic>D1</italic>) and the frequencies of the sinusoidal oscillation (<italic>D2, D3, …D9</italic>), taking into account the phase angle of the sinusoidal waves (<italic>γ1, γ2, γ3, γ4</italic>). Based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ju and Rappaport, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), we successfully formulated and applied a novel exponential decaying sinusoidal function, denoted as <italic>ρ(d</italic>), to fit the spatial ACF curves (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>).<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>cos</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mi>sin</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mn>5</mml:mn><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mn>6</mml:mn><mml:mi>cos</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mn>7</mml:mn><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mn>8</mml:mn><mml:mi>sin</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mn>9</mml:mn><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>For fitting, we utilized the Nadam optimizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dozat, 2016</xref>) and employed gradient descent in our approach.

The cofilin family controls the lifespan of actin filaments in cells by severing the filament and promoting depolymerization. Understanding the effects of cofilin on actin filament structure is critical. It is widely acknowledged that cofilin binding significantly shortens the pitch of the actin helix. The authors previously reported (1) that this shortening extends to the unbound region of the actin filament on the pointed end side of the cofilin binding cluster. In this study, the authors presented substantially improved AFM images and provide detailed accounts of the dynamics observed. It was found that a minimal cofilin-binding cluster, consisting of 2-4 molecules, could induce changes in the helical parameters over one or more actin crossover repeats. Adjacent to the cofilin-binding clusters, the actin crossovers were observed to shorten within seconds, and this shortening was limited to one side of the cluster. Additionally, the phosphate binding to the actin filament was observed to stabilize the helical twist, suggesting a mechanism in which cofilin preferentially binds to ADP-bound actin filaments. These findings significantly advance our understanding of actin filament dynamics which is essential for a wide of cellular processes.</p><p>However, two insufficient parts exist. Readers should be aware of possible errors in the Mean Axial Distance (MAD) analysis and the limitations of discussions about the actin subunit structure.</p><p>The authors have presented findings that the MAD within actin filaments exhibits a significant dependency on the helical twist. However, difficulty in determining each subunit interval from the AFM image might affect the analysis. For example, the observation of three peaks in HHP6 of Figure Supplement 6C, corresponding to 4.5 pairs, showed peak intervals of 5, 11.8, 8.7, and 5.7 nm (measured from the figure). The second region (11.8 nm) appears excessively long. If one peak is hidden in the second region, the MAD becomes 5.5 nm.</p><p>The authors also suggest a strong link between the C-form (cofilin binding form of actin found in cofilactin) and the formation of regions of the short pitch helix outside the cofilin binding cluster. However, the AFM observation did not provide any evidence about the actin form in these regions because of measurement limitations. Additionally, Oda et al. (2) have demonstrated that the C-form is highly unstable in the absence of cofilin binding, casting doubt on the possibility of the C-form propagating without cofilin binding. The &quot;C-actin-like structure&quot; in the paper is not necessarily related to the C-form actin. It might be one of the G-forms (monomeric actin forms) or another unknown form.</p><p>(1) K. X.

We provide experimental evidence to substantiate a &quot;proof of principle&quot; regarding the flexible helical twists of actin filaments that regulate the functions of actin-binding proteins. This important study enhances our understanding of actin filaments’ dynamics and polymorphic structures which play crucial roles in a broad spectrum of cellular activities.</p><p>We appreciate the comments from Reviewer 1. Below, we address their concerns point by point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>MAD analysis</p><p>The authors have presented findings that the mean axial distance (MAD) within actin filaments exhibits a significant dependency on the helical twist, a conclusion not previously derived despite extensive analyses through electron microscopy (EM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Notably, the MAD values span from 4.5 nm (8.5 pairs per half helical pitch, HHP) to 6.5 nm (4.5 pairs/HHP) as depicted in Figure 3C. The inner domain (ID) of actin remains very similar across C, G, and F forms (2, 3), maintaining similar ID-ID interactions in both cofilactin and bare actin filaments, keeping the identical axial distance between subunits in the both states. This suggests that the ID is unlikely to undergo significant structural changes, even with fluctuations in the filament's twist, keeping the ID-ID interactions and the axial distances. The broad range of MAD values reported poses a challenge for explanation. A careful reassessment of the MAD analysis is recommended to ensure accuracy.</p></disp-quote><p>The central challenge to study “Protein Dynamics” in real time lies in bridging the gap in time scales: HS-AFM captures dynamics of proteins within the milliseconds to seconds range, whereas molecular dynamics (MD) simulations typically operate within the femtoseconds to microseconds domain. Protein dynamics encompass a spectrum of temporal scales, from atomic vibrations to molecular tumbling and collective motions in simulations. HS-AFM stands out as a potent technique for delving into protein dynamics, including processes like protein folding and conformational changes triggered by drugs or protein interactions. Additionally, a significant limitation of MD simulation is the spatial modeling constraint (~50 x 50 nm unit), which restricts the study of large complex biological systems. However, utilizing HS-AFM enables the construction of intricate protein models facilitating the real time imaging of their structures and dynamics during functional activity.</p><p>Regarding the suggestion about ID-ID interactions in both cofilactin and bare actin filaments, maintaining identical axial distances (ADs) between subunits in both states, our HS-AFM cannot provide atomic-level structural insights to address this issue. However, we demonstrate that the variability of OD twists in actin protomers could potentially lead to globally shorter half helical pitches (HHPs) and fewer protomer pairs per HHP (Figure 2, Figure supplement 2) (see lines 218-222). The fluctuation in filament’s twist is further supported by currently available experimental data, including our findings (Figure 3C) in this study (see our Discussion in lines 555-560).</p><p>The minimal change in local ID-ID interactions results in an unchanged global length of actin filaments in both cofilin-bound and unbound cases (Figure supplement 2). However, filament’s twists, as experimentally detected by EM, high-resolution interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT), HS-AFM, and in pseudo AFM, are changeable (see lines 555-560).</p><p>We have additionally reassessed the fluctuation and dynamics of MAD in F-ADP-actin and F-ADP.Pi-actin over time at high temporal resolution (Figure supplement 3, Video 3, Table supplement 5). These data are further explained in the Results section (lines 264-270).</p><p>Furthermore, we reassessed the broad range of MAD values in F-ADP-actin segments on both sides of large cofilin clusters over time (Figure supplement 8, Video 5). These findings are explained in the Results section (lines 333-337) and further discussed in the new results (lines 555-560).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In determining axial distances, the authors extracted measurements from filament line profiles. It is advised to account for potential anomalies such as missing peaks or pseudo peaks, which could arise from noise interference. An example includes the observation of three peaks in HHP6 of Figure Supplement 5C, corresponding to 4.5 pairs. Peak intervals measured from the graph were 5, 11.8, 8.7, and 5.7 nm. The second region (11.8 nm) appears excessively long. If one peak is hidden in the second region, the MAD becomes 5.5 nm.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the difficulty in identifying peaks within the regions of bare actin segments adjacent to cofilin clusters or within the cofilactin region. In the revised Figure supplement 6C (originally Figure supplement 5C), we did not assess peak intervals as suggested by Reviewer 1. The measurement of axial distance (AD) and the number of peaks within a HHP to calculate the correct MAD is further detailed in the Methods section (see HS-AFM data analysis and processing, highlighted in purple).</p><p>Additionally, the purpose of presenting these Figures supplement 6-7 is to directly compare the half helices and the number of protomer pairs per HHP between bare actin filaments and actin segments near the boundary between cofilactin and bare actin segments on the PE side in the same AFM images. In an original version of this paper, we have avoided including the MAD values measured in the cofilactin region (HHP6, HHP7) in Figure Supplement 7E, to mitigate the measurement errors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Compiling histograms of axial distances (ADs) rather than focusing solely on MAD may provide deeper insights. If the AD is too long or too short, the authors should suspect the presence of missing peaks or pseudo-peaks due to noise. If 4.4 or 5.5 pairs/HHP regions tend to contain missing peaks and 7.5-8.5 pairs/HHP regions tend to contain pseudo peaks, this may explain the MAD dependency on the helical twist.</p></disp-quote><p>The measurement of axial distance (AD) and the number of peaks within a HHP to calculate the correct MAD is further detailed in the Methods section (see Analyses of pseudo AFM images of F-actin and C-actin structures constructed from existing PDB structures (e.g., Figure supplement 2); and HS-AFM data analysis and processing, highlighted in purple).</p><p>We disagree with Reviewer 1’s suggestion that compiling histograms of ADs, rather than focusing solely on MAD, may provide deeper insights. AFM imaging provides only a 2-dimensional (2D) surface structure, unlike the 3-dimensional (3D) structure offered by Cryo-EM. In AFM imaging, we cannot capture the object from different angles as Cryo-EM does. Therefore, AD values measured in 2D AFM images do not accurately represent the axial distance between two adjacent protomers along the same actin filament. Consequently, we relied on MAD values. Our results, including the fluctuation in the number of protomer pairs per HHP, are further supported by other studies (see our Discussion in lines 555-560).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, Figure 3E indicates a first decay constant of 0.14 seconds, substantially shorter than the frame rate (0.5 sec/frame). This suggests significant variations in line profiles between frames, attributable either to overly rapid dynamics or a low signal-to-noise ratio. Implementing running frame averages (of 2-3 frames) is recommended to distinguish between these scenarios. If the dynamics are indeed fast, the averaged frame's line profile may degrade, complicating peak identification. Conversely, if poor signal-to-noise ratio is the cause, averaging frames could facilitate peak detection. In the latter case, the authors can find the optimal number of frame averages and obtain better line profiles with fewer missing and pseudo-peaks.</p></disp-quote><p>We utilized state-of-the-art HS-AFM with high temporal and spatial resolution to capture the dynamic structures of F-ADP-actin and F-ADP.Pi-actin segments at higher frame rate of 0.2 sec/frame and 0.1 sec/frame, respectively (Figure supplement 3). As suggested, we implemented running frame averages (3 frames) in the ACF analyses. Consistently, our results indicate that the first time constant (t1) remains around 0.1-0.4 seconds, independent of the imaging rates (0.1 – 0.5 sec/frame), for AD between two adjacent actin protomers in F-actin bound with ADP or ADP.Pi (Table Supplement 5), and in the similar range of (t1), shown in Figure 3E. These significant experimental results support the notion that helical twists, the number of actin protomers per HHP, and MAD in bare F-actin segments, are intrinsically dynamic and fluctuate around the mean values over time (see further in lines 264-270; 333-337; and 555-560). It should be noted that our original ACF analyses did not include the averaging of running frames, thus eliminating the possibility of low signal/noise ratio in our analysis, as shown in Figure 3E-F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussions</p><p>The authors suggest a strong link between the C-form of actin and the formation of a short pitch helix. However, Oda et al. (3) have demonstrated that the C-form is highly unstable in the absence of cofilin binding, casting doubt on the possibility of the C-form propagating without cofilin binding. Moreover, in one strand of the cofilactin, interactions between actin subunits are limited to those between the inner domains (ID-ID interactions), which are quite similar to the interactions observed in bare actin filaments. This similarity implies that ID-ID interactions alone are insufficient to determine the helical parameters, suggesting that the presence of cofilin is essential for the formation of the short pitch helix in the cofilactin filament. Thus, crossover repeats are not necessarily shortened even if the actin form is C-form.</p></disp-quote><p>We have experimentally observed a shortened bare half helix adjacent to cofilin clusters on the PE side at high spatial resolution, comprising fewer protomers than normal half helices. Thus, we hypothesized that crossover repeats are shortened if the actin protomers in the bare half helix neighboring the cofilin cluster on the PE side resembles a C-actin structure. This assumption is further explained by referring to C-actin structure in Figure 2 and Figure supplement 2. Even though the C-form, as suggested in Oda et al., 2019, is unstable, it intrinsically fluctuates around the mean value over time and adopts various conformations. A single PDB structure resolved by Cryo-EM through the ensembles of averaging structural images should be referenced as a single atomistic structure, one of many possible conformations, regardless it is resolved by Cryo-EM, X-ray diffraction or crystallography, or NMR (see Figure 1, legend of Figure supplement 1).</p><p>We highlight two main points regarding this issue: (1) The short helical pitch at the global scale is associated with the twisting of the OD at the local scale for individual protomers; (2) Actins in different nucleotide or cofilin bound states exhibit varying ranges, distributions, spectra, variations of both local OD twist and global helical pitch (Figure 1-2, Figure supplement 1-2). The first point underscores that the twist/untwist of the OD determines the shortness of the helical pitches, rather than the ID-ID interactions. The latter point is more related to the global length of the filament. The minimal change in local ID-ID interactions results in an unchanged global length of actin filaments in both cofilin-bound and unbound cases see pseudo AFM images in Figure supplement 2 for canonical actin filament and cofilactin segments with the same length (comprising 62 protomers). However, filament’s twists, as experimentally detected by EM, high-resolution interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT), HS-AFM, and in pseudo AFM, are changeable (see lines 555-560) and independent on the ID-ID interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Narita (4) proposes that the facilitation of cofilin binding may occur through a shortening in the helix pitch, independent of a change to the C-form of actin. Furthermore, the dissociation of the D-loop from an adjacent actin subunit leads directly to the transition of actin to the G-form, which is considered the most stable configuration for the actin molecule (3).</p></disp-quote><p>See also our explanation above. We have incorporated these points in a Discussion section. See lines 497-499; 510-511.</p><p>Furthermore, our PCA analysis indicates that the transition from C-actin to G-actin necessitates the opening of the nucleotide cleft (resulting in a decrease in PC1) and is more readily achieved than the direct transition from F-actin to G-actin (which requires decreases in both PC1 and PC2). Whether this transition is directly triggered by the dissociation of the D-loop remains a topic for our future investigations. Our PCA analysis reveals that the D-loop is deeply buried within the core of the filament (Figure 2). Further experiments will be conducted to elucidate its roles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The mechanism by which the shortened pitch propagates remains a critical and unresolved issue. It appears that this propagation is not a result of the C-form's propagation but likely involves an unidentified mechanism. Identifying and understanding this mechanism represents an essential direction for future research.</p></disp-quote><p>It's worth mentioning that our HS-AFM data and spatial ACF analysis lend support to a hypothesis suggesting that 2-4 bare actin protomers adjacent to cofilin clusters on the PE side adopt C-actin-like structures. Additionally, we have proposed several hypotheses aimed at better understanding the mechanisms driving the unidirectional binding and expansion of cofilin clusters toward the PE side. These hypotheses will require further examination in future experiments. Additional information can be found in lines 328-329; 344-351; and 416-430.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) K. X.

Using fluorescent microscopy, others have reported a very symmetrical expansion of cofilin clusters (Wioland et al. Curr Biol 2017). This is not mentioned at all, here. It should be discussed, and explanations for this discrepancy could be proposed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have cited this paper (Wioland et al. Curr Biol 2017) in the current manuscript (see lines 361-362). However, we are unable to evaluate the technical distinctions between our methods and theirs. Instead, we have referred to a more recent paper that employed similar techniques to those used by Wioland et al. in Current Biology 2017. Our findings align with those reported by Bibeau JP et al. in the Journal of Molecular Biology 2021 see their Results on page 7, titled “Cofilin clusters elongate preferentially towards the actin filament pointed end”. At the minimum, we believe this is appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the AFM technique, I have the following concerns.</p><p>The filaments appear densely packed on the surface, and even clearly in register in some images (if not most images, e.g., Figs 3A, 4BC, 5A). Why is that? Isn't there a risk that this could affect the result? This suggests there is some interaction between the filaments.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, as well as in many similar studies of actin filaments alone or in interaction with other actin binding proteins (ABPs) including cofilin, we have carefully considered the density of filaments when designing experiments. We used highly dense, but not packed, actin filaments to minimize free space between filaments and the surface, which helps maintain stable tip-scanning during AFM imaging. This strategy technically allows us to capture high spatial and temporal resolutions of actin filaments’ structures.</p><p>The actin filaments, resemble paracrystal structures, are represented as densely packed actin filaments (see our data in Ngo and Kodera et al., eLife 2015, Figure 1C). Thus, the data presented in this paper is technically appropriate and does not risk misinterpretation due to lateral interactions impacting the structures and function of actin filaments and cofilin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The properties of the lipid layer and its interaction with the actin filaments are not clear at all. A poor control of these interactions is a problem if one aims to measure conformational changes at high resolution. The strength of the interaction appears tuned by the ratio of lipids put on the surface to change its electrostatic charge. A strong attachement likely does more than suppress torsional motion (as claimed in Fig 8A). It may also hinder cofilin binding in several ways (lower availability of binding sites on the filament facing the surface, electrostatic interactions between cofilin and the surface, etc.)</p></disp-quote><p>We are confident that our lipid membrane bilayer is the optimal choice for immobilizing actin filaments in a controlled manner for HS-AFM experiments, achieved through the variation of positively charged lipids. In this study, we have fine-tuned the surface charge for our specific purposes.</p><p>As an example, to capture high-spatial resolution images of actin structures (Figure 5-6, Figure supplement 5B, 6), we strongly fixed the filaments on DPPC/DPTAP (50/50 wt%) after the binding reaction between actin filaments and cofilin in solution was completed. This experiment yielded valuable information, including: (i) the ability to replicate the conformation of cofilactin and hybrid cofilactin/bare actin segments in solution, akin to the first steps in sample preparation for Cryo-EM techniques; and (ii) the capability to capture these structures, reflecting their solution states, by firmly fixing them on a lipid surface. On the lipid surface, these structures were retained stably during AFM imaging.</p><p>If there is a choice, we advise against using amino-silane and other positively charged polymers typically used for modifying glass surfaces to fix actin filaments in studies using fluorescence microscopy. The strong immobilization by these chemicals can alter the structural dynamics and functions of actin filaments, lead to non-specific binding of cofilin on the modified glass surface, and potentially affect data interpretation.</p><p>On a local scale, the reviewer may argue about the &quot;lower availability of binding sites on the filament facing the surface&quot;. However, on a global scale, we maintain that two single strands forming helical twists of long F-actin segments should have an equal chance to bind cofilin even when fixed on a lipid membrane. The evidence shown in Figure 8A and Video 7, which demonstrates that small cofilin clusters associate and dissociate locally without developing into large clusters along the actin filament, supports our conclusion that flexibility and dynamics in helical twists plays a crucial role in facilitating the binding and growth of cofilin clusters.</p><p>The lipid surface utilized in our study with actin filaments and cofilin provides an ideal surface, as it is flat and minimizes the nonspecific binding of cofilin to the lipid membrane (see an example of the lipid surface in Video 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How do we know that the variations over time are not mostly experimental noise, i.e. variations between repeats of the same measurement? As shown in Fig 3, correlation is mostly lost from one image to the next, and rather stable after that.</p></disp-quote><p>This question is similar to the above question of Reviewer 1. Please also refer to our response in lines 264-270; 333-337; 555-560, measurement Methods, and Figure supplement 3 and Table supplement 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The identification of cofilactin regions relies on the additional height of the &quot;peaks&quot;, due to the presence of cofilin. It thus seems that cofilin is detected every half helical pitch (HHP), but not in between, thereby setting the resolution for the localization of cluster borders to one HHP. It thus seems difficult to claim that there is a change in helicity without cofilin decoration over this distance. In Fig 7, the change in helicity could be due to cofilin decoration that is undetected because cofilins have not yet reached the next peak.</p></disp-quote><p>There are several important criteria to distinguish the &quot;supertwisted half helix&quot; in cofilactin region from the &quot;normal half helix&quot;. As illustrated in the pseudo AFM images constructed for normal F-actin and C-actin segments (with and without cofilin decoration) from PDB structures, it is evident that these two structures differ significantly in length and the number of protomer pairs per HHP (see Figure Supplement 2). In both pseudo and experimental AFM images, these parameters can be easily detected by measuring the distance between two cross-over points. Furthermore, the height or thickness difference between the cofilactin and bare actin regions is approximately 10-15 Å, which is well resolved by HS-AFM due to its exceptional z-axis resolution of ~1 Å. Technically, we were able to detect these differences by creating a longitudinal section profile that covered both bare actin and cofilactin areas, as shown in Figure supplement 6.</p><p>We experimentally reveal that a critical cofilin cluster comprising 2-4 molecules (Figures 5-6) or larger cofilin clusters (Figures 7-8, Figure Supplements 6-8) could equally supertwist a bare half helix on the PE side. The observation that a small cofilin cluster (2-4 molecules) can shorten a half helix by reducing number of protomers per HHP to 9 or 11 (4.5 or 5.5 protomer pairs), which typically requires full decoration by 9-11 cofilin molecules, strongly suggests that supertwisting or the change in helicity does not always require complete cofilin decoration. We predicted that 2-4 bare actin protomers neighboring a cofilin cluster on the PE side can adopt the C-actin-like structure. See further in lines 324-329.</p><p>Figure 7 captures a live binding event of cofilin at low spatial resolution, yet (i) the half helical pitches and (ii) the thickness of the cofilactin and bare actin segments can still be clearly distinguished. This demonstrates that changes in helicity within the cofilactin region propagate to an unbound half helix on the PE side, rearranging the helical twist by reducing the number of actin protomers per HHP, prior to recruiting additional cofilin for binding and expanding clusters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I believe C-form and G-form are better than C-actin like structure or G-actin like structure.</p></disp-quote><p>We avoid using terms like &quot;G-form&quot;, &quot;F-form&quot;, or &quot;C-form&quot;, as defined by Cryo-EM (Oda et al., 2019), because they refer to specific nucleotide and cofilin-bound states in other original papers. Instead, we use “G-actin”, “F-actin”, “C-actin”, “G-actin-like”, and “C-actin-like” to emphasize &quot;Structural Dynamics&quot; and &quot;Structural Polymorphism&quot;. This highlights that even F-actin structures without cofilin bound can adopt &quot;C-actin-like&quot; conformations with fewer OD twists, resulting in a shorter global helical pitch. ADP-bound F-actins exhibit greater variability in helical twists than ADP-Pi-bound F-actin (Figure 9), indicating that ADP-bound F-actin protomers can adopt more C-actin-like conformations than ADP-Pi-bound F-actin protomers (Figure 1, Figure supplement 1).</p><p>Technical terms describing actin structures do not need to be the same between Cryo-EM and HS-AFM, as the two techniques are fundamentally different. Our work underscores the importance of considering “structural dynamics and heterogeneity” in different nucleotide states of filamentous actin structures, both with and without cofilin, over time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1A</p><p>A very similar analysis has already been performed by Oda et al (1).
