Previous research demonstrates that 5-Hydroxtrayptamine (5-HT) and its receptors induce the formation of megakaryocytes (MKs) and platelets. However, the relationships between 5-HT1A receptor (5-HTR1A) and MKs is unclear so far. We screened and investigated the mechanism of vilazodone as a 5-HTR1A partial agonist in promoting MK differentiation and evaluated its therapeutic effect in thrombocytopenia. We employed a drug screening model based on machine learning (ML) to screen the megakaryocytopoiesis activity of Vilazodone (VLZ). The effects of VLZ on megakaryocytopoiesis were verified in HEL and Meg-01 cells. Tg (itga2b: eGFP) zebrafish was performed to analyze the alterations in thrombopoiesis. Moreover, we established a thrombocytopenia mice model to investigate how VLZ administration accelerates platelet recovery and function. We carried out network pharmacology, Western blot, and immunofluorescence to demonstrate the potential targets and pathway of VLZ. VLZ has been predicted to have a potential biological action. Meanwhile, VLZ administration promotes MK differentiation and thrombopoiesis in cells and zebrafish models. Progressive experiments showed that VLZ has a potential therapeutic effect on radiation-induced thrombocytopenia in vivo. The network pharmacology and associated mechanism study indicated that SRC and MAPK signaling are both involved in the processes of megakaryopoiesis facilitated by VLZ. Furthermore, the expression of 5-HTR1A during megakaryocyte differentiation is closely related to the activation of SRC and MAPK. Our findings demonstrated that the expression of 5-HTR1A on MK, VLZ could bind to the 5-HTR1A receptor and further regulate the SRC/MAPK signaling pathway to facilitate megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet production, which provides new insights into the alternative therapeutic options for thrombocytopenia.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>5-HT has been identified as a vasoactive neurotransmitter mostly located in the periphery of the body, and less than 1% of total body serotonin circulates in its free form in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erspamer and Asero, 1952</xref>). Peripheral synthesis by enteric chromaffin cells and release into the blood are taken up by circulating platelets via serotonin transporters (SERTs) and stored in dense particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spohn and Mawe, 2017</xref>). In the blood, approximately 98% of 5-HT resides in platelets, which are released into circulation when activated. The biological effects of 5-HT are exerted through activation of any of 15 distinct receptors in 7 different classes 5-HT1 receptor to 5-HT7 receptor (5-HT1R to 5-HT7R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnes et al., 2021</xref>). It has been assumed for a long time that 5-HT plays an important role in the hematopoietic process. 5-HT is a powerful mitogen that has been shown to have mitogenic action during embryonic development in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsuda et al., 2004</xref>). In particular, 5-HT is essential for the survival of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in vivo throughout embryogenesis and increases the generation of HSPCs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lv et al., 2017</xref>). Consistently, MKs were the first hematopoietic cells examined in relation to the serotonergic system and were megakaryocytes due to the well-known link between 5-HT and platelets. Studies have shown that the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C subtypes exist on the surface of human primary megakaryocyte progenitor cells, megakaryocytes, and some major megakaryocyte lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). In the process of megakaryocyte hematopoietic regulation, 5-HT increases the number of megakaryocyte progenitor cells, promotes megakaryocyte proliferation by activating the 5-HT2 receptor (5-HT2R), and promotes the formation and maturation of mouse CFU-MK and platelet generation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ye et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, 5-HT might contribute to erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amireault et al., 2011</xref>). Overall, the serotonergic system is a therapeutic target that shows promise due to its extensive capacity for regeneration and regulation of hematopoietic lineages. In addition to 5-HT2R, the 5-HT1 receptor (5-HT1R) is also important for cell proliferation and differentiation, among which the 5-HT1A receptor (5-HTR1A) is one of the main subtypes involved. The presence of 5-HT1F receptor (5-HTR1F) on CD34<sup>+</sup> cells suggested that 5-HT1R signaling may be involved in neuronal regulation of immature hematopoietic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Skurikhin et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, 5-HT dose-dependently induces the migration of neural crest cells in culture through 5-HTR1A in mice to interfere with development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moiseiwitsch and Lauder, 1995</xref>). Further evidence revealed that 5-HTR1A could exert effects on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Della Rocca et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Vilazodone (VLZ) is a new dual-mechanism antidepressant approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating major depressive disorder (MDD). VLZ displays the property of an SSRI and also has partial activation of 5-HTR1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McCormack, 2015</xref>). It selectively inhibits serotonin reuptake with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 1.6 nmol/L and binds selectively to human 5-HT1A receptors with high affinity (IC50 of 2.1 nmol/L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). The antidepressant effect of VLZ is through inhibiting the serotonin transporter’s reuptake of 5-HT, while part of the stimulant effect of 5-HTR1A is directed at the auto receptor-mediated negative neuronal feedback mechanism. Previous studies have shown that the 5-HTR1A partial activation of VLZ has a faster and larger effect on presynaptic 5-HTR1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is still unknown whether VLZ can regulate the fate of hematopoietic cells through 5-HTR1A.</p><p>Platelets are small nonnucleated cellular fragments that are essential for functions such as hemostasis, wound healing, angiogenesis, inflammation, and innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Machlus and Italiano, 2013</xref>). They are created in the bone marrow by megakaryocytes, which are enormous polyploid cells that develop from hematopoietic stem cells by megakaryopoiesis. The polyploid cells produced by this intricate process, which are remarkably similar in mice and humans, have a single polylobate nucleus and undergo repeated cycles of endomitosis after numerous rounds of unsuccessful cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marini et al., 2022</xref>). A low platelet count is a frequently encountered hematological abnormality. Thrombocytopenia is a medical condition associated with a reduced peripheral blood platelet count, which is characterized as a platelet count below 150×10<sup>9</sup> /L of whole blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Provan and Semple, 2022</xref>). Platelet production can be affected by bone marrow suppression, which is frequently observed in diseases including leukemia, chemotherapy, and sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lien et al., 2021</xref>). Among them, radiotherapy and chemotherapy for tumor treatment are the key factors leading to thrombocytopenia complications. Radiation-induced thrombocytopenia (RIT) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and is particularly important in the hematopoietic form of acute radiation syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tkaczynski et al., 2018</xref>). According to several studies, platelet count correlates more strongly with survival following total body irradiation than any other hematologic parameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mouthon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lebois et al., 2016</xref>). Bleeding and thrombocytopenia account for a large amount of morbidity and death in the context of radiation injury. Therefore, the creation of novel therapeutic approaches to manage thrombocytopenia is essential.</p><p>The continual development of platelet synthesis is known as megakaryocytopoiesis. The most fully researched regulator of MKs in this process is thrombopoietin (TPO), which is one of a complex network of hemopoietic growth factors. Generally, platelet production is regulated by TPO. The amount of TPO that is accessible to populations of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells is regulated by the thrombopoietin receptor (c-Mpl) on megakaryocytes and platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ninos et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to TPO, other regulators also have significant impacts on megakaryocytopoiesis. These include the interleukin cytokines family, vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor-1)/FGF-4 (fibroblast growth factor-4), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and other cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>). The majority of their effects are independent of TPO signaling to regulate MK differentiation and thrombopoiesis. Understanding the TPO-independent regulation system is crucial because it may present new options for understanding the process of development, the mechanisms behind diseases with aberrant MK and platelet formation, and the advancement of therapeutic research.</p><p>In the present study, we carried out virtual screening to predict the therapeutic activity of VLZ in the early stage and the predicted results were verified through in vitro and in vivo investigations. The molecular mechanism of the effect of VLZ on thrombocytopenia was probed through network pharmacological methods. Then experimental verification confirmed that the targeted activation of 5-HTR1A promoted the maturation and differentiation of megakaryocytes and was related to the regulation of the SRC-RAS-MEK-ERK1/2 signaling pathways. In conclusion, this study reports a combination of computational analysis and experimental validation to explore the thrombogenic effects and potential mechanisms by which 5-HTR1A drives megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production and enriches the research on the regulatory mechanism of serotonergic signaling on hematopoietic lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Prediction of potential megakaryocytopoiesis inducers via the virtual screening model</title><p>We focused on building a drug-screening model consisting of random forests in this work.

For the in vitro study, we used drug dosages of 2.5, 5, and 10 µM. LDH assay was used to determine the cytotoxicity of VLZ on HEL and Meg-01 cells. The outcomes demonstrated that 2.5, 5, and 10 µM VLZ were within a safe concentration range for MK differentiation since LDH release at days 1, 3, and 5 in the VLZ group was not different from that in the control group.

Wright-Giemsa staining showed that VLZ significantly increased the nuclear-to-cytoplasm ratio, polyploid cells, and deeply stained multilobulated nuclei compared with those in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>). Similarly, we evaluated the morphological alteration of VLZ-induced polyploidization, as determined by phalloidin staining. On the fifth day, significant numbers of multinucleated cells, cytoplasm enlargement, and F-actin aggregation were observed in the VLZ and PMA treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e and f</xref>). Megakaryocyte differentiation and maturation are frequently assessed using changes in the expression of distinctive molecular markers.

The typical feature of mature megakaryocytes is the polyploidization of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Dijk et al., 2018</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis also showed that VLZ significantly increased the population of ≥4 N DNA content in HEL and Meg-01 cells in a concentration-dependent manner after 5 days of VLZ intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i and j</xref>). Therefore, we further determined the action of VLZ on DNA content. We know that proplatelet formation requires local apoptosis. Annexin V/PI staining flow cytometry showed that Vilazodone induced excessive apoptosis of megakaryocytes on day 5 in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k and l</xref>).

We further appraised the overall effect of VLZ on promoting thrombocyte production in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The maximum dosage for subsequent investigations was set at 40 µM since toxicity analyses indicated that VLZ incubation had no discernible impact on the survival or general development of 3 dpf zebrafish embryos within a range of 2.5–40 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The embryos of platelet labeled Tg (itga2b: eGFP) transgenic zebrafish at 3 dpf were treated with VLZ (10–40 µM), and the itga2b: eGFP thrombocytes in the tail area were carefully examined at 5 dpf. Notably, VLZ increased the quantity of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the tail region, which represents platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>). Next, we extracted the total cells of zebrafish administered VLZ for quantification analysis of its effects on endogenous blood circulation through flow cytometry. As anticipated, there was a dose-dependent increase in the number of itga2b: eGFP cells among the total cells in the VLZ (10–40 μM) treatment groups compared to the control group, suggesting that circulating platelets were increased after VLZ stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).

Owing to X-ray exposure, the platelet count in all irradiation groups declined to a minimum on the 7th day, whereas it remained the same in control mice. Nonetheless, VLZ was efficacious in promoting platelet production and resumption in a dose-dependent manner from the seventh day to the twelfth day, indicating that VLZ administration boosted platelet recovery when the mice encountered irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Complementary to the results obtained for zebrafish, the cell count and flow cytometry of peripheral blood showed that platelets increased significantly on the 12th day of 10 mg/kg VLZ administration in normal mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The mean platelet volume (MPV) was likewise discovered and revealed no difference between each group, indicating that VLZ had no impact on MPV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).

Additionally, H&amp;E staining showed no significant differences between each group in major organs, suggesting that VLZ was not systemically toxic.

However, surface P-selectin (CD62P) increases after radiation damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johansson et al., 2012</xref>). Peripheral blood cells were used in a CD41/CD62P flow cytometry assay, and animals treated with VLZ and TPO had significantly reduced levels of CD41<sup>+</sup>/CD62P<sup>+</sup> expression compared to the model group in the platelet resting state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). In addition, animals treated with VLZ and TPO showed dramatically increased platelet reactivity in the CD62P assay after ADP stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Moreover, platelet adhesion on solidified collagen improved after VLZ or TPO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). Furthermore, we evaluated platelet aggregation induced by ADP. Compared to the model group, platelet aggregation caused by ADP was significantly strengthened in the VLZ-treated and TPO groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). In addition, we assessed the impact of VLZ on thrombus development following vascular damage in a carotid artery thrombosis model. The results suggested that VLZ promoted thrombus development in mice with thrombopenia, since it took considerably less time for the VLZ-treated group than the model group to form a totally occluded thrombus after the commencement of arterial injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>). The tail bleeding time was used to quantitatively evaluate the hemostatic capacity of platelets. The findings demonstrated that mice in the VLZ and TPO treatment groups had considerably reduced tail bleeding time compared with mice in the model group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref>). We next examined whole blood clots and washed platelet clot development and retraction over time (120 min) following clotting triggered by thrombin and CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Differences in the proportion of whole blood clot retraction were observed for VLZ and TPO and increased clot weight at the endpoint when compared with the model group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4l</xref>). Consistent with the results indicated for whole blood clot retraction, VLZ, and TPO completely improved washed platelet retraction compared to the model group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4m</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that VLZ stimulation is conducive to platelet recovery in vivo after encountering radiation. In the meantime, it also contributed to RBC recovery. The platelet function of thrombopenia mice treated with VLZ was complete, including hemostasis and coagulation, and the response characteristics to agonists were almost normal.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>VLZ rescues bone marrow and splenic hematopoiesis after radiation injury</title><p>Bone marrow is the most important hematopoietic organ in the human body, and extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen may occur in response to physiological stress or illness and may serve as a substitute tissue site for bone marrow hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lucas, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Short et al., 2019</xref>). We thus investigated whether VLZ could promote the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors into megakaryocytic progenitors and megakaryocytes in the BM and spleen considering the increased numbers of megakaryocytes in the VLZ-treated group. Following VLZ and TPO treatment for 12 days, H&amp;E staining results showed a clearly increased number of megakaryocytes in the BM and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>).

Potential targets of VLZ for treating thrombocytopenia included 63 common targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>).

As a preliminary study, the expression of 5-HTR1A in Meg-01 cells was evaluated. We also demonstrated that VLZ doses increased the expression of 5-HTR1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a and d</xref>). A DARTS assay was then employed to observe the binding performance of VLZ to 5-HTR1A on Meg-01 cells. The DARTS results demonstrated that VLZ administration increased the stability of 5-HTR1A against protease-induced degradation in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b and c</xref>). To obtain further evidence for the targeting of VLZ to 5-HTR1A, WAY-100635 (2.5 μM, 5-HT1A receptor antagonist) was applied with VLZ. In this case, the observed effects in vitro were mediated via a 5-HTR1A-dependent mechanism, as WAY-100635 administration blocked the accelerative effects of VLZ in Meg-01 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e–k</xref>). Once activation of 5-HTR1A induced by VLZ was blocked, the expression of RAS and phosphorylation of SRC and ERK1/2 were significantly inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8l</xref>). We indicated that the agonistic action of 5-HTR1A induced by VLZ was responsible for the activation of RAS and phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Therefore, we further demonstrated that VLZ activates 5-HTR1A on MKs to regulate the SRC/RAS/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, encouraging the nuclear translocation and mRNA expression of relevant transcription factors to trigger MK maturation and platelet formation.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>VLZ stimulates megakaryocytopoiesis via the 5-HT1A receptor.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative immunoblot images and biochemical quantification of 5-HTR1A after treatment with VLZ (2.5, 5, and 10 μM) in Meg-01 cells for 5 days (n=3 per group).

This complication seriously affects the prognosis and endangers the life of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mouthon et al., 1999</xref>). Thrombocytopenia remains a challenging disease despite multiple advances in drug research radiotherapies, and chemotherapies Currently, there are not entirely reliable and secure medications for the rapid treatment of thrombocytopenia. Although TPO-RA is a classical clinical treatment, it is also ineffective in individuals with TPO resistance or c-Mpl gene loss-of-function mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghanima et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poston and Gernsheimer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van den Oudenrijn et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, there are few agonists targeting TPOR, so the research and development of novel non-TPOR-dependent targets and agonists is currently a key strategy for the treatment of thrombocytopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jenkins et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakamura et al., 2006</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated the mechanisms underlying 5-HT-regulated hematopoietic lineages. It is crucial and necessary to investigate this TPO-independent signaling pathway. Here, we identified 5-HTR1A as an attractive target, VLZ could directly bind to 5-HTR1A to enhance megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet formation by facilitating the activation of the SRC and MAPK signaling pathways at the same time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the mechanism by which VLZ regulates megakaryocyte differentiation and thrombopoiesis.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94765-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><p>ML has unique advantages in compound activity prediction and screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bannigan et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we relied on a random forest-based drug screening model to characterize the hematopoietic activity of VLZ. Excitingly, VLZ demonstrated an activity prediction score worthy of further investigation, and its excellent hematopoietic activity was validated in subsequent experiments. In a safe therapeutic range, it promoted MK differentiation and maturation in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro. Furthermore, because of its advantages of in vivo complexity and in vitro high-throughput screening simplicity, zebrafish is a commonly recognized vertebrate model for research in many fields, including developmental biology, toxicology, and drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kong et al., 2020</xref>). Previous studies showed the construction and application of megakaryocyte production in Tg (itga2b: eGFP) zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). At the same time, VLZ significantly promoted the hematopoietic system of transgenic zebrafish and increased platelet-labeled fluorescence. To verify its therapeutic effect on thrombocytopenia, we constructed a mouse model of thrombocytopenia by whole-body radiation. After administration of different doses of VLZ for 12 days, its concentration-dependently increased platelet counts from day 10 onward, shortening the time to normalization of platelets. Under normal physiological conditions, it increased platelets in nonirradiated mice in a manner similar to the zebrafish model. In addition, we found that VLZ also had a significant effect on the recovery of red blood cells. In addition, to determine whether VLZ restores platelet function in radiation injury and whether its inhibitory effect on platelet SERT affects generated platelets, we explored platelet function in vitro and in vivo. We found that VLZ restored hemostasis thrombosis and platelet function in radiation model mice. As previously mentioned, SSRI drugs can inhibit the platelet transporter SERT and affect its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scharf, 2012</xref>). However, VLZ appeared to produce SERT-independent enhancement of platelet function in irradiated mice. Of course, it is possible that the doses and periods of our experiments did not have a significant influence on platelet inhibition. To determine which hematopoietic tissues are responsible for the findings, we subsequently analyzed the bone marrow (BM) and spleen. The results from H&amp;E staining and flow cytometry demonstrated that VLZ therapy stimulated the differentiation of BM hematopoietic progenitor cells and megakaryocytes, thereby producing and activating platelets. Similarly, VLZ increased splenic MK numbers, promoting extra splenial hematopoiesis. These data suggest that VLZ treats thrombocytopenia by enhancing bone marrow and splenic megakaryopoiesis and thrombosis. Simultaneously, VLZ compensated for the extra slight inhibition by promoting the production of new platelets in vivo. Admittedly, the overall effect of VLZ is to gradually restore the functional system of platelets damaged by radiation to normal. This suggests that VLZ may enhance platelet function in thrombocytopenic mice independently of SERT-mediated 5-HT transport, which needs to be further investigated.</p><p>Progenitor cells in the bone marrow undergo a process known as megakaryopoiesis in which they grow into megakaryocytes, which then create the platelets required for healthy hemostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crispino, 2022</xref>). Network pharmacology and molecular docking analysis predicted that VLZ may regulate megakaryocyte differentiation through the SRC and MAPK signaling pathways. Tyrosine-protein kinase proto-oncogene SRC, including other SRC family kinases (SFK), is crucial for controlling signal transduction by various cell surface receptors in response to alterations in the cellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Kock and Freson, 2020</xref>). SRC tyrosine kinases are signaling mediators that occur before MAPK activation and gene expression that is induced by cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Singer et al., 2011</xref>). Serine/threonine kinases known as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) regulate important cellular responses in eukaryotic organisms and play a role in proliferation, migration, differentiation, and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roux and Blenis, 2004</xref>). Extracellular signal-related kinases (ERKs) (also known as p44/p42, ERK1/2), ERK5, p38MAPKs, and c-Jun amino-terminal kinases are the four primary protein subgroups that make up the MAPK family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 1990</xref>). Further analysis of GO and KEGG enrichment led us to target the RAS-MEK/ERK signaling pathway. These intracellular signaling pathways play a pivotal role in many essential cellular processes, including proliferation and differentiation. Likewise, by additional validation, we showed that VLZ can activate SRC, RAS, MEK, and ERK and that it may have an impact on the signaling pathways linked to differentiation. Additionally, cytokines tightly control MK differentiation and thrombosis. Studies have revealed that NF-E2 is necessary for platelet release, proplatelet production, and megakaryocyte differentiation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Machlus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). EGR1 is an early growth response transcription factor (TF) that regulates a wide array of genes and plays a major role in MKs, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kanaji et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crist et al., 2013</xref>). Several megakaryocytic cell surface indicators and other auxiliary genes require FOS for expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Limb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2017</xref>). The transcription factor RUNX1 (previously called AML-1 and CBFα2) is an essential regulator of definitive hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) ontogeny, HSC self-renewal, MK maturation, and lymphocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raghuwanshi et al., 2020</xref>). The results demonstrated that VLZ activated these TFs in a concentration-dependent manner. To further investigate whether the MAPK signaling pathway was responsible for VLZ-induced MK differentiation, we blocked this signaling pathway with its inhibitor SCH772984. As anticipated, we discovered that blocking the MEK/ERK signaling pathway eliminated the ability of VLZ to cause MK differentiation. Thus far, the signaling pathway predicted by network pharmacology has been verified. VLZ induces the maturation and differentiation of MKs by promoting the expression of related transcription factors by regulating the SRC/MAPK signaling pathway.</p><p>As previously mentioned, VLZ is a 5-HT1A receptor agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the 5-HT tryptamine receptor signalingergic system is involved in the process from embryonic to stem progenitor cells and subsequent differentiation. However, most research has discovered and explored the effects of 5-HT2R on the hematopoietic system. The 5-HT receptor family is very large, and the interreceptor interaction and signal networks are complex. The regulation of different systems is both similar and different. To determine whether 5-HTR1A is involved in the induction of MK differentiation, we firstly validated the expression of 5-HTR1A on MKs. We first found that 5-HTR1A was expressed on Meg-01 cells and that VLZ could directly bind to the receptor. To further determine whether 5-HTR1A activates the MAPK signaling pathway and thus induces MK differentiation, we blocked the receptor with its antagonist WAY-100635. As expected, we found that 5-HTR1A inhibition completely abolished the induction of MK differentiation by VLZ and was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of the downstream signaling pathways RAS and ERK. Collectively, the data suggest that 5-HTR1A mediates the MK differentiation and maturation of the VLZ and that this effect is accomplished by 5-HTR1A through regulation of the MAPK (RAS/ERK) signaling pathway. In conclusion, we showed that VLZ stimulates MK differentiation and platelet formation through the 5-HTR1A/SRC/MAPK pathway. Our findings highlight the importance of 5-HT receptor signaling for promoting hematopoiesis and provide new insights into the underlying mechanism of VLZ.</p><p>Taken together, our study elucidated the effects and mechanisms of VLZ in the treatment of thrombocytopenia through a combination of computational analysis and experimental validation. We revealed a previously unknown interplay in which the expression of 5-HTR1A on MKs and the regulation of the SRC/RAS/MEK/ERK signaling pathway are involved in the effects of VLZ. Our study shows the therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms of VLZ in thrombocytopenia and enriches the study of the mechanisms of 5-HT receptor signalingergic regulation of the hematopoietic spectrum.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construction of a virtual screening model based on random forest</title><p>The virtual screening flowchart is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>.

Firstly, we collected 39 small molecule compounds that can promote MK differentiation or platelet formation and 691 small molecule compounds that have no obvious effect on MK differentiation or platelet formation to buiid the datbase. Then, the data of the remaining 713 types of small molecule compounds were utilized as the Training set, and the Molecular Descriptors of 2 types of active and 15 types of inactive small molecule compounds were randomly picked as the Validation set.With regard to the activity evaluation criteria, the prediction score for each molecule was between 0 and 1, and the model decision was made with a threshold of 0.5. The molecule with a score above the 0.5 threshold was identified as a megakaryopoiesis inducer (1).</p><p>Reference：</p><p>(1) Mo Q, Zhang T, Wu J, et al.

We used 50 zebrafish embryos per group to evaluate VLZ toxicity, and we think this is a suitable and fair baseline. Our gating procedure is clearly depicted in the resulting diagram. Since our goal was to evaluate the fluorescence intensity quantitatively, we isolated the entire zebrafish cell. Since the amount of eGFP+ in various zebrafish tissues found in other literature is likewise quite low and we are unsure of the typical eGFP+ threshold for zebrafish (1, 2), we think this finding should be fair given that each group's activities in the experiment were conducted in parallel.</p><p>Reference：</p><p>(1) Yang L, Wu L, Meng P, et al.

The possible reasons for this should be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for your thoughtful comment. Megakaryocytes build pseudopodia, which form extensions that release proplatelets into the bone marrow sinusoids. Proplatelets convert into barbell-shaped proplatelets to form platelets in an integrin αIIbβIII mediated process (1-2). Platelet size is established by microtubule and actin-myosin-sceptrin cortical forces which determine platelet size during the vascular formation of barbell proplatelets (3). Conversion is regulated by the diameter and thickness of the peripheral microtubule coil. Proplatelets can also be formed from proplatelets in the circulation (4). Megakaryocyte ploidy correlates with platelet volume following a direct nonlinear relationship to mean platelet volumes (5). Usually there is an equilibrium between platelet generation and clearance from the circulation (normal turnover) controlled by thrombopoietin. When healthy humans receive thrombopoietin, their platelet size decreases (6). Proplatelet formation is dynamic and influenced by platelet turnover (7) which increases upon increased platelet consumption and/or sequestration. In our study, the MPV values of each group of mice did not show significant downregulation or upregulation, from our point of view, there are several possible reasons for these results.</p><p>(1) Mice in a radiation-damaged state may result in a decrease in platelet count, but at the same time stimulate the bone marrow to release young and larger platelets, thus keeping the MPV relatively stable.</p><p>(2) After radiation injury, bone marrow cells were suppressed, resulting in a decrease in the number of platelets produced, but MPV remained unchanged, possibly because the direct effects of radiation on the bone marrow caused thrombocytopenia, but not necessarily the average platelet size.</p><p>Reference：</p><p>(1) Thon JN, Italiano JE.

How can the authors analyze the differences in their results?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We are appreciated your valuable comments. PPI (Protein-Protein Interaction) refers to the interaction between proteins. Inside cells, proteins interact with each other to perform various biological functions, influencing cell signaling, metabolic pathways, cell cycle, and more. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is a database that integrates information on genomes, chemicals, and biological systems. In pharmacoinformatic, KEGG pathways are often used to understand the molecular mechanisms of specific diseases or biological processes. KEGG contains the interrelationships between genes, proteins, and metabolites, helping to reveal key nodes in biological processes. PPI information can be integrated with data from KEGG pathways, such as metabolic and signaling pathways, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the role of protein-protein interactions in cellular processes and biological functions. For example, by analyzing nodes in the PPI network, proteins associated with a specific disease can be identified, and further examination of these proteins' locations in KEGG pathways can reveal molecular mechanisms underlying the onset and development of the disease. However, this method also has some limitations：</p><p>Uncertainty (1): The construction of protein-protein interaction networks and drug interaction networks involves many assumptions and speculations. The edges of these networks may be based on experimental data but can also rely on bioinformatics predictions. Therefore, the accuracy of predictions is limited by the quality and reliability of the data used during network construction.</p><p>Insufficient data (2): Despite the availability of a large amount of bioinformatics data for network construction, interactions between some proteins and drugs may still lack sufficient experimental data. This data insufficiency can result in inaccuracies in network predictions.</p><p>Dynamics and temporal-spatial changes (3): The dynamics and temporal-spatial changes in biological systems are crucial for drug effects. Pharmacoinformatic may struggle to capture these changes as it often relies on static network representations, overlooking the temporal and dynamic nature of biological systems.</p><p>Reference：</p><p>(1) Fernando PC, Mabee PM, Zeng E.

We completely concur that using this strategy would greatly increase the validity of our research. However, establishing a primary megakaryocyte model requires specialized expertise and technical resources, which unfortunately are not readily available to us within the given timeframe. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the limitations of Meg-01 cells, which may exhibit distinct properties compared to true megakaryocytes. To mitigate this concern, we have ensured robust experimental design and rigorous data analysis to interpret our findings within the context of these model cell lines. We believe our results still provide valuable insights into megakaryocyte differentiation and address an important biological question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors tried to understand the mechanism of how a drug candidate, VLZ, works on a receptor, 5-HTR1A, by activating the SRC/MAPK pathway to promote the formation of platelets.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors used both computational and experimental methods.

We fully agree that CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells or primary megakaryocytes would provide a more accurate representation of in vitro megakaryopoiesis compared to HEL and Meg-01 cells, which possess limited potential for this process. We acknowledge that our current study did not include experiments with these preferred cell models. This is because our laboratory is still actively developing the technical expertise and resources required for establishing and maintaining primary megakaryocyte and CD34+ cell cultures. Despite the limitations of the current study, we believe the results using HEL and Meg-01 cells provide valuable preliminary insights into the potential effects of VLZ on megakaryocyte differentiation. We are actively working to overcome these limitations and plan to incorporate these more advanced models in our future investigations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I think the authors can enhance the mechanism study by developing more reliable models and methodologies. The connection to clinical research should be strengthened at the same time.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We deeply appreciate your insightful feedback and valuable suggestions regarding the use of more suitable models for studying the role of VLZ in megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet production. Despite the limitations, we are committed to expanding our research in the future by incorporating your suggestion and establishing a primary megakaryocyte model to further validate our findings and strengthen our conclusions. At the same time, we wholeheartedly concur with your suggestion to combine clinical research. Unfortunately, VLZ is not a first-line treatment for depression in China, and getting blood samples from the matching number of patients for analysis is a challenge. To give additional experimental support for the medication, we have attempted to improve the data in vivo as much as feasible, including by implementing the intervention in normal mice. Our findings should also contribute to the theoretical underpinnings of this medication and aid in its practical application.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Issues the authors need to address:</p><p>Figure 7: Why the band intensity of GAPDH in b or e is much greater than that in f, g, or h?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for your careful observation and insightful comment regarding Figure 7. Because the concentration of each batch of protein samples is different, sometimes the GAPDH band strength is increased by the large loading volume. Other factors that may influence the GAPDH band strength include the instrument's contrast adjustment during exposure and the use of different numbers of holes for electrophoresis. Meanwhile, the original three replicate results of all WB results will be provided in the supplementary materials.</p><p>Finally, we sincerely thank you for providing us with this opportunity to make a further revision and modification of our manuscript, and your valuable and scientific comments are useful for the great improvement of our manuscript!</p></body></sub-article></article>
