signals control cell fate have been well studied, the impact of mechanical inputs on cell fate decisions is not well understood. Here, using the well-defined system of keratinocyte differentiation in the skin, we examine whether and how direct force transmission to the nucleus regulates epidermal cell fate. Using a molecular biosensor, we find that tension on the nucleus through linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes requires integrin engagement in undifferentiated epidermal stem cells and is released during differentiation concomitant with decreased tension on A-type lamins. LINC complex ablation in mice reveals that LINC complexes are required to repress epidermal differentiation in vivo and in vitro and influence accessibility of epidermal differentiation genes, suggesting that force transduction from engaged integrins to the nucleus plays a role in maintaining keratinocyte progenitors. This work reveals a direct mechanotransduction pathway capable of relaying adhesion-specific signals to regulate cell fate.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epidermis</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd><kwd>nuclear lamina</kwd><kwd>LINC complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM129308</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carley</surname><given-names>Emma</given-names></name><name><surname>Jalilian</surname><given-names>Iman</given-names></name><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Megan C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16PRE27460000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stewart</surname><given-names>Rachel M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ludwig Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Megan C</given-names></name><name><surname>Stewart</surname><given-names>Rachel M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AR060295</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horsley</surname><given-names>Valerie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AR069550</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horsley</surname><given-names>Valerie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 AR007016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zieman</surname><given-names>Abigail</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007223</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carley</surname><given-names>Emma</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Forces stemming from cell-matrix adhesions, but not cell-cell adhesions, are directly transmitted to the nuclear lamina to regulate epidermal cell fate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Physical forces and the architecture of the extracellular environment are an emerging area of cell fate regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Discher et al., 2009</xref>). Cells sense changes in the physical environment through cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesions, providing a mechanism by which mechanical inputs can contribute to the control of cell fate. While several studies have linked geometrical and physical inputs to changes in cellular signaling through mechanoresponsive transcription factors such as YAP/TAZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Totaro et al., 2018</xref>) or MKL/MRTF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Connelly et al., 2010</xref>), whether direct transmission of mechanical force to the nucleus can influence cell fate is not known.</p><p>The interfollicular epidermis is an excellent model to explore how mechanical inputs regulate cell fate. Epidermal stem cells adhere to the underlying basal lamina through β1 integrin-based adhesions and β4 integrin-based hemidesmosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Raghavan et al., 2000</xref>), which maintain stem cell fate, proliferation, and inhibit differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hotchin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Levy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rippa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Watt et al., 1993</xref>). Upon differentiation, basal keratinocytes release their integrin-based adhesions, initiate gene expression changes to activate terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsuruta et al., 2011</xref>), and move upward to enter the stratified epithelium until they are shed at the skin’s surface. Despite the well-established role for integrin adhesions in regulating epidermal differentiation, how integrin signals are propagated to the nucleus to regulate the keratinocyte differentiation program is not well understood.</p><p>Here, we explore whether mechanical cues can regulate keratinocyte cell fate via tension on the nucleus via the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex. The LINC complex, composed of tail-anchored Nesprins integrated into the outer nuclear membrane and SUN proteins integrated into the inner nuclear membrane, spans the nuclear envelope to mechanically integrate the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton and the nuclear interior – specifically the nuclear lamina and its associated chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2015</xref>). While the LINC complex has been postulated to act either as a direct mechanosensor or as a conduit for mechanotransduction to influence gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), whether the LINC complex controls gene expression in vivo remains largely untested. Indeed, to date direct gene targets of the LINC complex that regulate genetic programs in vivo, for example, during differentiation, remain to be identified.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that epidermal differentiation is regulated by the nuclear lamina, yet the mechanisms remain unknown. First, during basal stem cell differentiation, a large chromosomal region termed the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC), which consists of 60 consecutive genes necessary for epidermal stratification and the production of the cornified envelope, relocates away from the nuclear lamina toward the nuclear interior to be transcriptionally activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gdula et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mardaryev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Williams et al., 2002</xref>). Further, the AP-1 transcription factor complex, itself regulated by A-type lamins, influences EDC gene expression in both proliferating and differentiating keratinocytes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oh et al., 2014</xref>). AP-1 also coordinates with EZH2 in the polycomb complex, which promotes targeting of chromatin to the nuclear lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harr et al., 2015</xref>) and regulates epidermal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ezhkova et al., 2009</xref>). Lastly, a skin-specific lamin-null mouse model (Lamin B1/B2/A/C triple-knockout) exhibits a thickened epidermis attributed to precocious differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jung et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we provide evidence that the LINC complex regulates epidermal differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Using a novel molecular biosensor to measure forces exerted on LINC complex molecules, we find that tension is high on the LINC complex and A-type lamins in epidermal stem cells in an integrin-dependent manner and is reduced upon differentiation. In mouse keratinocytes (MKCs) lacking LINC complexes, we observe precocious differentiation in vitro and expansion of the differentiated, suprabasal layers of the skin in vivo. This work suggests that tension from integrins is communicated through the LINC complex to the nuclear lamina to maintain the progenitor state of basal keratinocytes, providing a potential mechanism by which cell fate is regulated directly by mechanical cues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A tension sensor in Nesprin-2 is sensitive to integrin engagement</title><p>In order to visualize tension on the LINC complex in living cells, we generated a molecular biosensor to measure force on individual Nesprin proteins. To this end, we inserted a tension sensor module composed of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair mTFP and Venus connected by an elastic flagelliform linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grashoff et al., 2010</xref>) into the juxtamembrane region of a mini-Nesprin-2 construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luxton et al., 2011</xref>), called hereafter ‘N2G-JM-TSMod’. The mTFP-Venus TSMod has been shown previously to be sensitive to forces in the single pN range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grashoff et al., 2010</xref>). In the N2G-JM-TSMod construct, the TSMod lies between the transmembrane domain and the entire cytosolic domain of mini-Nesprin-2, which contains both the N-terminal calponin homology domains that engage actin and a portion of the spectrin repeat region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This construct is distinct from previously described Nesprin tension sensors in its design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arsenovic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Déjardin et al., 2020</xref>). We also generated a tension-insensitive construct by inserting the TSMod at the N-terminus of mini-Nesprin2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, ‘NoT_TSMod’) as well as ‘dark’ controls that allow for bleed through between fluorescence channels to be assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A tension sensor in mini-Nesprin-2 is under actin-dependent tension when mouse keratinocytes (MKCs) engage the extracellular matrix through integrins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon of the N2G-JM-TSMod, in which the mTFP-Venus tension sensor module is inserted between the cytoplasmic domain and the C-terminal KASH domain/transmembrane domain of mini-Nesprin-2.

(<bold>B, C</bold>) The N2G-JM-TSMod displays higher tension (lower FRET index) than the no-tension NoT_TSMod control (higher FRET index) when expressed in MKCs plated on FN-coated glass. Representative images show that, at low expression levels, both the N2G-JM-TSMod and NoT_TSMod are successfully targeted to the nuclear envelope. Images are pseudocolored according to the normalized FRET index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feige et al., 2005</xref>).

(<bold>H, I</bold>) Plating of MKCs on extracellular matrix that engages integrins drives high tension on the N2G-JM-TSMod. MKCs grown on glass coated with fibronectin or laminin drive a higher tension state (low FRET index) than for cells grown on glass coated with poly-L-lysine (high FRET index).

We anticipated that the tension-insensitive NoT_TSMod would exhibit constitutively high FRET indexes, reflecting the conformational freedom at the N-terminus of the mini-Nesprin-2 protein. By contrast, we expected that intramolecular tension exerted on the N2G-JM-TSMod would lead to a decrease in the FRET index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Indeed, relative to the mean NoT_TSMod FRET ratio (set to a value of 1), the N2G-JM-TSMod exhibited lower FRET indexes when expressed in undifferentiated MKCs as assessed qualitatively by the pseudocolored images reflecting the relative FRET index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or quantitatively across populations of MKCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To determine if the actin cytoskeleton is required for tension on the N2G-JM-TSMod in undifferentiated MKCs, we pharmacologically disrupted filamentous actin with latrunculin A (Lat A). After 5 hr of Lat A treatment, the N2G-JM-TSMod displayed relaxed tension compared to the vehicle control (set to a value of 1) as indicated by an increase in the FRET indexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, E). By contrast, Lat A treatment had no effect on the NoT_TSMod, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Based on these data, we conclude that (1) the tension reported by the N2G-JM-TSMod reflects intramolecular tension exerted on the juxtamembrane region and (2) the N2G-JM-TSMod is sensitive to actin-dependent tension at the nuclear envelope.</p><p>Next, we examined how the properties of cell-substrate engagement influenced tension on the LINC complex. We plated undifferentiated MKCs on glass or 3 kPa polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates coated with fibronectin (FN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mertz et al., 2013</xref>). We observed high tension on the N2G-JM-TSMod on stiff glass substrates (set to a value of 1) relative to cells plated on the 3 kPa substrates, which displayed lower tension (higher FRET ratio; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, G). Proliferative keratinocyte progenitor cells bind to the basement membrane via several integrin-based adhesions with the laminin receptors α3β1 and the hemidesmosome-specific α6β4 being the chief epidermal integrins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgeson and Christiano, 1997</xref>). Thus, we also explored how substrate composition affects tension on the LINC complex by plating MKCs on either FN- or laminin-coated glass coverslips or those coated with poly-L-lysine, which allows cell adhesion through its positive charge rather than specific cellular adhesions.

To this end, we employed a conformationally sensitive lamin A/C antibody, which has been used to examine changes in lamin tension due to substrate stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ihalainen et al., 2015</xref>).

We imaged nuclei in which we could resolve the apical and basal regions of the nuclear envelope and quantified the fluorescent signal in the z-plane as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ihalainen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

By contrast, cells in the colony interior display far more uniform conformationally sensitive lamin A/C staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

While we demonstrated that WT MKCs biased expression of differentiation markers such as <italic>Sprr1b</italic> and <italic>Ivl</italic> at the colony interior over the colony periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, G) in agreement with repressive signals from integrin engagement in cells at the colony periphery, Sun dKO MKC colonies instead expressed <italic>Sprr1b</italic> mRNAs in MKCs residing in both the interior and periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), despite still having focal adhesions in peripheral cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). As a consequence, expression of differentiation markers is both elevated at the colony periphery and is random with respect to colony position in the absence of LINC complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

Taken together, these results suggest that LINC complexes are required to repress epidermal differentiation genes when integrins are actively engaged.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Sun dKO MKCs exhibit an increase in chromatin accessibility at genes within the EDC</title><p>The EDC moves away from the nuclear lamina during epidermal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gdula et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mardaryev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Williams et al., 2002</xref>) with an associated loss of repressive H3K27me3 chromatin marks at differentiation-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lien et al., 2011</xref>). Given that Sun dKO MKCs display a precocious differentiation phenotype, we hypothesized that the EDC may be more accessible when LINC complexes are ablated. To test this, we applied assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) to determine if chromatin accessibility was changed in Sun dKO MKCs with a focus on the EDC. Globally, most genes with annotated ATAC-seq peak(s) are conserved between WT and Sun dKO MKCs cultured in low calcium media (9307 genes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Sun dKO MKCs showed a loss of 1070 genes with annotated ATAC-seq peaks compared to WT MKCs, which are outnumbered by gains in Sun dKO MKCs (2935 genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that there is a relatively modest increase in global chromatin accessibility in Sun dKO MKCs.</p><p>It is therefore striking that Sun dKO MKCs displayed almost twice as many ATAC-seq peaks within the EDC region (34 peaks) relative to WT MKCs (19 peaks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Specifically, in Sun dKO MKCs we observed 18 additional peaks, 16 maintained peaks, and a loss of just 3 peaks compared to WT MKCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This net gain of peaks is observed throughout all regions of the EDC, with the SPRR region displaying the most striking change, gaining five novel ATAC-seq peaks upon loss of SUN proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, C). Importantly, while there is a trend toward increased chromatin accessibility in regions flanking the EDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>) in line with a trend toward increased accessibility across the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), the gain of ATAC-seq peaks is more pronounced in the EDC compared to chromatin regions 5′ and 3′ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We also noted examples in which the additional ATAC-seq peak was located near the promoter region of epidermal differentiation genes such as <italic>Sprr2a3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We next investigated if there are changes in chromatin accessibility at other genes tied to epidermal differentiation that reside outside the EDC. We observed a trend toward additional ATAC-seq peaks in some genic regions encoding keratins and cell adhesion genes tied to epidermal differentiation in Sun dKO MKCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). We further asked if Sun dKO MKCs displayed hallmarks of repression of cell proliferation genes, which might be expected upon loss of MKC progenitors due to precocious keratinocyte differentiation. However, no such trend was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Thus, the changes in chromatin accessibility support a model in which keratinocyte differentiation genes are precociously expressed in Sun dKO cells despite largely normal accessibility at genes that underlie progenitor maintenance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton complex ablation leads to an increase in chromatin accessibility of genes residing in the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC).</title><p>Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) tracks generated from either WT (top; N = 2) or Sun dKO (bottom; N = 2) mouse keratinocytes (MKCs) grown in low calcium media.

While <italic>β1</italic> integrin-dependent signals normally repress the differentiation of keratinocytes, in the absence of functional LINC complexes these basal progenitors instead differentiate precociously both in vitro and in vivo. Based on our findings, we propose a model in which LINC complexes transmit forces from the <italic>β1</italic> integrin-engaged actin network to the nuclear lamina to directly regulate the expression of epidermal differentiation genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), although an indirect role for the LINC complex in an alternative signaling pathway remains possible. In particular, as our electron microscopy data strongly suggest that adhesion between basal keratinocytes and the basal lamina remains normal in Sun dKO animals, we strongly favor this direct model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Of note, cells migrating through constrictions or plated at high versus low packing density display lower tension on a distinct Nesprin TSMod variant similar in design to the one described here, suggesting that tension on the LINC complex may respond to a number of mechanical inputs depending on the experimental system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Déjardin et al., 2020</xref>). However, high tension on the LINC complex at the edge of cell monolayer upon wounding compared to the interior of the monolayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Déjardin et al., 2020</xref>) is in line with the integrin dependence observed in this study.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for the mechanism of precocious differentiation in the Sun dKO epidermis.</title><p>WT progenitor cells adhere to the basal lamina through integrins, leading to tension on linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes that is transmitted to the basal surface of the nuclear lamina to maintain repression of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC). As cells move into the suprabasal layer, they lose integrin engagement. In suprabasal cells that only engage cell-cell junctions, LINC complexes and the nuclear lamina are relaxed, leading to upregulation of EDC gene expression. In the Sun dKO epidermis, tension from engaged integrins is not propagated to the nucleus in progenitor cells despite normal adhesion, leading to precocious expression of EDC genes.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58541-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Interestingly, our data indicate that high Rho activity and actin contractility are not sufficient to drive tension on the LINC complex – indeed, this represents a critical point that lies at the heart of our model. For instance, cells at the interior of cohesive MKC colonies also display extensive stress fibers integrated at cell-cell adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mertz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stewart et al., 2015</xref>), but nonetheless show low tension on the LINC complex and the nuclear lamina, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>. These observations suggest that actomyosin contractility is not sufficient, in and of itself, to drive LINC complex tension. This point is underscored by our finding that the LINC complex is relaxed in MKCs lacking β1 integrin, which have high Rho activity, strong focal adhesions (nucleated through β6 integrin), and massive stress fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Raghavan et al., 2003</xref>). Further studies will be required to define why only engagement of β1 integrins is sufficient to exert high tension on the LINC complex.</p><p>How might tension on the nuclear lamina regulate epidermal differentiation? As a skin-specific mouse model lacking A- and B-type lamin expression also demonstrated precocious epidermal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jung et al., 2014</xref>) and we find that MKC differentiation results in a relaxation of lamin A/C tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, E), the LINC complex may act through tension-dependent remodeling of the nuclear lamina. The chromosome region housing the EDC moves away from the nuclear lamina during epidermal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gdula et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mardaryev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Williams et al., 2002</xref>) and is associated with the loss of H3K27me3 chromatin marks on differentiation-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lien et al., 2011</xref>). If and how lamin tension influences this change in nuclear compartmentalization remains to be defined. We favor a model in which stretching of lamins drives remodeling of the composition of the nuclear lamina to maintain the epidermal progenitor state. Interestingly, the conformational epitope in lamin A/C examined in this work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) overlaps with binding sites for DNA, histones, SUN proteins, and the integral inner nuclear membrane protein emerin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haque et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ihalainen et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the force-dependent differential exposure of these binding sites may influence the interaction of lamin A/C with the genome, either directly or through modulation of the activity of its binding partners. Indeed, stretching of MKCs leads to the release of emerin from the nuclear lamina; abrogating this mechanical response also leads to precocious differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Le et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, this response involves the formation of a perinuclear actin cage, a structure that we found previously to be perturbed in MKCs lacking SUN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stewart et al., 2015</xref>). We note, however, that our ATAC-seq data do not reveal a global shift in chromatin accessibility in the absence and presence of LINC complex engagement, as observed previously in response to critical stretch of keratinocyte monolayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Le et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nava et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that constitutive tension on the LINC complex and the response to rapid stretching or cyclic stretch of the cell substratum may drive distinct responses.</p><p>Further work will be required to determine if the levels and geometry of forces exerted on LINC complexes differ between integrin-based adhesions and cell-cell adhesions. Another open question is whether building tension on the nuclear lamina requires a force opposing that is mediated by the LINC-actin-integrin axis. In our prior work, we found that control over nuclear position in MKCs at the periphery of cohesive colonies was dictated by a ‘tug-of-war’ between the actomyosin and microtubule networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stewart et al., 2015</xref>). Whether coupling of microtubules to LINC complexes contributes to building tension on the LINC-actin-integrin axis, and the magnitude of these intramolecular forces, remains an open question as all Nesprin TSMod constructs devised to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arsenovic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Déjardin et al., 2020</xref>), including the one we describe here, lack the spectrin repeats responsible for mediating interactions with microtubules and microtubule motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schneider et al., 2011</xref>). Examining whether the geometry of exogenous force application to cells influences nuclear lamina-dependent regulation of gene expression by modulating the extent of chromatin stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tajik et al., 2016</xref>) represents another exciting direction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

The epidermis was separated from the dermis with forceps and incubated in 0.25% trypsin for 15 min at room temperature (RT). Cells were liberated by trituration, filtered using a 40–70 µm strainer, and plated on mitomycin-C–treated J2 fibroblasts in medium-calcium medium (0.3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). After 2–4 passages, keratinocytes were plated on plastic dishes without feeder cells and maintained in media containing 0.05 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (E-low calcium media). Cells at low passage were stored under liquid nitrogen, and thawed cells were only used to passage 16. Integrin β1 null keratinocytes and corresponding WT controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2012</xref>) (kind gift from David Calderwood and Srikala Raghavan) were cultured at 32°C with 7.5% CO<sub>2</sub> in E media (DMEM/F12 in a 3:1 ratio with 15% fetal bovine serum supplemented with insulin, transferrin, hydrocortisone, cholera toxin, triidothyronone, and penicillin-streptomycin).

The sequence encoding green fluorescent protein was removed by QuikChange mutagenesis. The mTFP-Venus tension sensor module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grashoff et al., 2010</xref>) (kind gift from Martin Schwartz) was inserted just prior to the transmembrane domain. Dark controls were generated using QuikChange mutagenesis (Dark Venus: Y67L; Dark mTFP: Y72L). The no-tension (NoT_TSmod) construct was generated by inserting the mTFP-Venus tension sensor module 5′ of mini-Nesprin2 using the AgeI and XhoI restriction sites. For FRET experiments, cells were plated in E-low calcium media (or E media for Integrin β1 null MKCs ) 16 hr before transfections on glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek Corporation) coated with 50 μg/mL fibronectin (20 min at room temperature, Sigma-Aldrich), poly-L-lysine (2 hr at room temperature, Sigma P9155), or laminin (2 hr at 37°C, Thermo, Cat# CB-40232).

Components were mixed thoroughly and immediately degassed for 15 min in a desiccator. The surface of 35 mm glass-bottomed culture dishes (MatTek Corporation) were covered with 200 µL of the mixed gel. Each dish was then spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 60 s using a spin coater instrument (Headway Research, PWM32). Gels were cured at room temperature overnight. The next morning gels were sterilized for 30 min under UV light and then washed once with sterile PBS.

Acquired images were equally brightened, contrasted, and cropped using ImageJ/Fiji (version 1.50e) software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). For quantitation, signal threshold was determined using no probe controls for each individual experiment. Colony outlines were drawn and then cells were counted and scored as positive or negative for gene expression and interior or periphery based on location within colony. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 8 software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Mouse tissue isolation, histology, and immunofluorescence staining</title><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (IACUC protocol number 2018-11248).

After sectioning, the Click-iTEdU Cell Proliferation Kit for Imaging, Alexa Fluor 488 dye (Invitrogen C10337), was used according to manufacturer’s instructions to evaluate EdU incorporation. Tissue sections were then co-stained for K10 (see 'Mouse tissue isolation, histology, and immunofluorescence staining'). Before imaging, coverglass was mounted onto slides using Prolong Gold with DAPI (Invitrogen P36935) and sealed with clear nail polish. Images were acquired with the Zeiss Imager M1 using Zen software. Total EdU-positive cells were counted and normalized to the total number of epidermal cells (determined by DAPI staining).

Back skin sections from <italic>Sun 1+/-/Sun2-/-</italic> and Sun dKO pups were isolated at age P0.5; three mice were examined for each genotype. Tissue blocks were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at RT and 1.5 hr at 4°C. The samples were rinsed in sodium cacodylate buffer and were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 hr. The samples were rinsed and en bloc stained in aqueous 2% uranyl acetate for 1 hr followed by rinsing, dehydrating in an ethanol series to 100%, rinsing in 100% propylene oxide, infiltrating with EMbed 812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences) resin, and baking overnight at 60°C. Hardened blocks were cut using an ultramicrotome (UltraCut UC7; Leica). Ultrathin 60 nm sections were collected and stained using 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate for transmission microscopy. Carbon-coated grids were viewed on a transmission electron microscope (TecnaiBioTWIN; FEI) at 80 kV. Images were taken using a CCD camera (Morada; Olympus) and iTEM (Olympus) software.

Cells were fixed with methanol at −20°C for 5 min and washed with PBS. Cells were permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS at RT for 20 min and blocked using 10% goat serum, 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.5% Tween 20 in PBS for 1 hr. Cells were incubated in primary antibody, conformationally sensitive lamin A/C (1:200; ab8984; Abcam), diluted in blocking buffer at 4°C overnight. Coverslips were washed with PBS for three 5 min intervals and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000; Invitrogen Cat# A-11029) diluted in blocking buffer at RT for 1 hr. Coverslips were then costained with Hoechst 33342 (1:2000; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated Wheat Germ Agglutinin (1:1000; Life Technologies) diluted in PBS for 5 min at RT.

Images were acquired using Zen software. FRET imaging was performed in a similar manner as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grashoff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). Three sequential images were acquired: the donor mTFP1 channel using a 458 nm laser line (ex), 458 nm MBS filter, and PMT detector set for mTFP1 emission; the acceptor Venus channel using a 514 nm laser line (ex), 458/514 nm MBS filter, and PMT detector set for Venus emission; and the FRET channel using a 458 nm laser line (ex), 458/514 nm MBS filter, and PMT detector set for Venus emission. In all cases, the nuclear midplane was imaged. Acquisition settings were standardized and maintained during experiments. FRET image analysis was performed using the intensity-based FRET method, implemented as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). Nonlinear spectral bleed-through corrections were first determined using the PixFRET plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feige et al., 2005</xref>) for ImageJ/Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Donor mTFP1 leakage was quantified using cells transfected with mini-Nesprin2G-mTFP1 alone (dark Venus control), while acceptor Venus cross-excitation was quantified using cells transfected with mini-Nesprin2G-Venus alone (dark mTFP control). At least 10 cells each were used for bleed-through corrections. For FRET index determination, masks consisting of a three pixel-wide band encompassing the nuclear envelope were used to segment the nuclear envelope. Mean FRET index per nucleus was then determined using previously published software, either PixFRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feige et al., 2005</xref>) or in-house MATLAB scripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Imaging of conformationally sensitive lamin A/C was performed on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope using the LAS-AF software. Lamin A/C (AF488) was imaged using a 488 nm laser line (ex) and PMT detector set for AF488 emission; and the WGA (AF594) using a 594 nm laser line (ex) and PMT detector set for AF594 emission. PMT gain was adjusted for each sample to avoid over-/under-exposure. Acquisition settings were standardized and maintained during experiments. Single-plane images to determine the location of each cell within a colony were acquired using a 40× 1.25 NA air objective, imaging the AF488 and AF594 channels sequentially. Next, Z-stacks of each images were acquired using a 63×, 1.4 NA oil objective in the AF488 channel. Image zoom and size was adjusted such that voxel size was 55–65 nm in the xy-plane and 130 nm in the z-plane. Image stacks were deconvolved using Huygens Professional software (Scientific Volume Imaging, The Netherlands, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://svi.nl">http://svi.nl</ext-link>) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ihalainen et al., 2015</xref>). A theoretical point spread function was used for iterative deconvolution. Deconvolution was performed using the following software parameters: image signal to noise was set to 5, the quality threshold was 0.01, and maximum iterations was 50 (however, usually fewer than 20 iterations were required to reach the quality threshold). Images were then analyzed using ImageJ/Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). The apical-basal lamin A/C intensity was measured for a single XZ or YZ slice from the middle of each individual nucleus of interest. The intensity of antibody staining was measured from the apical to the basal side of the nucleus using a straight line along the z-axis that is approximately half the width of the nucleus of interest. The fluorescence intensity across the z-axis was plotted and fit to two gaussian curves, one corresponding to the apical side of the nuclear envelope and the second corresponding to the basal side. The area under each curve and the ratio of these areas were calculated using MATLAB R2019b, and the software can be found on GitHub at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/LusKingLab/GaussianFit">https://github.com/LusKingLab/GaussianFit</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>RNAseq</title><p>WT and Sun dKO cells were grown in E-low calcium media for 24 hr to 100% confluency (undifferentiated) or were switched to high calcium media to induce adhesion formation and differentiation for 48 hr.

With ever increasing excitement as to how cells sense tension and transmit it to the nucleus, your new work will now be an important addition to this arena.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The LINC complex transmits integrin-dependent tension to the nuclear lamina and represses epidermal differentiation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviews of your manuscript are now in. As you can see, the consensus is that your manuscript strives to address a fundamental and largely understudied question, and your tools and strategy have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of how connections between cell-matrix adhesions and the nucleus have direct consequences on cell fate. That said, all your reviewers encourage you to provide better support for the central claims of your manuscript. There are five pressing concerns summarized below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Their central hypothesis is that a relay of tension between integrins and the LINC complex maintains nuclear organization such that EDC gene expression is repressed. As tension on basally localized integrins is released, either by delamination or by redistribution of forces to cell-cell junctions (as happens in the middle of keratinocyte colonies), the chromatin state changes such that transcription of the differentiation program may be de-repressed. This attractive hypothesis needs to be tested more rigorously using their current models and existing experimental tools. For example, DNA-FISH approaches (as used in Mardaryev, Development, 2014) to test whether the positioning of the EDC chromosomal region within the nucleus is differentially located the interior of colonies (where tension is low) compared to the outside of colonies (where tension is high), or spatially correlates with LINC tension at the single-cell level (if their tension sensor is suitable for fixation and DNA-FISH conditions). The authors should also test whether nuclear positioning of the EDC cluster and/or genes associated with epidermal differentiation is misregulated in the Sun1/2-dKO epidermis. The inclusion of such data would significantly strengthen the central claim and broader impact of the manuscript.</p><p>2. There is a paucity of validation for the FRET sensor construct. To make conclusions about tension, a number of experiments can be conducted. A version of the construct lacking the actin-binding or KASH domains of Nesprin2 is important; similar controls were vital to the conclusions drawn in the original Schwartz paper (Grashoff et al., 2010) and in other contexts where the TS-module has been used (eg. Cai et al., Cell, 2013). Having the TS &quot;free floating&quot; on the N-terminus would also be valuable. These controls are also very important as e.g. treatment with latruculin or other inhibitors can affect the FRET efficiency in similar directions independent of tension. Other manipulations of cell tension (besides poly-lysine coating and Latrunculin treatment), such as coating with varying concentrations of fibronectin, culturing cells on substrates of different stiffness, or exogenous force application to culture substrates, would significantly improve confidence that their construct indeed reports on mechanical tension in the nuclear envelope. Standard for validation of FRET experiments is to include an acceptor photobleaching experiment. Also, although the raw data for Venus/mTFP channels and bleedthrough controls with single colour constructs should be shown.</p><p>3. The data with the force-sensitive epitope LaminA/C antibody is not of sufficient quality. In the original paper where this tool was developed (Nat Materials, 2015), the signal of the LaminA/C was normalized against signal from a force-insensitive LaminB antibody. Otherwise, how do we know we are looking at the nuclear envelope? Or that there aren't overall differences in nuclear envelope morphology/composition that contribute to the differences in A/C signal that we see, rather than an effect that can be specifically attributed to tensional differences?</p><p>4. Some baseline description of the LINC complex in the epidermis would provide insights that may lend support for (or refute) their hypothesis. For example, where in the epidermis is Sun1/2 expressed? Is there any developmental regulation of LINC complex organization? One might predict reduced expression or altered localization of LINC complex components (such as SUN1/2) in the differentiated layers of the epidermis. Can the force-sensitive Lamin-A/C antibody be used in vivo to see if there are differences between staining patterns in the basal layer where cells have integrin-mediated contacts compared to the suprabasal, differentiating layers where they do not? Are there differences in nuclear morphology in the presence or absence of sun1/2 dKO epidermis that might support their model? Does loss of Sun1/Sun2 alter nuclear stiffness? If the authors can show that the regulation of molecular tension across the Linc complex directly correlates to changes in nuclear tension, this will strengthen the paper.</p><p>5. The molecular links how integrins control tension on the Linc complex, or how altered tension at the Linc complex controls differentiation are not at all addressed, and the paper should at least provide some insight into either upstream or downstream control of how integrin dependent regulation of Sun1/2 regulates differentiation; e.g. explore the molecular link between integrin and the linc complex (in their model both actin and MTs are potentially implicated for example), alterations in epigenetic marks, chromatin organization of e.g. relocalization of the EDC locus etc.</p><p>The conditional b1 and KO of integrin a3 integrins do not result in altered/precocious differentiation in the skin (although it does affect proliferation and hair follicle morphogenesis). Presumably the link between integrins and the LINC complex under these conditions would be altered as well? The idea that LINC complex may control differentiation is possible, however the role of integrin based adhesions in this process has not been parsed out. At the very least the authors could have disrupted integrin signaling using KO cells or blocking antibodies. So it is possible that there may be alternative mechanisms? This should be considered.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised article &quot;The LINC complex transmits integrin-dependent tension to the nuclear lamina and represses epidermal differentiation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has now been re-reviewed by a Reviewing Editor and by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>We agree that your manuscript is much improved and has an important message for <italic>eLife</italic>. That said, there still several items remaining, that we feel need to be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>Three issues remain. First, changes in nuclear structure and likely mechanics in keratinocytes induce rather global changes in chromatin and transcription (Le et al., 2016), and hence it would be helpful if you can present the ATAC data more generally and not just pick a few loci to analyze. Are your data specific for the EDC locus or are other differentiation genes also affected? One would also predict changes in the so-called stem cell genes-can you comment on whether this is observed? These minor adjustments will provide even a better global vision on how the nuclear envelope tension regulates gene expression and differentiation.</p><p>Second, the b1 KO cells have to be cultured in high calcium media and have very high levels of Rho activity, strong focal adhesions (nucleated through integrin b6) and massive stress fibers (Raghavan et al. 2003, Bandyopadhyay and Raghavan 2012). Given the role of the actin cytoskeletal network in transmitting the forces via the LINC complex to the nucleus, it seems surprising that the tension sensor shows such high FRET (low tension) compared to the WT cells. It would be helpful if you could add a bit of discussion as to how you interpret these data and reconcile this point. Toning down some of the conclusions made regarding this point might be warranted.</p><p>Finally, it would seem that you should add a brief discussion and referencing of the recent Nava et al. Cell paper, that shows heterochromatin driven changes in nuclear mechanics in keratinocytes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58541.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We observe a clear increase in chromatin accessibility as revealed by gains in ATAC peaks in the EDC of <italic>Sun dKO</italic> MKCs across the EDC in the low calcium condition when these genes are repressed in WT MKCs, indicative of a more open chromatin state and consistent with our model of precocious differentiation.</p><p>We tried extensively to analyze the EDC position by FISH as suggested.

We believe this could reflect our inability to sufficiently denature the probe targets when the region is heterochromatized, as we expect it to be in WT MKCs cultured in low calcium media. Despite our inability to complete this experiment, the new data described above provide additional support for the role of the LINC complex in regulating chromatin accessibility at epidermal differentiation genes and their expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Also, although the raw data for Venus/mTFP channels and bleedthrough controls with single colour constructs should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their feedback and suggestions. We have provided additional controls to ensure that changes in the FRET indexes of the mini-Nesprin2 TSMod (N2G-JM-TSMod) indeed reflect tension on the LINC complex. To this end, we made a tension insensitive construct (no-tension construct) by inserting the TSMod at the N-terminus of the mini-Nesprin2 (Figure 1 A, “NoT_TSMod”) where it cannot bear any load. Comparing FRET index measurements at the nuclear envelope for MKCs transfected with the TSMod inserted at the juxtamembrane region (N2G-JM-TSMod) and the NoT_TSMod control (Figure 1B,C) indeed revealed that the N2G-JM-TSMod is under tension in WT MKCs. We also compared the response of the two TSMods to treatment with latrunculin A to depolymerize actin. While the N2G-JM-TSMod was under higher tension that was relaxed upon treatment of latrunculin A (Figure D,E), the tension insensitive NoT_TSMod control showed no change in tension at the nuclear envelope (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). Last, we provide new evidence that tension on the N2G-JM-TSMod is sensitive to the mechanics of the substrate (Figure 1F,G). Bolstered by these additional data we conclude that (1) the TSMod is sensitive to actin-dependent tension at the nuclear envelope; and (2) the changes in FRET efficiency reported by the N2G-JM-TSMod reflects intramolecular tension exerted on the juxtamembrane region, as the no tension control is insensitive to load. As suggested by the reviewers, we also now show additional experimental controls including “dark” donor only and acceptor only constructs used for bleed through correction (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,C,D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We agree that ideally we would co-stain nuclei with a force-insensitive lamin A/C or lamin B antibody to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. However, we have tested numerous commercially available tension insensitive lamin antibodies, including those used in the 2015 Nature Materials paper, as well as antibodies to other nuclear envelope and nuclear pore complex proteins. Ultimately, we were unable to identify an antibody that stained the nuclear envelope of the mouse keratinocytes under conditions compatible with the tension-sensitive lamin A/C antibody with the performance required for this experiment (although we verified this does work well in fibroblasts, as published). Since we found that we could successfully co-stain human epidermal keratinocytes, we further attempted to validate our system in this model. However, the nuclei of these cells are flatter than the mouse keratinocyte nuclei, and we were unable to achieve sufficient resolution with our confocal imaging and deconvolution set-up to resolve the apical and basal surfaces of the nucleus, even with manipulation of substrate conditions. This said, we developed our approach specifically because it allows us to robustly resolve the nuclear and basal surfaces. We have softened the language we use in the revised manuscript to acknowledge that while we observe decreased staining with this conformationally-sensitive antibody, this could reflect multiple changes in the state of the basal lamina, including a higher tension state.</p><p>The revised manuscript also includes abundant further characterization of the our N2G-JM-TSMod including its sensitivity to the presence of β1 integrin (Figure 1J,K) and the stiffness of the substrate on which the MKCs are plated (Figure 1F,G). As our observations using the tension-sensitive lamin A/C antibody mirror the results obtained from our now thoroughly-characterized N2G-JM-TSMod, we continue to favor the model that LINC complexes are under more tension in cells at the colony periphery versus the interior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Is there any developmental regulation of LINC complex organization? One might predict reduced expression or altered localization of LINC complex components (such as SUN1/2) in the differentiated layers of the epidermis. Can the force-sensitive Lamin-A/C antibody be used in vivo to see if there are differences between staining patterns in the basal layer where cells have integrin-mediated contacts compared to the suprabasal, differentiating layers where they do not? Are there differences in nuclear morphology in the presence or absence of sun1/2 dKO epidermis that might support their model? Does loss of Sun1/Sun2 alter nuclear stiffness? If the authors can show that the regulation of molecular tension across the Linc complex directly correlates to changes in nuclear tension, this will strengthen the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed immunostaining for SUN1 and SUN2 in E15.5 mouse skin. As described for post-natal skin in our prior manuscript (Stewart et al. JCB 2015), we find that both SUN1 and SUN2 are expressed throughout the basal and suprabasal layers of the epidermis (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B). We have been unable to perform staining for the force sensitive lamin-A/C antibody in skin sections due to poor antibody performance in IHC. Further, measuring nuclear stiffness directly, a technique with which we have experience, requires a substantial additional commitment and we have not attempted this approach here. We note, however, that the literature suggests that while LINC complexes are essential for force transduction to the nucleus, they have little effect on the force response (e.g. work from the Lammerding lab – Lombardi et al., JBC, 2011). We do not observe any gross changes in the nuclear morphology in <italic>Sun</italic> dKO epidermis, but would argue that our lack of understanding of the tension network in keratinocytes in vivo does not rule out there are nonetheless changes in tension exerted on the nucleus. Indeed, we have noted in our prior work that changes in nuclear shape can reflect both LINC complex-dependent and -independent factors (Stewart et al., JCB, 2015; Stewart et al., MBoC, 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The molecular links how integrins control tension on the Linc complex, or how altered tension at the Linc complex controls differentiation are not at all addressed, and the paper should at least provide some insight into either upstream or downstream control of how integrin dependent regulation of Sun1/2 regulates differentiation; e.g. explore the molecular link between integrin and the linc complex (in their model both actin and MTs are potentially implicated for example), alterations in epigenetic marks, chromatin organization of e.g. relocalization of the EDC locus etc.</p><p>The conditional b1 and KO of integrin a3 integrins do not result in altered/precocious differentiation in the skin (although it does affect proliferation and hair follicle morphogenesis).

This should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s feedback and agree that further investigation into the role of integrins in the regulation of LINC complex tension and keratinocyte differentiation is warranted. In this revision, we include new experiments to directly address the role that integrins play in regulating tension on the LINC complex by examining the tension on the N2G-JM-TSMod in β1 integrin KO MKCs. Our FRET analysis demonstrates that the FRET index of the N2G-TSMod was significantly higher in β1 integrin KO MKCs compared to WT MKCs (Figure 1J,K) indicating that β1 integrin is required for the high LINC complex tension state. Our additional data demonstrating that the N2G-TSMod is also sensitive to substrate stiffness (Figure 1F,G) further reinforces this relationship.</p><p>We also examined the expression of differentiation genes in β1 integrin KO MKCs. RT-qPCR analysis of <italic>Sprr1b</italic>, <italic>Involucrin</italic> (<italic>Ivl</italic>), and <italic>S100a14</italic> revealed a significantly elevated expression of these mRNAs in β1 integrin KO MKCs cultured in low calcium conditions (Figure 4I). These data mirror our observations in <italic>Sun</italic> dKO MKCs and support a role for β1 integrin in mediating tension on the LINC complex and its role in suppressing epidermal differentiation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We agree that your manuscript is much improved and has an important message for eLife.

Across the genome, most ATAC-seq peaks are found at the same genes for WT and Sun dKO MKCs. Sun dKO MKCs also show both gains and losses of ATAC-seq peaks associated with genes compared to WT MKCs, with a bias towards gains. Further analysis revealed that additional ATAC-seq peaks are found at genes encoding keratins and cell adhesion genes in Sun dKO MKCs, suggesting that epidermal differentiation genes outside of the EDC also show increased chromatin accessibility (Supplementary File 5). However, we do not see premature loss of ATAC-seq peaks at proliferation genes or “stem cell genes” (Supplementary File 5), arguing that precocious expression of epidermal differentiation genes is the primary alteration upon loss of the LINC complex. Of note, these data differ from the results of Le et al., 2016, who found global down-regulation of genes upon critical stretch of keratinocyte monolayers. We conclude, as outlined in the Discussion, that stretch achieved with the device employed by Le et al. and constitutive tension on the LINC complex dictated by integrin engagement represent two distinct contexts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the b1 KO cells have to be cultured in high calcium media and have very high levels of Rho activity, strong focal adhesions (nucleated through integrin b6) and massive stress fibers (Raghavan et al. 2003, Bandyopadhyay and Raghavan 2012). Given the role of the actin cytoskeletal network in transmitting the forces via the LINC complex to the nucleus, it seems surprising that the tension sensor shows such high FRET (low tension) compared to the WT cells. It would be helpful if you could add a bit of discussion as to how you interpret these data and reconcile this point. Toning down some of the conclusions made regarding this point might be warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this perspective. However, our data from this manuscript and other published work clearly indicate that high Rho activity and actin contractility are not sufficient to drive tension on the LINC complex – indeed this represents the critical point that lies at the heart of our model. For instance, cells at the interior of cohesive MKC colonies also display extensive stress fibers integrated at cell-cell adhesions (see our prior work – Mertz et al., PNAS, 2013; Stewart et al., JCB, 2015) and show low tension on the LINC complex and the nuclear lamina, as demonstrated in Figure 2 A-D. Thus, our data indicate that actomyosin contractility is not sufficient, in and of itself, to drive a high-tension state on the LINC complex. While we agree that these findings may be, on the surface, surprising, this model provides an explanation for how the LINC complex could specifically contribute to repressing epidermal differentiation genes in basal but not suprabasal keratinocytes. As for the specificity for integrin b1 and not integrin b6, further studies will be required to define why only engagement of the former is sufficient to exert high tension on the LINC complex. We now include a more detailed discussion on these points in the discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, it would seem that you should add a brief discussion and referencing of the recent Nava et al. Cell paper, that shows heterochromatin driven changes in nuclear mechanics in keratinocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>We now cite and discuss this paper, as suggested. However, we would point out that stretched cells and constitutive tension on LINC complexes with engaged b1-integrins likely represent distinct regimes as we do not observe the global changes observed by Le et al. and. Nava et al.</p></body></sub-article></article>
