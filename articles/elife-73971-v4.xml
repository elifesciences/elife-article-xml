atlases for a wide range of organisms, tissues, and disease processes. To increase the scale of these atlases, lower the cost and pave the way for more specialized multiome assays, custom droplet microfluidics may provide solutions complementary to commercial setups. We developed HyDrop, a flexible and open-source droplet microfluidic platform encompassing three protocols. The first protocol involves creating dissolvable hydrogel beads with custom oligos that can be released in the droplets. In the second protocol, we demonstrate the use of these beads for HyDrop-ATAC, a low-cost noncommercial scATAC-seq protocol in droplets. After validating HyDrop-ATAC, we applied it to flash-frozen mouse cortex and generated 7996 high-quality single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles in a single run. In the third protocol, we adapt both the reaction chemistry and the capture sequence of the barcoded hydrogel bead to capture mRNA, and demonstrate a significant improvement in throughput and sensitivity compared to previous open-source droplet-based scRNA-seq assays (Drop-seq and inDrop). Similarly, we applied HyDrop-RNA to flash-frozen mouse cortex and generated 9508 single-cell transcriptomes closely matching reference single-cell gene expression data. Finally, we leveraged HyDrop-RNA’s high capture rate to analyze a small population of fluorescence-activated cell sorted neurons from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, confirming the protocol’s applicability to low input samples and small cells. HyDrop is currently capable of generating single-cell data in high throughput and at a reduced cost compared to commercial methods, and we envision that HyDrop can be further developed to be compatible with novel (multi) omics protocols.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Scientists are now able to determine the order of chemical blocks, or nucleic acids, that make up the genetic code. These sequencing tools can be used to identify which genes are active within a biological sample. They do this by extracting and analysing open chromatin (regions of DNA that are accessible to the cell’s machinery), or sequences of RNA (the molecular templates cells use to translate genes into working proteins).</p><p>Initially, most sequencing tools could only provide an ‘averaged-out’ profile of the genes activated in bulk pieces of tissue which contain multiple types of cell. However, advances in technology have led to new methods that can extract and analyse open chromatin or RNA from individual cells.</p><p>First, the cells are separated, via a technique called microfluidics, into tiny droplets of water along with a single bead that carries a unique barcode. The cell is then broken apart inside the droplet and the barcode within the bead gets released and attaches itself to the genetic material extracted from the cell. All the genetic material inside the droplets is then pooled together and sequenced. Researchers then use the barcode tags to identify which bits of RNA or DNA belong to each cell.</p><p>Single-cell sequencing has many advantages, including being able to pinpoint precise genetic differences between healthy and abnormal cells, and to create cell atlases of whole organisms, tissues and microbial communities. But existing methods for extracting chromatin are very expensive, and there were no openly available tools for processing thousands of cells at speed. Furthermore, while several single-cell RNA sequencing tools are already freely available, they are not very sensitive or practical to use.</p><p>Here, De Rop et al. have developed a new open-source platform called HyDrop that overcomes these barriers. The method entails a new type of barcoded bead and optimised elements of existing microfluidics protocols using open-source reagents. These changes created a more user-friendly workflow and increased sensitivity of sequencing at no additional cost.</p><p>De Rop et al. used their new platform to screen the RNA and open chromatin of thousands of individuals cells from the brains of mice and flies. HyDrop outperformed other open-source methods when working in RNA-sequencing mode. It also provides the first open-source tool for sequencing open chromatin in single cells. Further improvements are expected as researchers tweak the platform, which for now provides an affordable alternative to existing methods.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-cell RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>single-cell ATAC sequencing</kwd><kwd>scRNA-seq</kwd><kwd>scATAC-seq</kwd><kwd>droplet microfluidics</kwd><kwd>hydrop</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>724226_cis- CONTROL</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aerts</surname><given-names>Stein</given-names></name><name><surname>Aerts</surname><given-names>Stein</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004040</institution-id><institution>KU Leuven</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C14/18/092</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aerts</surname><given-names>Stein</given-names></name><name><surname>Aerts</surname><given-names>Stein</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0B5619N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aerts</surname><given-names>Stein</given-names></name><name><surname>Aerts</surname><given-names>Stein</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000864</institution-id><institution>Michael J.

Two methods that pioneered the field, inDrop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klein et al., 2015</xref>) and Drop-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>), both rely on the same working principle: individual cells are rapidly encapsulated into a nanoliter droplet together with a barcoded bead. Barcoding primers carried by the beads inside the emulsion are then used to index each individual cell’s mRNA. This process occurs either inside the droplet, where the cell’s mRNA is reverse transcribed using barcoded primers released by the barcoded bead (inDrop) or after emulsion breaking, where the cellular mRNA is anchored onto barcodes carried by resin beads (Drop-seq). The thousands of single-cell transcriptomes can then be processed for next-generation sequencing in a pooled manner. The high throughput and low per-cell reagent consumption associated with this approach have allowed researchers to profile gene expression of tens of thousands of single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kalish et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yap et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Karaiskos et al., 2017</xref>) at an affordable cost. However, the labor requirements of current open-source droplet microfluidic protocols combined with their limited sensitivity have hindered widespread adoption. Furthermore, academic development of droplet-microfluidic single-cell sequencing technology after inDrop and Drop-seq has been limited. To our knowledge, only one noncommercial droplet-based single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) protocol has been published so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Despite its elegant conceptual solution to droplet-based combined scATAC and scRNA-seq, the SNARE-seq protocol is still labor intensive, and the use of resin beads leads to reduced cell capture rates. These resin beads are loaded at dilute concentrations to prevent microfluidic obstruction, and as a result, many droplets are empty, leading to a low cell capture rate (~2%), and reagent waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Instead, deformable hydrogel beads can be stacked and loaded into droplets at a fixed rate without the risk of microfluidic failure, thereby increasing cell capture rate to &gt;50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abate et al., 2009</xref>). Several commercial solutions have emerged since inDrop and Drop-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sarkar et al., 2018</xref>), and their application has been used to generate hundreds of thousands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Svensson et al., 2020</xref>) - and recently millions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Datlinger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ren et al., 2021</xref>) - of single-cell transcriptomes at a high sensitivity. However, the high cost of these commercial protocols remains prohibitive for many research applications, and their fixed nature limits custom protocol development.</p><p>In order to increase the sensitivity and user-friendliness of open-source microfluidic protocols, and to provide a more flexible and open platform, we developed HyDrop, a new hydrogel-based droplet microfluidic method for high-throughput scRNA-seq or scATAC-seq. We adapted inDrop’s original isothermal extension bead barcoding protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zilionis et al., 2017</xref>) to a linear amplification workflow to generate more uniformly barcoded beads. Next, we applied a custom hydrogel bead production process similar to a recently published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) to generate dissolvable beads, improving barcoded primer release and diffusion. We also optimized Drop-seq’s pooled template-switching reverse transcription strategy for application inside the cell/bead emulsion, and optimized the assay’s sensitivity by testing several different cDNA library preparation strategies. The combination of these adaptations resulted in a significantly increased sensitivity for HyDrop-RNA compared to inDrop and Drop-seq at no additional cost, and in a more user-friendly workflow. Additionally, the dissolution of the hydrogel beads stabilizes the cell/bead emulsion during linear amplification thermocycling. This change allowed us to implement to our knowledge the first open-source single-cell ATAC-seq in droplets using hydrogel beads. We applied both technologies to mouse cerebral cortex and generated single-cell ATAC-seq and single-cell RNA-seq data that is highly concordant with reference data.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of dissolvable hydrogel beads with barcodes for scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq</title><p>We generated barcoded hydrogel beads that can dissolve and release their embedded barcoded oligonucleotide. Polyacrylamide beads incorporating disulfide cross-linkers and short oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (PCR) priming sites were generated by droplet microfluidics similar to a recently published method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). A custom droplet microfluidic chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) was employed to produce beads of approximately 50 μm diameter. These hydrogel beads were then barcoded using a modified three-round split-pool linear amplification synthesis method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zilionis et al., 2017</xref>), resulting in 96 × 96 × 96 (884,736) barcode possibilities (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> – ‘Molecular sequence description of HyDrop bead barcoding’ for an in-depth visualization of the nucleic acid sequences in every step). The terminal sequence used in the final round of barcoding can be varied depending on the assay the beads will be used for (see Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). A sequence complementary to the Tn5 transposase adapter was used to capture tagmented chromatin fragments in scATAC-seq and a unique molecular identifier (UMI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kivioja et al., 2011</xref>)+ poly (dT) sequence was used to capture and count poly (A)+ mRNA in scRNA-seq (protocols described further). The barcoded beads were stored in a glycerol-based freezing buffer at –80°C in order to prevent loss of primers over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Technical overview of HyDrop barcoded bead production and quality control.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Split-pool process for barcoding of dissolvable hydrogel beads for single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq). Unbarcoded hydrogel beads are sequentially distributed over 96 wells, sub-barcoded using linear amplification polymerase chain reaction (PCR), repooled, and re-distributed two more times to generate 96 × 96 × 96 (884,736) possible barcode combinations.

These experiments showed that there was no significant loss of primers or mixing of barcodes throughout the barcoding process, and that the beads are uniform in size and primer content. Additional testing revealed that our modified linear amplification barcoding method produced more uniformly barcoded beads compared to the isothermal amplification protocol described in inDrop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, the disulfide moieties incorporated in both the bead’s polymer matrix and oligonucleotide linker are cleaved when exposed to reducing conditions, such as dithiothreitol (DTT). This chemical method of release is more user-friendly compared to the UV-mediated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zilionis et al., 2017</xref>) primer release as the beads do not have to be shielded from light. In addition to improved primer release compared to nondissolvable beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, Table S3), dissolvable beads did not disrupt the emulsion during the thermocycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). We hypothesize that this effect is due to the lower physical stress generated by the dissolved hydrogel as opposed to the solid hydrogel. This added benefit allowed us to implement scATAC-seq (see further) on HyDrop. Finally, by varying the concentration of the acrydite primer during bead synthesis, lower or higher amounts of cleavable barcoded primers could be generated. We found that when the concentration of acrydite primer incorporated in the hydrogel matrix was high (50 μM, similar to InDrop), excess unreacted barcodes could not be sufficiently filtered out in further downstream steps. These primers were then carried over to subsequent reactions, leading to random barcoding of free fragments after droplet merging, and subsequently to cell-mixed expression or chromatin accessibility profiles. The bead primer concentration with an optimal balance between sensitivity and library purity was found to be 12 µM for both scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Implementation and accuracy assessment of HyDrop-ATAC</title><p>We implemented a new open-source protocol for single-cell ATAC-seq using HyDrop’s dissolvable barcoded hydrogel beads.

We developed a custom preprocessing and mapping pipeline for HyDrop-ATAC data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dankort et al., 2009</xref>). After filtering the cell barcodes for a minimum transcription start sites (TSS) enrichment score of 7 and unique fragment count of 1000, we recovered 1353 cells from an input of 2000, and a median of 2705 unique fragments per cell. About 88% of all barcode reads were paired with the whitelist when one mismatch was allowed along the entire length of the 30 bp barcode. An additional 1.16% and 1.13% of HyDrop barcodes could be assigned to the whitelist when two and three mismatches were allowed, respectively. The remaining 9% of barcode sequences could not be identified and are most likely a result of frameshift due to incorporation errors in the synthetic oligonucleotide production process. Notably, only 39.7% of barcode reads could be matched with the whitelist in a public inDrop dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kalish et al., 2020</xref>), when one mismatch was allowed. When prefiltered cell barcode sequences were used as a whitelist for a public mouse retina Drop-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>), 49.5% of reads could be matched.

HyDrop-RNA employs a template switching oligo (TSO) reverse transcription technique (similar to Drop-seq), rather than an in vitro transcription/random hexamer priming workflow. This change simplifies and speeds up the protocol significantly with no reduction in sensitivity.</p><p>To improve the assay’s sensitivity, we interrogated the impact of several alterations to the protocol’s reaction chemistry by testing them on a 50:50 human-mouse (human melanoma, mouse melanoma) mixture. We first investigated the use of pooled exonuclease I treatment after reverse transcription to remove unused barcode primers. We reasoned that these unused barcoded primers could potentially prime transcripts during the subsequent bulk inverse-suppressive polymerase chain reaction (IS-PCR), leading to a loss of purity of transcripts associated with a given barcode. As evident from the increase in pure cells detected, we found that exonuclease I treatment indeed improved assay purity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then tested the implementation of a locked nucleic acid (LNA) in the TSO, as it has been shown to increase assay sensitivity due to increased stability of the TSO-cDNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Picelli et al., 2014</xref>). We also investigated the addition of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the in-droplet reverse transcription reaction. Both the addition of PEG as a molecular crowding agent and GTP as a stabilizer of the TSO complex has been shown to improve assay sensitivity in SMART-seq3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hagemann-Jensen et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, we wondered whether a second strand synthesis library construction approach could outperform the TSO/IS-PCR approach. In order to test this, we compared both alkaline hydrolysis and enzymatic treatment (RNAse H) to remove the RNA strand from the first strand product, and evaluated the performance of both Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase and Klenow (exo-) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hughes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stickels et al., 2021</xref>) fragment for second strand synthesis.

For example, we consider that benchmarking additional bead barcoding strategies, such as direct on-bead DNA synthesis or barcode ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delley and Abate, 2020</xref>) instead of linear amplification may further improve overall barcode quality. Ligation strategies would also allow the incorporation of oligonucleotide modifications in the barcode’s capture sequence, a possible necessity for adaptation of HyDrop to novel assays. For example, this change would permit HyDrop’s extension to protocols such as s3-ATAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mulqueen et al., 2021</xref>), which leverages the use of uracil bases and uracil-intolerant polymerases to double the amount of usable fragments generated by Tn5. The current 96 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kalish et al., 2020</xref> design could also be changed to 384 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Macosko et al., 2015</xref> (like inDrop) or even 768 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>. This two-step barcoding approach would result in shorter barcode sequences, allowing for cost-saving in sequencing and increased flexibility when pooling HyDrop libraries together with other library types such as 10× Genomics 3’ gene expression libraries. However, rescaling the barcodes in this manner would also necessitate the acquisition of a larger pool of sub-barcodes - from three 96 well plates to 8 and 16 plates respectively - and reduce the total barcode complexity from 884,736 to 147,456 and 589,824. Finally, one of the main challenges of implementing custom microfluidics systems is the considerable price of accurate stepper motor syringe pumps (~$2000 per independent channel) and the need for trained personnel. However, several simplified alternatives have recently emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Langer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2016</xref>), and we believe their application with HyDrop could further reduce the start-up costs and complexity of single-cell experiments.</p><p>We envision that HyDrop’s reduction in both cost and labor will accelerate the scaling of large-scale atlasing efforts and bring the benefits of single-cell sequencing to smaller projects. Additionally, HyDrop’s dissolvable bead synthesis and linear amplification barcoding toolkit could potentially be exploited to produce more complex beads incorporating multiple capture sequences, leading to implementation of single-cell (multi) omics assays such as the capture of accessible chromatin, (m)RNA, and surface epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stoeckius et al., 2017</xref>) or intracellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rivello et al., 2020</xref>) from single cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Microfluidic droplet generator manufacturing</title><p>Microfluidic droplet generators were produced using standard SU-8 lithography and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) lithography according to well-established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xia and Whitesides, 1998</xref>).

The SU-8 lithography is performed on a 4-inch silicon wafer using SU 8–2050 (Microchem) negative photoresist using UV aligner (EVG-620). As per manufacturers’ recommendation, spin coating of the wafer with SU8 was performed at 500 rpm (ramp 100 rpm/s) - 10 s and 2000 rpm (ramp: 300 rpm/s) - 30 s, to achieve a feature height of 70–80 μm. For preparing the PDMS chip, a mixture of PDMS monomer and cross-linker (Dow Corning SYLGARD 184) was prepared at a ratio of 10:1 and mixed thoroughly. The mixture was degassed in vacuum for 45 min and poured onto an SU-8 master template and baked at 80°C for 4 hr.

The mean grayscale intensity of the background was subtracted from the grayscale intensity at the center of each detected circle. The center intensity method was favored over a volumetric intensity measurement over the entire bead as slight differences in focus between images can affect intensity near the edge of the bead. For the 1/96 sub-barcode experiment, both fluorescence and brightfield images were taken of the same beads incubated with 1 out of 96 possible sub-barcodes. Total number of beads was counted manually from the brightfield image, while positive beads were counted using the image analysis tool from the fluorescence images.

Next, the VSN scATAC-seq pre-processing pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Waegeneer et al., 2021</xref>) was used to map the reads to the reference genome and generate a fragments file for downstream analysis. Here, barcode reads were compared to a whitelist (of 884,736 valid barcodes), and corrected, allowing for a maximum 1 bp mismatch. Uncorrected and corrected barcodes were appended to the fastq sequence identifier of the paired end ATAC-seq reads. Reads were mapped to the reference genome using bwa-mem with default settings, and the barcode information was added as tags to each read in the bam file. Duplicate-marking was performed using samtools markdup. In the final step of the pipeline, fragment files were generated using Sinto (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/timoast/sinto">https://github.com/timoast/sinto</ext-link>). For mixed species data, cells were filtered for a minimum of 1000 unique fragments and a minimum TSS enrichment of 7. For mouse cortex data, higher level analysis such as clustering and differential accessibility were performed using cisTopic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bravo González-Blas et al., 2019</xref>). In brief, cells were filtered for a minimum of 1000 unique fragments and a minimum TSS enrichment of 5. Fragments overlapping mouse candidate cis-regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2020</xref>) were counted, and the resulting matrix was filtered for potential cell doublets using a Scrublet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wolock et al., 2019</xref>) threshold of 0.35. Cells were Leiden clustered based on the cell-topic probability matrix generated by an initial cisTopic LDA incorporating 51 topics, at a resolution of 0.9 with 10 neighbours. A consensus peak set was generated from per-cluster peaks and used to recount fragments. Cells were filtered using the same filtering parameters and a new model with 50 topics was trained. Cells were again Leiden clustered based on the cell-topic probability matrix generated by the second LDA, at a resolution of 0.9 with 10 neighbours. Region accessibility was imputed based on binarized topic-region and cell-topic distributions. Gene activity was imputed based on Gini index-weighted imputed accessibility in a 10 kb up/downstream decaying window around each gene including promoters. Leiden clusters were annotated based on imputed gene accessibility around marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>).

Moreover, the authors exemplify the application of HyDrop to different contexts (e.g. low-input samples). For all these reasons, I think this is an outstanding candidate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific comments for the authors:</p><p>1) The introduction (line 38) contains the following statement &quot;Primers carried or released by the bead allow each individual cell’s mRNA to be indexed inside the droplet&quot;.</p><p>This is indeed the case for the inDrop method, however is incorrect for Drop-seq, where the RT reaction takes place <italic>after</italic> emulsion breaking.

To make this more clear to the reader, we have appended the absolute values of 1 standard deviation to both intensity and bead diameter in the supplementary data tables. For more details, the script, fluorescence images and resulting tables are available in GitHub: https://github.com/aertslab/hydrop_data_analysis/tree/main/manuscript_beadqc.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1—figure supplement 6c, the 6uM primer beads are concluded to be the best option for the HyDropRNA application.

However, we are almost certain that these small spots are dye precipitates or crystal aggregates arising from the primer suspension. We have also observed this while performing the same QC method on 10x genomics beads.

Would that be of interest to estimate the error rate of the linear amplification step?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this interesting suggestion. We have calculated the distribution of mismatches in the remaining 12% of unidentified barcode sequences up to a hamming distance of 3. This analysis showed that an additional 1.16% and 1.13% of all barcodes can be assigned to the whitelist when 2 and 3 mismatches are allowed. When hamming distance is increased to 4 and beyond, matching of a barcode to more than 1 whitelist entry becomes possible and obfuscates results. We believe that the remaining ~10% of unidentified barcode sequences are a result of incorporation errors in the oligonucleotide production process. Importantly, in order to limit cost of the barcode plates we opted for standard desalting purification when purchasing our barcode oligonucleotides. Here, the error in base incorporation is about: 1 in 1000 bases (https://eu.idtdna.com/pages/support/faqs/why-does-my-sequence-data-have-errors) which is far more frequent than the reported error rate of the polymerase we use (Kapa HiFi has an error rate of around 1 in 3.6M bases, https://rochesequencingstore.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/KAPA-HiFi-PCRKit_KR0368-%E2%80%93-v13.19.pdf) and results in a frame shift. These frameshifted barcodes produce a barcode read that cannot be identified using simple hamming distance based error correction.</p><p>We have added the following text to the manuscript:</p><p>“An additional 1.16% and 1.13% of HyDrop barcodes could be assigned to the whitelist when 2 and 3 mismatches were allowed respectively. The remaining 9% of barcodes sequences could not be identified and are most likely a result of frame-shift due to incorporation errors in the synthetic oligonucleotide production process. Notably, only 39.7% of barcode reads could be matched with the whitelist in a public inDrop dataset (3), when 1 mismatch was allowed. When pre-filtered cell barcode sequences were used as a whitelist for a public mouse retina Drop-seq dataset (2), 49.5% of reads could be matched.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) On the conclusion stated on line 116 on the optimal bead primer concentration: it seems that adding half the concentration of primer (6 instead of 12 uM) leads to 10x less reads. Which concentration would they in the end advice and in which context? (not mentioned clearly).</p></disp-quote><p>This was indeed not mentioned strongly enough. We are continuously evaluating the optimal concentration of primers needed for bead synthesis of different HyDrop assays. Based on our experience we have found that the 12 μm HyDrop beads provide the most sensitive performance on both the HyDrop assays. Therefore, we used (and continue to use) 12 µM primer concentration to produce barcoded hydrogel beads for both HyDrop-RNA and HyDrop-ATAC experiments.</p><p>We have clarified line 116 to:</p><p>“The bead primer concentration with an optimal balance between assay sensitivity and library purity was found to be 12 µM for both scATACseq and scRNA-seq (Figure 1 – Figure supp. 6).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Line 258: This sentence is confusing. Some points they elaborate on (use og GTP/PEG for molecular crowding) others they just refer to other papers (use of LNA). Maybe cut into different sentences with explanation and referral to supplemental figure? The overall conclusion can still be linked to the main figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that this part of the manuscript was not clearly written. We have rewritten the paragraph to:</p><p>“To improve the assay’s sensitivity, we interrogated the impact of several alterations to the protocol’s reaction chemistry by testing them on a 50:50 human-mouse (human melanoma, mouse melanoma) mixture. We first investigated the use of pooled exonuclease I treatment after reverse transcription to remove unused barcode primers. We reasoned that these unused barcoded primers could potentially prime transcripts during the subsequent bulk ISPCR, leading to a loss of purity of transcripts associated with a given barcode. As evident from the increase in pure cells detected, we found that exonuclease I treatment indeed improved assay purity (Figure supp. 1). We then tested the implementation of a locked nucleic acid (LNA) in the TSO, as it has been shown to increase assay sensitivity due to increased hybridization stability of the TSO-cDNA dimer (30). We also investigated the addition of GTP/PEG to the in-droplet reverse transcription reaction. Both the addition of PEG as a molecular crowding agent and GTP have been shown to improve assay sensitivity in SMART-seq3 (31). Finally, we wondered whether a second strand synthesis library construction approach could outperform the TSO/ISPCR approach. In order to test this, we compared both alkaline hydrolysis and enzymatic treatment (RNAse H) to remove the RNA strand from the first strand product, and evaluated the performance of both Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase and Klenow (exo-) fragment for second strand synthesis (32,33). We found that the classical TSO and ISPCR protocol supplemented with GTP/PEG performed best, yielding a median of 2,110 UMIs and 1,325 genes per cell with a species-purity of 90.1% (Figure 8a, Figure 8 – Figure supp. 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 8c, It seems from the methods section that the filtering of the InDrop and Drop-seq data is not the same? What happens you perform the same filtering as with your HyDrop analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for commenting on this filtering issue. In our original analysis, the sensitivities of Drop-seq and inDrop were deduced from the expression matrices provided as supplementary material to the respective publications, and these contained only the cells as filtered by the authors. In the Macosko et al., (Drop-seq) manuscript, these cells were selected based on visual detection of a drop in the UMI barcode rank plot. In the Kalish et al., (inDrop) manuscript, an arbitrary filter of barcodes containing &gt; 500 UMIs was used. As opposed to opting for manual filtering methods, HyDrop employs STARsolo’s automated cell filtering algorithm (identical to 10X Genomics cellranger’s cell filtering algorithm) which is adaptive to the distribution of UMIs in cell barcodes. We believe that this automated filter is the best approach for HyDrop, as it is independent of human judgment, matches our expected cell recovery, and clearly distinguishes background from true cells in the barcode rank plots.</p><p>We decided to re-analyze the published InDrop and Drop-seq datasets starting from the raw fastq files, using STARsolo for cell filtering. Surprisingly, both for the inDrop and Drop-seq data, the STARsolo filtering method yielded very different results of cell filtering compared to the reported results. STARsolo identified only 29k cells in the</p><p>Drop-seq’s 49k cells dataset, and 21k in inDrop’s 31k cells dataset. This discrepancy likely results from the lack of a clear separation between cells and non-cells in inDrop and Drop-seq’s UMI/barcode-rank, which makes it difficult for STARsolo to filter true cells from background. If we were to reduce the number of cells in the inDrop and Dropseq samples by such large margins, then the fraction of raw reads that end up as unique transcript counts in barcodes identified as cells, would fall too low.</p><p>As an alternative comparison of the three data sets, we decided to retain the number of cells reported in the Macosko et al., manuscript and sampled the sequencing data to HyDrop’s depth (52738 reads/cell). For the inDrop data, this constraint led to a reduction of the number of cells from 31293 to 27094 and resulted in a minimum UMI cutoff of 577 instead of the original 500 for the Kalish et al., inDrop data. As a result, the dataset’s median genes/UMIs increased from 1097/1521 to 1321/1920. Note that we also allowed 1 mismatch in Drop-seq’s barcodes (like with inDrop and HyDrop), a step which is not performed in the original Drop-seq analysis. This analysis is transparently reported step-by-step in our GitHub repository at: https://github.com/aertslab/hydrop_data_analysis/tree/main/HyDropRNA_publicdata_comparison.</p><p>We have also adjusted the figure and adapted the main text as following:</p><p>“We then used HyDrop-RNA to generate 9,508 single nuclei transcriptomes from snap-frozen mouse cortex in a single experiment. At a sequencing saturation of approximately 60% duplicates and with 86% of reads mapping to genome and 55% of reads mapping to transcriptome, we achieve a median of 3,389 UMIs and 1,658 genes per cell before, and 3,404 UMIs and 1,662 genes per cell after doublet filtering (Figure 8c), compared to the median of 1,920 UMIs and 1,321 genes detected by inDrop snRNA-seq on mouse auditory cortex neurons (3) and the median of 1,071 UMIs and 763 genes reported by Drop-seq on mouse retina neurons (2). Both datasets also exhibited a lower read alignment efficiency, with Drop-seq mapping 52%/21%, and inDrop mapping 48%/28% of reads to the mouse genome/transcriptome. Importantly, HyDrop’s “sequencing efficiency” is higher than both inDrop and Drop-seq’s: 7.44% of HyDrop’s sequenced reads end up as mapped transcripts with a unique molecular identifier, whereas this metric is 3.24% for the inDrop dataset and 4.46% for the Drop-seq dataset (Figure 8 —figure supplement 2). 10x Chromium v2 gene expression reference data reports a median number of genes of 775-2,679 and a median number of UMIs of 1,127-6,570 on E18 and adult mouse brain nuclei (see methods).”.</p><p>We also added the following to the methods section:</p><p>“Raw inDrop (SRR10545068 to SRR10545079) and Drop-seq (SRR1853178 to SRR1853184) sequencing data was downloaded from SRA. Data was sampled to the HyDrop-RNA mouse cortex sample sequencing depth (52738 reads per cell) and mapped to mouse reference genome using STARsolo, allowing 1 mismatch in the cell barcodes (like in our HyDrop-RNA and HyDrop-ATAC analyses).

Were the discussed neuronal cell populations also detected in the in-house generated Drop-seq experiments? It would be good to include a mention/discussion of this in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous analysis of these drop-seq experiments did not yield such a granularity in detected cell types, separating mostly glia and neurons. We believe that this difference can be explained partially due to the lower data quality, but mostly due to the difference in sample: the HyDrop runs were performed on specifically FAC-sorted neuronal populations, whereas the Drop-seq runs were performed on unsorted whole brain. We clarified in the text that the cell populations found by HyDrop after FAC sorting a specific subset are not expected to be found in the Drop-seq whole-brain dataset as follows:</p><p>“In comparison, in-house Drop-seq performed on fly brain neurons the entire fly brain recovered a median of 579 UMIs and 289 genes per cell at a deeper sequencing saturation (11).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
