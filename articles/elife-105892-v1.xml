their failure in disease control. Therefore, developing fungicides with novel action mechanisms is the most effective measure to manage resistance. Quinofumelin, a novel quinoline fungicide, exhibits exceptional antifungal activity against phytopathogens. However, there is currently no available information on its mechanism of action. Here, we used transcriptome and metabolome analysis to observe a co-enrichment pattern of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) within pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (PBP), identifying down-regulation of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). Exogenous uridine monophosphate (UMP), uridine, or uracil (metabolites in PBP) successfully restored quinofumelin-induced inhibition of mycelial growth in <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> and <italic>Fusarium asiaticum</italic>. Additionally, the deletion of <italic>FgDHODHII</italic> was determined to be lethal; however, mycelial growth of ΔFgDHODHII mutants could be restored by adding UMP, uridine, or uracil. These findings indicate that the deficiencies in <italic>FgDHODHII</italic> are functionally equivalent to complete inhibition of its activity by quinofumelin. Finally, molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and microscale thermophoresis (MST) results strongly support the precise interaction between quinofumelin and FgDHODHII. Collectively, these findings provide compelling evidence for the involvement of de novo uracil biosynthesis as a mechanism of action for quinofumelin while identifying FgDHODHII as its specific target.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic></kwd><kwd>quinofumelin</kwd><kwd>fungicide target</kwd><kwd>dihydroorotate dehydrogenase</kwd><kwd>action mechanism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFD1400100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duan</surname><given-names>Yabing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32072448</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Mingguo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The target of quinofumelin is DHODH in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Agrochemical fungicides have a history spanning over 3000 years in the control of plant diseases, and have undergone a development process from traditional protective fungicides with multiple action sites to modern selective fungicides with single action site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lamberth, 2022</xref>). The introduction of the first fully systemic seed treatment agent (carboxin, a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor) in 1966 and the launch of the first broad-spectrum foliar systemic fungicide (benomyl, a tubulin polymerization inhibitor) in 1968 represent significant milestones in the advancement of modern selective fungicides with single action site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lamberth et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Morton and Staub, 2008</xref>). Owing to their exceptional selectivity, potent activity, specific target site, and low toxicity, modern selective fungicides have gained widespread acceptance and witnessed an increasing market share year after year. However, like every coin has two sides, these types of fungicides encounter substantial challenges related to serious resistance issues when deployed in agricultural fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lucas et al., 2015</xref>). Numerous reports have been published on plant pathogens developing resistance to modern selective fungicides, which often result in failures or reductions in the effectiveness of chemical control against plant diseases and lead to decreased crop yields and quality (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.frac.info">https://www.frac.info</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">King et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mao et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, it is crucial to expedite the development of new-generation selective fungicides with innovative modes of action. Based on a single fungicide target, numerous modern selective fungicides can be developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Umetsu and Shirai, 2020</xref>). For instance, 24 commercialized available fungicides have been created so far based on the respiratory chain complex II as the target. Similarly, another 20 commercialized fungicides have been developed targeting the respiratory chain complex III. Additionally, there are already 37 commercialized fungicides that specifically target the fungicide target C14-demethylase in ergosterol biosynthesis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.frac.info">https://www.frac.info</ext-link>). However, identifying specific targets that efficiently control plant pathogens while ensuring safety for non-target organisms remains a significant challenge. The rate of discovery for new targets lags far behind current demands.</p><p>According to the latest information released by the Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC), over 30 fungicide selective targets have been identified and acknowledged in the field of fungicide biological research spanning more than 130 years. Currently, these targets have been identified based on the successful development of fungicides and are all related proteins that are essential for pathogen growth or pathogenicity. Extensive identification and functional analysis of essential genes for growth or pathogenicity in plant pathogens have been achieved with rapid advancements in molecular biology techniques; however, there is no precedent for successfully developing commercialized fungicides targeting genes involved in growth or pathogenicity. The creation of highly active modern selective fungicides currently relies on the structural characteristics of existing targets and is accomplished through technologies such as AI drug discovery and design (AIDD) and computer-aided drug design (CADD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). The biological functions of drug targets are highly conserved, although variations may occur at critical amino acid sites during genetic evolution. Therefore, it is crucial to explore drug targets and analyze their structural characteristics in order to develop novel fungicides with enhanced activity and selectivity. Recently, the Fungicide Biology group from Nanjing Agricultural University proposed a new concept for targeting pesticides based on the principles of targeted drugs in the medicine field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhong et al., 2021</xref>). The objective is to create specialized targeted pesticides that exhibit higher activity, greater selectivity, stronger specialization, lower toxicity, and environmental friendliness by leveraging the structural characteristics of pesticide targets. This approach aims to provide essential technical support for scientifically controlling crop diseases.</p><p>Quinofumelin (CAS 861647-84-9) is a novel quinoline fungicide developed by Mitsui Chemicals Co., Ltd. Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ito et al., 2023</xref>). Due to their significant bioactivity, quinoline compounds and their derivatives have found extensive applications in medicine and pesticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wheeler et al., 2003</xref>). In our previous study, quinofumelin not only exhibited excellent antifungal activity against the mycelial growth and spore germination of <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, but also inhibited the biosynthesis of deoxynivalenol (DON) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xiu et al., 2021</xref>). In previous studies, quinofumelin was identified as a specific inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase class II (DHODHII) in <italic>Pyricularia oryzae,</italic> suppressing fungal growth by blocking the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Higashimura et al., 2022</xref>). Gene disruption of <italic>DHODHII</italic> (<italic>PoPYR4</italic>) further confirmed its critical role in fungal pathogenicity and validated it as the action target site of quinofumelin. However, previous investigations did not report any detailed methodologies for target identification. Additionally, there was a lack of information regarding the precise interaction between quinofumelin and DHODHII. In this study, we used transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to investigate the co-enrichment patterns of DEGs and (DAMs). This approach enabled the identification of potential metabolic pathways were identified. Ultimately, the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway was identified as the target. Therefore, this study unveils that the mechanism of action of quinofumelin involves de novo synthesis of uracil, thereby identifying DHODH as its specific target. As a selective fungicidal target, DHODH offers a valuable resource for the design and development of novel fungicides.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptomic analysis of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> as affected by quinofumelin</title><p>RNA-seq experiments have emerged as the standard approach for quantifying and comparing gene expression levels across a wide range of species and conditions, providing critical insights into cellular phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pertea et al., 2016</xref>).

Among these findings, there were identified as up-regulated for a count of 97 genes while down-regulation was observed in case of another set comprising around 137 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A graphical representation was employed to depict the statistical distribution pattern exhibited by these DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To gain deeper insights into gene functionalities, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed on these DEGs. The results showed that they are notably enriched in seventeen distinct GO terms spanning across two major categories: eleven molecular functions along with six processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Furthermore, the enrichment analysis highlighted significant associations with various functional attributes, including transition metal ion binding, oxidoreductase activity, modified amino acid binding, amide binding, monooxygenase activity, and heme binding. Moreover, the enriched biological processes are primarily involved in transcriptional regulation driven by nucleic-enabled mechanisms, as well as monocarboxylic acid metabolism and RNA biosynthesis. Additionally, the KEGG enrichment analysis identified specific pathways associated with thiamine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, amino acid sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, pantothenic acid and CoA biosynthesis, as well as nucleotide sugar production compound synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Moreover, the quality control (QC) samples exhibited highly concentrated results, indicating excellent instrument stability and remarkable data repeatability. Furthermore, a distinct separation between groups was observed, particularly prominent in the positive ion mode, indicating significant variations in metabolites among different groups that warrant further investigation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>).

Based on these newly discovered targets, over 200 modern selective fungicides have been developed. Consequently, the identification of novel targets for fungicides poses a significantly greater challenge compared to the development of new fungicides. Currently, modern selective fungicides with single action sites are widely applied in agricultural practices for crop disease management. However, these specific types of fungicides encounter substantial obstacles associated with resistance issues when deployed in agricultural fields. Numerous studies have extensively documented cases of plant pathogens developing resistance to modern selective fungicides, resulting in failures or reductions in their efficacy against plant diseases and subsequently leading to decreased crop yields and quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">King et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mao et al., 2024</xref>).

This poses a formidable challenge for the control of crop gray mold disease caused by <italic>B. cinerea</italic>. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of new fungicides with novel mechanisms of action to effectively manage multiple resistance.</p><p>The novel quinoline, quinofumelin, developed by Mitsui Chemicals Co., Ltd. Japan, has demonstrated remarkable antifungal activity against plant pathogens such as <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xiu et al., 2021</xref>). Quinofumelin has been identified as an agrochemical fungicide targeting DHODHII in <italic>Pyricularia oryzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Higashimura et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, ipflufenoquin, another agrochemical fungicide with an analogous mechanism of action to quinofumelin, has been reported to target DHODH in <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van Rhijn et al., 2024</xref>). To elucidate the mode of action of quinofumelin against <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, we conducted a comprehensive investigation using integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. The transcriptome data revealed that DEGs were involved in ‘tryptophan metabolism’ and ‘amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism.’ Furthermore, the metabolome data identified DAMs enriched in ‘nucleotide metabolism’ and ‘amino acid metabolism.’ Interestingly, we observed a co-enrichment of DEGs and DAMs in the pyrimidine metabolism pathway. Specifically, we identified a down-regulation of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) in the experimental groups, which impeded the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate. Consequently, this inhibition led to decreased biosynthesis of downstream metabolites orotidine-5P and uracil. Therefore, we conducted an experiment using <italic>F. graminearum</italic> standard strain PH-1 to quantify mycelial growth by supplementing exogenous uracil, which is the end product of the uracil biosynthesis pathway. This was performed in the presence of complete inhibition of mycelial growth caused by quinofumelin. Surprisingly, the addition of exogenous uracil restored the inhibited mycelial growth induced by quinofumelin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Meanwhile, similar results were successfully verified with four other <italic>F. graminearum</italic> strains and five <italic>F. asiaticum</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on our depicted pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), we also supplemented other intermediate products, such as dihydroorotate, orotate, UMP, and uridine, externally. Except for dihydroorotate and orotate, supplementation of exogenous UMP and uridine effectively restored mycelial growth inhibited by quinofumelin as well. These findings strongly support that quinofumelin acts through modulation of the uracil biosynthesis pathway. Based on these findings and in conjunction with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Higashimura et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van Rhijn et al., 2024</xref>), these agrochemical fungicides are categorized under FRAC group 52. This classification targets dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) during the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, as outlined by the Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.frac.info">https://www.frac.info</ext-link>). As a key enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, DHODH has previously been investigated as a potential target for inhibiting infectious organisms and as an antitumor agent in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mao et al., 2021</xref>). Inhibiting DHODH can effectively impede the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and glycoproteins, thereby regulating aberrant cell metabolism and proliferation to ultimately achieve therapeutic objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boukalova et al., 2020</xref>). Within mammalian cells, DHODH is closely associated with the mitochondrial membrane and plays a pivotal role in the respiratory chain through its interaction with ubiquinone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen and Jones, 1976</xref>). Here, using amino acid sequences from <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> DHODHII as a reference query, we have identified FgDHODHII (FGSG_09678), a gene comprising of 1419 bp without any introns, which encodes 472 amino acids in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. FgDHODHII possesses a typical DHOD-2 like domain (NCBI: cd04738) and belongs to class 2 DHODs. Class 2 DHODHs are membrane-bound enzymes, whereas class 1 enzymes are located in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nørager et al., 2002</xref>). The DHODH enzyme catalyzes a unique redox reaction in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dorasamy et al., 2017</xref>). The DHOD-2-like domain can bind orotate and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), facilitating the oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate and the reduction of the FMN cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alves et al., 2015</xref>). Based on the aforementioned findings, we have concluded that DHODHII functions as the target of action for quinofumelin against <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. Consequently, we performed a protoplast transformation assay to delete FgDHODHII in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and further validate the precise target of action for quinofumelin. Typically, most fungicide targets are either lethal genes or essential pathogenic genes. Therefore, it is plausible that the inactivation of FgDHODHII may be lethal. In our genetic transformation experiment, exogenous uridine was supplemented to successfully obtain deletion mutants of the FgDHODHII gene. Fortunately, two ΔFgDHODHII mutants were successfully obtained. These mutants exhibited an inability to grow on PDA or CZA medium; however, mycelial growth was fully restored upon addition of uridine to the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Additionally, exogenous supplementation of UMP or uracil effectively restored mycelial growth. However, the supplementation of dihydroorotate to the medium did not alleviate the growth defect observed in ΔFgDHODHII mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Furthermore, mycelial growth in two ΔFgDHODHII mutants was restored by exogenously adding UMP, uracil or uridine under quinofumelin treatments. These findings indicate that the defects of FgDHODHII are functionally equivalent to complete inhibition of its activity by quinofumelin and further confirm that the mechanism of action for quinofumelin involves de novo synthesis of uracil while identifying FgDHODHII as its specific target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model of the pyrimidine pathway that quinofumelin attacks.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-105892-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Molecular docking is a computational procedure employed to predict the optimal binding orientation of a ligand with its macromolecular target (receptor), thereby forming a stable complex.

In this study, we conducted molecular docking analysis between quinofumelin and the target protein FgDHODHII. The docking results unveiled a robust affinity between FgDHODHII and quinofumelin.

In this study, we used SPR technology to measure the binding energy and kinetics between FgDHODHII and quinofumelin. The binding kinetics of FgDHODHII and quinofumelin demonstrated fast-binding and fast-dissociation modes. Soluble FgDHODHII exhibited an ideal affinity (Kd) of 6.606 × 10<sup>–6</sup> M with quinofumelin, falling within the suitable range of 10<sup>–3</sup> M to 10<sup>–6</sup> M for biomacromolecule-small molecule interactions. Furthermore, the binding affinity between FgDHODHII and quinofumelin was confirmed by a microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay. Therefore, these data strongly support the precise interaction between quinofumelin and its target protein FgDHODHII. This newly discovered selective target for antimicrobial agents offers a valuable resource for the design and development of targeted pesticides.</p><p>Unlike many other dehydrogenases that require NAD or NADP as an electron acceptor, DHODH transfers electrons to ubiquinone, which then transfers electrons into respiratory complex III and eventually to oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang and Hekimi, 2016</xref>). Thus, the production of orotate in pyrimidine biosynthesis is coupled with the electron transport system and energy production, exerting additional control over nucleotide synthesis and ensuring its coupling to cellular energy metabolism. In the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, DHODHII regulates the conversion from dihydroorotate to orotate. Our findings demonstrated that DHODHII is a target of action for quinofumelin. A previous study reported that exogenous orotate but not exogenous dihydroorotate recovered mycelial growth inhibited by quinofumelin, indicating that quinofumelin inhibits the formation of orotate in the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Higashimura et al., 2022</xref>). However, we observed that the supplementation of orotate to the medium did not alleviate the growth defect of ΔFgDHODHII mutants. Considering the disparity in mycelial growth inhibition between <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and other fungi, our data suggest that a nonclassical two-site ping-pong mechanism is the most suitable model for DHODH as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1992</xref>). In the classical ping-pong mechanism, DHODH interacts with dihydroorotate and ubiquinol in an identical conformation, while orotate and ubiquinone combine with an alternative form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cleland, 1963</xref>). However, similar to brequinar sodium inhibiting the activity of DHODH isolated from mammalian sources, FgDHODHII may follow a nonclassical, two-site ping-pong mechanism. In this non-classical ping-pong mechanism, the two substrates may not share chemical resemblance and, therefore, do not bind to a single binding site but likely bind to two adjacent sites that facilitate reactant transfer. The precise nature of the interaction between quinofumelin and FgDHODHII may require further elucidation studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains, culture conditions, and fungicides</title><p><italic>F. graminearum</italic> sensitive strain PH-1 and 9 wild-type strains (<italic>F. graminearum</italic> and <italic>F. asiaticum</italic>), and the PH-1 deletion mutants ΔFgDHODHII were maintained in the Fungicide Biology Laboratory, Nanjing Agricultural University.</p><p>The media used in this study included potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium, Yeast extract peptone dextrose (YEPD) medium, Czapek Solution Agar (CZA) medium, and LB medium.</p><p>Chemical-grade quinofumelin (Mitsui Agricultural Chemical Company of Japan) was prepared with dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> μg/mL and stored at 4°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Transcriptomic assay of mycelial growth in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> as affected by quinofumelin</title><p>A total of 20 mL of YEPD medium containing 1 mL of conidia suspension (1 × 10<sup>5</sup> conidia/mL) was incubated with shaking (175 rpm/min) at 25°C.

Two sets of data were generated between quinofumelin and no treatment group, and differentially abundant transcripts and metabolites were identified, suggesting a potential role of pyrimidine biosynthesis. Upon studying the genetic mutants of the uridine/uracil biosynthesis pathway with quinofumelin treatment and metabolite supplementation, combining in vitro biochemical assay of quinofumelin and F.graminearum dihydroorotate dehydrogenase protein, the authors identified that quinofumelin inhibits the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase and blocks downstream metabolite biosynthesis, limiting fungal metabolism and growth.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Omics datasets were leveraged to understand the physiological impact of quinofumelin, showing the intracellular impact of the fungicide.

The authors further focused on uridine/uracil biosynthesis pathway, considering the significant up- and down-regulation observed in final metabolites and some of the genes in the pathways.

Under no treatment with quinofumelin, mycelial growth remains normal and does not require restoration. In the presence of quinofumelin treatment, the supplementation of downstream metabolites in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway can restore mycelial growth that is inhibited by quinofumelin. The wild-type control group is illustrated in Figure 4. Figure 5b depicts the phenotypes of the deletion mutants. With respect to the relationship among quinofumelin, FgDHODHII, and other metabolites, quinofumelin specifically targets the key enzyme FgDHODHII in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, disrupting the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate, which consequently inhibits the synthesis downstream metabolites including uracil. In our previous study, quinofumelin not only exhibited excellent antifungal activity against the mycelial growth and spore germination of <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, but also inhibited the biosynthesis of deoxynivalenol (DON).

The results indicate that the number of reduced metabolites significantly exceeds the number of increased metabolites upon quinofumelin treatment. Mycelial growth is markedly inhibited under quinofumelin exposure. Prior to conducting omics studies, we performed a series of physiological and biochemical experiments (refer to Qian Xiu's dissertation <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paper.njau.edu.cn/openfile?dbid=72&amp;objid=50_49_57_56_49_49&amp;flag=free">https://paper.njau.edu.cn/openfile?dbid=72&amp;objid=50_49_57_56_49_49&amp;flag=free</ext-link>). Upon quinofumelin treatment, the number of down-regulated metabolites notably surpasses that of up-regulated metabolites compared to the control group. Based on the findings from the down-regulated metabolites, we conducted experiments by exogenously supplementing these metabolites under quinofumelin treatment to investigate whether mycelial growth could be restored. The results revealed that only the exogenous addition of uracil can restore mycelial growth impaired by quinofumelin.</p><p>Quinofumelin exhibits an excellent antifungal activity against <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. At a concentration of 1 μg/mL, quinofumelin inhibits mycelial growth by up to 90%. This inhibitory effect indicates that life activities of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> are significantly disrupted by quinofumelin. Consequently, there is a marked difference in down- and up-regulated metabolites between quinofumelin-treated group and untreated control group. The detailed results were presented in Figures 1 and 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Figure 2e:</p><p>This is a good analysis.

The inhibition of DHODH by quinofumelin results in the accumulation of dihydroorotate and the depletion of the downstream metabolites, including UMP, uridine and uracil. Consequently, downstream metabolites were considered as positive controls, while upstream metabolite dihydroorotate served as a negative control. This design further demonstrates DHODH as action target of quinofumelin against <italic>F. graminearum</italic>.

In the presence of quinofumelin treatment, the supplementation of downstream metabolites in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway can restore mycelial growth that is inhibited by quinofumelin. The wild-type control group is illustrated in Figure 4. Figure 5b depicts the phenotypes of the deletion mutants. With respect to the relationship among quinofumelin, FgDHODHII, and other metabolites, quinofumelin specifically targets the key enzyme FgDHODHII in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, disrupting the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate, which consequently inhibits the synthesis downstream metabolites including uracil.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(22) Figure 6b:</p><p>Lacking positive and negative controls (known binder and non-binder).

The results showed that these inhibitors exhibited no significant inhibitory effects against the strain PH-1. Therefore, we lacked an effective chemical for use as a positive control in subsequent experiments. Biacore experiments offers detailed insights into molecular interactions between quinofumelin and DHODHII. As shown in Figure 6b, the left panel illustrates the time-dependent kinetic curve of quinofumelin binding to DHODHII. Within the first 60 s after quinofumelin was introduced onto the DHODHII surface, it bound to the immobilized DHODHII on the chip surface, with the response value increasing proportionally to the quinofumelin concentration. Following cessation of the injection at 60 s, quinofumelin spontaneously dissociated from the DHODHII surface, leading to a corresponding decrease in the response value. The data fitting curve presented on the right panel indicates that the affinity constant KD of quinofumelin for DHODHII is 6.606×10-6 M, which falls within the typical range of KD values (10-3 ~ 10-6 M) for protein-small molecule interaction patterns. A lower KD value indicates a stronger affinity; thus, quinofumelin exhibits strong binding affinity towards DHODHII.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The authors should add information about the other molecule within this class, ipflufenoquin, and what is known about it.
