Several odor plume properties change with distance from the odor source, providing potential navigational cues to searching animals. Here, we focus on odor intermittency, a temporal odor plume property that measures the fraction of time odor is above a threshold at a given point within the plume and decreases with increasing distance from the odor source. We sought to determine if mice can use changes in intermittency to locate an odor source. To do so, we trained mice on an intermittency discrimination task. We establish that mice can discriminate odor plume samples of low and high intermittency and that the neural responses in the olfactory bulb can account for task performance and support intermittency encoding. Modulation of sniffing, a behavioral parameter that is highly dynamic during odor-guided navigation, affects both behavioral outcome on the intermittency discrimination task and neural representation of intermittency. Together, this work demonstrates that intermittency is an odor plume property that can inform olfactory search and more broadly supports the notion that mammalian odor-based navigation can be guided by temporal odor plume properties.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>navigation</kwd><kwd>plume</kwd><kwd>intermittency</kwd><kwd>olfactory bulb</kwd><kwd>sniffing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF/CIHR/DFG/FRQ/UKRI-MRC Next Generation Networks for Neuroscience Program (Award #2014217)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gumaste</surname><given-names>Ankita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRSA 1F31DC018708</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gumaste</surname><given-names>Ankita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BRAIN 1555880</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gumaste</surname><given-names>Ankita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BRAIN 1555862</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>True</surname><given-names>Aaron C</given-names></name><name><surname>Crimaldi</surname><given-names>John P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC014723</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verhagen</surname><given-names>Justus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mice are able to discriminate plume intermittency, which may be used for odor-guided navigation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>When navigating an airborne odor landscape, animals interact with highly dynamic and diverse odor structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fackrell and Robins, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crimaldi and Koseff, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crimaldi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Connor et al., 2018</xref>). Variations of odor plume parameters can, for example, create plumes with diffusive odor signals and little fluctuation, as well as plumes where odor is pulled into filaments (‘odor whiffs’) that are interleaved with layers of odor-free air. Despite these complex odor environments, many animals are adept at locating odor sources within airborne plumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vickers, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhattacharyya and Bhalla, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gire et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gumaste et al., 2020</xref>). Odor plume characteristics can be measured using plume statistics such as concentration distribution, odor whiff frequency, and odor intermittency, here defined as the fraction of time odor is present at a sampled point within odor plume space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yee et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Justus et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Connor et al., 2018</xref>). Statistical properties of these structures may provide animals with critical information to aid odor source localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reddy et al., 2022</xref>). Although we have a growing understanding of the quantification of features of these odor plumes, the plume properties that mammals use to navigate to an odor source remain largely unknown. Several temporal properties of odor plumes change with distance from the odor source and therefore serve as candidate properties that may be used for odor-guided navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balkovsky and Shraiman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vergassola et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmuker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Michaelis et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Changes in odor plume temporal properties affect both insect and rodent navigation strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reddy et al., 2022</xref>). One such temporal property is odor intermittency, which we focus on in the present study. Moths fly faster and straighter upwind within odor plumes with lower odor plume intermittency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mafra-Neto and Cardé, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vickers and Baker, 1994</xref>). In addition, the frequency and duration of time between odor whiffs, both of which can influence intermittency, affect pausing and orienting behavior of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Álvarez-Salvado et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Demir et al., 2020</xref>). Further probing into this behavior through mathematical models suggests that combining odor intermittency sensing along with detection of other temporal odor plume properties enhances odor source localization in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jayaram et al., 2022</xref>). While the effect of intermittency on rodent odor-based navigation remains yet to be studied, recent studies have highlighted that rodent navigation strategies also depend on temporal properties of odor plumes, such as variance of odor whiffs and number of odor whiff encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhattacharyya and Bhalla, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gumaste et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tariq et al., 2021</xref>). Together this indicates the contribution of temporal odor plume features to navigation within an airborne odor plume.</p><p>Acquisition of odor information by mammals navigating within complex odor environments can be controlled through active sampling in the form of sniffing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wesson et al., 2009</xref>). Rodent sniffing behavior is highly dynamic during laboratory odor-guided tasks, suggesting that animals actively change their sampling strategies to adjust the odor information they process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Uchida and Mainen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kepecs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verhagen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wesson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wesson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reisert et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, during odor plume navigation, sniff frequency is modulated with changes in olfactory search phases, such as initial investigation and odor-approaching phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhattacharyya and Bhalla, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Findley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reddy et al., 2022</xref>). This indicates that even in more naturalistic odor environments, rodent active sampling is highly modulated. Inhalation patterns also affect neural representation of odor stimuli and early olfactory processing within the olfactory bulb. Sniffing influences how odors travel in the epithelium and reach odorant receptors on olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), influencing resulting neural responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mainland and Sobel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scott, 2006</xref>). Sustained high-frequency sniffing diversifies and attenuates olfactory bulb neural responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verhagen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Díaz-Quesada et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jordan et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eiting and Wachowiak, 2020</xref>), as well as elicits changes in olfactory bulb output cells, mitral and tufted cells (M/T cells), firing rate, and response latencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carey and Wachowiak, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jordan et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shusterman et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, sniffing has diverse, but quantifiable effects on early olfactory processing. The intersection between odor environment properties and the modulation of active sampling patterns may inform neural representations of temporal odor plume properties while animals are navigating.</p><p>The rodent olfactory system has access to temporal information that may aide in localizing odor sources. Fluctuating odor input can be reliably represented by olfactory bulb glomeruli. In both rats and mice, M/T cells’ responses correlate with highly dynamic odor input and the correlation strength depends on the stimulus odor plume statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lewis et al., 2021</xref>). This dependence of glomerular response properties on odor plume statistics provides further reason to explore which temporal odor plume properties can be perceptually discriminated and therefore may inform navigation. Behaviorally, mice can discriminate changes in temporal properties of odors such as odor duration and odor whiff frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rebello et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackels et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, glomerular responses of OSNs and M/Ts can support this temporal discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackels et al., 2021</xref>). Based on olfactory bulb response properties, behavioral discrimination abilities, and dependence of behavioral strategies on odor plume statistics, we hypothesize that mice can use temporal odor plume properties for odor-guided navigation.</p><p>Here, we focus on the temporal property of odor intermittency and sought to investigate if mice can use odor intermittency for odor plume navigation. We use a combination of behavioral training and simultaneous calcium imaging of the dorsal olfactory bulb to determine if mice can detect differences in odor intermittency and if the olfactory bulb encodes information that enables intermittency discrimination. Additionally, using an artificial sniffing system we further address how active sampling strategies affect the olfactory bulb representation of fluctuating odor plumes. We found that mice can behaviorally discriminate between odor plume samples of high and low intermittency and that active sampling behavior can predict discrimination success. Additionally, we found that both input and output neurons in the olfactory bulb encode information that allows for the detection of differences in odor intermittency and that intermittency encoding in M/T cells is affected by sniff frequency. We observed heterogeneity in glomerular response properties based on the intermittency of the odor stimulus, which may inform intermittency discrimination and indicate specific glomeruli that best contribute to this discrimination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioral discrimination of intermittency</title><p>Several odor plume statistical properties change with increasing distance from the odor source and therefore serve as candidate properties that can be used for odor-based navigation.

Mice were tested on this intermittency task using three different stimulus types: (1) Naturalistic in which odor samples were taken directly from the odor plume imaged by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Connor et al., 2018</xref>, and normalized so that all plume traces reach the same maximum concentration. (2) Binary naturalistic, which represent a thresholded version of naturalistic stimuli where odor is either at the maximum concentration or off. (3) Square-wave in which odor pulses of fixed duration and duty cycle are presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Binary naturalistic stimuli were hence included to test the effect of intermediate concentration changes of the naturalistic stimuli on animal performance. Square-wave stimuli were included to test the effect of the random nature (aperiodicity) and frequency of naturalistic odor whiff presentation on animal performance. The intermittency values of the delivered odor stimuli, as determined by the odor concentration measured with a mini photoionization detector (PID), closely matched the expected intermittency values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To test the degree to which odor concentration integration may inform decisions on the intermittency discrimination task, mice were tested on interleaved trials using a two gain values, where in trials with a gain of 0.5, the maximum stimulus concentration was halved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>In the Go/No-Go task, CS+ and CS- were presented in a random order preceded by a tone cue.

Further, although there was an effect of gain on behavioral performance, animal performance at 0.5 gain was significantly better than a psychometric curve prediction of animal performance solely based on odor concentration integration accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, mixed effects model, n=48 sessions: performance~intermittency+genotype+stimulus type+gain; main effect of gain, p=0.00013, one-tailed t-test with Bonferroni correction, naturalistic intermittency≥0.3, p&lt;0.0001; binary naturalistic intermittency≥0.5, p&lt;0.0001; square-wave intermittency≤0.8, p&lt;0.0001).

We evaluated active sampling during the discrimination task by measuring sniffing in real time using a pressure sensor inserted into the odor tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). To assess how trial behavior and performance depend on active sampling over the 6 s dynamic odor stimulus, we calculated an estimate of perceived odor intermittency over time by mice. Here, we directly apply the concept of intermittency to the odor sampled during sniffing, thereby retaining a coherent calculation without introducing new assumptions. We defined estimated perceived odor as the odor concentration, as measured by the PID, only during sniff inhalation periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Using a thresholded version of the estimated perceived odor (see Methods), we estimated the intermittency perceived by animals based on their active sampling behavior. Average cumulative estimated perceived intermittency varied across the 6 s trial, however estimated perceived intermittency naturally separates by odor intermittency by the end of the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To assess the effect of odor intermittency and estimated perceived intermittency on decision-making, we quantified the time at which each mouse first licked during all trials by intermittency value. Anticipatory licking is used as a measurement of motivation and early decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berditchevskaia et al., 2016</xref>).

On trials with intermediate odor intermittency values of 0.4 and 0.5, at which animals initially start performing above chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), animals had a lower estimated perceived intermittency on miss trials when compared to hit trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, two-sample t-tests hit trials estimated perceived intermittency vs miss trials estimated perceived intermittency, binary naturalistic: intermittency 0.4, p=0.02, intermittency 0.5, p=0.04). Additionally, we assessed if animals were simply sniffing at higher average frequencies during odor presentation on hit when compared to miss trials, specifically for intermediate odor intermittencies. Neither trial outcome nor intermittency influenced average trial sniff frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Prediction accuracy is significantly above, and is maintained above, the shuffled control earlier in the trial for high intermittency trials when compared to low intermittency trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, two-sample one-tailed t-test with Bonferroni correction, see figure and caption for statistics). This finding provides further support for the notion that as the estimated perceived difference between CS+ and CS- intermittency values increase, animals are more likely to lick earlier in the trial.

Recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lewis et al., 2021</xref>, have shown that glomerular responses track odor plume dynamics with varying strength and that this odor tracking depends on odor plume statistics. We wanted to explore if odor intermittency had an effect on glomerular tracking of odor plumes, by measuring the cross-correlation between glomerular responses and PID odor reading of methyl valerate across trials of increasing intermittency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To characterize the spatial mapping of glomeruli based on stimulus tracking, we found the relationship between the odor-response correlation and glomerular location on the surface of the olfactory bulb. When presented with methyl valerate, the glomeruli in the posterior-lateral region of the olfactory bulb had the highest average correlation with the stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>) and this spatial organization is weaker for lower intermittency stimuli in the medial to lateral direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, x, intermittency; y, medial to lateral odor correlation, y=0.22x+0.21, r<sup>2</sup>=0.08, p&lt;0.0001). Additionally, the glomeruli in the posterior-lateral region of the olfactory bulb also have the largest amplitude response and are the fastest to respond to the odor (have the shortest time post sniff onset to reach 75% of the maximum dF/F value corresponding to that sniff, T75, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

To do so, hierarchical clustering on the inter-glomerular correlation of GI across odor intermittency was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

However, the heterogeneous population, which includes glomeruli of both clusters, shows slightly, but consistently and significantly, higher prediction accuracy using the linear classifier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, ANOVA [10–25 glomeruli]: p&lt;0.0001, maximum accuracy for each number of glomeruli added to model: Max<sub>10 glomeruli</sub>=40% cluster 1, Max<sub>15 glomeruli</sub>=50% cluster 1, Max<sub>20 glomeruli</sub>=60% cluster 1, Max<sub>25 glomeruli</sub>=70% cluster 1). Glomeruli have varying strengths in GI slope, and we sought to understand if the strength of GI slope has an effect on the ability of a glomerulus to contribute to trial identity prediction. Using a linear classifier, we found that the glomeruli in the top 25th percentile of GI slopes predict trial outcome better than those in the bottom 25th percentile of GI slopes. Just 22 glomeruli with high GI slopes are enough to predict trial outcome at the same accuracy as the average animal hit rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Thus, even a small number of glomeruli have access to enough information to encode trial intermittency and heterogeneity among glomerular responses to stimuli of varying intermittency may be beneficial for intermittency discrimination. Using THY1-GCaMP6f mice, in which GCaMP6f is expressed in output cells of the olfactory bulb, we found similar glomerular populations as well as a consistent ability of these populations to predict trial identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In this design, nasal airflow is decoupled from tracheal breathing. We tested glomerular responses to odor stimuli with a range of intermittency values at sniff frequencies of 2, 4, 6, and 8 Hz.

To quantify the effect of sniff frequency on recruiting glomeruli that encode intermittency differences, the number of glomeruli that show a significant effect of odor intermittency on GI was determined. When presented with methyl valerate, OSNs show a 13.4% decrease in the number of intermittency-encoding glomeruli from 2 to 8 Hz sniff frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, one-way ANOVA, 2 Hz = 82.3% intermittency-encoding glomeruli, 8 Hz = 68.9% intermittency-encoding glomeruli), whereas M/T cells show a 25.2% increase in the number of intermittency-encoding glomeruli from 2 to 8 Hz sniff frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, one-way ANOVA, 2 Hz = 36.7% intermittency-encoding glomeruli, 8 Hz = 61.9% intermittency encoding glomeruli). When presented with 2-heptanone, both OSNs and M/T cells show an increase in the number of intermittency-encoding glomeruli from 2 to 8 Hz sniff frequency, showing a 22.4% and 25.1% increase, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>, OSN 2 Hz = 65.2%, OSN 8 Hz = 87.6%, M/T 2 Hz = 29.5%, M/T 8 Hz = 54.6%). Additionally, previous studies have shown that increases in sniff frequency lead to more diversity in neural responses of M/T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Díaz-Quesada et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jordan et al., 2018a</xref>). Similarly, we find that at higher sniff frequencies, glomerular intermittencies are more variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>, Bartlett’s test, p&lt;0.0001). Having shown that glomeruli with a greater change in GI across odor intermittency, GI slope, can better predict trial intermittency, we quantified changes in glomerular GI slope based on sniff frequency. When presented with both methyl valerate and heptanone, M/T cells that significantly encode intermittency also show an increase in their GI slope as sniff frequency increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, Spearman correlation, methyl valerate: r=0.36, p&lt;0.0001, n=294 glomeruli; 2-heptanone: r=0.29, p&lt;0.0001, n=271 glomeruli). These increases in GI slope may in part be due to the increases in odor tracking (i.e. cross-correlation between glomerular responses and PID signal), decreases in sniff tracking (i.e. cross-correlation between glomerular responses and sniff pressure signal), and decreases in air responses as sniff frequency increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together this suggests that at higher sniff frequencies, more glomeruli encode intermittency, as well as show a greater range in their representation of intermittency at the level of olfactory bulb output.</p><p>We next assessed if the same glomerular populations best represent intermittency at both low and high sniff frequencies. Using GI slope to represent the degree to which glomeruli contribute to intermittency prediction, we found that when presented with methyl valerate, both input and output cells show a negative relationship between GI slope at 8 and at 2 Hz sniff frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <italic>left and right,</italic> linear regression, OMP: y=−0.27x+0.38, r<sup>2</sup>=0.05, p&lt;0.0001; THY: y=−0.40x+0.44, r<sup>2</sup>=0.11, p&lt;0.0001). This shows that different glomeruli show the greatest change in GI across odor intermittency (GI slope) at 2 and 8 Hz sniff frequency, suggesting that different glomerular populations encode intermittency at low and high sniff frequencies. However, we found that when presented with 2-heptanone, the same glomeruli have the greatest GI slope at both 2 and 8 Hz sniff frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, linear regression, OMP: y=0.57x+0.29, r<sup>2</sup>=0.35, p&lt;0.0001; THY: y=0.94x+0.15, r<sup>2</sup>=0.35, p&lt;0.0001). Together this leads to the understanding that the effect of sniff frequency on the glomerular population that most strongly encodes intermittency is odor-specific (GLM: GI slope~sniff frequency*odor, p&lt;0.0001, r<sup>2</sup>=0.14, sniff frequency*odor interaction, p&lt;0.0001).</p><p>Although sniff frequency has an effect on both the number of glomeruli that encode intermittency and the strength of this encoding (GI slope), there are only slight differences between the prediction of odor stimulus intermittency based on sniff frequency. We trained a linear classifier to predict odor intermittency value (0.2, 0.5, or 0.8) based on trial GI across sniff frequencies. Using glomeruli responding to methyl valerate, the classifier performs better at low sniff frequencies and plateaus for OSNs at 91% for 2 Hz and 86% for 8 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>, exponential plateau fit). For M/T cells, the classifier plateaus at 92% for 2 Hz and 93% for 8 Hz, showing little difference in performance between trials of different sniff frequencies. Using glomeruli responding to 2-heptanone, the classifier performs better at high sniff frequencies for both OSNs and M/T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, exponential plateau fit, OSNs: plateaus at 95% for 2 Hz and 99% for 8 Hz, M/Ts: plateaus at 85% for 2 Hz and 94% for 8 Hz). However, for both input and output cells, across all sniff frequencies and odors tested, less than 50 glomeruli are required to exceed a prediction accuracy of 75% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Overall, this suggests that although sniff frequency has an effect on prediction of odor intermittency, prediction accuracy is high using glomerular information from trials at all sniff frequencies between 2 and 8 Hz. This finding is congruent with previous studies showing that although sniff frequency alters olfactory bulb response properties, it does not influence performance on odor discrimination tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jordan et al., 2018b</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Mammals are likely often required to rely on and navigate within a highly dynamic and complex odor plume environment in order to find food sources, locate mates, and avoid predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vergassola et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reddy et al., 2022</xref>). Although it is well established that mammals are skilled at navigating within these complex environments, the properties of odor plumes that they use for source localization remain largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we show that mice can discriminate odor intermittency, a temporal odor plume property that varies with distance from the odor source, and that early olfactory processing encodes intermittency. We demonstrate that active sampling patterns may affect intermittency discrimination and sniff frequency influences glomerular representation of intermittency. Additionally, we have shown that glomeruli encode information that enables reliable discrimination between odor plume samples based on intermittency. Overall, these findings suggest that intermittency can be used to inform odor-guided navigation in mice.</p><p>We found that mouse performance on the intermittency discrimination task is not affected by the odor used or frequency of odor whiffs, but is affected by the concentration gain. This shows that intermittency is a temporal property of odor plumes that can be detected independently from other temporal properties, such as whiff frequency. This distinction may be important if different temporal properties provide at least partially independent information about location within the odor plume, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jayaram et al., 2022</xref>. Other temporal properties that may indicate distance from and composition of an odor source are odor whiff frequency and the temporal correlation of fluctuating odors, both of which mice are capable of detecting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hopfield, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmuker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackels et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dasgupta et al., 2022</xref>). It is possible that these temporal properties are either used independently or in concert during odor navigation. Additionally, we show that concentration gain has an effect on intermittency discrimination, suggesting that mice are in part using odor concentration integration for intermittency discrimination. While further work needs to be done to explore discrimination of odor stimuli based on odor integration, a plethora of work suggests that rodents can discriminate odor duration and intensity both at the neural and behavioral levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rubin and Katz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rospars et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spors and Grinvald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wojcik and Sirotin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sirotin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2020</xref>). In some odor plumes, odor concentration and odor intermittency both increase as distance from the odor source decreases, indicating that the integral of measured odor would also increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Connor et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that odor intermittency and odor integration might inform odor source localization in a partially dependent manner, where both statistical properties provide information on location within the plume.</p><p>We found that glomeruli show heterogeneous responses to odor plume stimuli across a range of intermittency values. We primarily found two subsets of glomeruli with inverse representations of intermittency and select glomeruli within both populations best represent changes in intermittency. Our results are consistent with previous findings showing that a subset of glomeruli track odor plume dynamics, and that the degree of odor tracking depends on odor plume statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lewis et al., 2021</xref>). However, our findings contradict those suggesting that fluctuating odors are linearly processed by M/T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>). This discrepancy may be due to our use of stimuli across a range of intermittencies and resulting non-linearities may only arise in response to plume samples of certain odor plume statistics not previously tested. Biophysical diversity in the mammalian olfactory bulb allows for increased information encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Padmanabhan and Urban, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tripathy et al., 2013</xref>), which may be particularly relevant during odor plume navigation where the odor plume property that is most salient for source localization may change along an animal’s trajectory within the plume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rigolli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jayaram et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, the heterogeneity we observe among glomeruli may yield specialized populations, important for feature selection of different statistical properties within the odor plume. Ultimately, these populations could be advantageous for efficient information encoding during odor plume navigation. Our results suggest glomeruli have varying lag times in their odor correlation and if future studies indicate a response synchronicity within these glomerular clusters, this concerted activity could be important in robustly encoding intermittency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gill et al., 2020</xref>). We show that both populations can predict intermittency and show distinct response properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Cluster 2 glomeruli, which show higher glomerular-response correlations may not only be effective at encoding intermittency but may also convey information about odor whiff timing or frequency; both of which provide additional information about an animal’s distance to the odor source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crimaldi and Koseff, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Celani et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>There are several properties of glomerular responses that can be altered by sniff frequency which can influence intermittency representation. Some of the properties that we have considered that may cause an increase in GI representation are a reduction of baseline air responses (the threshold for GI is dependent on the background response), an increase in response amplitude (so that it exceeds the threshold), an increase in the number of responses per unit time, or a decrease in adaptation (preventing sustained response from dropping below the threshold). We find that the average glomerular odor-response amplitude does not change with sniff frequency, but the air response amplitude decreases as sniff frequency increases. At low sniff frequencies, responses are more highly correlated with the sniff trace, whereas at higher sniff frequencies, responses are more highly correlated with the odor trace. This suggests that at higher sniff frequencies, odor responses are more representative of the stimulus due to more frequent sampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Additionally, although high-frequency sniffing attenuates odor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verhagen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wachowiak et al., 2009</xref>), GI on average increases with sniff frequency, suggesting that glomerular responses do not fall below the threshold for GI calculation due to adaptation. Using these findings, we reason that high sniff frequency in part changes intermittency representation by decreasing background air responses and more accurately representing the odor stimulus. These changes alone provide a reasonable understanding of why we observe an increase in M/T cell representation of changes in intermittency at high sniff frequencies.</p><p>When exploring the role of intermittency in mouse odor-based navigation, two main questions to address are: Is it feasible for mice to detect changes in odor intermittency? If so, are they using intermittency for navigation? We address the former by using a behavioral assay to determine that mice can discriminate odor intermittency and that the olfactory bulb can support this discrimination. The results of our work provide motivation to further study how mice may use intermittency when navigating complex odor environments. Future work focusing on shifts in navigation strategies based on changes in odor plume intermittency will further elucidate how mice use this property for source localization and enable more informed modeling approaches to the use of intermittency. Recently, head-mounted sensors have been implemented to measure odor concentration in real time during plume navigation in a laboratory arena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tariq et al., 2021</xref>). Such techniques provide important advancements that can be used to understand the correlation between changes in odor plume statistics experienced by a navigating animal and the behavioral decisions made along its trajectory. However, a limitation in studying rodent navigation in the laboratory environment is the ability to recapitulate naturalistic odor environments where more complex navigation strategies may be needed. To address this, virtual odor environments have begun to be implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Radvansky and Dombeck, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fischler-Ruiz et al., 2021</xref>). The use of virtual odor plumes presents an opportunity to manipulate the odor environment in a systematic manner and expose differences in navigation strategies when for example intermittency changes with distance from the odor source versus when it does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jayaram et al., 2022</xref>). Measuring if mice can detect within-stimulus increases or decreases in odor plume intermittency will also help elucidate the timescale over which mice can detect intermittency differences.</p><p>Our data show that mice can discriminate odor intermittency and that early processing in the mouse olfactory system encodes intermittency. Intermittency influences and may be critical for odor navigation in invertebrates. Here, we take the first steps in showing that intermittency may be used by rodents for odor plume navigation and provide further support that timing-based properties can be used for source localization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Olfactometer design</title><p>Filtered high purity nitrogen (Airgas, NI ISP300, &lt;0.1 ppm total hydrocarbons, H<sub>2</sub>O, and O<sub>2</sub> contaminants) was carbon filtered and passed through PFA vials (Savillex 200-30-12) containing odor (2% methyl valerate in mineral oil, Sigma-Aldrich product #1489977; 2% 2-heptanone in mineral oil, Sigma-Aldrich product # 537683; stored in the dark under nitrogen at room temperature).

During this testing period, the dorsal olfactory bulbs of these animals were imaged according to the optical imaging protocol described in the ‘Optical imaging system’ section.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Anesthetized wide-field calcium imaging</title><p>Animals remained anesthetized post tracheotomy and immediately prepared for calcium imaging. They were placed on a heating pad directly under a camera with their nose directly in front of an odor tube. The nasopharyngeal tracheal tube was connected to the previously described actuator-controlled artificial sniffing system while allowing the animal to freely breath through the lung-directed tracheal tube. Core body temperature was monitored and maintained throughout the procedure. Breathing was monitored by eye for signs of distress. Warmed saline was administered for hydration after 4 hr. Imaging lasted no more than 8 hr. Anesthetic maintenance was monitored based on the pedal withdrawal reflex and anesthesia boosters were administered as necessary (ketamine:dexmedetomidine, 100:0.5 mg/kg, i.p., 25% original dose booster). An atropine booster was administered every 2 hr after first administration (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) Animals were euthanized immediately after imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification and statistical analyses</title><p>All behavioral and imaging data was converted into a MATLAB-compatible format.

Sniff peaks were identified by peaks in the sniff trace (where positive deflections indicate inhalation) and sniff onsets were identified as the point at which the sniff trace changes sign prior to the peak. Inhalation periods were identified as the time between each sniff onset and subsequent peak. To quantify estimated perceived intermittency, the PID reading for each trial was sampled during inhalation periods. The perceived intermittency value was then calculated as described above with T = total inhalation time during the 6 s stimulus period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Optical imaging pre-processing</title><p>Imaging data was collected at 25 frames/s and 256×256 pixels, and pre-processed to correct for movement and global noise in every imaged frame. Glomerular ROIs were manually selected for each mouse accounting for glomeruli that may be recruited during different stimuli. Raw fluorescence traces were converted into ΔF/F using the average fluorescence of a 100 ms period prior to odor presentation as baseline fluorescence. Each trace was bandpass filtered (0.075–10 Hz, fourth-order Butterworth) to limit the contribution of noise to the measured response. Traces were baseline corrected for effects of photobleaching by fitting a second-degree polynomial to the response trace during pre- and post-odor periods. To obtain an estimate of the neural firing rate based on the GCaMP6f fluorescence calcium signal, filtered and baseline-corrected ΔF/F traces were deconvolved using a time constant of 150 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-4"><title>Identifying responding glomeruli</title><p>Estimated running firing rates (deconvolved ΔF/F traces) (FR) were z-scored relative to the baseline (2 s period preceding odor presentation) signal’s mean and SD:<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>For a given trial, if the glomerular response amplitude of the z-scored trace (identified as the trough to the peak of the response) associated with the first sniff of odor presentation exceeded a z-score value of 2, this glomerulus was identified as responding to odor for that specific trial.

Glomeruli that responded to &gt;10% of trials (~6 trials) were included in the final quantification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-5"><title>Cross-correlation of glomerular response with odor dynamics</title><p>To calculate the glomerular response tracking of odor dynamics, deconvolved ΔF/F traces of each glomerulus were cross-correlated with the PID signal for a single trial. Correlation coefficients were calculated for lags between –500 ms and 500 ms using the xcorr() function in MATLAB. Both the deconvolved ΔF/F traces and PID signal are mean subtracted before calculating cross-correlations so that the reported coefficients represent the Pearson coefficient. For each glomerulus, we additionally calculated a shuffled average (10 shuffle iterations) in which the deconvolved ΔF/F traces were shuffled, cross-correlated with the PID reading, and correlation coefficients were averaged across the 10 shuffle iterations. This shuffled cross-correlation was subtracted from the original glomerular cross-correlation for each trial. A maximum correlation for each glomerulus was identified as the peak of the shuffle-subtracted cross-correlation for the given 500 ms window.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-6"><title>Spatiotemporal analysis of response patterns</title><p>The z-scored response amplitude for each glomerulus was determined, as previously described, by measuring the difference in z-score value from trough to peak of the z-scored deconvolved ΔF/F glomerular response corresponding to the first sniff during odor presentation. Reported values are an average for each glomerulus over all trials. A T75 for each glomerulus was measured as the time to reach 75% of the response amplitude of the first sniff during odor presentation (as measured using % ΔF/F) from the sniff onset. Reported values are an average for each glomerulus over all trials.</p><p>Spatiotemporal response maps were established using the method outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2019</xref>. Briefly, for a single trial, z-scored response amplitudes and T75 values of all glomeruli were correlated with their location along each of their spatial dimensions using corr() in MATLAB (A-P pixels and M-L pixels, with the latter being measured as the pixel distance from the midline). Reported values are an average of the spatiotemporal response maps over all trials. The same approach was used to identify the olfactory bulb spatial location with the highest correlation between odor and glomerular response.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-7"><title>Glomerular intermittency</title><p>GI was quantified using the z-scored deconvolved ΔF/F glomerular response traces.

To determine if glomeruli significantly encoded intermittency as measured by GI representation across odor intermittency, a one-way ANOVA was performed using intermittency groups of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 for each glomerulus using all input trials (n=180 trials). A significant result was determined if the main effect of odor intermittency had p&lt;0.001.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-8"><title>Hierarchical clustering</title><p>To quantify similarities in glomerular responses across odor intermittency values, the average GI across odor intermittency values were correlated between all glomeruli. More specifically, each row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <italic>left,</italic> was correlated with every other row to obtain the correlation coefficient values (r) represented in correlation matrix in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <italic>middle</italic>. If the GI of two glomeruli covary strongly in the same direction across odor intermittency values, the r value was close to 1. Hierarchical clustering was implemented using the Linkage() function in MATLAB by calculating correlation distance of the correlation matrix. Briefly, hierarchical clustering was determined using a method in which if 1 – r is close to 0, two glomeruli are quantified as closely related. Subsequent cluster analysis was performed using the cluster() function in MATLAB and a distance cutoff for cluster detection set (0.74).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-9"><title>Linear classification</title><p>A threefold cross-validated linear discriminant classifier was implemented using the fitdiscr() function in MATLAB.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that the hypothesis that animals can use intermittency on the odor plume as an important variable to help them discriminate olfactory stimuli is interesting and an important question to be answered. However, the experimental data does not fully support the author's claims.</p><p>1) The main concern about testing intermittency in the behavioral experiment is disambiguating it from concentration. The method used by the authors may not be sufficient to achieve this disambiguation. If the concentration is changed in a session-by-session manner, an animal may change its decision criteria and still perform the task based on the concentration, but not intermittence. Two ways of doing this: either to present different concentrations in the same session, i.e. scramble concentrations or to train animals on one concentration and present 'probe' trials with another concentration. If the behavior does not depend on concentration in any of these cases, it is strong evidence that the animal is using intermittency.</p><p>2) The way intermittency is measured is not sufficiently explained. The paper does not fully prove that the animal is sensitive to intermittency but has no other flow parameters. How the intermittency values are chosen is not clear. For example, low intermittency is considered to be below 0.15 and high intermittency is considered to be between 0.2 and 0.8. What is the range of intermittency values animals are exposed to in the wild? Is this known? Given the fact that intermittency is the main focus of this work, the authors plainly point out how intermittency is computed (in addition to the references to previous papers) and plainly write a sentence to give a quick grasp of what high and low intermittency means. If necessary a graphical description of the phenomenon would go a long way to more easily convey the information.</p><p>3) How to make sure that the stimulation with high intermittency values results in a higher odor concentration in the olfactory epithelium, resulting in ORNs responding to concentration, rather than other variables. The authors make a big effort to design a more naturalistic odorant stimulation, however, the selection of the two odorants used is not discussed. Are the odorants innately relevant for the animals? The degree of discrimination of intermittency changes when the odorant is appetitive. How about a neutral or aversive stimulus?</p><p>4) Work is needed on the explanation of exactly how the behavioral experiments are performed. For example, make it clear if they are using an odor A with low intermittency versus an odor B with high intermittency. What exactly are the odorants used for the CS+ and CS-, in addition to the different intermittency levels? Also, do the authors mix all stimuli in the same session, and so the animals simply generalize across all the stimuli and only consider intermittency for the behavioral choices? Or do authors repeat different sessions for different parameters?</p><p>5) General comments. There are several issues with how the figures are presented that if edited would help the reader to interpret the results much better. The methods section could be improved. A better description of the statistics used throughout the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>After carefully reading this work, I found it to be a very interesting work with relevant contributions to the field of sensory physiology. Nevertheless, I do have some comments that the authors need to address for this work to be fit for publication.</p><p>1) Although it is clear what the authors are referring to when using the term intermittency, I think that a graphical description of the phenomenon would go a long way to more easily convey the information. This could be incorporated into Figure 1.</p><p>2) Line 136. In this first experiment, animals are trained to low intermittency as the CS- and high intermittency as the CS+. I was wondering why not try both possibilities in the different animal cohorts. It would be possible that the &quot;level&quot; of intermittency affects how the animal interprets this parameter.</p><p>3) Although I celebrate the effort made to design more naturalistic odorant stimulation, is not explained the selection of the actual odorants used. Are the odorants innately relevant for the animals? The degree of discrimination of intermittency changes when the odorant is appetitive. How about a neutral or aversive stimulus?</p><p>4) Another question I have regarding the olfactory stimuli is the following. How about using a mixture of odorants? In the wild, animals are more likely to encounter stimuli comprised of multiple components. It would be very interesting to analyze this.</p><p>5) Line 230. The conclusion of these experiments is that the animals are capable of discriminating odors based on intermittency. I think the authors should work on making it clear if they are using an odor A with low intermittency versus an odor B with high intermittency. What exactly are the odorants used for the CS+ and CS-, in addition to the different intermittency levels?</p><p>6) Line 365. Please explain carefully the identity of the odorants used for the experiments that lead to the conclusion that glomeruli track odor stimuli. Please discuss this finding in more detail.</p><p>7) Some of the colors used in the figures were a bit hard to discriminate. If possible use a colorblind-friendly palette.</p><p>8) I would like to comment that I was very happily surprised to find in the methods sections that the authors have the animals in the correct light schedule. This makes me wonder if they took into account the time at which the experiments were conducted to evaluate if there is any kind of circadian regulation of intermittency discrimination. Maybe having a cohort of animals in constant darkness would be a good experiment if the circadian aspect of the question is of interest to the authors.</p><p>9) Line 273. Figure 2 – supp 1. Please discuss the increase in sniff frequency observed for the synthetic odors.</p><p>10) Line 480. Figure 5. I think that showing response maps of the different trials would go a long way to help the reader grasp the actual result.</p><p>11) Please elaborate more about the difference in the response of the ORN and mitral cells, and how these two different populations of cells can be encoders of intermittency with taking into account different properties.</p><p>12) The clustering of glomeruli in 2 clusters needs clarification. It would be possible to show a map of the different clusters in multiple animals?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) I kept having doubts throughout the paper about how intermittency was computed and what high or low intermittency meant. Given that intermittency is the focus of the whole paper, I would suggest the authors plainly point out how intermittency is computed (in addition to the references to previous papers) and plainly write a sentence to give a quick grasp of what high and low intermittency means.</p><p>2) Figures are not well organized in terms of both content and graphic.</p><p>Content-wise: I found it very unintuitive and challenging to find the specific subfigure supporting specific claims. I had to juggle back and forth between the main and supplementary figures continuously. Some key results are presented in supplementary figures instead of main figures. The figures should be organized in chronological citation order, and key results/claims should be supported by at least one main figure item. All figures and subplots should be referenced in the text.</p><p>Graphic-wise: the font character is very small and hard to read, and some color-legend and axis labels are missing.</p><p>3) Please improve Figure 2A so that we can well understand the computation of the estimated perceived intermittency. For example, use the same temporal scale for the original signal and the estimated perceived intensity so that we can directly compare.</p><p>4) Figure 4D: please plot the average behavioral accuracy so that we can visualize the claim made in the text.</p><p>5) Whenever you report p-values, please, specify the statistical test you have used.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript could be further improved by addressing the following points.</p><p>1. The authors conclude from the behavioral data in Figure 1 that mice can discriminate between fluctuating odor stimuli based on intermittency values. However, a high intermittency value also means a higher total amount of odorants delivered (sniffed). Even though the concentration of the delivered odor is kept constant, depending on the properties of the odor (e.g., its absorption in the mucous), the actual concentration OSNs encounter may be different with varying intermittency values. This raises the possibility that the mice may discriminate other parameters rather than intermittency values per se. The authors should at least discuss alternative interpretations of these results.</p><p>2. Related to #1, the choice of the two odors is not explained or well justified. The chemical and physical properties of an odor may influence the final concentration the OSNs encounter and the behavioral outcome. Testing a few more odorants with different properties would be informative and help to strengthen the conclusions related to the odor-specific encoding of intermittency (Line 588) and spatial patterning/intrinsic glomerular properties (Line 358-360).</p><p>3. Line 527-530. &quot;OSNs show a 13.4% decrease in the number of ….from 2-8 Hz sniff frequency (Figure 5A, one-way ANOVA)&quot;. Figure 5A does not show this decrease of 13.4%. If this were shown in Figure 5B, the difference in the purple bars between 2 and 8 Hz is more like &gt;40%. For the M/T cells, a 25.2% increase is stated in the main text, but the green bar's increase from 2 to 8 Hz is more like 30%.</p><p>4. Line 530-532. When describing 2-heptanone results, please cite Figure 6A, B. Again double check the values of 22.4% and 25.1% increase from 2 to 8 Hz sniff frequency for OSNs and M/T cells. From Figure 6B, for OSNs (purple), there seems a slight decrease from 2 to 8 Hz.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Behavioral discrimination and olfactory bulb encoding of odor plume intermittency&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Piali Sengupta (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and the original reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:<italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I had a chance to look carefully into behavioral part of the paper, and I found the following problems:</p><p>1) The authors are trying to make a case that the animal is attending to the intermittence variable. It is a challenging problem, and I do not think that the authors succeeded.</p><p>The Figure 2B, shows different performances for high and low gain stimuli. The shift between two curves may be explained by an alternative animal strategy. Let's assume that an animal is doing a concentration discrimination task. It estimates an integral of concentration and respond as 'go', if its value is above some threshold. I can imagine that the behavioral results for such a task for stimuli with high and low gain presented in coordinates of intermittency would look like as shown at Figure 2B. For the low gain, an animal reach maximum perforce at a higher level of intermittency, exactly as shown on the figure.</p><p>I would actually strongly suggest that authors would plot their results as a function, of integral of concentration.</p><p>2) The authors tried to provide an argument for an intermittency by presenting a predicted performance based on concentration Figure S2B. But I could not find explanations of how this is estimated.</p><p>3) In general, an animal is computing some combination of variables, and it is extremely difficult to point out which one is most relevant. So far, the focus on intermittency is not motivated.</p><p>4) In the previous review I asked to provide the logic for choosing a specific value for intermittency threshold. I did not fully follow their explanation. The authors presented the graph of intermittency as a function of distance (Figure S1A). If the logic that an animal is using an intermittency as a measure of a distance to the source, then the measurement should be done at the interval of intermittencies where it is mostly informative about the distance. Based on the figure, this should be around 0.5, where the slope of intermittency as a function of distance is the steepest. It would be much more reasonable to show an animal's ability to differentiate intermittency around this level. The ability to discriminate intermittency at the level of 0.15 tells us only that an animal can only extract information that the source is far away. This can be potentially done using other cues.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85303.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that the hypothesis that animals can use intermittency on the odor plume as an important variable to help them discriminate olfactory stimuli is interesting and an important question to be answered.

Trials of the two gain values (which modulate the maximum concentration) are presented interleaved within a session. These trials are solely separated for post-session analysis to test the effect of gain on animal performance. To make this point clearer we have included the following text in the “Go/No-Go behavior” subsection of the Methods section of the manuscript on line 952-955:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Additionally, trials of a gain of 0.5 and a gain of 1 are interwoven randomly during the session with each unique stimulus being presented at both a gain of 0.5 and 0.1.

Thus, no parameters other than fluctuations in odor concentration are provided to the animal. We have stated the following in our methods section:</p><p>“Additionally, the carbon-filtered nitrogen line was split before passing through the odor and is directed to an empty PFA vial used for counterbalancing odor flow. Both odor delivery and counterbalanced nitrogen delivery are controlled by independent EVP Series Clippard Proportional Valves and an EVPD-2 valve driver (Clippard Instrument Laboratory, Inc, Cincinnati, Ohio). Proportional valves were calibrated so as to ensure that final combined nitrogen and odor flow is maintained at 50 mL/min. Combined nitrogen and odor flow was confirmed using a flow meter (Omron Electronic Components Product # D6F-P0010A1).”</p><p>Further we addressed under Reviewer 3 issue 1a that odor molecule absorption temporal integration can explain only some of the discriminatory psychometric curves. Thus, we can't think of or speculate on other potentially relevant parameters co-varying with intermittency other than mechanistic downstream processes inside the mouse itself to enable such discrimination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Although not included in this manuscript, we did perform a pilot experiment including the reverse paradigm (high intermittency as CS- and low intermittency as CS+). While we will not include these preliminary results in the present manuscript, we did find that the animals were able to perform the task with the paradigm reversed. In order to streamline behavioral testing and result interpretation, we chose to pursue one form of the paradigm. We chose to test low intermittency as CS- and high intermittency as CS+ as being rewarded at high intermittency values may parallel animals’ behavior when their goal is to navigate towards an odor source. However, we do acknowledge that testing the reverse paradigm would further support our finding that mice can discriminate odor intermittency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Although I celebrate the effort made to design more naturalistic odorant stimulation, is not explained the selection of the actual odorants used. Are the odorants innately relevant for the animals? The degree of discrimination of intermittency changes when the odorant is appetitive. How about a neutral or aversive stimulus?</p></disp-quote><p>These odorants (methyl valerate and 2-heptanone) were selected in part due to their spatial representation in the olfactory bulb. Both methyl valerate and 2-heptanone activate glomeruli on the dorsal surface of the olfactory bulb, therefore allowing us to image neural activity in response to presentation of these odorants (as the optical window procedure is performed on the dorsal olfactory bulb). Additionally, these two odorants recruit glomeruli in different regions of the dorsal olfactory bulb, have different functional groups and elicit different spatiotemporal response properties in the olfactory bulb (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, stated on line 507).</p><p>Both odorants are fruit-associated odors with neutral preference indices (Saraiva et al., 2016, Fletcher, 2012). Thus, while we do not explore a panel of odorants, we do explore the generalizability of intermittency processing with two distinct odorants.</p><p>We have included more information on the odorant selection in the “Sniff frequency-dependent glomerular representation of intermittency” section of the Results section on line 505-507.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Another question I have regarding the olfactory stimuli is the following. How about using a mixture of odorants? In the wild, animals are more likely to encounter stimuli comprised of multiple components. It would be very interesting to analyze this.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion and indeed we considered a mixture for the reasons suggested, however given the many variables we tested in this experiment did not have the capacity to introduce odor mixtures. We are, unfortunately, not aware of a &quot;standard&quot; odor mixture (e.g. from fragrance/food industry) that has been widely researched in rodents.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Line 230. The conclusion of these experiments is that the animals are capable of discriminating odors based on intermittency. I think the authors should work on making it clear if they are using an odor A with low intermittency versus an odor B with high intermittency. What exactly are the odorants used for the CS+ and CS-, in addition to the different intermittency levels?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer pointing out this area for further clarification. We have added additional clarification on the behavioral paradigm in the “Go/No-Go behavior” subsection of the Methods section. To answer this specific question we added on Line 965-970: &quot;All animals are trained and tested using 2% methyl valerate in mineral oil (Σ Aldrich product #1489977). After completing the entire behavioral paradigm (testing using naturalistic, binary naturalistic, and square-wave stimulus sets) using 2% methyl valerate, animals are tested on the binary naturalistic condition using 2% 2-heptanone in mineral oil (Σ Aldrich product #537683). Thus, within a session, all CS+ and CS- are a single odor, the distinguishing property between CS+ and CS- are their intermittency value.&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Line 365.

Thus, these two traces can directly be compared. The figure is illustrating that the estimated perceived odor is extracted from the inhalation periods of the raw trace (assuming that animals are not perceiving odor that they are not inhaling). We intentionally left off the scale in this figure to not mislead the reader into thinking that somehow the estimated perceived odor is a faster signal (when in fact it is the same odor signal as the original, simply just extracted during inhalation periods). Thus, the perceived graph is exactly the original graph but with exhalation periods removed, as retention of original inhalation timing is not relevant to the analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4D: please plot the average behavioral accuracy so that we can visualize the claim made in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the reviewer may be referring to Figure 5E (former Figure 4E, where we note “Just 22 glomeruli with high GI slopes are enough to predict trial outcome at the same accuracy as the average animal hit rate”).

The authors conclude from the behavioral data in Figure 1 that mice can discriminate between fluctuating odor stimuli based on intermittency values. However, a high intermittency value also means a higher total amount of odorants delivered (sniffed). Even though the concentration of the delivered odor is kept constant, depending on the properties of the odor (e.g., its absorption in the mucous), the actual concentration OSNs encounter may be different with varying intermittency values. This raises the possibility that the mice may discriminate other parameters rather than intermittency values per se. The authors should at least discuss alternative interpretations of these results.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a really interesting point made by the reviewer and we thank you for it. To be sure the concentration was varied over time in several ways: 1. During a trial: Continuously vs Binary 2. Across trials: high vs low gain (Figure 1F). We were indeed curious whether mice could discriminate merely based on the amount of &quot;deposited molecules&quot; as one would expect intermittency to affect. To test this &quot;integration&quot; hypotheses we halved the amount of odorant molecules delivered. We found that while this did indeed shift the psychometric curve in an expected direction, however it fell short of the shift one would predict if integration were the sole mechanism (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). Line 233-240:</p><p>&quot;As mentioned, mice were tested on two gain values to determine the degree to which odor concentration integration affected their task decisions. Although there was an effect of gain on behavioral performance, animal performance at 0.5 gain was significantly better than a psychometric curve prediction of animal performance solely based on odor concentration integration (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, Mixed effects model, n = 48 sessions: Performance ~ Intermittency + Genotype + Stimulus Type + Gain; Main effect of Gain, p=0.00013, one-tailed ttest with Bonferroni correction, Naturalistic intermittency ≥ 0.3, p&lt;0.0001; Naturalistic intermittency ≥ 0.5, p&lt;0.0001; Square-wave intermittency ≤ 0.8, p&lt;0.0001).&quot;</p><p>Our olfactory bulb imaging aims to further address what neural correlates exist to the behavioral performance, where the answer appears to be glomerulus-dependent (and to some extent odor-dependent).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Related to #1, the choice of the two odors is not explained or well justified. The chemical and physical properties of an odor may influence the final concentration the OSNs encounter and the behavioral outcome. Testing a few more odorants with different properties would be informative and help to strengthen the conclusions related to the odor-specific encoding of intermittency (Line 588) and spatial patterning/intrinsic glomerular properties (Line 358-360).</p></disp-quote><p>We much appreciate the concerns of the reviewer.</p><p>We indeed considered several odorants and associated properties. Given time constrains we were limited to 2 stimuli of which we had to vary many parameters (type, I, gain, sniffing) in assessing both discrimination and neural processing.</p><p>We decided to test 2 monomolecular odorants (2-heptanone and methyl valerate) as these have been most widely used in rodent olfactory bulb imaging, providing distinct and clear glomerular response patterns. They are both fruity smelling odors, implying a relationship to edible food (at least, for humans). Methyl valerate is a methyl ester of pentatonic acid with a fruity (apple) smell. 2-Heptanone is a ketone with a fruity (green banana) smell.</p><p>Nonetheless we agree exploring additional odorants with very different perceptual or physico-chemical properties will be of great interest, as this could affect the psychometric functions, associated active sampling behavior and bulbar response patterns. However, given the extensive testing on many parameters, we did not have the capacity to introduce more odors. Nonetheless, we are confident that mice in principle can discriminate intermittency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

It is a challenging problem, and I do not think that the authors succeeded.</p><p>The Figure 2B, shows different performances for high and low gain stimuli. The shift between two curves may be explained by an alternative animal strategy. Let's assume that an animal is doing a concentration discrimination task. It estimates an integral of concentration and respond as 'go', if its value is above some threshold. I can imagine that the behavioral results for such a task for stimuli with high and low gain presented in coordinates of intermittency would look like as shown at Figure 2B. For the low gain, an animal reach maximum perforce at a higher level of intermittency, exactly as shown on the figure.</p><p>I would actually strongly suggest that authors would plot their results as a function, of integral of concentration.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is making a valid point – can the discrimination be explained by another</p><p>(unintended) correlated variable. We anticipated this issue, as with increased intermittency, i. e. higher duty cycle, mice are exposed to the same concentration for a larger fraction of time. This could, and likely does to some degree, increase the absorbed amount of odor and hence increase perceived odor intensity. This forms the basis for the reviewer’s &quot;integral of concentration&quot;, which stands as an alternative to time-cue related mechanisms (odor onset and offset times, duration of inhalations when no odor is present, etc) solely reflecting when the stimulus is suprathreshold with no concern for intensity.</p><p>Indeed, to explore to what extent mice relied on such integration we designed the task with 2 levels of odor concentration (L 183-186; Figure 1F, Figure 2B): the lower concentration (gain 0.5) being roughly half of the higher (gain 1; Figure S 1D). &quot; To test the degree to which odor concentration integration may inform decisions on the intermittency discrimination task, mice were tested on interleaved trials using a two gain values, where in trials with a gain of 0.5, the maximum stimulus concentration was halved (Figure 1F, Figure 1—figure supplement 1D).&quot;</p><p>We reasoned that if mice are solely relying on intensity-integration, then halving the odor concentration (gain 0.5) would be fully equivalent to halving the intermittency at gain 1, as the amount of total absorbed odorant during a trial would be identical in both cases. Hence the expected psychometric curves would be right-shifted so that performance at gain 1 I=0.2 is moved to I=0.4, 0.3 to 0.6, 0.4 to 0.8. These straightforward hypothetical concentration integration curves are the black lines shown on Figure S 2B.</p><p>Our results (L 239-242) show that these two cases are not equivalent behaviorally: &quot;Although there was an effect of gain on behavioral performance, animal performance at 0.5 gain was significantly better than a psychometric curve prediction of animal performance solely based on odor concentration integration&quot;. Figure 2B shows qualitatively that the psychometric curves at gain 0.5 are not simply 2x right-shifted versions of gain=1. The caption further states &quot; At gain 1, mice perform significantly above chance at intermittency values of 0.3 and above (one-tailed ttest, Bonferroni correction, p&lt;0.0001, n=48 sessions) for all stimulus types. At gain 0.5, mice perform above chance at intermittency values 0.4 and above, naturalistic and square-wave, 0.5 and above, binary naturalistic (one-tailed t-test, Bonferroni correction, p&lt;0.0001, n=48 sessions).&quot; Thus, statistically the intermittency discrimination thresholds shift much less (0.4, 0.4 and 0.5) than the expected doubling of 0.3 (i.e., 0.6). This further demonstrates that concentration-integration can explain only some the behavior.</p><p>Based on the reviewers comments we have now further clarified in the text how the psychometric curves at both gains have provided evidence that concentration integration plays some, but only some, role in discrimination dynamic odor stimuli with varying physical intermittencies. We added LL232-239: &quot; If mice are solely relying on intensity-integration, then halving the odor concentration (gain=0.5) would be fully equivalent to halving the intermittency at gain=1, as the amount of total absorbed odorant during a trial would be identical in both cases. Figure 2B demonstrates that psychometric curves for gain=0.5 are not right-shifted versions of gain=1 by the expected equivalent doubling of intermittency. Indeed, the intermittency discrimination thresholds shifted much less (0.4, 0.4 and 0.5) than the expected doubling of 0.3 (i.e., 0.6).&quot;</p><p>In subsequent text we statistically show that the behavioral curves do not match the predicted concentration-integration curves, as described in our prior round to reviewer 3. Indeed, Reviewer 3 made a very similar remark in the first round of reviewing as their Issue 1, to which our response has been accepted as satisfactory and we copy below:</p><p>&quot;This is a really interesting point made by the reviewer and we thank you for it.

This shows that intermittency is a temporal property of odor plumes that can be detected independently from other temporal properties, such as whiff frequency. This distinction may be important if different temporal properties provide at least partially independent information about location within the odor plume, as suggested by Jayaram et al. (2022). Other temporal properties that may indicate distance from and composition of an odor source are odor whiff frequency and the temporal correlation of fluctuating odors, both of which mice are capable of detecting (Hopfield, 1991; Schmuker et al., 2016; Ackels et al., 2021; Dasgupta et al., 2022). It is possible that these temporal properties are either used independently or in concert during odor navigation. Additionally, we show that concentration gain has an effect on intermittency discrimination, suggesting that mice are in part using odor concentration integration for intermittency discrimination. While further work needs to be done to explore discrimination of odor stimuli based on odor integration, a plethora of work suggests that rodents can discriminate odor duration and intensity both at the neural and behavioral levels (Rubin et al., 1999; Rospars et al., 2000; Spors et al., 2002; Li et al., 2014; Wojcik et al., 2014; Sirotin et al., 2015; Li et al., 2020). In some odor plumes, odor concentration and odor intermittency both increase as distance from the odor source decreases, indicating that the integral of measured odor would also increase (Connor et al., 2018). It is possible that odor intermittency and odor integration might inform odor source localization in a partially dependent manner, where both statistical properties provide information on location within the plume. &quot;</p><p>In conclusion, we believe the reviewers suggested integration mechanism indeed in part underlies the discrimination of intermittency but cannot explain it in full. Both discrimination of integrated concentration and concentration-independent temporal properties are most likely in play.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors tried to provide an argument for an intermittency by presenting a predicted performance based on concentration Figure S2B.

Additionally, we agree we did not provide a clear explanation in the text, thank you for noticing. We hence added the following:</p><p>We added LL232-239: &quot; If mice are solely relying on intensity-integration, then halving the odor concentration (gain=0.5) would be fully equivalent to halving the intermittency at gain=1, as the amount of total absorbed odorant during a trial would be identical in both cases.

So far, the focus on intermittency is not motivated.</p></disp-quote><p>We set out to test whether mice can discriminate odor intermittency, which is a physical property of plumes. We have shown we accurately presented mice with different intermittencies in stimuli of different gains, and shapes (natural, binary, periodic). We demonstrate they can indeed discriminate all these stimuli's differences in intermittency. We further behaviorally define how mice may discriminate intermittency (partially on temporal suprathreshold means, partially on concentration integration). Last we describe how the olfactory bulb represents intermittency and how this depends on sniffing. We hence maintain the papers focus on intermittency.</p><p>We again point to our Discussion where this is addressed head on (L661-681):</p><p>&quot; We found that mouse performance on the intermittency discrimination task is not affected by the odor used or frequency of odor whiffs, but is affected by the concentration gain. This shows that intermittency is a temporal property of odor plumes that can be detected independently from other temporal properties, such as whiff frequency. This distinction may be important if different temporal properties provide at least partially independent information about location within the odor plume, as suggested by Jayaram et al. (2022). Other temporal properties that may indicate distance from and composition of an odor source are odor whiff frequency and the temporal correlation of fluctuating odors, both of which mice are capable of detecting (Hopfield, 1991; Schmuker et al., 2016; Ackels et al., 2021; Dasgupta et al., 2022). It is possible that these temporal properties are either used independently or in concert during odor navigation. Additionally, we show that concentration gain has an effect on intermittency discrimination, suggesting that mice are in part using odor concentration integration for intermittency discrimination. While further work needs to be done to explore discrimination of odor stimuli based on odor integration, a plethora of work suggests that rodents can discriminate odor duration and intensity both at the neural and behavioral levels (Rubin et al., 1999; Rospars et al., 2000; Spors et al., 2002; Li et al., 2014; Wojcik et al., 2014; Sirotin et al., 2015; Li et al., 2020). In some odor plumes, odor concentration and odor intermittency both increase as distance from the odor source decreases, indicating that the integral of measured odor would also increase (Connor et al., 2018). It is possible that odor intermittency and odor integration might inform odor source localization in a partially dependent manner, where both statistical properties provide information on location within the plume. &quot;</p><p>We hope the reviewer agrees at this stage, if at least sufficiently so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the previous review I asked to provide the logic for choosing a specific value for intermittency threshold. I did not fully follow their explanation. The authors presented the graph of intermittency as a function of distance (Figure S1A). If the logic that an animal is using an intermittency as a measure of a distance to the source, then the measurement should be done at the interval of intermittencies where it is mostly informative about the distance. Based on the figure, this should be around 0.5, where the slope of intermittency as a function of distance is the steepest. It would be much more reasonable to show an animal's ability to differentiate intermittency around this level. The ability to discriminate intermittency at the level of 0.15 tells us only that an animal can only extract information that the source is far away. This can be potentially done using other cues.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, based on Figure S1A our discrimination task, by design, is in essence asking if the mice can discriminate a far odor source (low intermittency) from an intermediate-near source (midhigh intermittency) and answers in the affirmative. This approach is reasonable as it addresses the main question of whether mice can discriminate intermittency at all. Additionally, it provides psychometric curves demonstrating discrimination even at relatively close intermittencies (i.e., between far and intermediate distances). Note that this is the first study every to do so in mammals. We agree that many additional and more refined questions follow from our work and we applaud the reviewer for suggesting such. We believe a design exploring what the just noticeable intermittency differences are across the entire proximal distal dimension would be the most informative study at this time, in particular when combined with bulbar and cortical recordings.</p><p>Please see our previous responses to your issue 3 as well, repeated below, but I hope our rationale is clearer now.</p><p>&quot;Intermittency drops as function of distance from the source (downwind). It also has a close to normal (with kurtosis) distribution across wind, peaking at the center (see e.g. Crimaldi 2002, Connor 2018). So, animals may encounter any and all intermittencies (0-1). Given our Go/NoGo paradigm we had to set a CS-/CS+ boundary. Typically, to generate an adequate psychometric curve using this paradign, either the CS- or CS+ stimuli need to represent a wide range of values of which the animals are required to compare against a narrow range (or single value). Again, bounded by effective behavioral paradigm design, the number of CS+ and CS- trials need to be even in order to appropriately motivate animals to engage in the task. Thus, considering the entire range of intermittency values animals can encounter while navigating through a plume in conjunction with effective behavioral design, we arrived at our chosen values for low and high intermittency.</p><p>As you can see in the above figure (and also reviewer #1, comment 2), I=0.15 is roughly at the knee where the monotonic decrease begins to asymptote. This is roughly true for all 3 concentration thresholds. Consequently, I=0.2-0.8 effectively samples the region where intermittency clearly relates to distance to the source, which is where we hypothesize animals.&quot;</p></body></sub-article></article>
