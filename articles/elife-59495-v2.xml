The <italic>H. pylori</italic> Cag T4SS includes a large membrane-spanning core complex containing five proteins, organized into an outer membrane cap (OMC), a periplasmic ring (PR) and a stalk. Here, we report cryo-EM reconstructions of a core complex lacking Cag3 and an improved map of the wild-type complex. We define the structures of two unique species-specific components (Cag3 and CagM) and show that Cag3 is structurally similar to CagT. Unexpectedly, components of the OMC are organized in a 1:1:2:2:5 molar ratio (CagY:CagX:CagT:CagM:Cag3). CagX and CagY are components of both the OMC and the PR and bridge the symmetry mismatch between these regions. These results reveal that assembly of the <italic>H. pylori</italic> T4SS core complex is dependent on incorporation of interwoven species-specific components.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Helicobacter pylori</kwd><kwd>type iv secretion</kwd><kwd>molecular machine</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>gastric cancer</kwd><kwd>bacterial protein secretion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI118932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cover</surname><given-names>Timothy L</given-names></name><name><surname>Ohi</surname><given-names>Melanie D</given-names></name><name><surname>Lacy</surname><given-names>D Borden</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI039657</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cover</surname><given-names>Timothy L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA116087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cover</surname><given-names>Timothy L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM103310</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ohi</surname><given-names>Melanie D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2T32DK007673</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sheedlo</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10OD020011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ohi</surname><given-names>Melanie D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5I01BX004447</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cover</surname><given-names>Timothy L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of a Type IV secretion system provides a framework for understanding assembly of a protein-injection machine.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>H. pylori</italic> colonizes the stomach in about half of the world’s human population, and its presence in the stomach is the strongest known risk factor for gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Uemura et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains containing a pathogenicity island (<italic>cag</italic> PAI), encoding CagA (a secreted effector protein) and the Cag T4SS, are associated with a significantly higher incidence of gastric cancer than that associated with strains lacking the <italic>cag</italic> PAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blaser et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cover, 2016</xref>). Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and there are nearly one million new gastric carcinoma cases annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Plummer et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, understanding the molecular organization of the Cag T4SS is an important goal.</p><p>Bacterial T4SSs are versatile molecular machines that can mediate a wide variety of functions, including horizontal transfer of DNA among bacteria (conjugation) and delivery of effector proteins into eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galán and Waksman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grohmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Waksman, 2019</xref>). T4SSs in Gram-negative bacteria are comprised of an inner membrane complex, a membrane-spanning core complex that extends from the inner membrane to the outer membrane, and in some systems, an extracellular pilus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galán and Waksman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grohmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Waksman, 2019</xref>). T4SSs vary in complexity, ranging from ‘minimized’ or ‘prototype’ systems that contain about 12 components (VirB1-11 and VirD4), as found in <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Xanthomonas citri,</italic> or conjugation systems, to expanded systems containing more than 20 components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhatty et al., 2013</xref>). Expanded T4SSs contain unique species-specific components and are much larger in size than their minimized counterparts. Examples of the larger, ‘expanded’ T4SSs include the Dot/Icm T4SSs of <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> and <italic>Coxiella</italic> and the Cag T4SS of <italic>H. pylori,</italic> each of which transports effector proteins into host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chetrit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frick-Cheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghosal et al., 2019</xref>). The <italic>Legionella</italic> Dot/Icm translocates more than 300 effector proteins, thereby allowing intracellular bacterial replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Qiu and Luo, 2017</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>H. pylori</italic> Cag T4SS is only known to deliver one effector protein, CagA (a bacterial oncoprotein), into gastric cells, resulting in altered cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cover et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Structural studies of minimized T4SSs have revealed a core complex (typically ~250 Å in width and ~150 Å in height) that contains three proteins (VirB7, VirB9, and VirB10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chandran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fronzes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Low et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sgro et al., 2018</xref>). The <italic>H. pylori</italic> Cag T4SS core complex is a much larger mushroom-shaped assembly (~400 Å in width and ~250 Å in height) that contains structural homologs of the proteins found in minimized systems [CagT (VirB7), CagX (VirB9), and CagY (VirB10)] along with additional proteins (Cag3 and CagM) that lack homologs in other bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frick-Cheng et al., 2016</xref>). The Cag T4SS core complex has been described as consisting of three distinct structural features: the outer membrane cap (OMC) consisting of an outer-layer (O-layer) and inner-layer (I-layer), a periplasmic ring (PR), and a stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). There is an apparent symmetry mismatch between the 14-fold-symmetric OMC and the 17-fold symmetric PR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2019</xref>). Our recent sub-4Å structure of the Cag T4SS revealed that central portions of the OMC are composed of CagT, CagX, and CagY (VirB7, VirB9, and VirB10 homologs), but the resolution of the map did not allow us to build molecular models for the entire complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, we could not determine the molecular composition of the PR or define the locations of Cag3 or CagM. In the current study, we undertook a further analysis of single particle cryo-EM data for the wild-type Cag T4SS core complex as well as analysis of a mutant form of the core complex. These efforts allow us to define the locations of Cag3 and CagM within the core complex, determine the molecular composition of the PR, and determine the stoichiometry of components within the OMC.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison between maps of the wild-type (WT) and ΔCag3 Cag T4SS core complex.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The Cag T4SS spans the inner membrane and outer membrane and consists of distinct features with differing symmetry: the OMC (C14 symmetry), the PR (C17 symmetry), an inner-membrane complex (IMC, C6 symmetry), and the stalk and collar with unknown symmetries.

All the raw micrographs used in the WT Cag T4SS 3D reconstructions were identical to the datasets used in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2019</xref>). Approximately 6000 high quality images were selected from ~20,000 images.~361,000 particles were selected by template picking in CryoSPARC. After 2D and 3D classification, the best class (~67,000 particles) was chosen for further refinement, without symmetry (C1). All the particles used in the 3D refinement of CryoSPARC were exported into RELION for further steps and the 4.7 Å 3D model with C1 symmetry was filtered to 60 Å resolution and used as an initial model for 3D structure determination in RELION. Focused 3D classification and 3D refinement were used to determine higher resolution maps of the WT OMC (with 14-fold symmetry), resulting in a 3D map of the OMC (14-fold symmetry) at 3.4 Å. Similar steps were applied to ΔCag3 Cag T4SS data. Approximately 3400 micrographs were collected and ~108,000 particles were selected by template picking in CryoSPARC. After the 2D/3D filtration and further refinement (3D map at 7.1 Å with C1 symmetry),~12,000 particles were exported into RELION for further steps. Focused 3D classification (without alignment) was used to determine higher resolution maps of the ΔCag3 OMC (with 14-fold symmetry) and the PR (with 17-fold symmetry). The maps of the OMC and PR were further refined using focused 3D refinement (with local refinement), resulting in 3D maps of the OMC (14-fold symmetry) and the PR (17-fold symmetry) at 3.1 Å and 3.0 Å, respectively.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59495-fig1-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM processing of the ΔCag3 Cag T4SS core complex.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Sub-area of a motion-corrected image of vitrified ΔCag3 Cag T4SS particles.

When comparing the maps reconstructed from the WT and Δ<italic>cag3</italic> strains, peripheral components of the O-layer of the OMC are missing in the Δ<italic>cag3</italic> map. At least a portion of this peripheral density is likely composed of Cag3, since it is the component most notably absent in core complex preparations from the Δ<italic>cag3</italic> mutant [based on SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>)]. Notably, the PR remained intact in the Δ<italic>cag3</italic> map, and weak density was still observed within the I-layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>).</p><p>As described previously, CagT and the C-terminal portions of CagX (residues 349–514) and CagY (residues 1677–1909) are localized to central regions of the O-layer of the OMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2019</xref>). The increased resolution of the new maps allowed us to define the OMC asymmetric unit and determine the molecular composition of regions that were previously undefined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Positioned adjacent and peripheral to the previously described CagT (CagT-1), we identified another copy of CagT which we call CagT-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3a</xref>). We found that the two copies of CagT differ significantly in the conformations of both their N- and C-termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). In CagT-1, the N-terminus is an extended loop that is nestled against a portion of CagT-1 and CagX from the neighboring asymmetric unit, resulting in an interface similar to what was described for <italic>X. citri</italic> VirB7 and VirB9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sgro et al., 2018</xref>). Within CagT-2, the N-terminus adopts a different conformation, one in which it is wrapped back around the central, globular VirB7-like fold, forming a β-strand that completes a β-sheet within an adjacent protein that we designate as Cag3-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c–f</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). This rearrangement likely occurs due to changes in a stretch of amino acids (I44-I50) within the center of this loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>). While it is currently not clear what drives these conformational differences, it is possible that this rearrangement results from the different repertoire of binding partners mediated by this loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d–f</xref>). Despite the structural differences between CagT-1 and CagT-2, a putative lipidation site (C21) in both proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McClain et al., 2020</xref>) is placed in close proximity to the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). The C-termini of both CagT molecules adopt extended conformations that differ in their overall direction and organization. In CagT-1, the C-terminal α-helices extend outward from the center of the map, forming contacts with CagT-1 Cag3-1, Cag3-2, and Cag3-4 within the OMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2019</xref>). Conversely, the C-terminal α-helices of CagT-2 are connected by an apparently dynamic linker and are arranged such that they contact a distinct repertoire of OMC proteins, including Cag3-1, Cag3-2, and CagM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). In both cases, the arrangement of these helical extensions deviates significantly from corresponding regions in the <italic>X. citri</italic> VirB7 structure, where the domain terminates shortly after the core VirB7 fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sgro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Because of this, we suggest that the addition of these C-terminal α-helices is critical to maintaining the expanded architecture of the Cag T4SS OMC, as it has been previously shown that Cag3 cannot be effectively incorporated into core complexes lacking CagT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frick-Cheng et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The asymmetric unit of the WT and ΔCag3 Cag T4SS core complex.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A cross-section model of the mapped portions of CagY (yellow), CagX (orange), CagT (red and salmon), CagM (brown and tan), and Cag3 (various shades of green and blue) in the OMC from the WT Cag T4SS.

In addition to the loss of peripheral density corresponding to Cag3 within the Δ<italic>cag3</italic> map, we observe no density for CagT-2 in the Δ<italic>cag3</italic> map. One possible explanation for the loss of CagT-2 is that it cannot effectively fold when Cag3 is absent, leading to dissociation of the complex or unfolding of the protein.

The PR is mostly comprised of a globular domain formed by an N-terminal portion of CagX, which starts from the cytoplasm-facing side of the PR, wraps back and forth to form two β-sheets, and ends in an α-helix pointed towards the OMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). The N-terminal domain of CagX is homologous to the N-terminal domain of <italic>X. citri</italic> VirB9 (RMSD of 0.8 Å, PDB 6GYB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b–d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sgro et al., 2018</xref>). The C-terminal domain of CagX is also highly similar to its <italic>X. citri</italic> counterpart (RMSD of 0.6 Å, PDB 6GYB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e,f</xref>). The major difference between the two proteins is the presence of an insertion within CagX that forms a long α-helix in the center of the molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d,g</xref>). Because of this feature, the N- and C-terminal domains of <italic>H. pylori</italic> CagX are positioned ~200 Å apart (within the PR and OMC, respectively), whereas the corresponding domains of <italic>X. citri</italic> VirB9 are ~80 Å apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8h</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>CagX and CagY comprise the PR.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The PR is comprised of N-terminal portions of CagX and a fragment of CagY. Both proteins start from the inner membrane side of the PR, form small globular folds, and extend upward toward the outer membrane. A portion of CagY within the PR wraps around CagX, starting from the periplasm and winding into the lumen of the PR. (<bold>b</bold>) The N-terminal domain of CagX (residues 41–310) is similar to that of VirB9 (<bold>c</bold>) from <italic>X. citri</italic> in both structure and sequence (<bold>d</bold>). The C-terminal domain of CagX (<bold>e</bold>) is similar to that of the C-terminal domain of VirB9 from <italic>X. citri</italic> (<bold>f</bold>). (<bold>g</bold>) The periplasmic and outer membrane domains (PD and OMD, respectively) are similar in structurally characterized VirB9 homologs, though they are separated by a periplasmic linker (PL) that is variable in length. CagX contains an additional insertion (residues 102–153, periplasmic insertion or PI) that is unique when compared to other homologs. The structure corresponding to the PI was not observed within any of our cryo-EM reconstructions. (<bold>h</bold>) The spacing of the two CagX/VirB9 domains varies depending on the organism and appears to be highly dependent on the length of the periplasmic linker (CagX and VirB9 are shown in orange). (<bold>i</bold>) The segment of CagY within the PR (residues 1469–1603) adopts a highly elongated fold that consists of four α-helices (left). The periplasmic portion of CagY (as shown on the left) starts within the periplasm and wraps around the globular domain of CagX (shown in orange), eventually ending in the lumen of the PR (gray, right). (<bold>j</bold>) The periplasmic segment of CagY, which we call the periplasmic domain (PD, brown), is unique to CagY and is not present in other VirB10 homologs such as VirB10 from <italic>X. citri</italic> (yellow indicates a VirB10 like domain, and red represents the unstructured linker). (<bold>k</bold>) The N-terminus of CagY was not observed within any of these cryo-EM reconstructions.

In both cases, a segment of CagY/VirB10 in this region is linked to the C-terminal portion of the protein through a linker which is not directly observed in the data. Both CagY and <italic>X. citri</italic> VirB10 start with the N-terminus of this portion positioned near the periplasmic space and pass ‘below’ two protomers of CagX/VirB9. Both proteins then extend upward toward the outer membrane through the interior of the ring formed by the N-terminal domain of CagX/VirB9. The CagX-CagY interface in <italic>H. pylori</italic> is much larger than the corresponding VirB9-VirB10 interface, likely due to an expansion of CagY compared to VirB10 homologs in minimized systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8j</xref>). The position of CagY within the PR could potentially allow the unresolved segment (residues 1604–1676) to span the inner chamber of the OMC to connect with a C-terminal domain of CagY in the OMC. We note that the portion of CagY visible in the PR is positioned so that the remaining N-terminal 1468 residues (not observed) likely extend into the periplasm, possibly contributing to the low resolution ‘collar’ and stalk densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8k</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The identification of CagX and CagY within the PR was unexpected, as it suggests that each protein exists within both the OMC and PR, two distinct regions of the T4SS that differ in overall symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>). Although we cannot specifically trace either component across the symmetry mismatch, we note that the long helical expansion within CagX appears to bridge the OMC and PR. This model is supported by focused refinement of the connecting region between the OMC and PR in the WT map without imposition of symmetry, which shows 14 tubes of helical density connecting the OMC and PR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>). Notably, only 14 copies of CagX within the PR appear to traverse the symmetry mismatch, leaving three domains within the PR without an obvious connection to the OMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). It is not clear if the density corresponding to these copies of CagX and CagY cannot be traced due to inherent flexibility within the respective C-terminal domains, if these additional protomers represent truncated versions of CagX and CagY, or if they represent uncharacterized structural homologs.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>CagX and CagY span the symmetry mismatch between the OMC and PR.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Models of CagX and CagY within the OMC and PR asymmetric units.

We have identified the positions of all five core complex proteins, including the previously uncharacterized Cag3 and CagM. A notable discovery is the structural conservation between central domains of CagT and Cag3, a result which could not have been predicted based on sequence comparisons alone. Our finding that the Cag T4SS incorporates multiple copies of Cag3, CagM and CagT into the OMC allows for a refined understanding of how this very large complex is assembled from only a few components. The current analysis also provides a better understanding of how the components of the Cag T4SS are arranged, highlighting important interactions among the newly described components. Specifically, interactions between CagT-1-CagT-2, CagT-1-Cag3-1, Cag3-Cag3, Cag3-CagM, and CagM-CagX have all been localized within this map. Although this study presents the first structural description of these interactions, it is interesting to note that many of these interactions have been previously detected by various biochemical methods. Specifically, interactions between Cag3-Cag3, Cag3-CagT, Cag3-CagM, CagX-CagM, and CagT-CagM were previous detected using a yeast two-hybrid screening approach or by studies of recombinant proteins produced in <italic>E. coli,</italic> and are consistent with the structural observations reported here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Busler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kutter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smart et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, the structural detail obtained from single particle cryo-EM analysis reveals the context of these interactions, allowing us to define which interactions occur within one asymmetric unit and which interactions occur between adjacent asymmetric units.</p><p>The structure that we present here provides an improved understanding of how the PR is assembled and highlights the presence of portions of CagX and CagY within the PR. We show that CagX and CagY assemble to form portions of both the OMC and PR, bridging the previously described symmetry mismatch within the core complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2019</xref>). Although the existence of CagX and CagY in both the OMC and PR seems inconsistent with the observed symmetry mismatch, it should be noted that this is not the first example of such a phenomenon. Indeed, a similar phenomenon has been detected in the Type Three Secretion System (T3SS) of <italic>Salmonella,</italic> in which one molecule (InvG) exists on both sides of a C15-C16 symmetry mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2018</xref>). Symmetry mismatch has been observed in multiple types of bacterial secretion systems or other large bacterial machines, including T2SSs, T3SSs, the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> Dot/Icm T4SS, T6SSs, and the <italic>Salmonella</italic> flagellar motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chernyatina and Low, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dix et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting an important physiological function for this architecture. The mechanisms by which symmetry mismatch arises in these systems have not yet been determined, and the functional consequences of symmetry mismatch in these systems remain unclear. Interestingly, no symmetry mismatch has been observed in core complexes of minimized T4SS systems such as the <italic>X. citri</italic> T4SS, which contain 14 copies of both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of VirB9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sgro et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>When comparing the <italic>H. pylori</italic> Cag T4SS core complex to corresponding T4SS subassemblies in other species, there are striking differences. Most notably, the Cag T4SS core complex is much larger in size than core complexes in prototype systems, and it contains two species-specific components (Cag3 and CagM). The CagT, CagX and CagY components of the Cag T4SS are homologs of VirB7, VirB9 and VirB10 components of prototype systems, but there are marked differences in the sequences and structures. Finally, the Cag T4SS core complex includes a PR feature, which has not been detected in prototype systems. In the current study, we discovered that the portions of CagX and CagY within the PR are similar to the parts of VirB9 and VirB10 which reside in the I-layer of the <italic>X. citri</italic> T4SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sgro et al., 2018</xref>). Because of this relationship, it is perhaps appropriate to consider the PR of the Cag T4SS and the I-layer of the <italic>X. citri</italic> T4SS as analogous structures. However, there are several important distinctions. First, the difference in symmetry between the OMC and the PR of the <italic>H. pylori</italic> Cag T4SS contrasts the C14 symmetry observed throughout the <italic>X. citri</italic> T4SS core complex. Second, the position of the <italic>X. citri</italic> T4SS I-layer within the OMC (~115 Å below the outer membrane, as determined by the position of the membrane spanning helices) is similar to that of the I-layer of the Cag T4SS (positioned ~120 Å beneath the outer membrane, and composed of CagM). Therefore, in comparison to the Cag T4SS PR, the I-layer within the <italic>X. citri</italic> T4SS is positioned much closer to the OMC. The functional roles of these structures are currently unclear, but we speculate that the OMC I-layer and the PR represent structural expansions within the Cag T4SS that are associated with specific functions. Future investigations building on the current structural studies will be needed to develop a more complete understanding of the similarities and differences that exist among T4SSs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> 26695)</td><td valign="top">HA-CagF</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26758182">26758182</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">produces HA epitope-tagged CagF</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> 26695)</td><td valign="top">Δ<italic>cag3;</italic> HA-CagF</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26758182">26758182</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Δ<italic>cag3</italic> mutant, produces HA epitope-tagged CagF</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Leginon</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15890530">15890530</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MotionCor2</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28250466">28250466</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">CTFFind4</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26278980">26278980</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">cryoSPARC</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28165473">28165473</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">RELION</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27685097">27685097</ext-link> <break/>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30412051">30412051</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Coot</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20383002">20383002</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">UCSF Chimera</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15264254">15264254</ext-link> <break/>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29340616">29340616</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">PHENIX</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29872004">29872004</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">DALI server</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31263867">31263867</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Core complex purification</title><p>Cag T4SS complexes were purified from either a wild-type <italic>H. pylori</italic> strain or a <italic>∆cag3</italic> mutant strain, each engineered to produce an epitope-tagged form of CagF, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frick-Cheng et al., 2016</xref>).

The grids were vitrified by plunge-freezing in a slurry of liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4°C and 100% humidity.</p><p>All the images were collected on a Thermo Fisher 300 kV Titan Krios electron microscope equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit Direct Electron Detector. The nominal pixel sizes for WT and ΔCag3 samples were 1.64 Å per pixel (x18,000 magnification) and 1.00 Å per pixel (x29,000 magnification), respectively.

Different defocus ranges were used for each sample (−2.5 to −3.5 μm for WT and −1.5 to −3.5 μm for ΔCag3) as they had different ice-thicknesses. All the raw images for WT samples were identical to the datasets used in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2019</xref>).

Two different image processing software packages, cryoSPARC and Relion3.0, were used for different types of processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>). For analysis of the WT Cag T4SS, 361,706 particles were picked from 5,980 micrographs using the template picker in cryoSPARC. The selected particles were then extracted with a 510 pixel box size (1.64 Å/pixel) and used to generate representative 2D classes. After the 2D classification, classes with clear secondary structural features and intact particles were retained (corresponding to 77,133 particles). The particles in these classes were then subjected to a 3D classification with a reference-free initial 3D model (<italic>ab initio</italic> model in cryoSPARC). The best 3D class (approximately 70,000 particles) was used as the reference for 3D refinement with C1 symmetry (lowpass filtered to 60 Å). Finally, a solvent mask and B-factor were applied to improve the overall features and resolution of the map, resulting in reconstruction of a 3D electron density map with a global resolution of 4.7 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). For the ΔCag3 Cag T4SS dataset, 107,917 particles were selected using template picker in cryoSPARC and extracted with a 510 pixel box size (1.00 Å/pixel). After 2D and 3D particle filtering steps, approximately 12,000 particles were retained and subjected to 3D refinement with C1 symmetry. Subsequently, a solvent mask and B-factor were applied, resulting in reconstruction of a 3D map with 7.1 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The particle stacks used in 3D refinements of WT and ∆Cag3 Cag T4SSs were then exported to Relion for further steps, such as per-particle CTF refinement and focused refinement. In the freezing step, the formation of relatively thick ice was necessary because of the very large size of the complexes (height,~470 Å). In addition, thin carbon support film (continuous ultra-thin carbon film) was used to overcome preferred particle orientation in vitrified ice. Within the conditions, different particles were situated at different heights within the field of view, causing per-particle defocus variations within a micrograph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, to reconstruct high resolution 3D models, per-particle defocus refinement and beam tilt estimation were applied, followed by 3D auto-refinements, which yielded a final resolution of 4.5 Å (for the WT Cag T4SS) and 5.3 Å (for the ΔCag3 Cag T4SS) with no symmetry applied.</p><p>For focused refinement of the WT OMC, signal subtraction for each individual particle containing the OMC was used with a soft mask. After signal subtraction and alignment-free focused 3D classification, one highly populated 3D class of OMC was produced (~47,000 particles). The best 3D class was then subjected to a masked 3D refinement, resulting in reconstruction of the 3D map at 3.6 Å resolution. Another round of per-particle defocus refinement and beam tilt estimation was applied, followed by another focused 3D refinement, which yielded a final resolution of 3.4 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Similar steps were used for focused refinement of the ΔCag3 OMC and PR, starting with signal subtraction of the sub-complex for each particle.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;.

(If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an important study that will be received with great interest. It expands on the group's previous contributions towards understanding the molecular organization of the core complex from the <italic>H. pylori</italic> Cag T4SS. The group presents single particle cryoEM analyses of a core complex from a Cag3-deficient strain (<italic>Δcag3</italic>) and re-analyzed data previously collected for wild-type core complexes to obtain higher resolution maps. Their previous publication in <italic>eLife</italic> (Chung et al., 2019) described the general features of the structure: an outer membrane complex (OMC or OMCC) with 14-fold symmetry and a periplasmic ring complex (PR or PRC) with 17-fold symmetry. The previous OMC structure presented an inner and outer ring connected by &quot;spokes&quot;, with the inner ring consisting of 14 copies each of CagT and the C-terminal domains of CagX and CagY. In the present study the improved resolution of the spokes and outer ring enabled the authors to trace the partial chains of a 14 copies of {a second CagT subunit, 5 Cag3 subunits and 2 CagM subunits}. This results in a 1:1:2:2:5 CagY:CagX:CagT:CagM:Cag3 molar ratio for the OMC. Also, in the previous study the PRC was modeled as 17 copies of a polyalanine chain of unknown sequence, speculated at the time to be made of CagM. In the present study this the PRC is in fact shown to consist of 17 copies of the N-terminal domain of CagX plus 17 copies of a segment from CagY. Finally, the authors present experimental evidence that suggests a possible explanation for the symmetry mismatch between the OMC and PR that both contain portions of CagX and CagY proteins.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Atomic models of the 4 structures were provided but the corresponding EM maps were not. Therefore, this reviewer was not able to determine how well the sequence matches the density in the previously ambiguous regions of the map, especially for the CagM and Cag3 subunits in the OMCC and the CagY fragments in the PRC. Supplementary figures showing the quality of the EM map in these regions should be included.</p><p>2) The suggestion that the symmetry mismatch may involve the proteolysis of CagX and/or CagY proteins (so that 17 copies contribute to the PR while only 14 contribute to the OMC) needs some experimental support. One suggestion is to use SDS-PAGE of the samples: 3/17 = 17% proteolysis should be detectable. In any case, such electrophoretic analysis of the samples should be provided as supplementary material.</p><p>3) The reviewers felt that additional evidence was also required for the stoichiometry and organisation of Cag3, CagM and CagX/Y. Suggestions for how to do this involved cross-linking mass spec, but the reviewers were open to other approaches. The comments from the reviewers were as follows:</p><p>– The number of Cag3 and their organization should be probed by cross-linking mass spectrometry.</p><p>– More importantly, same applies to CagM and CagX/CagY which belong to the two subcomplexes.</p><p>– The proposed 1:1:2:2:5 stoichiometry for X:Y:M:T:3 should also be confirmed by alternate methods.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59495.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Atomic models of the 4 structures were provided but the corresponding EM maps were not.

We are happy to provide the maps, but we also want the publication to demonstrate the quality of both the models and the maps in all regions for which we have determined structures. We have added six supplementary figures to Figure 2 (Figure 2—figure supplements 1-6). These new figures show the quality of the maps and models within the OMC/PR for both the WT and ΔCag3 complexes. We have also mentioned this in the Materials and methods section (subsection “Model Building and Refinement”). Additionally, we have added a supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) discussing CagT-1 and CagT-2 interactions, which includes a panel (panel F) highlighting the quality of density that is observed at these interfaces. We have also added a panel to another new supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 2) to show the quality of the map and models of all the C-terminal helices of CagT-1 and CagT-2 in both the WT and ΔCag3 maps. To address concerns regarding the register and the quality of density in the peripheral copies of Cag3, we have included a supplementary figure (Figure 6—figure supplement 1) that depicts the density in these areas, including examples that indicate the presence of a strand-exchange with adjacent molecules (panel F). Finally, we have revised panels in Figure 7 (panels A and B) to better demonstrate the quality of data in the portions of the map corresponding to CagM-1 and CagM-2. Collectively, these additional figures provide readers with a better understanding of the quality of the EM maps and provide reassurance that the maps closely match the assigned sequences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The suggestion that the symmetry mismatch may involve the proteolysis of CagX and/or CagY proteins (so that 17 copies contribute to the PR while only 14 contribute to the OMC) needs some experimental support.

In any case, such electrophoretic analysis of the samples should be provided as supplementary material.</p></disp-quote><p>We suggested proteolysis as one of several possible models that could account for 14 copies of CagX/CagY in the OMC and 17 copies in the PR. In line with suggestions from the reviewers, we have revised the manuscript to clarify that there are multiple possible explanations for how symmetry mismatch can arise.</p><p>“It is not clear if the density corresponding to these copies of CagX and CagY cannot be traced due to inherent flexibility within the respective C-terminal domains, if these additional protomers represent truncated versions of CagX and CagY, or if they represent uncharacterized structural homologs.”</p><p>We also comment that despite the presence of symmetry mismatch in several types of secretion systems, the mechanisms by which symmetry mismatch arises have not been established.</p><p>“Although the existence of CagX and CagY in both the OMC and PR seems inconsistent with the observed symmetry mismatch, it should be noted that this is not the first example of such a phenomenon. […] The mechanisms by which symmetry mismatch arises in these systems have not yet been determined, and the functional consequences of symmetry mismatch in these systems remains unclear.”</p><p>It would be almost impossible for us to confidently detect or exclude ~17% proteolysis of CagX and/or CagY using SDS-PAGE analysis. In response to the last sentence of this comment, we have included SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometric analyses of the wild-type and ∆<italic>cag3</italic> core complex samples in Figure 1—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reviewers felt that additional evidence was also required for the stoichiometry and organisation of Cag3, CagM and CagX/Y.

In the revised manuscript, we show additional data that further describe the basis for our high level of confidence in matching protein sequences to specific regions of the EM maps and determining the register of individual Cag proteins (see response to point 1 above). We have previously attempted cross-linking mass spectrometry analysis of the Cag T4SS core complex samples without success. The difficulty is probably attributable to multiple factors, including the low concentration of T4SS complexes extracted from <italic>H. pylori</italic>, non-specific aggregation of the complexes, and the complexity of the structures (each of which contains 5 different proteins in multiple copies, with a total of 154 proteins per complex, as proposed in our model). Even under the best of circumstances, cross-linking mass spectrometry would not corroborate the number of Cag3 proteins or provide information about the overall stoichiometry. On the other hand, numerous experiments have been done previously by multiple groups (including one of the author’s labs) to define protein-protein interactions among Cag core complex components. The cryo-EM results reported in the current manuscript match very well with the results of these previous studies (including yeast two-hybrid experiments and studies of recombinant proteins produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>). In our revised manuscript, we now discuss the previous studies and explain how they support the cryo-EM findings pertaining to the organization of Cag3, CagM, CagT, and CagX/Y.</p><p>“The current analysis also provides a better understanding of how the components of the Cag T4SS are arranged, highlighting important interactions among the newly described components. […] Importantly, the structural detail obtained from single particle cryo-EM analysis reveals the context of these interactions, allowing us to define which interactions occur within one asymmetric unit and which interactions occur between adjacent asymmetric units.”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
