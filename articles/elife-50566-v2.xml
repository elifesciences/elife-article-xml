Here we define the logic of this transformation in a <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> integrating interneuron. AIA interneurons receive input from multiple chemosensory neurons that detect attractive odors. We show that reliable AIA responses require the coincidence of two sensory inputs: activation of AWA olfactory neurons that are activated by attractive odors, and inhibition of one or more chemosensory neurons that are inhibited by attractive odors. AWA activates AIA through an electrical synapse, while the disinhibitory pathway acts through glutamatergic chemical synapses. AIA interneurons have bistable electrophysiological properties consistent with their calcium dynamics, suggesting that AIA activation is a stereotyped response to an integrated stimulus. Our results indicate that AIA interneurons combine sensory information using AND-gate logic, requiring coordinated activity from multiple chemosensory neurons. We propose that AIA encodes positive valence based on an integrated sensory state.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>sensory integration</kwd><kwd>neural circuits</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dobosiewicz</surname><given-names>May</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Qiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Bargmann</surname><given-names>Cornelia I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dobosiewicz</surname><given-names>May</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Qiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Bargmann</surname><given-names>Cornelia I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Kavli Neural Systems Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Qiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A pair of interneurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> condenses information from multiple sensory neurons into a uniform response, using an AND-gate logic to represent a stimulus with positive valence.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory environments are complex, and can include multiple signals within and across sensory modalities. Individual stimuli and the combinations in which they occur may differentially signal the presence of beneficial, harmful, or neutral conditions. Accordingly, integration across sensory inputs is an essential function of the nervous system, and the logic of integration is an area of active investigation.</p><p>The compact <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> nervous system, with 302 neurons and a complete neuronal wiring diagram, is well-suited for studying sensory representation and integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cook et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> uses volatile and water-soluble cues to detect its food and other relevant stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bargmann, 2006</xref>). Its highly developed chemosensory system senses a large number of attractive and repulsive compounds using over a thousand different G-protein-coupled chemoreceptors, many of which are expressed by eleven pairs of chemosensory neurons in the amphid sensory organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Robertson and Thomas, 2006</xref>). Specific subsets of chemosensory neurons have reproducible functions in chemotaxis and avoidance of chemical stimuli, spontaneous locomotion, physiology, development, and lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bargmann, 2006</xref>). AWA and AWC sensory neurons, for example, drive chemotaxis toward a variety of attractive odors, whereas AWB sensory neurons drive avoidance of certain repellents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bargmann et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Troemel et al., 1997</xref>). Notably, sensory neurons may be either activated or inhibited by odors. For example, AWA is activated by the attractive odor diacetyl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shinkai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Larsch et al., 2013</xref>), whereas AWC is inhibited by another attractive odor, isoamyl alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chalasani et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>At the first layer of neuronal integration, the sensory neurons form abundant chemical and electrical synapses onto a half-dozen pairs of interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White et al., 1986</xref>). The interneurons regulate behaviors such as reversal frequency, speed, and head turning during thermotaxis, chemotaxis, and spontaneous locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iino and Yoshida, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsalik and Hobert, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hendricks et al., 2012</xref>). Interneuron responses are variable and complex, and can incorporate feedback from network states and motor systems as well as sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hendricks et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaplan et al., 2018</xref>). Synaptic mechanisms linking interneurons to locomotor states have been defined, but the computations that interneurons perform to integrate multiple sensory inputs are unknown.</p><p>The AIA interneuron pair receives chemical or electrical synapses from all eleven pairs of amphid chemosensory neurons, suggesting an integrative function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White et al., 1986</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). At a behavioral level, AIA is implicated in the suppression of reversal behavior upon odor addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Larsch et al., 2015</xref>), integration of attractive and repulsive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shinkai et al., 2011</xref>), olfactory desensitization at short and long timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalasani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2016</xref>), and regulation of spontaneous reversals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">López-Cruz et al., 2019</xref>). Functional calcium imaging has demonstrated that AIA can be activated by the attractive odors diacetyl and isoamyl alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Larsch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalasani et al., 2010</xref>), which are primarily sensed by AWA and AWC neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bargmann et al., 1993</xref>). In both cases, AIA activity rises in the presence of an attractive food-related odor.</p><p>Here, we use an optogenetic approach to isolate the connections between individual sensory neurons and AIA. We find that AIA uses AND-gate logic to integrate sensory information. AIA is reliably activated only by coordinated sensory information from multiple neurons, and this activation is mediated by both chemical and electrical synapses. A bistable current-voltage relationship provides a biophysical mechanism for the nonlinear AIA response. Our results suggest that AIA represents a positive valence that is integrated across sensory inputs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optogenetic activation of AWA sensory neurons elicits unreliable AIA calcium responses</title><p>AWA sensory neurons expressing genetically-encoded calcium indicators such as GCaMP respond to the bacterial odorant diacetyl with fluorescence increases indicating depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shinkai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Larsch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zaslaver et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hale et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Larsch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2018</xref>).

(<bold>D</bold>) Individual AWA calcium responses to direct Chrimson excitation (617 nm) using various 474 nm light levels to excite GCaMP. Under strong illumination of GCaMP with 474 nm light (full power of LED, 165 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>), GCaMP fluorescence did not increase with subsequent 617 nm stimulation, presumably because of direct Chrimson excitation by 474 nm light. At lower 474 nm light levels (15–65 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>), or using a duty cycle with 10 ms of illumination every 100 s (10% of 40–165 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>), GCaMP fluorescence transiently increased but returned to a baseline that allowed a subsequent Chrimson response to 617 nm light. Chrimson responses were partly suppressed under continuous 474 nm illumination or at the highest light level at 10% illumination, suggesting some cross-activation. The 10% duty cycle at 40 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> minimized the initial transient response to 474 nm while providing a strong signal to noise ratio at 617 nm. The 10% duty cycle at 15 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> was too dim for AIA GCaMP experiments. In general, the 10 ms/100 ms duty cycle for 474 nm illumination is used for GCaMP experiments because strobing reduces motion artefacts, and because the duty cycle minimizes GCaMP photobleaching during long-term imaging. AWA had normal responses to 1.15 µM diacetyl when using the 10% duty cycle of 40 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>; this light level was used for all Chrimson experiments.

Thresholds depend on the standard deviation (STD) of either fluorescence or time derivative of the 10 s window preceding the stimulus.

A fluorescence threshold of 2 STD marks an inflection point in number of traces called ‘responses’ to pulses of buffer, such that a lower fluorescence threshold would include false positives. The time derivative threshold of 1 STD marks another inflection point such that higher thresholds begin to exclude events for all stimuli. All subsequent analyses use the thresholds of 2 STD for fluorescence and 1 STD for time derivative. The chosen time derivative threshold is useful for constraining the response timing for latency analyses rather than excluding traces based on slope or shape.

The GCaMP fluorescence baseline in AIA was stable, with little spontaneous activity, and nearly all AIA neurons responded to the higher odor concentrations (115 nM and 1.15 µM diacetyl) with an average delay of ~1 s relative to AWA activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D and F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B–C</xref>). At the lowest tested diacetyl concentration (11.5 nM) AIA responded with a lower probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>), and a delay of ~2 s relative to AWA responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Thus AIA responses to diacetyl are coupled to odor and dose-dependent. These AIA properties differ from those of AIB interneurons, which have spontaneous calcium fluctuations and variable sensory responses at all odor concentrations due to a strong effect of downstream motor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kato et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>At an individual trial level, AWA::Chrimson stimulation elicited AIA responses with a low probability and a delay, and these responses were much less robust than AIA responses elicited by diacetyl at a comparable level of AWA activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). AWA::Chrimson elicited calcium increases in 85% of AWA sensory neurons within one second of optogenetic stimulation, resembling 115 nM diacetyl, but only 56% of the AIA interneurons were activated. Moreover, the AIA calcium transients were delayed by &gt;6 s on average relative to the AWA response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Thus AIA calcium responses to AWA::Chrimson were unreliable.</p><p>Control experiments indicated that these differences were robust to transgenes or stimulus protocols. AWA::Chrimson animals had normal AIA and AWA responses to diacetyl, before or after light stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3C</xref>), and the AIA response latency was not correlated with GCaMP fluorescence levels or AWA::Chrimson transgene expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D–E</xref>). Animals were routinely subjected to two stimulus pulses of light or odor; these responses were slightly biased toward the first stimulus but largely independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3F–R</xref>). Animals that responded to both stimulus pulses had correlated response magnitudes between the two pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3J,N and R</xref>). However, the latencies of responses were not correlated between the first and second pulse of 11.5 nM diacetyl or AWA::Chrimson stimulation, indicating that reliability is primarily a trial-to-trial property and not due to variation between animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3I,M and Q</xref>).</p><p>Close examination of the AIA calcium signals revealed that the response rise dynamics to diacetyl or AWA::Chrimson stimulation were similar; the major differences were in their probability and latency. When aligned to the beginning of an AIA calcium response, positive AIA trials had similar rise times, whether elicited by optogenetic stimulation or by diacetyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>).

In the absence of food odor, glutamatergic sensory neurons release glutamate and activate glutamate-gated chloride channels on AIA, preventing AWA from activating AIA. In the presence of food odor, AWA is activated, glutamatergic sensory neurons are inhibited, and AIA is disinhibited and more sensitive to AWA depolarization, resulting in reliable activation. Weak odor or optogenetic stimuli engage a subset of sensory neurons, resulting in a variable and delayed response in AIA.

To seek biophysical evidence for this nonlinearity, we recorded AIA voltage responses to electrophysiological current injections in dissected animals using step and ramp injection protocols under current clamp. We found that AIA membrane potential was bistable, with one stable state near the resting potential of −80 mV and a second state near −20 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Multiple <italic>C. elegans</italic> sensory neurons respond to an attractive odor such as diacetyl or isoamyl alcohol with cell type-specific dynamics and signs. The sensory neurons signal the presence of odor to AIA using electrical synapses (AWA) or glutamatergic chemical synapses (AWC, ASK). AIA does not respond reliably to input from a single sensory neuron. Rather, AIA is activated by coordinated inputs from multiple sensory neurons, functioning as an AND-gate that requires both activation by AWA, and disinhibition from glutamatergic neurons including AWC and ASK.</p><p>We propose the following model for AIA integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In the absence of food odor, glutamatergic sensory neurons release glutamate that activates glutamate-gated chloride channels on AIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">López-Cruz et al., 2019</xref>). The chloride current decreases AIA membrane resistance, preventing AIA activation via the AWA-AIA electrical synapse. In the presence of food odor, glutamatergic sensory neurons are inhibited, the glutamate-gated chloride channels close, and AIA disinhibition and increased AIA resistance make it more sensitive to depolarizing inputs. At the same time, food odors activate AWA, driving AWA depolarization and calcium action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), and transmission of this information through AWA-to-AIA gap junctions depolarizes AIA to the plateau potential of −20 mV.</p><p>The properties of the AND-gate and the contributing neurons explain both the low probability of an AIA response and the delayed response to weak odor stimuli. For both diacetyl and isoamyl alcohol, AIA activation lags behind the first sensory neuron to detect odor, matching the arrival of the second input. The sensory neurons, in turn, can contribute to this delay. At low odor levels, the inhibition of the glutamatergic sensory neurons reported by calcium imaging is graded and gradual. Similarly, the first AWA action potential lags behind stimulus onset by about a second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). As a result, the synchronization of the disinhibitory and excitatory sensory inputs required for the AND-gate are delayed at low stimulus levels.</p><p>AIA membrane potential is bistable, with a sharp threshold that separates stable states near −80 mV and −20 mV. The depolarized state resembles the plateau potentials first reported in <italic>C. elegans</italic> RMD motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mellem et al., 2008</xref>) and subsequently observed in a number of other <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons that have a high resistance regime between stable low and high voltage states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). The intrinsic bistability of AIA creates a threshold nonlinearity that shapes the response to synaptic inputs. The synaptic inputs are predicted to increase depolarizing current (through AWA gap junctions) and to increase membrane resistance (by closing glutamate-gated chloride channels), and therefore could have the multiplicative effect on voltage classically defined by Ohm’s law. A preferential effect of AWA gap junctions on depolarizing current, and inhibitory chemical synapses on membrane resistance and shunting, provide a plausible mechanism for the AIA AND-gate.</p><p>The AND-gate is an established motif in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchler et al., 2003</xref>), and bears similarity to the related concept of coincidence detection in neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koch, 1999</xref>). In contrast with computational models of neurons based on additive inputs onto the target neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dayan and Abbott, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCulloch and Pitts, 1943</xref>), the AND-gate computation is nonlinear and multiplicative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koch, 1999</xref>). In the context of AIA, this logical computation requires multiple sensory neurons to report the presence of an attractant, an integrative step that may filter out environmental noise. Based on our results with diacetyl and isoamyl alcohol, it appears that different combinations of sensory neurons can generate the disinhibition and excitation necessary for reliable AIA activation.</p><p>It is interesting to compare AIA to another well-characterized olfactory interneuron, AIB. AIB activity rises when odors such as isoamyl alcohol are removed, triggering aversive behaviors such as reversals and turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chalasani et al., 2007</xref>). The coupling of strong odor stimuli to AIB activity is less reliable than coupling to AIA: stimuli that drive AIA responses in over 90% of trials, drive AIB responses in only 57% of trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordus et al., 2015</xref>). At a circuit level, AIB variability results from its integration of sensory input with the downstream motor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordus et al., 2015</xref>), and AIB activity is highly correlated with the activity of other neurons that drive reversals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kato et al., 2015</xref>). AIA activity has not been studied systematically with respect to network states, although it appears to rise during transitions to forward locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laurent et al., 2015</xref>). In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> wiring diagram, AIA receives three times as many synapses from sensory neurons as from interneurons, and AIB receives equal numbers of synapses from sensory neurons and interneurons, perhaps explaining why AIA activity is more closely coupled to sensory state, and less to motor state, than AIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White et al., 1986</xref>). That said, motor states were not examined in this work, and they could contribute to the remaining variability in AIA activation. For example, even when the response probability to odors is high, the magnitude of the AIA calcium response can vary somewhat between trials, and neither AIA response magnitude nor response duration were analyzed systematically here. Further investigation could uncover input from network states on these and other quantitative aspects of the AIA response.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Excitation and disinhibition by electrical and chemical synapses</title><p>In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> behavioral functions of many neurons are known – for example, AIA supports forward movement in the presence of odor, reversals upon odor removal, and aversive olfactory learning – but the associated synaptic computations are not as well understood. As predicted by the wiring diagram, our results indicate that AWA primarily excites AIA via an electrical synapse, in the context of chemical synapses from other neurons. Mixed chemical-electrical synapses are present in many escape circuits, including insect giant fibers, goldfish Mauthner cells, and the <italic>C. elegans</italic> backward command neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen and Murphey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Phelan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). In these escape circuits, the same cells form chemical and electrical synapses with each other to maximize speed and efficiency. By contrast, AIA receives chemical and electrical synapses from different sensory neurons to enable integration.</p><p>At a synaptic level, the combination of excitatory and disinhibitory inputs of AIA resemble interactions at the glomeruli of the rat inferior olivary nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pereda et al., 2013</xref>).

The inhibitory synapses shunt excitatory current flow at the electrical synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pereda et al., 2013</xref>). Synchronized firing in this system has features of an AND-gate, with distinct states that depend on both electrical and chemical synapses.</p><p>At a circuit level, the roles of excitation and inhibition in an AND-gate differ from their roles in many circuits. Excitation and inhibition are most frequently observed as balanced inputs, tightly correlated in time and space, poising circuits to detect small changes with precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okun and Lampl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Denève and Machens, 2016</xref>). In the AND-gate logic employed by AIA, excitation and inhibition alternate, switching the neuron’s activity state. A related disinhibition logic, with a more complex mechanism, is used in mammalian cortical and hippocampal circuits, where VIP-expressing interneurons disinhibit information flow through excitatory circuits by GABAergic inhibition of local inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Turi et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>AIA activity as a readout of positive valence</title><p>We suggest that AIA signals an integrated, positive sensory valence, as represented through the activity state of multiple sensory neurons. In addition to the odors studied here, further evidence for combinatorial integration by AIA comes from behavioral studies in which animals cross an aversive copper barrier, sensed by the glutamatergic ASH sensory neurons, to reach an attractive diacetyl source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shinkai et al., 2011</xref>). The copper-diacetyl behavioral interaction requires ASH glutamatergic inhibition of AIA via the glutamate-gated chloride channel GLC-3. In this context, the integrated sensory state detected by AIA includes a repellent as well as an attractant, and a different combination of sensory inputs. The behavioral role of AIA activity is complex, but it is interesting that the combinations of sensory neurons that activate AIA are partly distinct from the roles of those sensory neurons in chemotaxis. For example, AWA is not necessary for chemotaxis to isoamyl alcohol, but has an important role in AIA activation by that odor, and the converse holds for ASK and diacetyl.</p><p>The existence of a complete wiring diagram for <italic>C. elegans</italic> poses a challenge: are there core computations performed by repeated circuit motifs?

For Chrimson experiments, L4 animals were transferred to freshly seeded plates of 5x concentrated OP50-seeded LB with or without 5 µM all-trans retinal (Sigma R2500; CAS 116-31-4) and housed overnight in complete darkness.</p><p>Before beginning the experiment, we selected animals for visible GCaMP fluorescence and gently washed them in S Basal buffer. We then loaded ~10 animals of two genotypes or conditions into separate arenas of a custom-fabricated two-arena polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS; Sigma 761036, made from 9:1 base:curing agent, Sylgard 184) imaging devices that had been de-gassed in a vacuum dessicator for at least 5 min. We chose ~10 animals per arena to maximize the number of replicates within a condition or genotype without sacrificing proper flow. Animals were paralyzed in darkness for ~90 min in buffer + tetramisole before the start of the recording.</p><p>Experiments were performed on a Zeiss AxioObserver A1 inverted microscope fit with a 5x/0.25 NA Zeiss Fluar objective. A Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4 sCMOS camera was mounted to the microscope using a 0.63x c-mount adapter to increase field of view. We delivered 474 nm wavelength light with a Lumencor SOLA-LE lamp. We used Metamorph 7.7.6 software to control image acquisition and light pulsing in addition to rapid stimulus switching (National Instruments NI-DAQmx connected to an Automate Valvebank 8 II actuator that controls a solenoid valve), odor selection (Hamilton 8-way distribution valve), and activation of an external red LED for Chrimson stimulation (Mightex Precision LED Spot Light, 617 nm, PLS-0617–030 s; attached to Chroma ET605/50x filter to narrow band to 605 ± 25 nm). For Chrimson experiments, red light intensity was 15 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>For odor-only calcium imaging experiments, we detected GCaMP signals after illumination with 165 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> 474 nm light, strobed at a 10 ms per 100 ms (10 fps) exposure duty cycle to reduce motion artefacts and GCaMP photobleaching.</p><p>For optogenetic experiments, we used a lower light intensity at 474 nm to reduce blue light activation of the Chrimson channel. To define conditions, AWA neurons expressing GCaMP and Chrimson were tested at 474 nm light intensities ranging from 15 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> with a 10% duty cycle to 165 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> with constant illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Strobed (10% duty cycle) 40 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> light captured fluorescent GCaMP signals in the AIA neurite, and retained full AWA responses to 617 nm Chrimson illumination and odor stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), although with a higher level of background noise than under strong illumination.</p><p>Animals received two pulses of the tested stimulus, and both pulses were pooled for analyses, with the exception of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3F–R</xref>. In experiments with multiple odor concentrations, we delivered odors in order of increasing concentration. In Chrimson experiments with diacetyl controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>), or diacetyl experiments with NaCl controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D and H</xref>), the control was delivered last. To confirm proper odor flow, we delivered a pulse of fluorescein dye at the end of the experiment; assays in which flow was impeded were discarded.</p><p>Raw fluorescence values were measured using a custom ImageJ script from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Larsch et al. (2013)</xref>, which measures the average intensity of a 4 × 4 pixel square and subtracts the local background intensity. For all sensory neurons, the square captured the soma; for AIA, it captured the middle of the neurite. Animals that moved too much for the tracking script, and animals with no visible AIA soma, were discarded. Occasionally, the tracking script inserted NaN (Not a Number) instead of a fluorescence intensity; pulses with NaN values were discarded. The tracking script is semi-automated to reduce experimenter bias. Each background-subtracted raw fluorescence trace was first normalized to generate ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>0</sub> was the median of the 10 s (100 frames) before the odor pulse onset. Traces were then smoothed by five frames such that each frame <italic>t</italic> represented the mean of <italic>t</italic>-2 frames to <italic>t</italic>+2 frames.</p><p>In a preliminary experiment, we delivered 28 AWA::Chrimson pulses to wild type animals, and 24 pulses to <italic>unc-13(e51)</italic> mutant animals (not included in analyses because we used a slightly different protocol). This experiment captured a statistically significant difference in cumulative response time profiles between wild type and <italic>unc-13</italic> AIA responses to AWA::Chrimson stimulation (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p: 0.007, D test statistic: 0.470). Guided by this result, all experiments reported here included at least 17 light or odor pulses (and typically &gt;30) per genotype or condition.</p><p>We delivered two light or odor pulses per animal, tested 5–10 animals per PDMS device arena, tested 2–16 arenas per genotype or condition, and tested 2–10 genotypes or conditions per experimental block. The number of arenas per genotype or condition depended on the number of genotypes or conditions included in an experimental block, such that each genotype or condition was tested on at least two days with fresh odorant solutions or retinal plates, tested in both the upper and lower arenas of a PDMS device (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and tested simultaneously with the control at least once. The n used for analysis refers to individual stimulus pulses. Statistical analyses include all genotypes or conditions in an experimental block, corrected for multiple comparisons that in some cases include genotypes or conditions we do not present. The genotypes or conditions included in an experimental block depended on the hypothesis we were testing. We included a wild type-to-<italic>unc-18(e234)</italic> comparison in several independent experimental blocks, and the cumulative response time profiles for the separate and combined experimental blocks are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Determining response latency times</title><p>For AWA, AIA, ASE, and ASH, a calcium trace was deemed a ‘response’ at the first frame <italic>t</italic> at which the mean smoothed ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> of <italic>t</italic> to <italic>t</italic>+12 frames exceeded two standard deviations of the mean of the 10 s pre-stimulus ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, and the mean time derivative of <italic>t</italic> to <italic>t</italic>+1 frame exceeded one standard deviation of the mean time derivative of the 10 s pre-stimulus ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>. The threshold of 2 standard deviations of the pre-stimulus ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> marks an inflection point in the number of traces categorized as ‘responses’ to buffer, in the absence of odor or Chrimson stimulus. This threshold was therefore the lowest, or most inclusive, threshold possible without including an excessive number of obvious non-responses, or false positives. The threshold of 2 standard deviation of the mean time derivative of the pre-stimulus ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> marks an inflection point in the number of traces categorized as ‘nonresponses’ to each stimulus; that is, higher thresholds exclude responses. Therefore, this threshold is the highest threshold possible without excluding an excessive number of responses, or false negatives. Notably, at the threshold of 2 standard deviations of the pre-stimulus ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, the number of responses are largely independent of the time derivative threshold, which we used to constrain the timing of the event. More details on thresholding procedures can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>To determine ASK and AWC response latency, but not for other calculations, each ASK and AWC calcium trace was scaled such that the minimum value was 0 and the maximum value was 1. The calcium trace was deemed a ‘response’ at the first frame <italic>t</italic> at which the mean scaled ΔF/F<sub>max</sub> of <italic>t</italic> to <italic>t</italic>+10 frames was below two standard deviations of the mean of the 10 s pre-stimulus ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, and either the time derivative of <italic>t</italic> to <italic>t</italic>+10 frames was below 0.5 standard deviations, or the time derivative to <italic>t</italic> to <italic>t</italic>+5 frames was below 1.15 standard deviations, of the mean of the 10 s pre-stimulus ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>.</p><p>To compare the variability of response latencies, we compared the cumulative response time profiles. We used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare these distributions since this test would capture both the latencies and probability of response. Although the figures show only 5 s of stimulus, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test compared distributions for 10 s of stimulus.

We performed this calculation 1000 times from randomly bootstrap-sampled populations that had the same <italic>n</italic> as the true population, sampled with replacement. The standard deviation of the bootstrapped distribution was used as the standard error of the bootstrapped mean. The lag between simultaneously recorded AWA and AIA responses in 24 animals was calculated by subtracting each animal’s AIA response initiation time from its AWA response initiation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

Because AWA and AIA responses often adapt during the stimulus pulse, we defined AWA and AIA response magnitudes as the maximum ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> within the 10 s stimulus pulse.</p><p>To compare AIA or AWA magnitudes between genotypes or conditions, we included only calcium traces that represent detectable responses as described in the Determining Latency Times section. To determine whether there was an appreciable ASK, AWC, or ASH response to a given stimulus, or AWA response to isoamyl alcohol, we included all calcium traces.</p><p>We statistically tested differences with either an ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test for experiments with more than two conditions, or an unpaired t-test for experiments with only two conditions. For ASK, AWC, ASE, AWA, and ASH responses to diacetyl, isoamyl alcohol, or NaCl, we used responses to S Basal – S Basal buffer switches as the control. For ASK, AWC, and ASE responses to AWA::Chrimson stimulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1O</xref>, we used a paired t-test to compare response magnitudes to the change in ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> within a similar time window prior to the light pulse.

Adult animals were transferred to an unseeded agar plate, then transferred into S Basal buffer containing 1 mM (-)-tetramisole hydrochloride as a paralytic agent. After 10 min, individual animals were loaded into a custom-fabricated PDMS microfluidic chamber in S Basal buffer, and either 11.5 nM or 1.15 µM diacetyl was delivered to the animal’s nose under controlled conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chronis et al., 2007</xref>). Fluorescence changes were monitored on a Zeiss Axiovert 100TV wide-field inverted microscope fitted with a 40x/1.3 Zeiss Plan Apochromat oil objective. Metamorph 7.7.8.0 software controlled stimulus switching and image acquisition through an Andor iXon+ EMCCD camera (as described above, Calcium Imaging of Individual Neurons). Light was delivered with a Lumencor SOLA-LE lamp, passed through a 1.3 ND filter, and narrowed to 484–492 nm using a CHROMA 49904-ET Laser Bandpass filter set. Illumination was constant and at full power, which may have elicited some light responses in ASK.</p><p>We used ImageJ’s ‘Align slices in stack’ plugin to correct for small amounts of motion. We then measured fluorescence values by selecting regions of interest that captured the AIA neurite, AWA nucleus, and ASK nucleus without background subtraction. We scaled fluorescence values separately for each neuron from 0 to 1 for visualization purposes. Many videos were discarded because fluorescence from other neurons prevented measurement of our neurons of interest, because our neurons of interest could not be captured in the same focal plane, or because the animal rotated during the video.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>Electrophysiological recording was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, an adult animal was immobilized on a Sylgard-coated (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) glass coverslip in a small drop of DPBS (D8537; Sigma) by applying a cyanoacrylate adhesive (Vetbond tissue adhesive; 3M) along the dorsal side of the head region. A puncture in the cuticle away from the head was made to relieve hydrostatic pressure. A small longitudinal incision was then made using a diamond dissecting blade (Type M-DL 72029 L; EMS) between two pharyngeal bulbs along the glue line. The cuticle flap was folded back and glued to the coverslip with GLUture Topical Adhesive (Abbott Laboratories), exposing the nerve ring. The gluing and dissection were performed under an Olympus SZX16 stereomicroscope equipped with a 1X Plan Apochromat objective and widefield 10x eyepieces. The coverslip with the dissected preparation was then placed into a custom-made open recording chamber (~1.5 ml volume) and treated with 1 mg/ml collagenase (type IV; Sigma) for ~10 s by hand pipetting. The recording chamber was subsequently perfused with the desired extracellular solution using a custom-made gravity-feed perfusion system for ~10 ml. All experiments were performed with the bath at room temperature. We used an upright microscope (Axio Examiner; Carl Zeiss, Inc) equipped with a 40x water immersion lens and 16x eyepieces to view the preparation. AIA neurons were identified using either GFP or GCaMP5A fluorescent markers. We made electrodes by using a laser pipette puller (P-2000; Sutter Instruments) to pre-pull borosilicate glass pipettes (BF100-58-10; Sutter Instruments) with resistance (RE) of 15–20 MΩ and back-filling them with the desired intracellular solutions. We used a motorized micromanipulator (PatchStar Micromanipulator; Scientifica) to control the electrodes. The pipette solution was (all concentrations in mM): [K-gluconate 115; KCl 15; KOH 10; MgCl<sub>2</sub> 5; CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.1; Na<sub>2</sub>ATP 5; NaGTP 0.5; Na-cGMP 0.5; cAMP 0.5; BAPTA 1; Hepes 10; Sucrose 50], with pH adjusted with KOH to 7.2, osmolarity 320–330 mOsm. The standard extracellular solution was: [NaCl 140; NaOH 5; KCL 5; CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2; MgCl<sub>2</sub> 5; Sucrose 15; Hepes 15; Dextrose 25], with pH adjusted with NaOH to 7.3, osmolarity 330–340 mOsm. Liquid junction potentials were calculated and corrected before recording. Whole-cell current clamp and voltage clamp experiments were conducted on an EPC-10 amplifier (EPC-10 USB; Heka) using PatchMaster software (Heka). Two-component capacitive compensation was optimized at rest, and series resistance was compensated to 50%. Analog data were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz or 50 kHz. For quality control, only patch clamps with a seal resistance above 1 GΩ and uncompensated series resistance below 100 MΩ were accepted for further analysis (seal resistance ranged from 2 to 10 GΩ; series resistance ranged from 17 to 95 MΩ for most accepted recordings). For the 1 pA/step experiment, a short −10 pA hyperpolarizing pre-pulse was added to each current injection step in the stimulation protocol to reset membrane potential to rest. Voltage or current measurement and data analysis were conducted using Fitmaster (Heka) and exported to OriginProt (OriginLab) for graphing. To reduce file size, electrophysiological recording traces shown in figures were re-sampled at 1 kHz by averaging adjacent data points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Simultaneous electrophysiology and calcium imaging</title><p>The electrophysiology recording setup was as described above. GCaMP fluorescence in AIA neurons expressing soluble GCaMP5A was captured with a CoolSNAP HQ2 Camera (Photometrics) controlled by MetaMorph software. The onset of imaging acquisition and electrophysiology recording was synchronized by a TTL signal sent through Patchmaster. We illuminated the sample with a SpectraX Lumencor solid-state light source. Patch-clamping was performed under DIC illumination, and the sample was switched to fluorescent illumination once a whole-cell recording configuration was formed to begin simultaneous recording. Imaging was set at 20 MHz, binning at 2 and 50 fps. To quantify GCaMP fluorescence, we used ImageJ to capture the mean fluorescence of a hand-selected area around the AIA neurite. We bleach-corrected the resulting trace by fitting a line to the non-stimulus portions of the calcium trace, then subtracted and subsequently dividing the raw trace by the fitted line to achieve the ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Philip Kidd, Sagi Levy, Aylesse Sordillo, Elias Scheer, Du Cheng, Audrey Harnagel, Alejandro López-Cruz, Likui Feng, James Lee, Javier Marquina-Solis, Andrew Gordus, Andrew Leifer, Vanessa Ruta, and Shai Shaham for thoughtful discussions and comments on the manuscript.

revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>In order to evaluate their environment, animals can process information via multiple sensory channels. The basic computations that lead to salient and behaviorally relevant neuronal representations, such as valence of an input, are an active area of research. The authors describe a <italic>C. elegans</italic> interneuron class, termed AIA, that receives information about attractive odors from multiple pre-synaptic primary sensory neurons. The sensory neuron AWA, which is activated by attractive odors, excites AIA via electrical signaling, while a set of sensory neurons that are inhibited by attractive odors, inhibit AIA via glutamatergic chemical synapses. This circuit motif performs an AND-gate computation during which concomitant excitation and disinhibition ensures reliable positive valence responses in AIA in the presence of low odor concentrations. In support of their model, the authors find that AIA exhibits non-linear bimodal voltage responses to input currents, suggesting a cellular mechanism for this computation. The computational motif described here perhaps repeats in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system; moreover, it is likely implemented in a similar way in circuits of animals with larger nervous systems.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Reliability of an interneuron response depends on an integrated sensory state&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, Dobosiewicz and Bargmann use calcium imaging and genetic manipulations to examine the integration of sensory information by AIA interneurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. By comparing odor- and optogenetically- driven responses from upstream neurons, the authors find that input from a single sensory neuron (AWA) produces a slow and unreliable response, while coincident input from multiple sensory neurons produces more robust and reliable responses. The authors find that AWA provides excitatory input to AIA through electrical synapses, while ASK and AWC provide disinhibitory input through glutamatergic synapses. The authors conclude that integration onto AIA functions as an &quot;AND-gate&quot; and is involved in the selective filtering of sensory information for behavior.</p><p>A) Major concern:</p><p>The AND gate logic and filtering function seem largely speculative at the moment and more experiments are required to support this claim. The reviewers agree that summation at the level of AIA as opposed to a non-linear AND computation could equally well explain your observations. We understand that reviewer #3 suggestion to perform simultaneous imaging in AIA and the sensory neurons is perhaps out of reach within 2 Months of revisions due to the low resolution of your experimental setup. But we find it necessary that you perform additional convincing experiments that could address this issue in an equivalent manner (for example, by co-stimulating AIA with a specific ASK ligand, or voltage imaging).</p><p>Reviewer #3 also is concerned by the lack of explanation what causes the variability in AIA and that you cannot exclude effects from network states, like in Gordus et al. See also reviewer #1, comment (6). While we find it not necessary to address this concern with new experiments, the possible sources of variability should be better discussed.</p><p>Please pay also particular attention to rule out reviewer #3's concern that some of your results and conclusions are simply due to the thresholding procedures. A better explanation and a quantitative assessment of how certain parameters were chosen and that your choice does not skew the results is important.</p><p>B) Other essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1) The main experiment has the caveat that Chrimson is not only very sensitive but also has a long excitation tail extending to the wavelength (474nm) used for GCaMP imaging. Other experts in the field struggle with this problem. It is likely that GCaMP excitation light leads to basal tonic activation of AWA and perhaps habituation of signaling pathways parallel or downstream of Ca<sup>++</sup>. As stated in their Materials and methods, to prevent AWA activation, the authors use low 447nm light levels. In addition, a peculiar 474nm light-pulsing protocol (10 ms, every 100 ms) is used. I assume that these conditions have been somehow optimized to prevent AWA::Chrismon activation but a systematic demonstration of this is missing here as well as in previous literature. The authors should report in detail how they optimized and scrutinized their light stimulation protocol. This would be needed for the community to reproduce these data, and also extremely useful for other combined optogenetics/imaging experiments.</p><p>2) A crucial element of their model is that AWA signals unidirectionally via a gap junction to AIA. While inhibitory glutamatergic signaling to AIA via the other sensory neurons has been characterized, the support for AWA-AIA gap junction signaling is rather thin here.</p><p>2a) Conclusions made with the AWA::TeTx strain are based on a negative result, therefore some validation should be provided that this strain is effective at all. For example, AWA sends a relative high number of synapses to AIZ. Does optogenetic activation of AWA affect AIZ activity and is this altered in the AWA::TeTx strain?</p><p>2b) UNC-7 and UNC-9 are broadly expressed in the nervous system and are implicated in many functions. Therefore, indirect effects cannot be excluded.</p><p>- Is there no phenotype in single mutants?</p><p>- This concern could be addressed by transgenic rescue experiments in AWA and AIA.</p><p>- In addition, or alternatively, the authors have reported previously a tool for cell-class selective removal of <italic>unc-9</italic>, which could be used for AIA and AWA.</p><p>3) Figure 6. A-B: n-numbers are not listed in legend or table</p><p>The data would be more informative if the authors also showed the cumulative response probabilities of AWC, AWA and ASK as well as the AIA response delay time for WT.</p><p>4) The authors discuss that the function of this AND-gate computation might be &quot;an integrative step that may filter out environmental noise&quot;. Is this consistent with the result in Figure 3A?: based on the authors model, we should assume that the AND-gate computation is absent in the synaptic transmission mutants. Here, I would expect unreliable responses of AIA to the weak AWA stimulation via 11.6nM dia (see Figure 1A), as opposed to when AWA gets strongly activated by Chrimson. This seeming contradiction and the functional relevance of the mechanism could be better discussed.</p><p>5) The authors discuss that AIA primarily is modulated by stimulus versus motor state. Although their wording is careful (&quot;AIA activity is more closely coupled to sensory state, and less to motor state,&quot;), a reader less acquainted with the literature could be misled. Currently, I don't see evidence for this statement. In contrast, in freely moving imaging studies Laurent et al., 2015, showed that AIA is indeed modulated by motor state; this paper should be cited and the implications to the current study should be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>1) Measures of response reliability and kinetics and interpretation of AIA integration as an AND-gate (But see our comments Major concern (A) above.)</p><p>The conclusion that AIA performs an &quot;AND&quot; gate is based in large part on data in Figure 1 showing that AWA:Chrimson produces smaller, more delayed and less likely responses in AIA than 115 nM diacetyl, however that response kinetics, when there is a response, are similar. However these two pieces of data seem to be in conflict. In the heat maps in Figure 1C (last column) there are clearly some responses with very slow kinetics. The fact that the two curves in Figure 1F are similar (though not the same) is likely an artefact of the thresholding used to determine that there was a response. The same is likely true in Figure 3D, which likewise shows an average of thresholded responses, while the heat maps in 3B show responses with variable latencies.</p><p>More generally, I think the authors should try to provide more experimental insight into the source of the observed variability. Some measures of variability and regression on expression levels of Chrimson and GCaMP are shown in the supplement to Figure 1, but only a subset of trials are ever shown in any of the figures. Do responses change in any systematic way over the time of the experiment? Are there slow fluctuations in response magnitude? Are responses correlated on some timescale? What do the authors think is the primary source of the variability in responses? Is it arising at the level of synaptic integration, or calcium channel activation? Is there a contribution of motor state variability to responses as in AIB, even if smaller?</p><p>Finally, I think conclusions about integration in AIA would be greatly strengthened by showing AIA responses as a function of simultaneously measured responses in AWA or ASK/AWC. Since simultaneous imaging experiments are mentioned in Figure 5, it seems like this data would be possible to obtain. Plotting AIA response magnitude on a trial-by-trial basis as a function of AWA/ASK/AWC activation on that trial would allow the authors to explicitly test and accept or reject the hypothesis that the integration between these sensory inputs is non-linear, versus being linear with some correlated or uncorrelated noise source either up or downstream. I think these analyses and an explicit model are important to draw the conclusions made here.</p><p>2) Temporal filtering by AIA</p><p>A second, more minor, conclusion drawn in the Discussion is that AIA integration serves to filter out transient or noisy odor stimuli. However, this idea is not explicitly tested in the manuscript. Odor dynamics can be challenging to control but can be done with proportional valves and measured by photo-ionization detector. Chrimson activation can be reliably controlled in time. If the authors wish to draw conclusions about temporal filtering or noise rejection in AIA I think they need to test this idea by explicitly varying the timecourse of odor or the level of background noise and measuring responses.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) Subsection “Calcium Imaging”, fourth paragraph: Both pulses were pooled for analyses.</p><p>For both heatmaps in Figure 1C last panel (AWA:Chr) and Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, it appears that probability of AIA response is &lt;50% (with varying latencies) given each row is a single trial (n= 569). Number of animals tested (Figure 1—figure supplement 1J) are 282 where 35% respond to both AWA:Chr pulses, 28% to 1st only, and 16% to 2nd only. What is getting pooled in Figure 1? Only traces which respond to both pulses?</p><p>2) The mean trace for the AWA:Chr stimulus is similar to 115 nM diacetyl, but the trials seem more variable, including a number of non-responders. Are these most likely expression differences, or something about Chrimson dynamics? Can you be sure the low-level of 474 nm blue light used to image GCaMP prior to red light stimuluation does not have an effect on Chrimson? Did you try stimulating only the dendrite / sensory ending of AWA?</p><p>3) Did you attempt to image AWA and AIA at the same time, or is this precluded by the need to image the AIA process?</p><p>4) <italic>unc-13</italic> mutants as well another transgene of <italic>unc-18</italic> seem to have no effect on AIA response latency at 1.15uM diacetyl. Though this is mentioned in the second paragraph of the subsection “Chemical synapses inhibit AIA”, the rationale is not clearly explained. Is the reliability of the response also dosage dependent? Only data related to latency are shown in Figure 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, heatmaps which can indicate reliability are missing.</p><p>5) As in comment 2, only response time profiles are shown in Figure 4, indicating differences in latency, but heatmaps should be added as supplementary data to show trial-to-trial variability in responses.</p><p>6) At 11.5nM diacetyl, AWA is activated and ASK is inhibited, and this leads to moderate reliability of AIA response. At 1.15uM dia, AWA is activated with high fidelity, ASE is activated; ASK and AWC are inhibited and this leads to disinhibition of AIA and high reliability in its response. Do glutamate levels or different channel expression regulate the magnitude of disinhibition and in turn affect the reliability? ASK seems to be a key candidate tuning this reliability, as inhibition of ASK alone (Figure 4D) has a significant effect on AIA response reliability.</p><p>7) Glutamate release from ASE (with AWC::Figure 4I) can inhibit AIA activation. However, 1.15uM dia activates ASE, yet increases AIA reliability. This is not well clarified in the manuscript, and a model figure and extended discussion would help in this regard.</p><p>8) Were the <italic>unc-9</italic> and <italic>unc-7</italic> mutants tested individually to identify which of the innexins are required for AWA-AIA communication?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50566.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A) Major concern:</p><p>The AND gate logic and filtering function seem largely speculative at the moment and more experiments are required to support this claim.

We note that network states could explain the remaining 10% of the variability, as well as variability in response magnitude and duration, which are not the focus of this work.

In the new Figure 1—figure supplement 1, we show the methods development for this experiment. We calibrated conditions by expressing GCaMP and Chrimson in the same cell, AWA. Under strong illumination of GCaMP at 474 nm, we did not see fluorescence increases to longer-wavelength 617 nm Chrimson stimuli, presumably because of direct Chrimson excitation at 474 nm. Lower illumination levels at 474 nm resulted in a transient GCaMP response with a return to a baseline that allowed a subsequent Chrimson response to 617 nm light. We chose a light level at 474 nm that minimized the initial transient response and preserved a full AWA response to 617 nm light (left panels) and diacetyl odor (right panels). As stated in the legend to Figure 1—figure supplement 1, we used a 10 ms/100 ms duty cycle for 474 nm illumination, here and elsewhere because (a) strobing reduces motion artefacts and (b) the duty cycle minimizes GCaMP photobleaching during long-term imaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A crucial element of their model is that AWA signals unidirectionally via a gap junction to AIA.

(2a) Validation of Tetanus toxin. Tetanus toxin has been effective in <italic>C. elegans</italic> in our hands and others in the past, and its target confirmed through the use of an uncleavable synaptobrevin (Macosko et al., 2009). We cite these results, and further elaborate that the Tetanus toxin experiment (a negative result) is supported by the subsequent demonstration that synaptic transmission mutants in <italic>unc-13</italic> and <italic>unc-18</italic> have enhanced, not diminished, signaling between AWA and AIA (Figure 3). (2b) We have added experiments showing that expression of the gap junction subunit <italic>unc-9</italic> in AIA and AWA (but not a point-mutated inactive version of <italic>unc-9)</italic> rescues the calcium imaging defect in an <italic>unc-7 unc-9</italic> double mutant (Figure 2F), and include the data showing that single mutants do not have a defect (Figure 2D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 6A-B: n-numbers are not listed in legend or table.

However, we do not agree that there is a contradiction between the model and the synaptic transmission mutant data. In our model, the AND-gate computation still applies in the synaptic transmission mutants, which have one condition of the AND-gate chronically fulfilled (no glutamate inhibition), leaving AWA activation (the second condition) largely in control of whether AIA responds. Our model predicts that the background of AIA spontaneous activity would increase in the synaptic transmission mutants, whereas the reviewer suggests that the reliability of the evoked signal would decrease. We believe the reviewer’s question may reflect a lack of clarity in our writing, so we have added a model figure making this point to Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors discuss that AIA primarily is modulated by stimulus versus motor state.

We added a citation to the free-moving AIA imaging work from Laurent et al., but note that the relationship to behavior is complex; the authors of that paper take a light touch in their description of the one AIA trace that is shown (“careful analysis showed that [calcium changes] usually coincided with a switch in the direction of travel, and never lasted more than a few seconds”). The same paper showed much clearer evidence for behavior-correlated activity of AIB, AVA, and AVB interneurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) Measures of response reliability and kinetics and interpretation of AIA integration as an AND-gate (But see our comments Major concern (A) above.)</p><p>The conclusion that AIA performs an &quot;AND&quot; gate is based in large part on data in Figure 1 showing that AWA:Chrimson produces smaller, more delayed and less likely responses in AIA than 115 nM diacetyl, however that response kinetics, when there is a response, are similar.

I think these analyses and an explicit model are important to draw the conclusions made here.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed the reviewer’s questions about the robustness of the analysis methods by re-formulating Figure 1, showing more of the analysis methods in an additional supplementary figure, and addressing them directly in that section of the Results. To expand:</p><p>a) Thresholding. We have documented the robustness of the decisions both by including more primary data in Figure 1 and by adding a supplementary figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) documenting thresholding and the robustness of the result. We identify a broad range of thresholds of signal magnitude and time derivative that yield a consistent set of results showing similar AIA responses to different stimuli. Importantly, we chose a set of thresholds in which response probability and latency are not sensitive to 2-fold increases or decreases in any parameter. The fact that peak response magnitude was still sensitive to these parameters is one of the reasons that we chose not to emphasize response magnitude in this study. The reviewer raises questions about the responses being “smaller, more delayed, and less likely.” The responses are not smaller in magnitude across stimuli, so we think the reviewer is talking about response duration, which does vary. What we want to emphasize is the sharp onset kinetics, not the duration of the stimulus; in fact, due to the obvious variability in duration and decay, it doesn’t make sense to average them. To bring that primary result out more, we added Figure 1E, showing representative single traces selected at random from the full set of traces, in the same latency order as the heatmap traces, demonstrating the sharp characteristic onset and variable duration. Figure 1E should also help provide visual evidence that the signal is high compared to the background. Figure 1—figure supplement 2, which shows an additional 150 individual responses, should also increase confidence in the basic robustness of the response onset. We moved all other aligned /averaged responses to Figure 4—figure supplement 2 (from Figure 2-4) so that they are there for examination, but do not emphasize them.</p><p>b) Sources of variability. First, we emphasize that in response probability and latency, the AIA response to a strong diacetyl stimulus is highly reproducible, and very low compared to any interneuron we or others have studied; it is only the weak stimuli that uncover its variable features. Second, we added more heatmaps to primary Figure 2 and supplementary figures associated with Figures 1, 2, 4 and 5, as requested by reviewer 2. Although heatmaps have their own shortcomings; the combination with traces in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 should provide clarity. Third, we add additional information describing the analysis as the reviewer suggested; for example, response latency is not correlated across trials, but there’s a small decrease in response probability across trials; latency and probability are not correlated with GCaMP expression levels (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Again, we do not emphasize response magnitudes, but Figure 1—figure supplement 2 shows that magnitudes are consistently smaller for spontaneous events than odor-evoked events at all thresholds, and Figure 4—figure supplement 2 shows that magnitudes are anti-correlated with GCaMP expression levels.</p><p>c) In all figures and supplementary figures, we downsampled for primary traces and heatmaps at random; there was no selection of traces except to represent the population at the level of percentage response and latency of response. We downsample heatmaps only for visibility, which is necessary especially when different experiments have different n values.</p><p>(d) Simultaneous measurements of multiple neurons. We have successfully obtained 20 events in which we simultaneously measure AIA, AWA, and ASK responses to diacetyl. These results are presented in Figure 5—figure supplement 2, and are consistent with our conclusions, but technical concerns are an issue here. The decreases in fluorescence in ASK are harder to threshold than the increases in AWA and AIA, because of spontaneous ASK activity and the slow offset kinetics of GCaMP reporters. To obtain orthogonal results supporting the AND-gate model, we have added electrophysiological experiments demonstrating a plausible basis of the observed AIA non-linearity and a correlation of the all-or-none plateau state with an all-or-none calcium signal (Figure 6). We believe that taking this entirely separate experimental approach is conceptually and technically stronger than further calcium imaging experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Temporal filtering by AIA</p><p>A second, more minor, conclusion drawn in the Discussion is that AIA integration serves to filter out transient or noisy odor stimuli. However, this idea is not explicitly tested in the manuscript. Odor dynamics can be challenging to control but can be done with proportional valves and measured by photo-ionization detector. Chrimson activation can be reliably controlled in time. If the authors wish to draw conclusions about temporal filtering or noise rejection in AIA I think they need to test this idea by explicitly varying the timecourse of odor or the level of background noise and measuring responses.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a side point in the Discussion and we have de-emphasized it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) Subsection “Calcium Imaging”, fourth paragraph: Both pulses were pooled for analyses.</p><p>For both heatmaps in Figure 1C last panel (AWA:Chr) and Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, it appears that probability of AIA response is &lt;50% (with varying latencies) given each row is a single trial (n= 569).

In Figure 1—figure supplement 3, we analyzed responses from 282 of the 287 animals in which usable results were obtained during both trials. We clarify this information in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The mean trace for the AWA:Chr stimulus is similar to 115 nM diacetyl, but the trials seem more variable, including a number of non-responders. Are these most likely expression differences, or something about Chrimson dynamics? Can you be sure the low-level of 474 nm blue light used to image GCaMP prior to red light stimuluation does not have an effect on Chrimson? Did you try stimulating only the dendrite / sensory ending of AWA?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. The AWA::Chrimson transgene has some variability that we ascribe to animal-to-animal transgene failure, which is not unusual in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In experiments combining GCaMP with Chrimson in AWA, we found that 32/38 animals had GCaMP responses in 4/4 Chrimson-light trials, but 6/38 animals failed to respond to any of 4 Chrimson-light stimuli (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E). Looking across all AWA:Chrimson -&gt; AIA results in the paper, they all still yield significant and consistent results if they are assumed to include transgene failure in ~15% of the animals. For example, in Figure 1—figure supplement 3H, one can assume that the 22% of animals that respond to neither stimulus include a respectable number of transgene failures, but that wouldn’t explain the 44% of animals that responded to only one of two light pulses. We now make that point in the Figure 1—figure supplement 3 legend. We couldn’t explain the issue by level of transgene expression, see Figure 1—figure supplement 1F. We did not attempt to stimulate dendrites. On the second point on simultaneous GCaMP imaging and Chrimson stimulation – yes, that was a challenge worked out during methods development. See response to main points above, and Figure 1—figure supplement 1D documenting methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Did you attempt to image AWA and AIA at the same time, or is this precluded by the need to image the AIA process?</p></disp-quote><p>We added a limited number of simultaneous recordings of AIA, AWA, and ASK to Figure 5—figure supplement 2. The results are consistent with our conclusions, but technical concerns are an issue here. The decreases in fluorescence in ASK are harder to threshold than the increases in AWA and AIA, both because of spontaneous ASK activity and because of the slow offset kinetics of GCaMP reporters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) unc-13 mutants as well another transgene of unc-18 seem to have no effect on AIA response latency at 1.15uM diacetyl. Though this is mentioned in the second paragraph of the subsection “Chemical synapses inhibit AIA”, the rationale is not clearly explained. Is the reliability of the response also dosage dependent? Only data related to latency are shown in Figure 3A and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, heatmaps which can indicate reliability are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We view the smaller effect of <italic>unc-13</italic> and <italic>unc-18</italic> mutations on AIA responses as the result of a ceiling effect. We note that all three chemical synapse mutants tested had slightly faster responses than wildtype, although only one reached statistical significance. We have added this point to the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) As in comment 2, only response time profiles are shown in Figure 4, indicating differences in latency, but heatmaps should be added as supplementary data to show trial-to-trial variability in responses.</p></disp-quote><p>At the reviewer’s request, we added heat maps for all experiments presented in Figure 4, to Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) At 11.5nM diacetyl, AWA is activated and ASK is inhibited, and this leads to moderate reliability of AIA response. At 1.15uM dia, AWA is activated with high fidelity, ASE is activated; ASK and AWC are inhibited and this leads to disinhibition of AIA and high reliability in its response. Do glutamate levels or different channel expression regulate the magnitude of disinhibition and in turn affect the reliability? ASK seems to be a key candidate tuning this reliability, as inhibition of ASK alone (Figure 4D) has a significant effect on AIA response reliability.</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t have insight into glutamate levels or the specific glutamate receptors involved in parsing the signals from the different sensory neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Glutamate release from ASE (with AWC::Figure 4I) can inhibit AIA activation. However, 1.15uM dia activates ASE, yet increases AIA reliability. This is not well clarified in the manuscript, and a model figure and extended discussion would help in this regard.</p></disp-quote><p>ASE is complicated, so we’ve de-emphasized it in the figures while addressing its role further in the main text. Yes, ASE responds to diacetyl with depolarization, but this ASE response appears to be indirect, since it’s blocked in an <italic>unc-18</italic> synaptic mutant, unlike all other sensory neuron responses. The sensory neurons are highly interconnected, but we don’t know which one is important for activating ASE except that it’s not AWA. As the reviewer notes, the clear results we have are for ASK (diacetyl) and AWC (high diacetyl and isoamyl alcohol). We have reworked the model figures to emphasize this analysis, and think this should be helpful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Were the unc-9 and unc-7 mutants tested individually to identify which of the innexins are required for AWA-AIA communication?</p></disp-quote><p><italic>unc-7</italic> and <italic>unc-9</italic> single mutants are not defective in AWA to AIA signaling. We added these results to Figure 2D, and added cell-selective AWA/AIA <italic>unc-9</italic> rescue in the double mutant to Figure 2F.</p></body></sub-article></article>
