The precise mechanism by which the bacterial SRP receptor, FtsY, interacts with and is regulated at the target membrane remain unclear. Here, quantitative analysis of FtsY-lipid interactions at single-molecule resolution revealed a two-step mechanism in which FtsY initially contacts membrane via a Dynamic mode, followed by an SRP-induced conformational transition to a Stable mode that activates FtsY for downstream steps. Importantly, mutational analyses revealed extensive auto-inhibitory mechanisms that prevent free FtsY from engaging membrane in the Stable mode; an engineered FtsY pre-organized into the Stable mode led to indiscriminate targeting in vitro and disrupted FtsY function in vivo.

The universally conserved core of SRP contains an SRP54 protein (termed Ffh in bacteria) tightly bound to an SRP RNA. A methionine-rich M-domain in SRP54 (or Ffh) recognizes the signal sequences on nascent polypeptides emerging from translating ribosomes. The GTPase domain, termed NG-domain, in SRP54 (or Ffh) interacts with a highly homologous NG-domain in SR (termed FtsY in bacteria), thus delivering the ribosome-nascent chain complex (RNC) to the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the bacterial plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walter and Johnson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cross et al., 2009</xref>). At the membrane, the RNC is unloaded from the SRP•SR complex onto the Sec61p (or SecYEG) translocon, via which the nascent protein is either integrated into or translocated across the membrane.</p><p>Extensive work on the bacterial SRP showed that the delivery of RNCs to the target membrane is actively regulated by the substrate and translocon complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akopian et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang and Shan, 2014</xref>). During each targeting cycle, the SRP•FtsY complex sequentially transitions between three conformational states, <italic>early</italic>, <italic>closed</italic> and <italic>activated</italic>, that culminate in their reciprocal GTPase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). The <italic>early</italic> complex is a GTP-independent labile intermediate that stably forms only when SRP is loaded with RNCs bearing SRP-dependent substrate proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">von Loeffelholz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bradshaw et al., 2009</xref>). This stabilization enables the <italic>early</italic> intermediate to preferentially rearrange to the stable <italic>closed</italic> complex rather than dissociating, thus allowing rapid formation of the <italic>closed</italic> RNC•SRP•FtsY targeting complex at the membrane. Finally, the SecYEG complex drives additional NG-domain rearrangements that are coupled to GTPase activation and unloading of the RNC onto the translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akopian et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ataide et al., 2011</xref>). These substrate- and translocon-driven conformational changes of the SRP•FtsY complex ensure productive targeting of the correct SRP substrates, while also providing key mechanisms to reject SRP-independent proteins from the pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25885.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of the current models for co-translational protein targeting by the SRP pathway.</title><p>Targeting via FtsY molecules that are pre-bound and activated at the membrane is shown on the lower left (shaded in <italic>blue</italic>); the alternative targeting route via FtsY molecules in solution is shown on the upper right (shaded in <italic>magenta</italic>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25885.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25885.002</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-25885-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p>Compared to the RNC, the interaction of FtsY with phospholipid membranes and the role of membrane in the targeting reaction remain incompletely understood. FtsY has a poorly conserved acidic A-domain preceding its NG-domain. The A-domain has been implicated in interaction of FtsY with the membrane and translocon, but its precise roles remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Leeuw et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Angelini et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angelini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weiche et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Braig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuhn et al., 2015</xref>). Most previous work has focused on an amphiphilic lipid binding helix, here termed αN1, at the junction between A- and NG-domains. These studies showed that while the FtsY NG-domain itself could not stably bind membrane nor support efficient protein targeting, inclusion of Phe196 from the A-domain stabilizes the helical structure of αN1 and restores both activities in the FtsY-NG + 1 construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parlitz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stjepanovic et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, lipid interaction via αN1 strongly stimulates FtsY’s GTPase activity and formation of the <italic>closed</italic> SRP•FtsY complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stjepanovic et al., 2011</xref>). This is because in free FtsY, αN1 tightly packs against the remainder of the N-domain and sterically occludes approach of Ffh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Draycheva et al., 2016</xref>). Multiple observations suggest that lipid interaction of αN1 removes it from these auto-inhibitory contacts and thus primes FtsY for complex formation with SRP: (i) αN1 was proteolytically cleaved in all the crystal structures of <italic>closed</italic> SRP•FtsY complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shepotinovskaya and Freymann, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gawronski-Salerno and Freymann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shepotinovskaya et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Egea et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Focia et al., 2004</xref>); (ii) EPR studies showed that formation of the <italic>closed</italic> complex with SRP leads to significant mobilization of the αN1 helix, suggesting that it is released from the remainder of FtsY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2010</xref>); (iii) consistent with the prediction from (ii), closed complex formation with SRP substantially increases the binding of FtsY to liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parlitz et al., 2007</xref>); and (iv) an FtsY-dN1 mutant, in which αN1 is deleted, is superactive in GTPase activity and in stable complex formation with SRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neher et al., 2008</xref>), phenocopying the stimulatory effect of lipids on FtsY. Together with the finding that lipids are also required for the interaction of FtsY with the SecYEG translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuhn et al., 2015</xref>), these observations led to the current model in which most FtsY molecules are membrane-bound through the αN1 helix and pre-activated for receiving cargo-loaded SRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuhn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parlitz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Draycheva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Braig et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, lower pathway in <italic>blue</italic>).</p><p>Nevertheless, rigorous formulation and consideration of this model lead to a number of conceptual conundrums. During SRP-dependent targeting, substrate-driven assembly of the SRP•FtsY <italic>closed</italic> complex is the major fidelity checkpoint at which incorrect SRP substrates are rejected, as they mediate this assembly up to 10<sup>3</sup>-fold more slowly than the correct substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). However, liposome-activated FtsY rapidly forms a closed complex with SRP even in the absence of the RNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, if the pathway occurs primarily through pre-activated FtsY at the membrane according to the current model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, lower route in <italic>blue</italic>), this would potentially bypass an important selection mechanism in the SRP pathway. The alternative path, in which FtsY assembles a <italic>closed</italic> complex with SRP in the cytosol and then interacts with the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, upper route in <italic>magenta</italic>), would preserve the specificity of substrate selection, but the unfavorable pre-equilibrium for FtsY’s membrane interaction and activation could render the pathway less efficient. These considerations delineate a common challenge that biological pathways face in the trade-off between efficiency and specificity; how the SRP pathway overcomes this challenge is unclear.</p><p>Indeed, many observations suggest that the lipid interaction of FtsY is more complex than depicted in the current model. The notion that FtsY contains multiple membrane binding motifs was initially suggested by the observation that FtsY induces extensive liposome aggregation, implying a single FtsY interacting with multiple membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Leeuw et al., 2000</xref>). Later, the extreme N-terminus of the A-domain was identified as a secondary lipid binding motif based on sequence conservation and its ability to confer carbonate-resistant membrane association of FtsY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weiche et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Braig et al., 2009</xref>). However, the function of the additional membrane-binding motif(s) in FtsY and its relationship with the αN1 motif remain unclear.</p><p>To address these issues, we carried out the first quantitative analysis of FtsY’s membrane interaction using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy on supported lipid bilayers. The sensitivity and resolution of this assay allowed us to detect two distinct modes of membrane interactions: a Dynamic mode mediated by the extreme N-terminus of the A-domain, and a Stable mode mediated by the αN1 motif. Free FtsY is auto-inhibited and interacts with the membrane primarily in the Dynamic mode. A conformational change is required for FtsY to engage the membrane in the Stable mode, which is driven by complex assembly with SRP. An engineered FtsY pre-organized into the Stable mode led to indiscriminate targeting in vitro and was unable to support cell growth in vivo. These results lead to a new model in which the Dynamic mode allows the membrane association of FtsY to be uncoupled from its conformational activation at the membrane, thus ensuring both the efficiency and fidelity of the targeting pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SRP induces a switch in the membrane interaction mode of FtsY</title><p>To rigorously investigate FtsY-membrane interactions at high resolution, we assembled supported lipid bilayers (SLB) on microscope coverslips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cremer and Boxer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seu et al., 2007</xref>).

As excess FtsY was needed to drive formation of the <italic>early</italic> complex, we labeled SRP instead of FtsY in these experiments to remove contributions from free FtsY. SRP•FtsY(A335W) displayed comparable amounts of Stable SLB interactions as the wildtype complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, both conditions that stall the SRP•FtsY complex in the <italic>early</italic> conformational state significantly reduced the Stable mode of lipid interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Representative trajectories are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>. With free FtsY, removal of the αA1 motif (FtsY-d14) reduced interactions in the Dynamic mode &gt;10 fold, and no substantial additional reductions were observed with further truncations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, solid bars). This indicates that the αA1 motif is primarily responsible for FtsY-lipid interactions in the Dynamic mode. In contrast, only complete truncation of the αN1 helix in FtsY-dN1 abolishes the Stable mode of interactions in the SRP•FtsY complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, open bars), indicating that the αN1 motif mediates the Stable mode. Thus, distinct motifs in FtsY mediate the Dynamic and Stable modes of lipid interactions.</p><p>To further probe the nature of the Dynamic mode, we tested the contribution of conserved basic residues in the αA1 motif (Lys3, Lys5, Lys6 and Arg7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weiche et al., 2008</xref>]); basic residues are enriched in αA1 and could mediate interaction with the anionic phospholipid headgroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Leeuw et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2010</xref>). To this end, we constructed FtsY mutants in which part or all of these charges are removed and/or reversed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, EE, EL, and EEEL). All these mutants exhibited two-fold reduced interactions with the membrane compared to wildtype FtsY in SLB-smTIRF measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Nevertheless, the defects of these mutants are modest compared to FtsY-d14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that the aromatic and aliphatic residues in the remainder of αA1 also contribute to interaction in the Dynamic mode. Thus, the Dynamic mode is driven by a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions mediated by αA1.</p><p>Importantly, FtsY-d14 not only reduced the Dynamic mode, but also nearly abolished the Stable mode of interaction in free FtsY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and E</xref>), suggesting that interaction in the Dynamic mode is required to attain the Stable mode in free FtsY. Consistent with this notion, disruption of the Dynamic and Stable interactions are highly correlated in the αA1 charge mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). To independently test this model, we measured the lipid-mediated stimulation of FtsY’s GTPase activity, which provides a readout for the conformational activation of FtsY upon engagement of the αN1 helix with the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2010</xref>). The GTPase activity of wildtype FtsY is strongly stimulated by PG/PE liposomes as previously observed, whereas this stimulation was abolished in FtsY-d14, similar to the behavior of FtsY-NG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Together, these results strongly suggest that in free FtsY, the Dynamic mode is upstream of and required for this receptor to further engage the membrane in the Stable mode.</p><p>To assess the contribution of the Dynamic interactions to biological function, we tested the ability of FtsY mutants to mediate the co-translational targeting and translocation of a model SRP substrate, preprolactin (pPL), into ER microsomal membranes (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Removal of the αA1 motif reduced targeting efficiency to less than 30% of wildtype level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, FtsY-d14), indicating that αA1 is important for protein targeting. The set of αA1 charge mutants of FtsY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) provided a more controlled assessment of the contribution of the Dynamic mode. All these mutants reduced the efficiency of pPL targeting and translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and the targeting efficiency correlated well with the amount of Dynamic interactions displayed by each variant in this set of mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results provide strong evidence for an important role of the Dynamic interactions in protein targeting mediated by full-length FtsY.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25885.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Both modes of FtsY-membrane interactions impact efficient protein targeting.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The effect of charge mutations in the αA1 motif on the co-translational targeting of pPL.

This suggests that the A-domain prevents free FtsY from engaging with the membrane in the Stable mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, red line from A-domain). With FtsY-NG+1, in which the entire A-domain is removed except for Phe196, the Stable and Dynamic interactions were restored to ~80% and ~20% of that of full-length FtsY, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This suggests that when the inhibitory A-domain was removed, the αN1 helix could also mediate Dynamic interactions with the membrane, albeit less efficiently than the αA1 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, dashed green arrow). As αN1 also mediates the Stable interaction, transition from the Dynamic to the Stable mode is likely more efficient in FtsY-NG+1 than in full-length FtsY. Nevertheless, FtsY-NG+1 still interacts weakly with the membrane by itself and requires SRP binding to drive favorable interaction with the membrane (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, additional auto-inhibitory interactions, presumably from the remainder of the N-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Draycheva et al., 2016</xref>), are present to prevent free FtsY-NG+1 from engaging with the membrane in the Stable mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>, red lines from N-domain). Finally, protein targeting efficiency paralleled the restoration of the Stable mode in free FtsY across the A-domain truncation mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>), consistent with the Stable mode being an obligatory species during targeting.</p><p>Collectively, the results in this section showed that the Dynamic and Stable modes are mediated primarily by the αA1 and αN1 motifs of FtsY, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, cyan and blue arrows). Before association with SRP, lipid interaction via αA1 is required for wildtype FtsY to further engage the membrane via the αN1 helix. This requirement is due, in part, to the inhibitory effect from the remainder of the A-domain, whose highly acidic nature likely repels FtsY from the membrane. The αA1 motif likely provides an initial membrane attachment to overcome this inhibition, enabling the subsequent Stable mode and efficient targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, green lines); this explains why αA1 can be bypassed by truncations of the A-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Finally, regardless of the presence of the A-domain, free FtsY exists in an auto-inhibited state for interaction with the membrane via αN1, and interaction with SRP is the dominant mechanism to drive FtsY to the conformation that interacts with the membrane in the Stable mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>).</p><p>The SRP-induced transition of FtsY’s membrane interaction mode is unlikely to be an artifact of the DOPC/DOPS composition of the SLB. First, bacterial SRP and FtsY can replace their mammalian homologues and mediate efficient targeting and insertion of mammalian substrates into ER microsomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Powers and Walter, 1997</xref>) with a similar substrate selection pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang and Shan, 2012</xref>). These observations indicate that the core regulatory mechanisms of SRP and the SRP receptor are insensitive to the difference in lipid composition between the bacterial plasma membrane and the mammalian ER membrane. Second, although FtsY exhibits a preference for PG, previously observed lipid-stimulation of FtsY’s biochemical activities required liposomes containing 70–100% PG, whereas total <italic>E. coli</italic> lipids or liposome compositions that mimic the <italic>E. coli</italic> plasma membrane did not induce detectable stimulations of FtsY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Leeuw et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stjepanovic et al., 2011</xref>). These earlier results agree well with our model, showing that the majority of FtsY is in the auto-inhibited state in its native lipid environment. Third, we repeated the SLB measurements using DOPC/DOPG side-by-side with DOPC/DOPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). No significant differences between SLBs generated from the different lipid compositions were observed, indicating that the identity of anionic phospholipids (PG in bacterial plasma membrane and PS in the ER membrane) does not impact FtsY’s lipid interaction modes. Finally, the model derived from the SLB measurements were extensively tested by in vitro targeting assays using ER microsomes and in vivo complementation assays in bacteria (see the next section); the good agreement between the results of all three assays further suggest that modest variations in lipid composition does not alter the regulatory mechanism of SRP receptor shown here.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The Dynamic mode balances the specificity and efficiency of protein targeting</title><p>The observation of extensive auto-inhibitory mechanisms for FtsY’s membrane interaction raises a fundamental question: what is the role of these auto-inhibitory interactions? What is the penalty for evolving a receptor molecule that is pre-organized into the Stable mode at the membrane? A hypothesis stems from the consideration that FtsY-membrane interaction via αN1 is coupled to conformational activation of this receptor, which enables FtsY to adopt the <italic>closed</italic> conformation and bind SRP much more rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neher et al., 2008</xref>). As discussed in the Introduction, formation of the <italic>closed</italic> SRP•FtsY complex is a major cargo selection step in the SRP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">von Loeffelholz et al., 2013</xref>). FtsY molecules pre-organized into the Stable mode could potentially bypass this key checkpoint and thereby compromise fidelity. In this context, the Dynamic mode provides a mechanism for FtsY to associate with the membrane without conformational activation, and thus preserves this fidelity checkpoint.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we engineered an FtsY that bypasses the Dynamic mode and is pre-organized into the Stable mode. We used FtsY-dN1 to mimic the effect of lipids on pre-organizing FtsY into the <italic>closed/activated</italic> conformation. Multiple observations support the choice of this construct: (i) in apo-FtsY, the αN1 helix sterically occludes tight SRP•FtsY association in the <italic>closed</italic> conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Draycheva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shepotinovskaya and Freymann, 2002</xref>); (ii) lipid binding releases αN1 from the remainder of the protein and preorganizes FtsY into the <italic>closed</italic> state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stjepanovic et al., 2011</xref>); (iii) as predicted from (i) and (ii), FtsY-dN1 phenocopies the effects of lipids on enhancing SRP•FtsY assembly and GTPase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neher et al., 2008</xref>). Note that FtsY-NG+1 is not a proper construct to mimic a pre-organized FtsY, as free FtsY-NG+1 is still auto-inhibited and requires SRP to switch to the Stable mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). To re-establish stable membrane association of FtsY, we tethered His<sub>6</sub>-tagged FtsY-dN1 on the SLB doped with Ni-NTA-DGS lipids for in vitro assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), or fused FtsY-dN1 to the spontaneous membrane-inserting 3L-Pf3 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lim et al., 2013</xref>]) for in vivo assays.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25885.019</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>An engineered FtsY pre-organized into the Stable mode led to indiscriminate targeting.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Time courses for targeting of RNC<sub>FtsQ</sub> (<italic>orange</italic>) and RNC<sub>Luc</sub> (<italic>blue</italic>) to SLB mediated by wildtype FtsY (<bold>A</bold>) and FtsY pre-organized into the Stable mode (<bold>B</bold>).

We presented RNC•SRP complexes, labeled at SRP, to either wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) or pre-organized FtsY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) and monitored the appearance of membrane-bound targeting complexes in real time. We tested RNCs bearing two representative nascent chains: FtsQ, a bona-fide SRP substrate, and Luc (luciferase), a cytosolic protein. Both wildtype and engineered FtsYs efficiently targeted RNC<sub>FtsQ</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>, orange lines). However, while wildtype FtsY strongly rejected RNC<sub>Luc</sub>, significant amounts of RNC<sub>Luc</sub> were localized to the membrane by pre-organized FtsY-dN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>, blue lines). We confirmed that the observed SRP-RNC<sub>FtsQ</sub> targeting is dependent on FtsY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). To more specifically test the role of conformational pre-organization in FtsY-dN1, we measured other FtsY A-domain truncation mutants (d14, NG+1, and NG) that showed SRP-dependent transition from the Dynamic to Stable mode. We tethered these mutants on SLB via Ni-His<sub>6</sub> interaction and compared the targeted SRP-RNC populations mediated by these constructs to those by FtsY-dN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). All these surface-tethered FtsY mutants mediated efficient targeting of RNC<sub>FtsQ</sub>, but not RNC<sub>Luc</sub>, to the SLB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, yellow vs. blue bars). Importantly, they all showed 5–10 fold more selective targeting than FtsY-dN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Thus, pre-organizing FtsY into the Stable mode compromises its ability to reject incorrect cargos bearing SRP-independent substrates.</p><p>To examine the consequence of pre-activating FtsY in vivo, we tested the ability of the pre-organized FtsY to complement FtsY depletion and support cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). TM-FtsYdN1 was expressed from the pTlac18 plasmid in <italic>E. coli</italic> strain IY28, in which expression of chromosomal FtsY is under control of the <italic>ara</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bahari et al., 2007</xref>). We tested cell growth on LB plates supplemented with either IPTG (Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) or L-arabinose after serial dilution of the culture. As controls, we also tested complementation by FtsY-d14, FtsY-NG and FtsY-NG+1 with or without N-terminal fusion to 3L-Pf3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). FtsY-NG+1 showed no significant defect in supporting cell growth, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eitan and Bibi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bahari et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parlitz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mircheva et al., 2009</xref>), whereas FtsY-d14 and FtsY-NG exhibited modest and strong defects, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results are consistent with the membrane binding and protein targeting activities of the respective mutants observed in vitro. Fusion to 3L-Pf3 rescued cell growth of both mutants FtsY-d14 and FtsY-NG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with the robust RNC targeting activity of the corresponding tethered mutants observed in the SLB setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This and cell fractionation analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) corroborated that the 3L-Pf3 sequence successfully restored the membrane localization of the mutant FtsYs. In contrast, FtsY-dN1 exhibited a strong defect in supporting cell growth that was not rescued by fusion to 3L-Pf3; this defect cannot be attributed to defects in the expression or localization of TM-dN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). The fact that TM-NG was fully functional in supporting cell growth also ruled out possible folding defects of the NG-domain due to the 3L-Pf3 fusion. Most importantly, membrane-anchored FtsY-dN1 is highly efficient in targeting correct SRP substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>), indicating that deficient targeting was not responsible for the failure of TM-FtsYdN1 to support cell growth. Collectively, the combination of in vitro and in vivo data strongly suggest that pre-organizing FtsY into the Stable mode leads to promiscuous targeting that is detrimental to cells.</p><p>On the other hand, an unfavorable pre-equilibrium to reach the stable mode in free FtsY could compromise the efficiency of the pathway if FtsY only binds membrane via the Stable mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, upper path and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).

The Dynamic mode, characterized by rapid association with and dissociation from membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), is primarily mediated by the αA1 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The Dynamic mode is required for FtsY to further engage with the membrane via the Stable mode, which is characterized by membrane association and dissociation kinetics 10-fold and 200-fold slower, respectively, than the Dynamic mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) and mediated by the previously characterized αN1 helix at the A-N domain junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Importantly, while the Dynamic mode dominates in free FtsY and the <italic>early</italic> SRP•FtsY complex, the targeting complex switches to the Stable mode only when it forms the <italic>closed</italic> complex with SRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These observations, together with additional findings here and previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parlitz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shepotinovskaya and Freymann, 2002</xref>), reveal extensive auto-inhibitory mechanisms for the FtsY-membrane interaction via αN1, in contrast to the currently accepted model in which targeting occurs through FtsY molecules that are pre-bound and activated at the membrane via the αN1 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). An engineered FtsY pre-organized into the Stable mode compromises substrate selection by the targeting pathway in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and disrupts FtsY function in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), suggesting that pre-activating FtsY at the membrane is associated with a severe penalty. We propose that the Dynamic mode, by providing an initial membrane attachment that is uncoupled from the conformational activation of FtsY, ensures accurate substrate selection without significantly compromising the efficiency of the pathway.</p><p>Most previous work has focused on the αN1 helix of FtsY that mediates the Stable mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parlitz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stjepanovic et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, membrane interaction via αN1 also activates FtsY for interaction with SRP, rapid GTP hydrolysis, and subsequent cargo unloading onto the SecYEG complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shepotinovskaya and Freymann, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gawronski-Salerno and Freymann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Braig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stjepanovic et al., 2011</xref>). This raises issues for the fidelity of substrate selection by SRP, as the kinetics of SRP-FtsY assembly is strongly regulated by the cargo and comprises a major substrate selection mechanism in the pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, red arrows, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">von Loeffelholz et al., 2013</xref>]). In the extreme scenario where targeting occurs solely through FtsY molecules pre-activated at the membrane in the Stable mode prior to SRP binding, this important fidelity checkpoints would be bypassed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, lower pathway). In support of this hypothesis, we found here that an engineered FtsY pre-organized into the Stable mode leads to indiscriminate targeting of SRP•FtsY complexes in vitro and cannot support cell growth in vivo. Thus, the fidelity of the SRP pathway demands that FtsY is not predominantly in the Stable/<italic>closed</italic> conformation before it encounters cargo-loaded SRP. Consistent with these notions, the results here and from previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stjepanovic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Draycheva et al., 2016</xref>) show that free FtsY is extensively auto-inhibited for lipid interaction via αN1, and assembly of a <italic>closed</italic> complex with SRP is required to drive FtsY molecules into the Stable mode. This auto-inhibition arises not only from the acidic A-domain as shown here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) but also from the N-domain of FtsY, which forms tight intra-molecular interactions with αN1 in free FtsY that reduces its accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Draycheva et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Auto-inhibitory mechanisms are often associated with a penalty in efficiency. The results here show that the Dynamic mode helps alleviate this penalty, by providing a targeting route that accelerates the formation of a stably membrane-bound targeting complex compared to routes that rely only on the Stable mode. This acceleration stems from two effects: (i) membrane interaction via the Dynamic mode is ~10 fold faster than the Stable mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>); and (ii) once associated with the membrane in the Dynamic mode, the SRP•FtsY complex rearranges 25-fold more quickly into the Stable mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). More importantly, in contrast to the Stable mode, the Dynamic mode provides an initial membrane attachment without conformational activation of the receptor, and thus preserves important substrate selection mechanisms in this pathway.</p><p>We propose a revised model in which the two-step membrane binding mechanism of FtsY balances the trade-off between efficiency and selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). In this model, SRP initiates interaction with FtsY either in solution or bound to membrane in the Dynamic mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, events in yellow background); this generates the <italic>early</italic> targeting complex, which is strongly stabilized when SRP is loaded with a correct substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Once the <italic>early</italic> complex localizes to the membrane in the Dynamic mode, phospholipids trigger its rapid and favorable rearrangement to the <italic>closed</italic> state, in which FtsY further uses the αN1 motif to engage the membrane in the Stable mode, and the complex is activated for interaction with and cargo unloading onto the SecYEG translocon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, events in white background). In contrast to correct substrates, the SRP•FtsY early complexes formed with incorrect substrates are much less stable and can be rejected either in solution or when bound at the membrane in the Dynamic mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, red arrows).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25885.024</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model for the sequential membrane interaction of FtsY during protein targeting, which balances speed and specificity of the pathway.</title><p>The dynamic mode mediates initial membrane association of free FtsY and the <italic>early</italic> SRP•FtsY complex, followed by rearrangement of the <italic>early</italic> complex to the <italic>closed</italic> state/Stable mode at the membrane.

Thus, the dynamic nature of this interaction is not a prerequisite for receptor molecules in general. In principle, any membrane interaction mechanism that precedes and is uncoupled from activation of downstream events could fulfill this role. This explains why replacing the αA1 motif with the 3L-Pf3 TM (this work) or with another unrelated membrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zelazny et al., 1997</xref>) rescued the defects of FtsY mutants lacking the Dynamic mode, as long as the mutants are not conformationally pre-organized into the <italic>closed</italic> state. Also consistent with this model, fusing the more hydrophobic αA1 motifs from <italic>S. lividans</italic> FtsY to <italic>E. coil</italic> FtsY-NG rescued the activity of the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bibi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maeda et al., 2008</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that in eukaryotic cells, although the SRP receptor is anchored at the ER membrane via the transmembrane domain of the SRβ subunit, a conceptually analogous switch in the conformation, activity, or interaction mode could be built into the eukaryotic SRP receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>In addition to phospholipids, the SecYEG translocon has been proposed to play a crucial role in FtsY’s membrane localization and in receiving cargo-loaded SRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Angelini et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angelini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuhn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Draycheva et al., 2016</xref>). A recent study also showed that phospholipids are required for FtsY-SecYEG association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuhn et al., 2015</xref>); this places the FtsY-SecYEG interaction downstream of the FtsY-membrane interactions described here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Additionally, FtsY exhibits a strong preference for anionic phospholipids, such as PG and cardiolipin, in the Stable mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Leeuw et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stjepanovic et al., 2011</xref>). The same preference has been found for SecYEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gold et al., 2010</xref>). These observations suggest that the SecYEG translocon could further enhance the transition of FtsY to the Stable mode and vice versa, either directly through induced conformational changes or indirectly through anionic phospholipids. These remain open possibilities for future studies.</p><p>Speed and accuracy define the competency of biological systems. How to balance the trade-off between these two parameters has been widely discussed, but in few systems has this concept been studied at molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hopfield, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murugan et al., 2012</xref>). Much discussions have focused on transcription and protein synthesis machineries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thompson and Karim, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johansson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wohlgemuth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johansson et al., 2012</xref>). Our work illustrates an analogous accuracy-speed tradeoff for receptor molecules. Previous models of protein targeting based solely on FtsY’s Stable mode of membrane interaction exemplify extreme cases in which either speed or specificity is compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The two-step membrane-binding mechanism of FtsY resolves this dilemma and balances the tradeoff between efficiency and fidelity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This new model, which is largely based on energetic and kinetic principles, may provide a conceptually generalizable mechanism for membrane recruitment events in other receptor systems and targeting pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Vector, protein and RNA preparations</title><p>Plasmids for mutant FtsY were constructed using the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene).

Dried lipid film was rehydrated in buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 1 mM DTT to 10 mg/mL. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were generated using three-rounds of freeze-thaw cycles followed by 21 times extruding through 100 nm pore polycarbonate filters.

The emission signal changes were monitored at 515 nm and 470 nm for samples in the absence and presence of PG/PE liposomes, respectively. The early complex was pre-assembled with 200 nM FtsY-acrylodan, 15 μM Ffh, 30 μM 4.5S RNA with or without 1 mg/mL PG/PE liposome present. The SRP concentration was varied from 15 to 25 μM to ensure complete formation of the early complex. The closed complex rearrangement was initiated by adding 200 μM GppNHp to early complex mixtures. Time courses of fluorescence changes were fit to single-exponential functions to extract the rearrangement rate constants.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>In vivo assays</title><p>Wildtype or mutant FtsY with C-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tags were cloned into pTlac18 plasmid using Gibson assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>).

The 3L-Pf3 DNA sequence was synthesized by standard polymerase chain reaction using overlapping oligos as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lim et al., 2013</xref>), and cloned into FtsY constructs to make TM-fusion FtsYs. The FtsY conditional knockout strain, <italic>E. coli</italic> strain IY28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bahari et al., 2007</xref>), was a kind gift from the Bibi Lab. IY28 transformed with empty vector or with pTlac18 plasmids encoding wildtype or mutant FtsY were grown to log phase in 2.5 mL LB containing 0.2% arabinose, 100 μg/mL Ampicillin, 50 μg/mL Kanamycin at 37°C. The cells were harvested by low-speed centrifugation, washed once in LB, and resuspended to OD<sub>600</sub> = 1 in LB containing antibiotics. Serial dilutions of cell suspensions were plated in 3 μL droplets onto LB plates containing antibiotics and 0.2% arabinose or 1 mM IPTG, or no inducers.

The pellets were re-suspended in 900 μL lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 8, 100 mM KOAc, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor cocktail), incubated with 1 mg/mL lysozyme at room temperature for 30 min, and digested with DNAaseI (50 μg/mL in 16 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) on ice for 10 min. Lysed cells were sonicated in a room temperature bath sonicator. Cell debris and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 2 k rpm, 5 min in Microfuge 18 (Beckman Coulter). The total lysate sample (T) was taken from the supernatant. The inclusion body (I) was isolated by additional centrifugation at 4 k rpm for 5 min. The soluble (S) and membrane (M) fractions were further separated by ultracentrifugation at 48 k rpm for 1 hr in a TLA120.2 rotor (Optima TLX, Beckman Coulter).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen Philip Cole as the Senior Editor.

The authors propose that the lipid analysis occurs through a two-step mechanism in which FtsY initially interacts with the membrane dynamically (dynamic mode) whereupon the interaction of FtsY with SRP results in a more stable membrane interaction (stable mode). The latter likely primes FtsY for further downstream steps. FtsY seems to be prevented from stable binding by an auto-inhibitory mechanism, which is also required to discriminate cargo-loaded SRP. The work provides a deeper understanding of the role of the lipid interaction in SRP mediated protein targeting and provides clues on the possible mechanism of cargo rejection. However, the reviewers raise major concerns about the physiological relevance of the lipid compositions used in the study (see below).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is unclear why the SLBs were prepared from DOPC/DOPS. This deviates from the native lipid composition of <italic>E. coli</italic>, which is PE/PG/Cardiolipin. Making SLBs from PE/PG is likely a challenge but it is essential for the authors to confirm their results with physiologically relevant lipid compositions (70/30 PE/PG lipids). As documented in a number of publications over the past two decades, the specific lipid composition is a critical factor that impacts FtsY binding and activity. The two-step binding mode observed here might be strongly influenced by the chosen lipids so that unnatural lipid composition could lead to irrelevant kinetic observations. While the authors attribute the stable mode to a conformational change induced by SRP, it could also be due to a conformational change in FtsY upon lipid interaction independent of SRP – and not physiologically significant.</p><p>Moreover, in the GTPase and fluorescence assays, &quot;normal&quot; composition PE/PG liposomes are used whereas for the translocation assays, microsomal membranes are employed. Therefore, these distinct experiments use different lipid compositions. As the authors state that they for the first time have conducted a rigorous and quantitative analysis of the FtsY-membrane interaction, they should be consistent in their experimental conditions. It should be kept in mind that with DOPC or POPC, the FtsY GTPase is not stimulated.</p><p>Finally, NG+1 is reported to interact weakly with the membrane itself and requires SRP to drive a favorable interaction. Again, the lipid composition used in the current study is not relevant to the in vivo situation and has been shown previously to be incompatible with stable recruitment of FtsY to the membrane.</p><p>For <italic>E. coli</italic>, we have a rather profound understanding of the SRP/FtsY dynamics and of the influence of lipid binding. The membrane interaction of FtsY and its consequences for the FtsY GTPase, on SRP interaction, and on protein translocation have been described previously. A quantitative analysis that introduces two steps with different affinities and kinetics would be interesting – however, only if relevant and consistent experimental conditions are used.</p><p>2) When determining lifetimes of binding to the membrane, how do the authors control for photobleaching?

Again, the lipid composition used in the current study is not relevant to the in vivo situation and has been shown previously to be incompatible with stable recruitment of FtsY to the membrane.</italic></p><p>The answer to these questions is that although FtsY has a preference for binding anionic phospholipids (de Leeuw et al., 2000; Erez et al., 2010; Lam et al., 2010; Stjepanovic et al., 2011), modest variations in lipid composition are insufficient to alter its mechanism of regulation shown in this work. To quickly summarize our model: (i) FtsY by itself predominantly interacts with lipids via the aA1 motif, which does not require a major conformational change in this receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>); (ii) Stable complex formation with SRP is required to induce FtsY to a distinct conformation, in which its αN1 helix is removed from inhibitory contacts with the rest of the receptor and can engage stably with membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>); (iii) Bypassing the above regulation and pre-organizing FtsY into the activated conformation compromises the fidelity of substrate selection in this pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Multiple observations strongly suggest that this model is robust to modest variations in lipid composition, and only breaks down under extremely unphysiological conditions. First, bacterial SRP and FtsY can replace their mammalian homologues and mediate efficient targeting and insertion of mammalian substrates into mammalian ER microsomes (Powers and Walter 1997). The substrate selection pattern is also similar between the mammalian and bacterial SRP and SRP receptors (D. Zhang and Shan 2012). This evolutionary conservation indicates that the core regulatory mechanisms of SRP and the SRP receptor are insensitive to the difference in lipid composition between the bacterial plasma membrane versus the mammalian ER membrane. Second, the GTPase and fluorescence assays demonstrating lipid-stimulation of FtsY’s biochemical activities require 70-100% PG, whereas liposomes generated from total <italic>E. coli</italic> lipids or 70/30 PE/PG did not give any stimulation (de Leeuw et al., 2000; Lam et al., 2010; Stjepanovic et al., 2011). These earlier results indicate that super-physiologically high PG concentrations are required for a substantial fraction of free FtsY molecules to assume the activated conformation, but most of the receptors are in the auto-inhibited state in a native <italic>E. coli</italic> lipid environment, as is depicted in our current model. Finally, we note that in this work, predictions generated from SLB measurements with DOPC/DOPS-lipids were tested by in vitrotargeting assays into ER microsomes and in vivocomplementation assays in bacteria, and the good agreement between the results of all three assays further supports the notion that the precise lipid composition is not a critical factor in governing the mechanism and regulation of SRP and SRP receptor. These points are now clarified under Results section.</p><p>Pragmatically, we used DOPC/DOPS in sm-TIRF measurements because this is the most robust composition to generate high quality SLBs, which is essential for quantitative single-molecule analyses (Lin et al., PNAS 2014, Huang et al., PNAS 2016, Ziemba et al., Biochemistry 2014). In contrast, PE has a much higher melting temperature than PC and is notorious for being unable to form fluid lipid bilayers. PE/PG or <italic>E. coli</italic> SLBs are inhomogeneous and partially in a gel-phase at room temperature (Doménech et al., 2006; Seeger et al. 2009). Some literatures even concluded that it’s impossible to form stable planar SLBs with these compositions (Dodd et al., 2008; Merz et al., 2008). Reports of complete SLB formation with <italic>E. coli</italic> lipids or mimics are scarce (Nollert, Kiefer, and Jähnig 1995; Garcia-Manyes, Oncins, and Sanz 2005; Lind et al., 2015), and no direct measurements to benchmark SLB quality were shown in these articles. We nevertheless attempted to form SLBs using POPE/POPG or <italic>E. coli</italic> lipids and found that the resulting SLBs were not mobile and full of defects, as reported.</p><p>To corroborate that our observation of SRP-induced change in FtsY-lipid interaction is robust to the difference between PG and PS (anionic lipids in bacteria and the ER membrane, respectively), we repeated the SLB measurements using DOPC/DOPG side-by-side with DOPC/DOPS. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>, no significant difference in the distribution of FtsY in the two binding modes was observed between SLBs generated from these different lipid compositions, and this is true for both FtsY and FtsY(NG+1). The SRP-induced enrichment of the stable mode was also similar between the two different lipid compositions. Together, all the previous and current experimental data point to the fact that the SRP-mediated regulation of FtsY’s membrane interactions is fairly robust to variations in lipid composition.</p><p><italic>2) When determining lifetimes of binding to the membrane, how do the authors control for photobleaching? They should provide data to confirm that the bleaching timescale is much longer than the lifetime of the slow population.</italic> </p><p>We added a bleaching curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. The time-scale of photobleaching is much longer than the lifetime of the stable interaction of FtsY, and is therefore negligible. This is clarified in the Survival Probability Analysis section under Material and methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
