maternal-to-zygotic transition in embryos of Drosophila melanogaster. At mitotic cycle 8, when few zygotic genes are being transcribed, embryonic chromatin is in a relatively simple state: there are few nucleosome free regions, undetectable levels of the histone methylation marks characteristic of mature chromatin, and low levels of histone acetylation at a relatively small number of loci. Histone acetylation increases by cycle 12, but it is not until cycle 14 that nucleosome free regions and domains of histone methylation become widespread. Early histone acetylation is strongly associated with regions that we have previously shown to be bound in early embryos by the maternally deposited transcription factor Zelda, suggesting that Zelda triggers a cascade of events, including the accumulation of specific histone modifications, that plays a role in the subsequent activation of these sequences.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03737.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03737.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03737.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>For a fertilized egg to develop into an embryo, many genes must be switched on and off at specific times. A fertilized egg (or zygote) contains genetic material from both parents; and the life of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> begins with the nuclei that contain this genetic material repeatedly dividing for the first 2 hr. These nuclear divisions are initially controlled by molecules that the mother deposits into the egg cell. However, as these molecules degrade, the zygote's genome is activated and its own genes take control of embryonic development, in a process referred to as the ‘maternal-to-zygotic transition’.</p><p>In the fruit fly zygote, this burst of regulated gene activation is likely to be accompanied by changes to the way that the DNA is packed inside the nuclei. Most DNA in a cell is packaged into a structure called chromatin, which can be marked at specific sites by chemical modifications. For example, chromatin can be acetylated or methylated, which alters its physical structure, helping the underlying genes to be either activated or repressed.</p><p>In the fruit fly, the first genes to be switched on (as well as many early developmental genes) have a DNA motif that is recognized, and is bound by, a protein called Zelda. The Zelda protein plays a major role in activating the genome of the early fruit fly embryo, by marking thousands of genes and regulatory regions for activation. This is somewhat similar to the activity of so-called ‘pioneer’ factors that alter chromatin structure to allow particular genes to be switched on or off, and to trigger the formation and development of specific tissues.</p><p>Here, Li et al. have investigated whether the Zelda protein—like known pioneer factors—also affects chromatin during the maternal-to-zygotic transition. Different chromatin modifications across the whole fruit fly genome were characterized at specific time-points during the maternal-to-zygotic transition, and the information gathered was then analyzed along with previous data on gene activity.</p><p>In the early stages of the maternal-to-zygotic transition, Li et al. found very few of the chromatin features that characterize more mature cells. This indicates that the chromatin is in a so-called ‘naïve’ state. As the transition progresses, Li et al. observed that the chromatin becomes acetylated before it is methylated, and that marks associated with activation appear before those associated with repression. Chromatin acetylation was strongly associated with the early binding of the Zelda protein to its target genes.</p><p>Li et al.'s findings show when, and in what order, the different features of mature chromatin appear in <italic>Drosophila</italic> zygotes. A future challenge will be to identify whether Zelda directly recruits the proteins that cause chromatin acetylation, or whether it blocks the changes to chromatin that repress gene expression.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03737.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03737.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>histone modification</kwd><kwd>enhancers</kwd><kwd>maternal-to-zygotic transition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xiao-Yong</given-names></name><name><surname>Villalta</surname><given-names>Jacqueline E</given-names></name><name><surname>Eisen</surname><given-names>Michael B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>41/11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaplan</surname><given-names>Tommy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1796/12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaplan</surname><given-names>Tommy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Drosophila melanogaster embryos undergo a dramatic genomic transformation in the hour preceding gastrulation, as thousands of promoters and regulatory regions become biochemically distinct before they become active.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In most animals, the first phase of embryonic development depends solely on maternally deposited proteins and RNAs and is often accompanied by very low or undetectable transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Newport and Kirschner, 1982a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">1982b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>). After several hours to several days, depending on the species, zygotic transcription initiates, marking the beginning of a process known as the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) during which maternally deposited RNAs are degraded and the zygotic genome assumes control of its own mRNA production.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, sustained zygotic transcription begins around mitotic cycle 7, about an hour into development, although there is growing evidence that very low levels of transcription occur even earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali-Murthy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">ten Bosch et al., 2006</xref>). Zygotic transcription gradually increases with each subsequent mitotic cycle, but it is not until the end of mitotic cycle 13 that widespread zygotic transcription is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pritchard and Schubiger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lécuyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McKnight and Miller, 1976</xref>). This zygotic genome activation, along with the elongation of mitotic cycle, and cellularization of the syncytial nuclei defines the mid-blastula transition (MBT). Approximately 3000 genes are transcribed in the cellular blastoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Renzis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lécuyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lott et al., 2011</xref>). Of these, roughly 1000 are expressed in spatially restricted patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tomancak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Combs and Eisen, 2013</xref>), a result of the differential binding by around 50 spatially patterned transcription factors to several thousands known and putative patterning transcriptional enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacArthur et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In the cellular blastoderm, active genomic regions are biochemically distinct from the rest of the genome: they have relatively low nucleosome densities; are bound by transcription factors, polymerases and other proteins that mediate their activity; and have characteristic histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nègre et al., 2011</xref>). This high level of activity and relatively complex landscape of genome organization is remarkable given that an hour earlier the genome was being continuously replicated and doing little else. Although the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cellular blastoderm is among the most well-characterized animal tissues, the transition from quiescent to active state that precedes the formation of this tissue remains poorly understood, despite increasing evidence of its importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blythe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nien et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leichsenring et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that a single seven base-pair DNA motif is found in the vast majority of patterning enhancers active in the cellular blastoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2008</xref>), and that the maternally deposited transcription factor Zelda (ZLD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liang et al., 2008</xref>), which binds to this sequence, is present at these enhancers by mitotic cycle 8, in the early phase of the MZT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>). ZLD binding sites were also found in the promoters of most genes activated in this early phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">ten Bosch et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that ZLD may play a broad role in early embryonic genome activation and suggesting that ZLD might play a role analogous to the pioneer transcription factors that choreograph the reorganization of genome activity during differentiation, as reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zaret and Carroll, (2011)</xref>.</p><p>Although ZLD mutants alter the expression of a large number of cellular blastoderm genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liang et al., 2008</xref>), and affect transcription factor binding in the cellular blastoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yanez-Cuna et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2014</xref>), little is known about its molecular function or when its activity is required. We hypothesized that ZLD might affect transcription factor binding and enhancer activity indirectly through interactions with chromatin. To further explore this possibility, and to better situate ZLD action in the broader context of early embryogenesis, we decided to characterize the chromatin landscape of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos throughout the MZT.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Quantitative mapping of nucleosome occupancy and histone modifications across the MZT</title><p>To define the chromatin landscape before, during and after the maternal-to-zygotic transition, we collected <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (Oregon-R) embryos from population cages at 25°C for 30 min, and aged them for 55, 85, 120 and 160 min to target mitotic cycles 8, 12, 14a and 14c respectively, prior to fixing them with formaldehyde (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03737.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hand sorting based on morphology results in tightly staged embryos.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental scheme. <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos were collected and allowed to develop before being fixed with formaldehyde.

The enhancer-associated mark H3K4me1 appeared on flanking nucleosomes by cycle 14a, but the repressive H3K27me3 did not appear in surrounding regions until cycle 14c. This raises the possibility that early events, reflected by the appearance of these enhancer-associated acetylation and methylation marks, play an important role in keeping these regions active once broader domains of inactivity are established.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Early appearing chromatin features are associated with binding sites for the transcription factor ZLD</title><p>As expected from our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>), almost all enhancer sequences described above are also strongly associated with early binding of the transcription factor ZLD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This suggests that at least at the enhancers, ZLD binding is likely to play a major role in directing the deposition of the histone acetylation marks in early embryos. To investigate this further and to identify other factors that may play a major role in determining overall histone acetylation patterns, not just the enhancers in early embryos, we carried out k-mer enrichment analysis and used the motif search tool MEME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey and Elkan, 1994</xref>) to identify sequence motifs associated with different histone mark peaks identified at each stage. We found that the motif most strongly correlated with the early appearing marks, H3K27ac, H3K18ac and H4K8ac, was ZLD's CAGGTAG binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). A small number of other motifs also showed modest enrichment using these two methods, but they failed to show substantial enrichment when the enrichment is plotted around the histone mark peaks. These analyses thus suggested a close connection between ZLD binding and early histone acetylation in general, which is further highlighted by the extremely high degree of overlap between early (cycle 8) ZLD-bound peaks and early (cycles 8 or 12) peaks for H3K27ac, H3K18ac and H4K8ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The relationship is quantitative, with higher levels of ZLD binding coupled to increased levels of the same three marks in cycle 8 and cycle 12 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The relationship between ZLD binding and these histone marks decays over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), likely reflecting the increasingly complex transcriptional profile of the genome. However, the strength of this association in early stages of the MZT suggests that ZLD is indeed a dominant factor shaping the early chromatin landscape.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03737.011</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Relationship between histone occupancy, histone modification pattern and ZLD binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ZLD DNA binding motif enrichment around cycle 8 peaks for H4K8ac, H3K18ac, and H3K27ac.

By combining high-resolution gene expression analysis with precise mapping of nine histone marks throughout this early stage of development, our data suggest that this reprogramming, at least in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, occurs by transitioning through a naïve state in which many histone marks commonly present in somatic cells are absent or at comparably low levels. We further demonstrate that histone acetylation of H3K18, H3K27, and H4K8 precedes most histone methylation. Thus we suggest that the establishment of the totipotent chromatin architecture proceeds in an ordered process with acetyl marks being deposited prior to methyl marks.</p><p>Studies in other organisms have similarly suggested that this early reprogramming is characterized by a transition through a relatively unmodified chromatin state. There is a loss and then reestablishment of DNA methylation following fertilization in mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Santos et al., 2005</xref>). Immunostaining in mouse and bovine embryos has demonstrated that some histone methylation marks are removed following fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burton and Torres-Padilla, 2010</xref>). Additionally, studies in zebrafish have demonstrated widespread changes in chromatin marks as the embryo progresses through the MZT. While the extent and location of specific histone modifications in zebrafish is not consistent between recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vastenhouw et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lindeman et al., 2011</xref>), a general widespread increase in histone methylation (H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3, and H3K9me3) is evident at the MZT. Thus in most, if not all, organisms studied to date there is a dramatic increase in the abundance of histone modifications at the MZT, coinciding with zygotic genome activation.</p><p>One important lingering question is how this naïve state is established; whether there is a specific system that removes gametic marks associated with sperm and egg at fertilization, or whether the rapid replication cycles of early development are simply incompatible with active and differentiated chromatin. The lack of some histone marks in developing mouse and bovine embryos, which do not undergo rapid cell cycles early in development, suggests that while the mechanisms may vary between species, the removal of parental histone modifications may be a general feature of reprogramming. In the future, it will be important to understand how this transition is regulated to allow for the generation of a totipotent cell population.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Early transcription does not require marks canonically associated with activation</title><p>The presence of several post-translational modifications (e.g. H3K4me3 and H3K36me3) is correlated with transcription and with different states of gene expression in a variety of eukaryotic cells and tissues (c.f. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</xref>)). By comparing high temporal-resolution transcription data to the quantitative histone modification data, we find that, at least in the early embryo, transcription often occurs in the near absence of these marks. These data confirm and extend the previous observation that H3K4me3 levels are first detectable at the MBT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly global H3K36me3 levels are also below the level of detection in the mouse embryo as it undergoes the first wave of zygotic genome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boskovic et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Together these data suggest that marks canonically associated with gene activation at later stages of development are not associated with transcriptional activity in the very early zygote. Moreover, recent data has demonstrated that these marks may not be required for transcription later in development.

Therefore transcription in the absence of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 is likely not a distinctive feature of early embryonic development. Additionally, data from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> show robust transcriptional activation of a gene localized to heterochromatin in the presence of minimal amounts of H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, in zebrafish H3K4me3 was identified at promoters of genes prior to their occupancy by RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vastenhouw et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lindeman et al., 2011</xref>). Because those genes marked by H3K4me3 early are more likely than most genes to be activated at the MZT, it has been proposed that this mark is preparing genes for activation in the early zebrafish embryo.

One possibility is that ZLD directly recruits histone acetyltransferases, several of which including Nejire and Diskette are maternally deposited, and that these modifications play a direct or indirect role in genome activation. Alternatively, ZLD may simply act as a kind of steric impediment to subsequent chromatin compaction and silencing—with the observed histone acetylation an indirect byproduct of early ZLD binding.</p><p>We have previously observed that, while ZLD binding is fairly stable across the MZT, some of the regions it binds at cycle 8 are unbound at cycle 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>). This may reflect the need for other factors to work in conjunction with ZLD while more restrictive chromatin is established. Indeed, while ZLD protein levels remain high through the MZT, the increasing number of nuclei means that absolute ZLD levels are dropping in each nucleus and may reach a point at which ZLD binding alone is insufficient to keep regions active or resist silencing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>ZLD as a pioneer transcription factor</title><p>Work from Ken Zaret and others over the past decades has identified a class of transcription factors, known as ‘pioneer’ factors, that bind early to enhancers during differentiation and thereby promote the binding of other factors to the enhancer. Zaret attributes two characteristics to pioneer factors: 1) they bind to DNA prior to activation and prior to the binding of other factors, and 2) they bind their target sites in nucleosomes and in condensed chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zaret and Carroll, 2011</xref>).</p><p>ZLD clearly has the first characteristic. But it is not clear that is has the second. Our data suggest that there is essentially no condensed chromatin in the early embryo, as nucleosome density is relatively low, nucleosomes are relatively evenly distributed across the genome, and hallmarks of repressed chromatin are absent. This is consistent with the unusually broad binding of ZLD to its target sequences: ZLD binds to more than fifty percent of its target sites in the genome, far more than what is typical for other factors later in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>). We and others have shown that the restricted binding of other factors is largely due to the occlusion of most of their sites by condensed chromatin. Perhaps ZLD binds to a large fraction of its sites because there simply is no condensed chromatin in the early embryo. If so, ZLD would not require, and therefore would likely not possess, the ability to bind its sites in condensed chromatin.</p><p>Nonetheless, it is clear, if our model is correct, that ZLD is fulfilling the same general role that pioneer factors carry out—getting to the genome first and facilitating the subsequent binding of other factors.</p><p>While there are no clear ZLD homologs outside of insects, it has recently been shown that in zebrafish the transcription factor Pou5f1 (Oct4), in combination with Nanog and SoxB1, drives zygotic genome activation and may share with ZLD a pioneer-like activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leichsenring et al., 2013</xref>). Together these data suggest that pioneer transcription factors may generally be required to prepare the embryonic genome for widespread transcriptional activation at the MZT. Interestingly, Pou5f1 is homologous to the canonical pluripotency factor Oct4, which along with Nanog and Sox2, are transcription factors expressed to generate induced pluripotent stem cells. Together these data make an explicit connection between the role of pioneer-like factors in zygotic genome activation and the establishment of a totipotent state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Separation of enhancer specification from output</title><p>Another attractive feature of the model presented above is that it would explain an important and unexplained question about transcriptional enhancers: given that essentially every enhancer sized stretch of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome contains a large number of binding sites for the factors active in the cellular blastoderm (or any other stage of development) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berman et al., 2002</xref>), why is it that only a small fraction of the genome functions as an enhancer?</p><p>It has long been thought that the difference between enhancers and the remainder of the genome is that enhancers do not simply contain binding sites, but rather have these sites in a particular configuration that leads to activation.

This includes 107 genes whose onset of expression was around mitotic cycles 10–11 (‘Early’ group), 99 genes at cycles 12–13 (‘Mid’), 143 genes at early cycle 14 (‘Late’), and 99 genes during late cycle 14 (‘Later’).

In addition, we used RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lott et al., 2011</xref>) to define another class of non-expressed genes, showing no transcription from mitotic cycles 10 through the end of cycle14 (‘Silent’).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Defining embryo blastoderm enhancers</title><p>A set of putative enhancers was defined based on the in vivo binding locations for early transcription, as measured previously by us using ChIP–chip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacArthur et al., 2009</xref>).

We then identified all regions with cumulative signal over 20. This yielded 784 genomic regions, with an average length of 488 bp.

First, 7mers enriched in the 2 kb sequences around the peaks for each experiment were identified by comparing the frequency of each 7mer to the 7mer distribution in randomly selected 2 kb sequences throughout the genome. The selection of the random sequences was restricted to the major chromosome arms excluding the heterochromatic sequences, and the distribution of the number of random sequences were set to match the distribution of peaks among different chromosome arms. The enrichment of the 7mers was ranked based on Z scores. In parallel, the motif enrichment analysis was also carried out using MEME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey and Elkan, 1994</xref>) with motif length set at 6–10 and maximum number of motifs to be found at 10. In this case the sequences located in the 250–650 bp surrounding the maximum of the histone mark peak were used, and random sequences selected using the same criteria as the kmer enrichment analysis were used as negative control. The search was limited to the 150 top ranked peaks for each histone mark. After the candidate enriched motif was identified from these two methods, the motifs were used to map the enrichment around all the peaks by patser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hertz and Stormo, 1999</xref>) using a ln(p-value) cutoff of −7.5, and with Alphabet set at ‘a:t 0.3 c:g 0.2’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>ChIP-seq in <italic>zld</italic> mutant embryos</title><p>To obtain embryos depleted of maternal <italic>zld</italic> RNA, the FLP-DFS technique was used.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Chris Ponting (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript presents interesting data that provide a unique view into how histone modifications accumulate at enhancers that are activated during the maternal-to-zygotic transition. The reviewers agree in principle that this is worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, two major concerns on the manuscript need to be addressed before further consideration.</p><p>1) The first is a concern raised by reviewer 2 on the normalization of datasets across different samples (here embryonic stages and wildtype versus Zelda-depleted embryos), when the samples are expected to strongly differ in the strengths and relevant features.</p><p>2) The second is a shared general concern of both reviewers that key aspects of existing literature are not cited and integrated into the text. Several conclusions drawn are already well established in the literature. These omissions detract from the balance and quality of the work and must be addressed. Specific examples are noted in the reviewers' opinions, which are included below to aid the authors in revising the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>Li et al. perform a careful genome-wide analysis of various histone modifications during the maternal-to-zygotic transition in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. Their major finding is that histone acetylation at many residues is present before the mid-blastula transition and that the presence correlates with sites of Zelda motifs and Zelda binding. In contrast, histone methylation, including H3K4me1, which is thought to be a general mark of enhancers, is not present until after widespread transcription begins during the mid-blastula transition.</p><p>Overall, the data and the analysis seemed to be of high quality and provide a unique view into how histone modifications accumulate at enhancers that are activated during the maternal-to-zygotic transition. Unfortunately, the interpretation of the data frequently does not take into account the current knowledge of the literature and thus many observations that the authors describe are either already published or are very speculative and not well supported. While the novelty of the manuscript lies in the enhancer analysis before transcription begins, the authors spend quite a deal on well-studied areas such as the role of H3K27me3 or the differences in nucleosomes and histone modifications at different gene classes (see below). These oversights unfortunately detract from the manuscript and leave me wondering what the novelty and significance of the presented findings is. Looking at the data, I do think that the manuscript has value but I would have expected a much more balanced paper (with the inclusion of appropriate citations and better emphasis on what's novel) for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Findings that were already known and not acknowledged:</p><p>1) The authors write “Despite the generally assumed correlation between H3K4me3 at promoters and H3K36me36 at gene bodies, our data demonstrate that at early expressed genes transcription proceeds in the absence of these marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).”</p><p>It has become clear in the last few years that this general assumption is incorrect. Rach et al. (PLOS Genetics 2011) showed that epigenetic features such as histone modifications differ between promoter classes and this difference has also been observed between the five chromatin states observed by Bas van Steensel'd group in Kc cells. They show that H3K36me3 is specific for yellow chromatin (housekeeping genes) versus red (developmental genes). Finally, Chen et al. (eLife 2013) showed that genes expressed before the midblatula transition in <italic>Drosophila</italic> do not show H3K4me3. The latter paper is cited in the manuscript with regard to the Pol II data so I am surprised that the authors do not cite the paper in this context.</p><p>2) The authors write “Surprisingly, we observed NFRs at the promoters of maternally deposited genes at all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), even though there is no evidence that genes in this set are transcribed either from expression data or ChIP with RNA polymerase.”</p><p>Actually, the traditional view is usually that promoters are naturally nucleosome-free. However, it is known from yeast and <italic>Drosophila</italic> and that regulated promoters tend to have a strong disposition for promoter nucleosomes. For example, it has been shown by Gilchrist et al. (Cell 2010) and Gaertner et al. (Cell reports 2012) that promoters with paused Pol II (thus developmental genes) tend to have a strong promoter nucleosome when Pol II is not present. Thus, the fact that maternal genes and developmental genes have a different natural nucleosome configuration at the promoter was already known.</p><p>3) The authors find that H3K27me3 was completely absent from maternal genes and they speculate in quite some detail about the “balanced state” of Polycomb-repressed genes as if nothing had been said about this before. The fact that H3K27me3 is specifically found at developmental genes both in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals has been known for a long time (e.g. Schwartz 2006, Boyer 2006, Lee 2006) and the relationship between H3K27me3 and Pol II (the balanced state) is fairly complex and not accurately described in the manuscript.</p><p>Recommended reading (to name a few): Dellino (Mol Cell 2004); Stock et al. (Nat Cell Biol 2007); Enderle et al. (Genome Res 2011); Gaertner et al. (Cell reports 2012); Bonn et al. (Nat Genet 2012); Lehmann et al. (JBC 2012)</p><p>4) The authors propose that inconsistent results from reporter assays on Zelda enhancers stem from the fact that reporter lines usually have insulator sites and thus are not under the influence of Polycomb repression. This is certainly a good point but has previously been reported by Arnold at el. (Science 2013). In fact, Arnold et al. found this in S2 cells, suggesting that this is a general phenomenon and not specifically linked to Zelda.</p><p>Other major points:</p><p>The authors describe “within the broad H3k27me3 domains, the signal was almost completely absent in regions corresponding to ZLD-binding peaks” and speculate a fair bit about the significance. However, the simplest explanation for this is that ZLD-bound regions are nucleosome-depleted and thus do not have H3K27me3 signal. Looking at the average plots of other histone modifications on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, this dip is certainly observed for all other histone modifications, too (although the scale is different so it's hard to compare). The overlap between ZLD-bound regions and H3K27me3 regions as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> is actually fairly low (&lt;50%) and could be explained by the fact that both Zelda and H3K27me3 are preferentially found at developmental genes. I would predict that the same relationship would be found between any other early transcription factor and H3K27me3 regions. I do find it very conceivable, however, that the H327ac that accumulates at ZLD enhancers would prevent H3K27me3 (as described by Tie et al. Development 2009) but the data shown in the manuscript have not convinced me yet that this is visible in the genome-wide H3K27me3 data (I am also surprised that the authors do not cite this paper).</p><p>The authors propose that some enhancers that are bound by Zelda and have H3K27me3 are poised for future activation later in development. Unfortunately, this is only based on one gene and its published expression pattern. At the very least, one would like to see that the ZLD-bound region is indeed a late enhancer (e.g. based on Kwon et al. Nature 2014) and that this pattern can be observed for multiple enhancers. To my knowledge, early ZLD-bound regions are generally not active late so I would need better evidence to be convinced otherwise.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>How zygotic genomes are transcriptionally activated during early embryogenesis is an important open question. The authors determine the genomic distribution of histone H3 and different histone marks at 4 stages of embryogenesis using ChIP from tightly staged embryos. They integrate these datasets with previously published data on transcription and the binding of Pol II and the transcription factor Zelda. This allows the authors to investigate the dynamics of these chromatin features in general, at the transcription starting sites of different sets of genes (e.g. genes expressed during early embryogenesis, maternal genes, etc.), and around the locations of putative blastoderm embryo enhancers. Overall, this reveals that the genome appears relatively uniformly at mitotic cycle 8 and acquires the different histone modifications and nucleosome free regions only later between cycles 12 and 14. Correlations between histone modification patterns and Zelda binding strengthens the previous notion that Zelda is involved in zygotic genome activation and in defining embryonic enhancers. The authors repeat some of their experiments and analyses in embryos in which Zelda had been genetically depleted and found that the chromatin structure at intergenic position that bind Zelda in wildtype embryos was strongly affected while little effect was observed at TSS.</p><p>I find this an interesting and important paper that presents a time-course of how prominent chromatin features associated with transcription and transcriptional regulation are formed during the activation of the zygotic genome in early embryogenesis. I have only 1 major technical comment and a few suggestions that might help the authors to clarify a few sections of the text and figures.</p><p>Major technical comment:</p><p>The normalization of datasets across different samples (here embryonic stages and wildtype versus Zelda-depleted embryos) is an important issue, especially when the samples are expected to strongly differ in the strengths or even the presence of the studied features. The authors present an elegant solution: prior to the chromatin immunoprecipication, they mix their stage-specific <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> chromatin samples with a constant spike-in sample, <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> chromatin from stage 5 (mitotic cycle 14) embryos. As the associated DNA molecules differ characteristically in their sequences, the origin of the sequencing reads can be determined after deep sequencing, allowing the normalization of the different <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> samples to the constant spike-in <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> sample.</p><p>Judging from the description of the data normalization, this spike-in control might however have been used sub-optimally; the authors state that they normalize their data based on the number of reads, which can only ensure that the same number of reads (i.e. the same 'sequencing power') goes into the analysis of each sample. While this makes sense for RNA-seq data, it does not account for possible experimental variability in a ChIP experiment and the results are in my opinion difficult to interpret. In other words, the number of reads is unrelated and uninformative regarding the quality of a ChIP enrichment, i.e. if the IP step enriched for the respective antibody epitope comparably strongly or not. Similarly, it cannot control for potential differences in library complexity, i.e. the number of identical reads that can arise during PCR amplification.</p><p>To demonstrate that the different experiments worked comparably, the authors should determine peaks in the D. pseudoobscura spike-in sample and show that they are of similar heights across the different experiments (e.g. next to the respective <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> data). This is particularly relevant when no signal is seen in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> samples, e.g. for early stages in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figure 5, 6</xref>, and the current normalization cannot exclude that the ChIP failed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03737.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We have addressed the concern of reviewer 2 about normalization with several additional analyses, and we have extensively rewritten the manuscript to more fully and accurately cite the relevant literature and contextualize our results.

However, our primary point was that ZLD binding tends to interrupt regions H3K27me3 – it is this spatial relationship, not the specific mechanism of depletion, to which we were referring. We have rewritten the sections referring to H3K27me3 to make this clear.</p><p><italic>The overlap between ZLD-bound regions and H3K27me3 regions as shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8A</italic></xref> <italic>is actually fairly low (&lt;50%) and could be explained by the fact that both Zelda and H3K27me3 are preferentially found at developmental genes. I would predict that the same relationship would be found between any other early transcription factor and H3K27me3 regions</italic>.</p><p>We have dropped this section from the paper. We agree with the reviewer, it was not compelling.</p><p><italic>I do find it very conceivable, however, that the H327ac that accumulates at ZLD enhancers would prevent H3K27me3 (as described by Tie et al. Development 2009) but the data shown in the manuscript have not convinced me yet that this is visible in the genome-wide H3K27me3 data (I am also surprised that the authors do not cite this paper)</italic>.</p><p>We have added a discussion of Tie’s results to the Discussion section, and agree that this is a tantalizing possibility, although our current data do not really speak to it.</p><p><italic>The authors propose that some enhancers that are bound by Zelda and have H3K27me3 are poised for future activation later in development. Unfortunately, this is only based on one gene and its published expression pattern. At the very least, one would like to see that the ZLD-bound region is indeed a late enhancer (e.g. based on Kwon et al. Nature 2014) and that this pattern can be observed for multiple enhancers. To my knowledge, early ZLD-bound regions are generally not active late so I would need better evidence to be convinced otherwise</italic>.</p><p>There are several additional examples of this, but we feel that additional data are needed to understand their functional relevance, so we have removed any discussion of poised enhancers from the paper.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>[…] Judging from the description of the data normalization, this spike-in control might however have been used sub-optimally; the authors state that they normalize their data based on the number of reads, which can only ensure that the same number of reads (i.e. the same 'sequencing power') goes into the analysis of each sample. While this makes sense for RNA-seq data, it does not account for possible experimental variability in a ChIP experiment and the results are in my opinion difficult to interpret. In other words, the number of reads is unrelated and uninformative regarding the quality of a ChIP enrichment, i.e. if the IP step enriched for the respective antibody epitope comparably strongly or not. Similarly, it cannot control for potential differences in library complexity, i.e. the number of identical reads that can arise during PCR amplification</italic>.</p><p><italic>To demonstrate that the different experiments worked comparably, the authors should determine peaks in the</italic> D. pseudoobscura <italic>spike-in sample and show that they are of similar heights across the different experiments (e.g. next to the respective</italic> D. melanogaster <italic>data). This is particularly relevant when no signal is seen in the</italic> D. melanogaster <italic>samples, e.g. for early stages in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6"><italic>Figure 5, 6</italic></xref><italic>, and the current normalization cannot exclude that the ChIP failed.</italic></p><p>We agree with everything the reviewer says here. Indeed we had done all of the analyses they suggest in the early stages of this paper, and chose to use the simple read-based normalization because the results were the same as when we used peak heights. We note that while it is certainly true that there is a lot of variation between antibodies in the efficacy of the immunoprecipitation, here we are only normalizing between parallel IPs using the same antibody (and carried out at the same time). While it is obviously possible for there to be differences in IP efficiency between experiments with the same antibody, our results here, and more generally, suggest that this is relatively uncommon, meaning that read- based normalization will work in most cases. Nonetheless, we have added an additional figure addressing consistency in the <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> IPs and discuss the use of peak-based normalization in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
