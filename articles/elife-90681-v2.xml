This recognition of pathogens is driven by the interaction between membrane-bound T cell receptors (TCRs) and antigenic peptides presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. The formation of the TCR-peptide-MHC complex (TCR-pMHC) involves interactions among germline-encoded and hypervariable amino acids. Germline-encoded and hypervariable regions can form contacts critical for complex formation, but only interactions between germline-encoded contacts are likely to be shared across many of all the possible productive TCR-pMHC complexes. Despite this, experimental investigation of these interactions have focused on only a small fraction of the possible interaction space. To address this, we analyzed every possible germline-encoded TCR-MHC contact in humans, thereby generating the first comprehensive characterization of these largely antigen-independent interactions. Our computational analysis suggests that germline-encoded TCR-MHC interactions that are conserved at the sequence level are rare due to the high amino acid diversity of the TCR CDR1 and CDR2 loops, and that such conservation is unlikely to dominate the dynamic protein-protein binding interface. Instead, we propose that binding properties such as the docking orientation are defined by regions of biophysical compatibility between these loops and the MHC surface.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TCR</kwd><kwd>MHC</kwd><kwd>germline interactions</kwd><kwd>biophysics</kwd><kwd>bioinformatics</kwd><kwd>co-evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIA AI001076-16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meier-Schellersheim</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A comprehensive computational study of germline-encoded T cell receptor CDR loops and MHC alpha-helices finds limited evidence for evolutionary conserved interactions, and instead suggests broad biophysical compatibility guides the interactions between the two proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The interaction between T cell receptors (TCRs) and the peptide-presenting major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecule is a nanometer-scale recognition event with macroscopic consequences for health and control of disease. In αβ T cells, the six complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops of the TCR are responsible for scanning the pMHC surface and determining the appropriate immunological response. Since the first crystal structures of a TCR-pMHC complex were solved in 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garcia et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garboczi et al., 1996</xref>), general ‘rules of engagement’ between TCR and pMHC have been identified and reliably reproduced in subsequent structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garcia et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yin et al., 2012</xref>). First, the peptide is presented in the ‘groove’ formed by the two α-helices of either the class I or class II MHC molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bjorkman et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brown et al., 1993</xref>). The TCR then scans this peptide primarily using the highly diverse CDR3 loops of the TCRα and TCRβ chains, whose sequences are determined by V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jung and Alt, 2004</xref>). The sequences of the remaining two CDR1 and CDR2 loops of the α and β chains are entirely determined by germline TRAV and TRBV genes, respectively. In a majority of structures, these CDR1 and CDR2 loops make a number of key contacts with well-defined regions of the likewise germline-encoded MHC <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gras et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, previous work has found a large list of deviations from these classic ‘rules of engagement’. The hypervariable CDR3 residues can dominate the interactions with the germline-encoded MHC α-helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Piepenbrink et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Singh et al., 2022</xref>), germline-encoded CDRs can interact strongly with peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Piepenbrink et al., 2013</xref>), an exceptionally long peptide can ‘bulge’ causing separation between germline-encoded regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tynan et al., 2005</xref>), or the docking orientation can even be entirely reversed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beringer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gras et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zareie et al., 2021</xref>). When considering the large number of possible TCR-pMHC interactions and the substantial crossreactivity of TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Riley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sewell, 2012</xref>), these historically non-canonical interactions may in fact be rather common. Despite this great variability inherent in TCR-pMHC complex formation, the docking orientation of the TCR over MHC molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) falls within a tight distribution of angles for the majority of structures solved thus far (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>) nearly independent of the strong variation in the CDR3 and peptide sequences involved. This suggests that interactions between germline-encoded regions play fundamentally important roles.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A breakdown of the canonical docking orientation adopted by TCRs over the pMHC complex in all solved crystal structures to date highlights the strong structural conservation of the TCR-pMHC interaction.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Example renderings of TCR-pMHC complexes for class I (A, PDB: 6MTM) and class II (B, PDB: 1J8H) MHC molecules.

This selection occurs in the presence of the potentially orientation-determining co-receptors CD4 or CD8. However, evidence for this hypothesis of docking determined by selection comes largely from a study utilizing a knockout system that deviates strongly from the physiological norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Van Laethem et al., 2007</xref>), or from the identification of rare ‘reverse-docking’ TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beringer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gras et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zareie et al., 2021</xref>). Alternatively, the extent of this orientational preference may reflect a co-evolution of interacting, germline-encoded regions of TCR and MHC molecules. In support of this hypothesis, a number of mouse studies have identified key residue pairs critical for TCR-pMHC binding which were later structurally validated and found in other, distantly related organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scott-Browne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Krovi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blevins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Scott-Browne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dai et al., 2008</xref>). While these studies find evidence of conserved interactions for a small subset of alleles, no work thus far has found consistent conservation across the full range of possible TCR-MHC molecule interactions.</p><p>These observations underscore the need for a more thorough understanding of the fundamental role of CDR1 and CDR2 in the recognition of pMHC complexes, either as sculptors of the TCR-pMHC interface, or as opportunistic reinforcements to a protein-protein interaction largely determined by the CDR3 loops and peptide involved. Due in part to the concentration of diversity at the CDR3-peptide interface, a majority of studies characterizing TCR-pMHC interactions have focused on describing immune recognition events in the context of this interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birnbaum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sharon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sibener et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Krovi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Burrows et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ishigaki et al., 2022</xref>). This runs counter to the relative contributions of the germline-encoded regions that account for a majority (75–80%) of the binding interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garcia et al., 2009</xref>). The progress made thus far can largely be attributed to X-ray crystallography, the gold standard for the study of TCR-pMHC interactions. However, this approach is severely limited by its low-throughput nature, calling its utility for this particular combinatorial problem into question. While a majority of the 45 productive TCRα-encoding TRAV and 48 productive TCRβ-encoding TRBV genes in humans have been crystallized at least once in complex with pMHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gowthaman and Pierce, 2019</xref>), the total of 149 crystallized human TCR-pMHC complexes pales in comparison to the 2160 possible productive TRAV-TRBV pairings. When we further consider the nearly 900 known unique amino acid sequences of class I MHC in humans (also referred to as class I human leukocyte antigen - HLA), we find that structural studies to date have covered less than 0.01% of the total possible TCR-MHC germline interaction space.</p><p>While structural modeling is an intriguing alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Milighetti et al., 2021</xref>), predictions of the conformations adopted by flexible TCR or antibody CDR loops and the placement of the antigen-contacting amino acid side chains on these loops have been found to be somewhat unreliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Evans et al., 2022</xref>). In the work reported here, we explore how much insight about TCR-MHC interactions can be gained using a simplified, pseudo-structural representation of the biophysics of protein interactions that scores amino acid interactions as either productive, neutral, or counter-productive with regard to complex formation. Using the Automated Immune Molecule Separator (AIMS) software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boughter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boughter and Meier-Schellersheim, 2023</xref>) we generated the first systematic characterization of every germline-encoded TRAV-MHC and TRBV-MHC interaction through such a pseudo-structural approach. The AIMS architecture allows us to analyze the CDR1 and CDR2 contributions to interactions with MHC molecules independent of CDR3, providing a not previously explored antigen-independent perspective on the TCR-MHC complex. We find that the great diversity present in the CDR1 and CDR2 loops encoded by TRAV and TRBV genes in humans, as well as the dynamic nature of amino acid side chains, makes strongly conserved interactions between TCR germline-encoded residues and MHC <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-helices highly unlikely. This suggests that the few strongly evolutionarily conserved interactions that have been identified previously in the literature should be considered exceptions and not the rule. Importantly, however, analyzing the biophysical compatibility for each germline-encoded CDR residue and those on the MHC α-helices, we find evidence of an evolutionary conserved region of permissible binding on the MHC molecular surface responsible for the observed canonical orientation of the TCR-MHC molecular complex. These measures of biophysical compatibility between germline CDRs and MHC α-helices can be used as a basis for understanding TCR-pMHC interactions, and as a tool for understanding how perturbations to these regions alter these interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Starting from the TRAV and TRBV protein entries from the ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brochet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lefranc, 2014</xref>) and the IMGT-HLA database containing all identified HLA alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mack et al., 2013</xref>), we include only productive genes and unique amino acid sequences in our final analysis dataset. This final dataset included a total of 882 unique class I MHC sequences (HLA-A, B, and C), 44 class II α chain sequences (HLA-DQα, DRα, and DPα), and 431 class II β chain sequences (HLA-DQβ, DRβ, and DPβ). Due to significant differences in the alignments and more nuanced differences in the structures of these MHC molecules, we analyzed these three groups separately and compare the results as appropriate.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Polymorphic HLA molecules are far less diverse than human TRAV and TRBV genes</title><p>We first searched for potentially conserved interactions between TCR and MHC molecules that would suggest a strong coevolution between the two. Such biases in the amino acid usage of TCR and MHC molecules at specific sites can occur either in the form of full amino acid conservation, or as pairs of meaningfully co-varying amino acids found across multiple diverse sites. Without the structural data necessary to precisely identify these conserved interactions, we can characterize the diversity present in TRAV, TRBV, and HLA amino acid sequences using bioinformatic approaches and determine whether a conserved germline-encoded interaction is possible for each unique molecular combination. We quantified the diversity in these molecular subsets using concepts from information theory. Specifically, the amino acid diversity of each TRAV, TRBV, and HLA sequence encoded into an alignment matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) was quantified by calculating the Shannon entropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shannon, 1948</xref>) for each individual dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The alignment matrix of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> provides the basis for all of our pseudo-structural analyses throughout this manuscript.

Despite the low number of TRAV and TRBV genes significant diversity persists in CDR1 and CDR2, suggesting limited conservation in those residues most likely to contact the MHC surface. Further, most of the entropy in MHC class I alleles is concentrated in the peptide-binding region. In this more diverse region the entropy tops out at around 2 bits, which corresponds to at most 4 equiprobable amino acids, or a distribution of a slightly larger number of amino acids strongly skewed towards one particular amino acid. In the α-helical regions that are in contact with the germline-encoded CDR loops, the class I entropy reaches a maximum of 1.5 bits, or at most 3 equiprobable amino acids. These same trends persist for the analysis of class II HLA alleles, with sequence diversity more limited in the class II α-helices when compared to the germline-encoded CDR loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>).</p><p>HLA alleles are polymorphic, which can be misconstrued as having high sequence diversity in MHC molecules across the human population. However, the polymorphic sites are limited to a minority of the total variable positions within the MHC nucleotide sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>), which suggests even more limited variability at the amino acid level. While there are many unique alleles, these alleles are largely similar, especially when compared to other, more diverse protein families that are strongly structurally conserved but sequentially divergent, as in the neuronal Dpr-DIP system in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nandigrami et al., 2022</xref>). Conversely, despite the low number of TCR germline genes present in humans, the diversity is substantial, with multiple sites across the CDR loops harboring over 10 unique amino acids. This mismatched diversity between the TCR germline-encoded CDR loops and the MHC α-helices suggests that conserved germline-encoded interactions are unlikely to exist for every possible molecular combination, either within a single individual or across the human population more broadly. Mutual information calculations (see Methods) corroborate these observations by quantifying this lack of co-variation of germline-encoded TCR and MHC residues in both humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and in a wider range of mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>).

Pairing this with an α-helical site on HLA molecules which likewise only permits hydrophilic residues would represent a likely site of conserved interaction.

We further contextualized these findings with specific examples from KIR-MHC and TCR-MHC molecular interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>).

From this, we can see how diversity in each region reinforces or disrupts potentially conserved interactions at each site.

Similarly, diversity is exceptionally limited at the interacting sites on the HLA-C α2 helix.</p><p>Contrasting this with the regions involved in the YXY motif interactions, we see much higher diversity across both the TCR and MHC molecules. Considering specifically the conserved lysine on the α1 helix, we see that some of the residues utilized by TRBV-encoded CDR2 would create a strong conflict with the proposed conserved interaction site. While the YXY motif present on a few TRBV genes is clearly evolutionarily conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Scott-Browne et al., 2011</xref>) it is evident that substitutions either on CDR2β or on the MHC α1 helix would disrupt this interaction.

However, incorporation of such information for a given interaction requires extensive knowledge of the structural details of the complex of interest, which as discussed previously, is not available for all possible TRAV/TRBV pairings.

For instance, we shouldn’t expect a priori that a Tyr-Gln interaction would be a common backbone-sidechain or sidechain-sidechain interaction, as both of these sidechains are relatively bulky. While the ‘biases’ introduced by the structures solved thus far may not be biases at all, and could in fact be signatures of TCR recognition, it is difficult to decouple the signal from the noise without more structural information.</p><p>Despite the challenges associated with aligning model predictions with structural data, AIMS interaction scores are useful to identify those germline TRAV- and TRBV-encoded CDR loops that may make more frequent contacts with the MHC α-helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). We find significant increases in the number of CDR1/2 sidechain contacts with both MHC helix sidechain and backbone atoms in TRAV sequences predicted by the AIMS interaction potential to be stronger interaction partners. While a similar agreement between interaction potential and sidechain contacts is seen for TRBV, these differences are not statistically significant. This effect is less pronounced for TCR backbone atom interactions with MHC sidechain and backbone atoms, as one would expect given that these interactions are not accounted for in the AIMS interaction potential. Interestingly, these interaction potentials show better experimental agreement and predictive power for TRAV-encoded sequences compared to TRBV-encoded sequences. This could be due either to a fundamental difference in how TCRα and TCRβ contact the MHC α-helices, or in part due to the aforementioned higher interaction potential variance for TRAV-encoded CDR loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>However, there are still clear deviations from the predictions we can achieve at this point. In these structures, it appears that the CDR3-peptide interactions dominate the interface, overruling all other trends in germline-encoded interactions. We can consider an extreme example, looking at the germline-encoded and peptide contacts of a so-called ‘super-bulged’ peptide bound to MHC class I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tynan et al., 2005</xref>). In this structure, the TRAV19 and TRBV6-1 encoded CDR loops, which are both identified as having a high interaction potential with HLA class I molecules, make limited germline-encoded contacts with MHC side-chains. There is only a single germline-encoded sidechain interaction between TRAV19 and the MHC α2-helix. As is evident from this structure, significant CDR3-peptide interactions are capable of strongly altering the TCR-MHC interface, regardless of which TRAV and TRBV genes are used. Absent these dominating CDR3-peptide contacts, the interaction potentials serve as a strong, structurally validated quantification of the likelihood of each germline-encoded CDR loop to interact with MHC α-helices.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Biophysical constraints on the MHC surface create germline-encoded biases in docking angles</title><p>Having experimentally validated the interaction matrices in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we explored whether there exist structural biases in the interactions between germline-encoded TCR CDR loops and MHC α-helices. First, we divided these matrices into separate datasets for each HLA group A, B, and C. We then calculated the interaction potentials across every HLA allele and TRAV or TRBV gene and identified the relative contribution of each CDR loop interacting with each HLA α-helix. From these distributions of contributions, our interaction potentials suggest that the constructive TCR β-chain interactions with the HLA α1-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and perhaps to a lesser extent destructive interactions between the TCR α-chain and the MHC α1-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), may moderately bias the binding orientation between TCR and class I HLA molecules. This reliance on TCR β-chain interactions to guide the overall TCR-MHC interaction has been suggested previously in the literature based upon multiple early observations in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marrack and Kappler, 1987</xref>).

Nearly every crystallized TCR-HLA class II complex solved thus far adopts the canonical docking orientation whereby the TCR β-chain binds to the HLA α-chain helix, while the TCR α-chain binds to the HLA β-chain helix, with few notable exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beringer et al., 2015</xref>). It is important to note that these interaction potentials take an unbiased approach, calculating every possible interaction between TCR and MHC residues to produce this final score. Therefore, this inconsistency between our interaction potential distributions and crystallized structures may arise from variations across a given MHC helix obscuring the interaction potentials within the canonical binding region, highlighting the need for a more precise approach. To more carefully characterize the CDR loop interactions with MHC α-helices and attempt to alleviate this inconsistency, we isolated the contributions of each individual residue in the HLA class I and class II sequence alignments to the interaction potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Breakdown of the interaction potential for every exposed residue on HLA surfaces.</title><p>Color coded structures of HLA class I (<bold>A</bold>, PDB: 6MTM) and class II (<bold>B</bold>, PDB: 1J8H) provide the structural context to the bioinformatic results.

These TCR-exposed residues are colored based approximately upon the register a TCR would adopt upon binding each subset, whereby TCRs adopting the canonical binding orientation would contact the residues colored in cyan and pink, and non-canonical binders would contact the blue and red residues. For both HLA class I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, top) and class II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, top), we found a conserved pattern of specific regions of peak interaction potentials surrounded by immediate drop-offs in these interaction potentials. In all but the HLA class I α1-helix, the interaction potentials adopt a distinctly bimodal distribution over the surface of the HLA molecules. In the case of class I molecules, our interaction analysis suggests that the TCR β-chain binds to the HLA class I α1-helix nearly indiscriminately, with potential to form many interactions. The TCR α-chain then contributes to the orientation of the interactions by binding to the HLA class I α2-helix in one of two discrete regions. Conversely, interactions between the αβ TCR and HLA class II molecules appear to have a more defined register for binding, with both the HLA class II α-chain and β-chain interactions with TCR forming distinct bimodal distributions.</p><p>We then compared these by-residue interaction breakdowns to crystallized TCR-pMHC structures, counting the number of side-chain interactions between CDR loops and the solvent-exposed residues of the MHC helices. For HLA class I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, bottom), we found good agreement between our predictions and the crystal contacts. Particularly for contacts with the α2-helix, we see that the majority of CDR1/2α contacts fall directly within the predicted regions of non-zero interaction potential. Comparisons to HLA class II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, bottom) are more difficult, again due to the relative dearth of crystallized structures. Overall, these results further contextualize the seemingly inconsistent findings of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. While the interactions with the class II β-chain are stronger, we see that the average over all interactions with the α-chain are subdued by the very weak interaction potential of the non-canonical binding region.

Even without these eccentric exceptions, evidence for evolutionarily conserved interactions have only been convincingly shown for a small subset of TRAV and TRBV genes. Here, we report the results of the first systematic study across these variable alleles.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Diversity analysis rules out the existence of specific conserved contacts for a majority of TRAV- and TRBV-encoded CDR loops</title><p>Using AIMS, a recently developed software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boughter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boughter and Meier-Schellersheim, 2023</xref>) for encoding and analyzing amino acid sequences and their biophysical properties in the context of molecular interactions, we found that across all tested TRAV, TRBV, and HLA alleles, there is no evidence of strongly conserved germline-encoded interactions that exist for all possible combinations of TRAV/TRBV genes and HLA polymorphisms. The sequence-level diversity in the germline-encoded TCR CDR loops alone makes such interactions highly unlikely. Biophysical analysis further confirmed that the wide range of physical properties of these highly diverse germline-encoded CDR loops can lead to steric conflicts in regions where other germline genes create productive interaction networks. These findings suggest that conserved TCR-MHC interactions spanning species identified thus far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blevins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scott-Browne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Scott-Browne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dai et al., 2008</xref>) may be rare across the entirety of the immune repertoire.

Surprisingly, this analysis may suggest why, in spite of the observed sequence variability, we find rather well-conserved TCR-pMHC docking orientations. Across nearly all tested human polymorphisms, we found that class I and class II MHC helices are composed of moderately diverse regions of increased interaction potential interrupted by centrally located, well-conserved regions of low interaction potential. These regions of low interaction potential define a conserved docking orientation, with room for slight variability in orientation about the flanking regions of higher interaction potential. Our findings do not contradict the previously proposed concept of ‘interaction codons’ whereby specific TCR-MHC pairs are predisposed to interact in multiple registers dependent upon the peptide bound to the MHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garcia et al., 2009</xref>). However, these codons as currently posited suggest the existence of multiple rigid docking modes, consistent with their ideation deriving from solved crystal structures. The results of our analyses suggest a broader, dynamic interpretation of the TCR-pMHC interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devlin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Smith et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Borbulevych et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Scott et al., 2011</xref>), with the TCR CDR loops sampling local regions of increased interaction potential on the MHC surface, utilizing a more opportunistic approach to binding. Further, while the interaction codon hypothesis suggests co-evolved interaction interfaces between the TCR and MHC, our analysis suggests that each TRAV-TRBV pairing finds a unique approach to binding within the constraints permitted by the MHC molecular surface. In other words, the MHC molecule largely defines the interface.</p><p>In further extending these dynamic interpretations of the TCR-pMHC interface, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations highlight the inherently fleeting nature of sidechain interactions.

Over the course of these simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), the intrinsic motility of the glutamine sidechain in the interface significantly alters the interpretation of the tyrosine-alanine interaction from a well-evolved notch reserved for TCR binding to merely a consequence of other factors determined strongly by the potentially more dominant CDR3 interactions with the interface.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Molecular simulations of the so-called ”knob-in-hole” interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garcia, 2012</xref>) highlight the dynamic nature of protein sidechains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The starting crystal structure (PDB:1FYT) suggests a tight packing between TYR50 on CDR2β and GLN57 and ALA61 on the class II α-chain.

The CDR loops encoded by these TRAV and TRBV genes each have largely distinct binding strategies with MHC. While many V-genes encode CDR1 and CDR2 loops with equal interaction potentials with MHC α-helices, a small subset appears to favor one or the other for binding to MHC molecules. Importantly, these preferences seem to be accompanied by compensatory contributions to binding; the interaction potentials of TRBV6-1, 6–2, and 6–3 have negligible CDR2β contributions to binding, but in turn have a stronger propensity for MHC binding via CDR1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.). These compensatory contributions to binding are suggestive of a mix-and-match strategy for peptide-MHC complex recognition, consistent with previous findings highlighting the strong dependence of complex geometry on CDR3 residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stadinski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Piepenbrink et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>What these previous studies and our computational results suggest is that for a T cell to recognize a given antigen, the CDR3 loops must bind sufficiently strongly to the peptide, while the CDR1 and CDR2 loops can provide a basal level of support for the more complex-specific CDR3-induced binding.

The diversity in the V-genes instead permits a range of recognition strategies independent of, and complementary to, the V(D)J recombination-generated CDR3 loops.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Biophysical compatibility between germline encoded TCR sequences and MHC does not rule out alternative binding modes</title><p>The general TCR-MHC compatibility as suggested by our results does not rule out the possibility of reversed-docking TCRs, suggesting both evolution and selection play a strong role in the conservation of the canonical docking orientation. While it is unclear how prevalent these reversed-docking TCRs are in the pre-selected immune repertoire, it is clear that they are deficient in their ability to signal due to the distance-sensitivity of the coreceptor-associated Lck in interactions with the CD3 signaling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gras et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zareie et al., 2021</xref>). In our analysis of the biophysical compatibility between germline-encoded TCR sequences and their potential interaction sites on the MHC molecule, we found strong indications that this may be a necessary coevolutionary tradeoff. Over evolutionary history, TCR and MHC molecules have had to balance a conservation of canonical modes of contact with the need to maintain sequence variability in the face of evolutionary pressure. This pressure, exerted by pathogenic challenges, may have forced a drift away from rigid coevolution at the level of amino acid sequences, necessitating this loose compatibility, even at the cost of a major subset of receptors being destined for thymic deletion due to an inability to generate productive signal.</p><p>New results further suggest the extent of the germline interaction permissiveness, with a class-mismatched CD4+ T cell capable of binding to and being activated by MHC class I, albeit with a slightly abnormal, but not reversed, docking orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Singh et al., 2022</xref>). These results further highlight the opportunism, expanding on previous work in this space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blevins et al., 2016</xref>), of TCR interactions in general, where the ‘rules’ of TCR-pMHC binding seem to be more like guidelines.

However, results such as the class-mismatched TCR, reversed docking TCRs, and super-bulged peptide suggest that perhaps such TCR-MHC specific rules may be too restrictive, and that these interactions may frequently involve more opportunistic configurations that call for unbiased evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Towards generating a generalizable model for TCR-pMHC recognition</title><p>The ideal approach for studying TCR-pMHC interactions would involve generating a comprehensive set of crystallized structures, exhaustive biochemical experiments to pinpoint contributions to binding affinity and kinetics, and activation assays to thoroughly understand the nuances that underlie complex formation.

However, it can provide a good first estimate of how well given TCR-MHC pairs may bind. Absent rich experimental data on major parts of the TCR and MHC repertoire space, can we attempt to approximate how a fictitious TCR-MHC interaction would form independent of peptide and CDR3? Comparisons of our computational results to experiment suggest that yes, in fact, we can generate some strong approximations to build off of, with clear deviations from these predictions largely driven by outlier structures. While the simplified interaction potential we have used for the analyses presented here performed surprisingly well in its predictions for overall protein-protein binding propensities, it is clear that it leaves room for improvement, in particular with regard to aspects such as the relative spatial positioning of the interacting structures. As we continue to build these interaction potentials and the AIMS software as a whole, we hope to continually add modular improvements to consider how these initial germline interaction assumptions are altered by peptide and CDR3 to build more predictive tools for interactions and binding.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Ideas and speculation: multi-modal recognition strategies provide a mechanism for autoimmune and non-canonical TCRs</title><p>The existence of V-genes with weakly interacting CDR loops that have little to no propensity for binding to the MHC α-helices suggests surprising modes of immune recognition. Among them, those with the weakest interactions may, in fact, be the most interesting. V-genes including TRBV7-2, 7–3, 20–1, and 29–1 have no potential for interaction with MHC, and are associated with celiac disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gunnarsen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>) and multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sethi et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies have shown that TCR-pMHC interactions dominated by non-germline-encoded CDR3 contacts enable TCR cross-reactivity, and in some cases autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ciacchi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Petersen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Petersen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sethi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hahn et al., 2005</xref>). This, coupled with the aforementioned germline associations with autoimmune disorders, leads to the intriguing possibility that interactions between germline-encoded TCR regions and the MHC provide a framework for reliable peptide differentiation whereas the lack of such interactions, while granting more flexibility, may lead to higher instances of misguided T cell activation.</p><p>Thinking of the entire TCR, not just the germline-encoded CDR loops, as a necessarily cross-reactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mason, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sewell, 2012</xref>) opportunistic binder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Singh et al., 2022</xref>) provides a potential mechanism for the thymic escape of autoimmune TCRs and reversed docking TCRs. Consider a TCR utilizing TRAV1-1 and TRBV7-3, a V-gene pairing with the lowest possible MHC interaction potential. While a few CDR1 and CDR2 backbone interactions may contribute to the overall complex stability, the CDR3 loops would be largely responsible for forming strong interactions with MHC. In the absence of the germline-encoded binding framework, such strong dependence on CDR3-mediated interactions would make antigen recognition similarly dependent on the CDR3 loop conformation. If this TCR were to encounter a potentially strongly binding (auto-)antigen in the thymus, its probability of being negatively selected would somewhat stochastically depend on the conformations adopted by those TCRs when binding to the pMHC complexes, thereby increasing the chances for thymic escape and subsequent autoimmune events in the periphery.</p><p>While over-reliance on CDR3 may bias TCRs towards auto- and cross-reactivity, the role of the MHC molecule in autoimmunity remains unclear from these results. In contexts such as celiac disease, a particular allele (HLA-DQ2.5) is enriched in patients with the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gunnarsen et al., 2017</xref>). Given that the interaction potentials largely predict similar interaction strengths across HLA molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) such enrichment cannot yet be explained by AIMS. However, considering that the majority of diversity across HLA alleles is concentrated in the peptide binding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), these correlations between HLA molecules and disease may largely be related to the peptides presented by these molecules, as has been suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ishigaki et al., 2022</xref>). In trying to understand how allelic variation alters peptide presentation, and how this in turn impacts the onset of autoimmunity, the lack of strong rules for binding again complicates the problem. While HLA molecules have amino acid preferences at certain anchor positions, there are many exceptions to these ‘rules’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>), and mutations to peptides that should improve stability in the HLA binding pocket can have unintended consequences on T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Smith et al., 2021</xref>). The substantial diversity of possible presented peptides makes the systematic analysis of this aspect of the autoimmunity problem exceptionally challenging.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The AIMS software package used to generate the analysis in this manuscript is available <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ctboughter/AIMS">here</ext-link>, including the original Jupyter Notebook used to generate the Figures in this manuscript as well as a generalized Notebook and a python-based GUI application for analysis of novel datasets.

In this encoding each amino acid in structurally conserved regions is represented as a number 1–21, with zeros padding gaps between these structurally conserved features. The encoding is straightforward for the TCR sequences, with only the germline encoded regions of the CDR loops included for each gene. For the MHC encoding, only the structurally relevant amino acids are included for optimal alignment of each unique sequence. In this case, the structurally relevant amino acids of the class I (or class II) molecules were divided into three distinct groups; the TCR-exposed residues of the α1 (or α) helix, the TCR-exposed residues of the α2 (or β) helix, and the peptide-contacting residues of the given MHC.</p><p>Standard AIMS analysis, including calculation of information-theoretic metrics and position-sensitive biophysical properties, is then derived from these AIMS-encoded matrices. The AIMS interaction scoring is based on a matrix that quantifies a basic pairwise interaction scheme (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), whereby productive amino acid interactions (salt bridges, hydrogen bonds) are scored positively while destructive interactions (hydrophilic-hydrophobic and like-charge clashes) are scored negatively. The first version of this interaction scoring matrix has previously been used to classify interacting and non-interacting molecular partners with a distinguishability of nearly 80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nandigrami et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In calculating the interaction score, we assume that productive contacts are only made by the side-chains of the interacting residues. This simplification does not capture all TCR-pMHC complex contacts, but here we are looking for selectivity enforced by specific TCR-MHC interactions mediated by side-chains in a structure-free manner. Further, given that any single pair of amino acids on adjacent interfaces of protein binding partners can potentially form strong interactions without being meaningful for the formation of a given complex, we require that any productive interaction include a trigram of at least weakly interacting residues.</p><p>For example, for the TCR sequence YNNKEL, we break the sequence into trigrams YNN, NNK, NKE, KEL. A portion of an MHC α1 helix with the sequence EDQRKA is similarly broken intro trigrams EDQ, DQR, QRK, RKA. While AIMS takes into account every possible interaction combination of these triads, the interaction partners TCR:NNK and MHC:EDQ would be scored positively, while TCR:KEL and MHC:RKA would be discounted as an unfavorable interaction. In the former case the scores according to the AIMS interaction matrix come out to [+1,+1,+1] while in the latter case the score [−2,+2,+0] includes clashing residues, and is therefore not counted as a possible interacting triad. This scoring methodology defines our search parameters for broad biophysical compatibility between TCR CDR loops and the MHC helices, from which we can generate averaged interaction potentials for every TRAV and TRBV gene with every possible HLA allele.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sequence processing</title><p>All sequences used in this work are derived from the ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brochet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lefranc, 2014</xref>) database of TRAV and TRBV alleles (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.imgt.org/IMGTrepertoire/Proteins">https://www.imgt.org/IMGTrepertoire/Proteins</ext-link>) from the following organisms: <italic>Bos taurus</italic> (cow), <italic>Capra hircus</italic> (goat), <italic>Aotus nancymaae</italic> (Nancy Ma’s Night Monkey), <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (mouse), <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic> (rhesus macaque), and <italic>Ovis aries</italic> (sheep). MHC sequences are derived from the IMGT-HLA database containing all identified HLA alleles from human and a wide range of organisms (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/download">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/download</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mack et al., 2013</xref>). Only unique, productive sequences are included, which excludes all open reading frames and pseudogenes. Specific structural features are identified from these productive sequences for each molecular species. For TCRs, these structural features are the complementarity determining region (CDR) loops as defined by IMGT. For MHC molecules, these are the TCR-exposed residues of the MHC α-helices as defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bjorkman and Parham, 1990</xref> for class I and as identified in visual molecular dynamics (VMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>) for class II. Class I identifications were likewise validated in VMD. For comparison to non-TCR contacting residues, the peptide-contacting residues were also included for class I molecules, again from identification in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bjorkman and Parham, 1990</xref>. All downstream sequence processing was done from these regions of each TCR and MHC sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Structural comparison processing pipeline</title><p>We accessed 149 human TCR-pMHC class I structures and 44 human TCR-pMHC class II structures with PDB IDs drawn from the TCR3D database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gowthaman and Pierce, 2019</xref>) and each PDB loaded into python using the mdtraj package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McGibbon et al., 2015</xref>). After parsing the TCR3D database for degenerate structures and improperly deposited PDBs, we compiled a final dataset of 96 class I structures and 36 class II structures. We extracted CDR-MHC distances for all contacts. The interaction cutoff is set to 4.5Å for van der Waals interactions and 6Å for charged interactions. Oxygen-Oxygen/Nitrogen-Nitrogen were only counted as productive electrostatic bonding pairs if Ser/Thr/Tyr were involved in O-O contacts or if His was involved in N-N contacts. Through a random selection of 10 complex structures analyzed using this pipeline, we were able to validate structural distance measurements using VMD and found that 100% of the identified contacts match those in structures. All code for sequence processing and structural analysis is included in a separate repository, PRESTO (PaRsEr of Solved Tcr cOmplexes).

In this work, we utilize two powerful concepts from information theory, namely Shannon entropy and mutual information. Shannon entropy, in its simplest form, can be used as a proxy for the diversity in a given input population. This entropy, denoted as H, has the general form:<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munder><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the occurrence probability of a given event, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the set of all events. We can then calculate this entropy at every position along the CDR loops or MHC α-helices, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the set of all amino acids, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is the probability of seeing a specific amino acid at the given position. In other words we want to determine, for a given site in a CDR loop or MHC helix, how much diversity (or entropy) is present. Given there are only 20 amino acids used in naturally derived sequences, we can calculate a theoretical maximum entropy of 4.32 bits, which assumes that every amino acid occurs at a given position with equal probability.</p><p>Importantly, from this entropy we can calculate an equally interesting property of the dataset, namely the mutual information. Mutual information is similar, but not identical to, correlation. Whereas correlations are required to be linear, if two amino acids vary in any linked way, this will be reflected as an increase in mutual information.

Keeping with the terminology of information theory, we would define the TCR-pMHC interactions as a ‘communication channel’, and thus think of each TCR sequence as a given input. In this picture, each HLA allele would be seen as a corresponding output. If there exists some systematic relationship between the amino acids in the TCR and HLA sequences, we would see a significant influence of TCR sequence variations on HLA sequences, and this should manifest as an increase in the mutual information.</p><p>To calculate this mutual information, we start with the assumption that if the concept of evolutionary conservation of TCR-pMHC interactions is correct, then one should assume that every TCR should interact with every HLA allele. Humans largely possess the same TRAV and TRBV alleles, but each individual possesses a maximum of 12 HLA alleles. We expect that specific alleles that are unable to enforce the supposed evolutionary rules for canonical docking will not be allowed to persist in the population. Continuing from this assumption we then subsample the data and calculate the mutual information on this subsampled dataset. Each TRAV and TRBV allele (the input) is matched with a single HLA allele (the output), and the mutual information is calculated for these pairings. This process is repeated 1000 times and the average mutual information is reported. Further validation of our approach on non-human organisms was carefully formulated to only reclassify TRAV/TRBV alleles and MHC sequences as input/output sequences from the same organismal source. The mutual information calculation was then carried out across organisms, with this within-species architecture conserved.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>All-atom MD simulations</title><p>All simulations performed were prepared using the CHARMM-GUI Input Generator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2016</xref>).

Restraints were only applied to the carbon-α atoms of these regions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing, Conceptualization, Resources</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Table used for the second version of the AIMS scoring of pairwise amino acid interactions.</title><p>The table attempts to recapitulate the interactions between amino acids at the level of an introductory biochemistry course.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-90681-supp1-v2.csv" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="octet-stream"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Key for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> relating the numbers on the X-axis of each plot to the corresponding TRAV or TRBV gene.</title><p>Note, the pairing of TRAV and TRBV genes to a specific X-axis number has no meaningful relation.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Eric Huseby (Reviewer #2); Brian Baker (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All reviewers agree that this study addresses an important topic, namely the sequence determinants of TCR-MHC binding modes. The sequence analysis in the study illustrates that the diversity of CDR loops and MHC contact surfaces is likely incompatible with hard-wired interaction motifs. However, the reviewers argue that the subsequent claims about the true origins of TCR:MHC docking orientations, and speculation about the origins of self-reactive TCRs, are based on flawed and unconvincing analyses. The reviews provide detailed suggestions as to how to improve the analyses to test the claims. We believe the substantial steps needed to address these reviews go beyond the scope of this manuscript but if the authors decide to expand on these suggestions, they can submit the manuscript as a new submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors investigate the origins of TCR:MHC docking orientation using information-theoretic sequence analysis simplified biophysical scoring, and inter-atomic contact analysis of solved TCR:pMHC ternary complexes. First, the authors show that the TCR CDR loops are more variable in sequence and in biophysical properties than the surface-exposed regions of the MHC. They conclude that &quot;This mismatched diversity between the TCR germline-encoded CDR loops and the MHC α-helices suggests that conserved germline-encoded interactions are unlikely to exist for every possible molecular combination&quot;. Though not conclusive, this is consistent with the observed variability in the solved ternary structure databases, which show smoothly varying binding orientations rather than discrete recurring binding solutions. The authors also claim to see very little mutual information between TCR and MHC sequence positions, but they appear to be matching them up randomly (rather than using established TCR:MHC pairings from epitope-specific TCRs, for example, or TCRs from HLA-typed individuals), so it's not clear how this analysis could possibly find any covariation.</p><p>The heart of the study relies on a simplified 20x20 amino acid interaction matrix that is meant to capture basic biophysical interaction propensities. The sign of the values in the matrix is chosen to accord with intuition (opposite charges are favorable, like charges are unfavorable, etc), but the absolute values of the matrix values seem pretty arbitrary (all either 0, 0.5, 1, or 2). All matrix values for alanine and glycine are zero, despite their frequent involvement in tight hydrophobic packing interactions. The core calculation is to take all the residues in a given CDR1 loop (regardless of orientation: pointing toward MHC or toward the core of the TCR), and look up the interaction matrix scores for all surface residues (or maybe even all residues, period, it's hard to tell) of an MHC molecule, and sum up all the interaction scores. This single number (averaged over all HLA alleles) then reports the &quot;interaction propensity&quot; for that CDR1 loop sequence; if it's negative, then the loop/V gene has &quot;severely limited interaction potential with HLA molecules&quot;. Despite the obvious problems with this – that the matrix is crude and arbitrary, that the sum involves many pairs of residues that couldn't possibly interact, etc, etc – the authors take these summed interaction scores as the basis for subsequent conclusions. For example, Figure 4 shows that TRBV7-2 and 7-3 have limited interaction potential (which appears to be related to them having glycine and alanine in their loops) with class I MHC; this finding is linked by the authors to the fact that these V genes are enriched in certain epitope-specific responses in celiac disease and multiple sclerosis, despite these enrichments being found in CD4 T cells. I looked at several TRBV7-2/7-3 containing ternary complexes (4mji, 5eu6, 5d2l, 4grl, 4ozh) and in fact, the TRBV7 segments are making extensive MHC contacts, dominating the TRAV segments in every case (4grl is a great example). It seems doubtful that the interaction scores derived from all pairwise residue matrix values are telling us anything about the intrinsic binding properties of the TCR V genes.</p><p>Next is a section entitled &quot;Structural Data Validate Interaction Scores&quot;, in which they analyze atomic contacts in ternary complexes. Figure 5A certainly looks impressive at first glance, with tall bars for &quot;predicted binders&quot; and short or non-existent bars for &quot;predicted NonBinders&quot;. But the problem is that there is no correction for the number of &quot;nonbinder&quot; V genes, and for example for CDR1A there only appear to be only 2 or 3 (Figure 4B), which may or may not have contributed to the database of solved structures. Thus the preponderance of observed contacts coming from &quot;predicted binders&quot; could just be due to the structural database composition, with binder and non-binder V genes making interactions at the same rate. The other problem with this analysis is that the contact analysis itself is flawed: the distance threshold is too small for hydrophobic interactions (4.5A would be better); there are too few total contacts being found (average of 1.35 per structure) the atom types included (referring here to the jupyter notebook https://github.com/ctboughter/PRESTO/blob/main/AIMS_interact_compare.ipynb) don't look right, since oxygen-oxygen and nitrogen-nitrogen can both form an H-bond donor-acceptor pair, and there's no evidence that hydrogens are being added to the structure; and the rules for counting &quot;productive&quot; contacts are too prescriptive (no carbon-carbon hydrophobic contacts allowed between polar or charged residues, even arg and lys with their long side chains). This latter has the consequence that the comparison to interaction scores becomes a little circular because the contact counting is driven by the same simplified biochemical intuition embodied in the pairwise interaction matrix. Much better would be to combine unbiased contact analysis (including backbone atoms) with an orthogonal measure such as buried surface area, and then look to see if predicted non-binder V genes really do make fewer interactions with MHC.</p><p>The remainder of the manuscript uses these interaction-matrix sums to investigate the determinants of the TCR:MHC docking mode. This is just not convincing, for the reasons outlined above, and also because there appear to be logical inconsistencies here. The concept is that MHC surfaces of &quot;low interaction potential&quot; (ie, alanine and glycine) define guardrails that limit the binding mode. Figure 8E has a nice cartoon showing the central ala/gly region in the class I alpha2 helix. The problem is that there are actually contacts throughout and on both sides of that &quot;guardrail&quot;, which can be seen from Figure 7C, lower panel (161,164,165) or from a cursory examination of a few ternary complex structures. It's also not clear why, for class I α helix 2, MHC positions 143 and 144 have such low interaction scores (Figure 7C, upper panel) when in the alignment in Figure 8C those positions look similar to other R/K-containing positions.</p><p>On the positive side, the authors make their analysis scripts and notebooks very easily accessible, which is a big plus for reproducibility and transparency.</p><p>A few additional comments:</p><p>&quot;The exposed residues on the α2-helix of HLA class I molecules are enriched in alanine and glycine relative to the α1- helix, which is highly unlikely to be involved in a specific, orientation-altering productive interaction&quot; – alanine and glycine can be involved in highly specific packing interactions. Glycine, for example, can create pockets into which other side chains fit.</p><p>&quot;Every crystallized TCR-HLA class II complex solved thus far adopts the canonical docking orientation whereby the TCR β-chain binds to the HLA α-chain helix, while the TCR α-chain binds to the HLA β-chain helix&quot; – this is not correct, see 4y19 and 4y1a from the Rossjohn group.</p><p>&quot;…obviating the need for a more precise approach&quot; – do you mean &quot;highlighting&quot;?</p><p>This part of the methods is super-confusing (and I couldn't find it in the code): &quot;Further, given that any single pair of amino acids on adjacent interfaces of protein binding partners can potentially form strong interactions without being meaningful for the formation of a given complex, we require that any productive interaction include a triad of at least weakly interacting residues&quot;.</p><p>As mentioned above, the whole mutual information analysis seems bonkers. How could there be any mutual information if the pairing between TCR and MHC is random/arbitrary? Please explain this part better:</p><p>&quot;…every TCR should interact with every HLA allele. Humans largely possess the same TRAV and TRBV alleles, but each individual possesses a maximum of 12 HLA alleles. We expect that specific alleles that are unable to enforce the supposed evolutionary rules for canonical docking will not be allowed to persist in the population. Continuing from this assumption we then subsample the data and calculate the mutual information on this subsampled dataset. Each TRAV and TRBV allele (the input) is matched with a single HLA allele (the output), and the mutual information is calculated for these pairings&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors take an all-encompassing computational approach to analyzing TCR CDR – MHC interactions with the goal of identifying repetitive use of complementary protein-protein interaction events. On a first pass, there does not appear to be a significant contribution (to the T cell repertoire) of truly conserved pairwise interactions that drive MHC restriction. In contrast, their 'whole repertoire-wide approach' strongly supports the general concept that TCRs find opportunistic ways to bind pMHC using biochemically similar interactions.</p><p>First, I want to state that I really enjoyed reading this paper. I think it is written very well, which is quite important for papers on this topic as it can be a struggle even for seasoned immunologists to comprehend how there might be 'rules of engagement' when both the TCR and MHC/HLA are highly variable proteins. My comments will largely focus on issues that may help the authors provide the readers with a better understanding of the background and what their program does, and does not do. I will use statements within the manuscript to highlight these challenges.</p><p>In the abstract, &quot;The formation of the TCR-peptide-MHC complex (TCR-pMHC) can be broken into two types of interactions, one between the hypervariable TCR CDR3α/β loops and the presented peptide and the second between germline-encoded regions of the TCR and MHC. &quot;</p><p>– This is not an accurate statement. There are significant interactions between the CDR3 and MHC, as well as CDR1 and peptides. E.g., CDR1a often engages p-1 and p2 peptide residues, CDR3b almost always engages at some level, MHC-IIa61 area, and CDR3a with MHC-IIb 60area. Within the manuscript, the authors back off a bit from their hyper-simplistic statement, however, having such a blunt untrue statement in the abstract is not reasonable.</p><p>&quot;Instead, binding properties such as the docking orientation is defined by regions of biophysical compatibility between these loops and the MHC surface.&quot;</p><p>– The authors spend a lot of effort working through certain variables that contribute to the binding reaction. I am wondering if the authors took account of shape complementarity (e.g., PMID: 9628472) and CDR loops that carry different types of conserved canonical structures (e.g., PMID: 10656805). One could imagine that based on the protein folding requirements of CDR regions, certain residues are in the interface whereas others are internal to the CDR structure and cannot actually contribute directly to binding.</p><p>&quot;We selected a key hydrogen bonding network in the KIR2DL2-HLA-C*07:02 interface [50] and compared this to the evolutionarily conserved YXY motif of CDR2β [19, 21]&quot;.</p><p>– This is a good example to discuss the point above. it is important to know structurally, where each residue is. For example, the first Y (46 or 48 depending upon the nomenclature, above) often does not directly contribute to pMHC binding but may be important for the &quot;outline structure&quot; of the CDR loop itself. In addition, the authors do not discuss Van der Waals interactions really at all. Much of the TCR-pMHC interface (binding affinity) is driven by the exclusion of water, a property that is very difficult to assess on an amino acid-amino acid pairwise allotment of interaction energy. I was hoping that once the authors started to discuss &quot;areas of binding potential&quot; the contribution of non-side chain to side chain interactions would be discussed. It is unclear to this reviewer if these types of interactions are accounted for within their algorithm or if they are largely ignored.</p><p>In discussing the interaction potential, of amino acids, the authors cite and discuss a single manuscript.</p><p>42.

Some more inclusive discussion of past ideas about how proteins interact with one another and whether old ideas remain accurate could add to the overall discussion.</p><p>&quot;Figure 4: Interaction score between every TRBV (A) or TRAV (B) sequence and HLA allele for all four germline-encoded CDR loops. &quot;</p><p>– Why are alanine and glycines assumed to be zero/non-interacting? Does a binding reaction care if a contact is a side chain-side chain, backbone-backbone, or mix? Indeed, when the authors &quot;counted the contacts&quot; I assume many of the side chains were indeed interacting with backbone atoms. It has also been suggested that some side chains can contribute negatively to interfaces (e.g., PMID: 17041605). Another question, perhaps for the algorithm used, does it take into account the frequency at which say X and Y amino acids actually occur at a possible site of interactions. It is mentioned that autoimmune-prone T cell repertoires are biased for certain TCR usage, does this bias include matching/non-matching HLA areas of recognition? There was some discussion on this but a clearer picture (if there is one) could be spelled out for the non-expert.</p><p>The interaction potentials also succeed in predicting TCR complexes that will not make contact with MHC. 20 of the 22 structures predicted to have poor CDR2β binding make no contact with MHC, while the last two only make one contact with MHC (Figure 5C). Further, all 8 structures predicted to have poor CDR1β binding make no contact with MHC. (Figure 5C). Again, this prediction accuracy is lower for class II predictions (Figure 5D).</p><p>– This is a super interesting idea that may unlock a lot of what is going on. One wonders how much of this is random chance, i.e., if a different TCR-pMHC with the same V genes and HLA would behave similarly. Also, do these structures preclude (or are driven by) CD1-peptide contacts, or are the structures carry such a different docking orientation as to completely preclude the CDR1 and CDR2 regions from being part of the binding interface?</p><p>The exposed residues on the α2-helix of HLA class I molecules are enriched in alanine and glycine relative to the α1- helix, which is highly unlikely to be involved in a specific, orientation-altering productive interaction.</p><p>– In practice, it is this reviewer's understanding that there are exit contributions of Van der Waals interactions at these sites. Indeed, early ideas suggested that the diagonal area of pMHC (MHCa 61, MHCb73) used this divot for shape complementary purposes.</p><p>It is important to note that these interaction potentials take an unbiased approach, calculating every possible interaction between TCR and MHC residues to produce this final score.</p><p>– It was unclear if the authors mean position by position, or did they weigh whether a residue was actually surface exposed and capable of being part of the binding interface.</p><p>productive side-chain interactions between CDR loops and the solvent-exposed residues of the MHC helices.</p><p>– There does seem to be an (over) emphasis on side-chain interactions. And less so on the clustered ability for VDW and/or inhibitory interaction.</p><p>– In general, there are quite a number of T cell development citations with actually very little discussed the role of thymic selection in and/or clonal T cell responses in skewing the TCR-pMHC interface to conform to selective pressures. E.g., TCRs can't be too good/cross-reactive or they would undergo central tolerance.</p><p>&quot;In calculating the interaction score, we assume that productive contacts are only made by the side chains of the interacting residues. This simplification does not capture all TCR-pMHC complex contacts, but here we are looking for selectivity enforced by specific TCR-MHC interactions mediated by side-chains.&quot;</p><p>– Though stated as a caveat, perhaps some effort could be made to include side-chain to the backbone, etc interactions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Boughter and Meier-Schellersheim describe an analysis of TCR-peptide/MHC complexes, aiming to gain an understanding of the underpinnings of the &quot;common&quot; TCR binding geometry. This is fundamental to understanding the MHC restriction of TCRs and how T cells scan and readout peptides. They begin with a comprehensive bioinformatics approach, move to a structural analysis to help interpret the informatics, and bring in biophysical computations. The overall conclusion that specific contacts between TCR genes and MHC proteins are not necessarily pre-programmed and that traditional TCR binding geometries emerge from biophysical compatibility is supported by the data and consistent with recent findings. In general, the work and the conclusions are an advance and place recent findings into perspective. However, the strength of evidence is weakened by choices made in characterizing structures, computing energies, and a strained reliance on &quot;roles&quot; played the parts of the interface which have been discounted many times yet persist in the literature. The latter in particular weakens the discussion and how the authors view the impact of their work.</p><p>The major strength of the paper is the approach taken; I found the comparative analysis of TCR and MHC genetic variability at the sequence level particularly compelling. Bringing in KIRs as a control was also a strong way to support the arguments. There is one major technical weakness in that, as far as is clear from the methods, interatomic interactions were considered with a 3.5 Å cutoff. This is woefully inadequate. Electrostatic interactions can be strong at long distances, which the authors really need to consider – say, going out to 6 Angstroms or so (there is much-published literature on short- and long-range electrostatics in protein interfaces). The importance of long-range electrostatics in TCR-peptide/MHC complexes has been demonstrated previously, particularly in prior work that aimed to address the same problem studied here. The authors also fall victim to the common immunology trope that CDR3-peptide interactions drive specificity, leaving CDR1/CDR2 to bind MHC proteins, i.e., the CDR loops have &quot;roles&quot; in binding. In the very first high-resolution structure of a TCR-peptide/MHC complex, CDR3 interactions with a class I MHC were noted and remarked on, as were CDR1 and CDR2 interactions with the peptide. Later work showed that these CDR3-MHC and CDR2-peptide interactions were critical for binding. These findings have been replicated several times now. The authors' introduction of this perspective of different loops of the TCR playing evolved roles (CDR3-&gt;peptide, CDR1/2-&gt;MHC), and their interpretation of their findings in light of it, weakens the papers' conclusions and impact, and it is a missed opportunity that can be addressed with the authors' approach.</p><p>The authors also should consider other literature for a greater impact on their work. For example, they also exclude backbone interactions – this is a curious omission from a biophysical perspective, and others in the field have published on the importance of backbone-mediated interactions (hydrogen bonds mostly) in stabilizing TCR interfaces. The authors also mention but fail to address T cell selection and the role of selection (and possibly coreceptor) in 'enforcing' what we get and have seen structurally (i.e., the idea that pre-selection TCRs bind all over the place, but selection ensures we get ones that bind right and work). Much has been written about this and it should be included.</p><p>1) The very first high-resolution crystal structure of a TCR-pMHC complex by Garboczi and Wiley in the 90s (PMID 8906788) showed CDR3 contacts to the MHC and germline CDR1/2 contacts to the MHC. Later biophysical studies by our own group showed these were crucial for binding (PMID 23736024). Other work has shown the same. Thus, although it is common to say that diverse CDR3 loops bind peptide and germline-encoded CDR1/2 loops bind the MHC, this is not supported at the atomic or energetic level. It actually plays INTO the authors' argument about opportunism/compatibility, but curiously the authors do not discuss it. They should. These observations and the idea that &quot;roles&quot; are not hardcoded into the TCR CDR loops play right into the authors' opportunistic argument introduced at the end of the paper.</p><p>2) A 3.5 Å cutoff is far too limited and ignores long-range electrostatics. Our own work addressing the same problem (which also introduced the notion of opportunism/compatibility) found signals for some &quot;sloppy&quot; evolved compatibility but only if we moved to longer ranges (PMID 26884163). The authors should re-evaluate their energetic analysis using longer-range cutoffs. To avoid greatly complicating the analysis, longer ranges could be done only with charged side chains. It was also very curious to omit main chain interactions, something which the authors might want to work back in (see PMID 17041605).</p><p>3) The authors should really address the question of how thymic education influences what we see. For example, we recently published a TCR that binds with an outlier geometry (not reverse) which signals just fine – an example of a class-mismatched TCR (emerged from a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell but binds a class I). This TCR is a bit weird in that it has an unusually long CDR3b loop that contacts both peptide and MHC (point 1 again). We also concluded that this is a weird TCR that somehow escaped normal thymic selection, implying that maybe the pre-selection repertoire has TCRs that bind crazily and one role of thymic selection is to filter these, giving us TCRs that are somehow &quot;better&quot; biologically (maybe they signal better, or possess lower x-reactivity, etc.). The authors need to work this thinking in. Relevant papers are PMID 36424374 and PMID 30833553.</p><p>4) The authors use &quot;compatibility&quot; and &quot;opportunistic&quot; to describe TCR binding from a biophysical perspective, contrasting this with the hard-coded model. These are not new concepts though, and although the authors have greatly expanded on the topic (albeit with the limitations above), they should make note of this. They do reference some of the appropriate literature, but clarifying how they are expanding on the topic would strengthen the impact of the work.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested and these were then sufficiently addressed prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Conserved Biophysical Compatibility Among the Highly Variable Germline-Encoded Regions Shapes TCR-MHC Interactions&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you can see from the report, the reviewers appreciate the changes done for revision. After an extensive discussion, the overall consensus of the reviewers is that while the concept of evolved biophysical compatibility is possible and a potential solution to the question of how TCRs could be biased towards MHC proteins given the massive diversity in both receptor and ligand, it is a concept that is exceptionally difficult to demonstrate and the paper still has some wishful thinking. For this manuscript to move forward, we request that you tone down the paper, remove the claims highlighted by reviewer #1, and present the concept as an interesting possibility for which some evidence is offered but no solid proof (see report from reviewer #1 for details).</p><p>We also had a discussion with regards to the suggestion of reviewer #2 to perform a similar analysis on BCRs to verify that the signal is not spurious. We acknowledge that this might be beyond the scope of the current paper. However, if the authors chose to do this analysis, it can help solidify some of the claims.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I recognize the time and effort that the authors have invested in responding to the reviews of the first version of the manuscript. It is appreciated that they recognized the circularity of the original Figure 5 and removed it, adjusted the distance thresholds and sequence-filters for contacts analysis, and that they have also removed references to the origin of self-reactive TCRs.</p><p>My concerns with regard to the claims about V-gene interaction potential and determinants of the binding mode still stand, since the relevant text hasn't been modified and the author's responses are not convincing. For example, the detailed analysis of the TRBV7-2 containing complexes provided by the authors in the response appears to disprove the AIMS-based prediction that this gene has low interaction potential: &quot;Certainly PRESTO agrees with these structural interpretations, suggesting CDR2B dominates the germline interactions here, with 13/15 SC-SC contacts.&quot; The contorted logic that the authors produce to explain this disconnect doesn't really make sense: &quot;However, yet again we have an abnormally high number of CDR2B backbone-backbone interactions, 14, suggestive of nonspecific tight packing not driven by TCRB specific interactions&quot;. What exactly is &quot;nonspecific tight packing&quot;?</p><p>The authors also continue to over-sell their findings in the newly introduced text. For example, in describing the new Figure 5, the authors state: &quot;This comparison shows exceptional agreement between our bioinformatic results and structural analyses&quot;. But when one compares Figure 5a and 5b, for example, the agreement is pretty dubious. And in 5d, *none* of the differences are significant, and many show the wrong directionality, for example, the median value for &quot;Weak TRBV&quot; is always greater than or equal to the median value for &quot;Moderate TRBV&quot;. And in the new text describing the AIMS potential: &quot;The AIMS interaction potential, which can swiftly analyze thousands of sequences, has significantly outperformed more physically detailed and computationally expensive models. In a binary classification of a large database of structurally similar protein complexes, the AIMS interaction potential was capable of distinguishing binders and non-binders to an accuracy of 80%, whereas calculations run on over 45µs of simulated all atom trajectories could only distinguish to an accuracy of 50%. &quot; I looked back at this reference, and what the authors neglect to mention is that the 80% performance comes from a highly parameterized model based on a linear discriminant analysis fitting a weight for each pair of residues in the interface-- it's not at all analogous to the calculation here in which AIMS scores are directly summed up. It's also a single family of interacting proteins.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>With regards to the manuscript in general, in some places, the authors seem to want to have their cake and eat it too. Particularly, the idea that TCRs are evolutionarily biased to recognize MHC, included stating support for the &quot;codon model&quot; while at others suggesting that CDR1s and CDR2s have only minimal (complementary) roles in binding. With the extension suggesting that some TRAVs and TRBVs have no (or very minimal) MHC/HLA binding potential. This later argument would suggest that antibodies, fully capable of creating diverse CDR3s, should similarly have a (modest, strong) ability to bind pMHC ligands. I suppose a computational test of the general idea the authors are putting forward would be to use their AIMs platform with human antibody CDR1s and CDR2s to see if these were all net no-binding or negative binding with MHC. However, I do not like the idea of bringing up additional questions/tests of the model during a re-review.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90681.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Specifically, looking at the ability of various algorithms to predict interacting or non-interacting molecules (Figures 7, 8, 9, and 10 in the cited Nandigrami et al. manuscript) AIMS distinguishes between known binders or non-binders with a significantly higher accuracy compared to calculations based on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations starting from crystals or modelled structures. In other words, the software outperforms more physically detailed models in predicting protein-protein interactions, the exact problem we are interested in at present.</p><p>A paragraph dedicated to the high performance of the AIMS interaction matrix approach is now included in the main text, lines 212-221<bold>:</bold></p><p>“The AIMS interaction potential, which can swiftly analyze thousands of sequences, has significantly outperformed more physically detailed and computationally expensive models.

While not as biophysically descriptive as methods such as alchemical free energy perturbation [Gumbart 2013a] or potential of mean force-based calculations [Gumbart 2013b], the AIMS interaction potential generates accurate predictions for problems that are intractable with current limitations to computation due to the number of protein complexes of interest.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issue 2: Closely related to Issue 1, the scoring of alanine and glycine interactions as “0” in the interaction matrix was largely deemed incorrect by the reviewers, due to the ability of these amino acids to be involved in “tight packing” hydrophobic interactions, or as hydrogen bond partners using backbone atoms.</p></disp-quote><p>In this response, we will discuss only the side chain interactions of glycine and alanine. For a discussion on backbone hydrogen bonding (with sidechains or other backbones), see issue/response 5.</p><p>The decision to refer to alanine and glycine interactions as “0” in the matrix is largely due to their lack of sidechain hydrogen-bonding capability and relatively limited (de)solvation penalty. With their minimal sidechains, the energetic benefit of a hydrophobic interaction is likewise minimal. Whether one considers the hydrophobic effect as driven by ordered waters or disruption of water-water hydrogen bonds, the smaller hydrophobic volume of Ala and Gly will have a more limited entropic or enthalpic effect. The smaller the hydrophobic volume, the smaller the effect of the singular hydrophobic molecule [Chandler <italic>Nature Insight Review</italic> 2005. PMID: 16193038].</p><p>We further quantitatively confirm that such interactions are rare in TCR:pMHC complexes crystallized thus far (see new Figure 5). Of note, this new figure appears to show 1. That, in fact, glycine and alanine rarely make sidechain-sidechain (SC-SC) contacts and 2. That the qualitative agreement between the AIMS interaction potential and these counted contacts further supports the use of the interaction potential in this study (see issue/response 1). It is important to note these figures are generated using the new structural cutoffs discussed in issue/response 3.</p><p>There is an exception to the lack of SC-SC interactions involving Ala or Gly, with the only enriched interaction coming from Tyr-Ala interactions. However, it is important to note that such interactions have been the center of intense study [Feng et al. <italic>Nat. Immuno</italic> 2007; Garcia et al. <italic>Nat Immuno</italic> 2008; and others] and may potentially be biasing the PDB. Further, while this interaction may genuinely be important for immune recognition, not every TRAV/TRBV gene includes tyrosine in the CDR loops. 9/45 TRAV and 18/48 TRBV alleles do not contain a single tyrosine.</p><p>Upon further consideration of these “tight hydrophobic packings” that have been observed between Tyrosine and Alanine, it is important to note that such packing (as in the “knob-in-hole” interaction) is unlikely to be long-lived in many structures. Side chains are inherently motile, and shifting of these side chains is likely to occur over the course of the formation of an interaction interface. More stable are hydrogen bonds, charged interactions, and stronger hydrophobic interactions.</p><p>To support this dynamic interpretation of side chain interactions, we now include a paragraph in the discussion dedicated to a truly dynamic interpretation of TCR-pMHC interactions. We note that in triplicate all-atom molecular dynamics trajectories of PDB 1FYT, the tyrosine-alanine “tight packing” lasts only between 10-20ns across these triplicate trajectories (Figure 9, Supplemental Figure S14), suggesting again that this interaction is less key to the interface, and more an opportunistic placement for this side chain. We further include new text in the discussion focused on how such a dynamic interpretation has been considered previously, and what these new results mean for TCR-pMHC interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issue 3: The cutoffs used in the analysis of previously published structures were improperly estimated, and the consideration of only “productive” contacts artificially boosted the agreement between the AIMS scoring and structural data.</p></disp-quote><p>The structure parser suggestions have now been implemented per the comments of Reviewers 1 and 3, with hydrophobic interactions of 4.5Å, charged interactions of 6Å, and a more permissive definition of “productive” interactions (i.e. C-C packing interactions between hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues counted, O-O hydrogen bonds allowed if Ser, Tyr, and Thr are involved, N-N allowed if His involved).

In almost all structures solved thus far, the germline CDR1/2 loops interact with the MHC α helices. So, our goal is to determine rules for how might happen for the “average” TCR-pMHC complex, while realizing that there will be strong deviations from this average complex.

The hypervariable CDR3 residues can dominate the interactions with the germline-encoded MHC α-helices [Piepenbrink 2013, Singh 2022], germline encoded CDRs can interact strongly with peptide [Piepenbrink 2013], an exceptionally long peptide can &quot;bulge&quot; causing separation between germline regions [Tynan 2005], or the docking orientation can even be entirely reversed [Gras 2016, Zareie 2021]. When considering the large number of possible TCR-pMHC interactions and the substantial cross reactivity of TCRs [Riley 2018, Sewell 2012], these historically non-canonical interactions may in fact be rather common.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issue 5: The analysis presented in this manuscript, specifically the AIMS interaction matrix, does not account for various structural features, including shape complementarity, backbone interactions, and relative solvation/desolvation of certain sidechains.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand and appreciate the vast structural and biochemical literature that has contributed to our understanding of TCR-pMHC interactions thus far. A complete understanding of how a TCR discriminates between self, non-self, or altered-self peptides will require understanding the precise contributions of these structural features, and some not mentioned by the reviewers (catch bonds, dwell time, dynamic matching, etc). Unfortunately, the explicit incorporation of such structural, energetic, and dynamic features is outside of the scope of the AIMS analysis, and to our knowledge, well beyond the abilities of any modeling approach. We now explicitly address what our manuscript does and does not attempt to do in the discussion (lines 511-528) and elaborate further below:</p><p>“The ideal approach for studying TCR-pMHC interactions would involve generating a comprehensive set of crystallized structures, exhaustive biochemical experiments to pinpoint contributions to binding affinity and kinetics, and activation assays to thoroughly understand the nuances that underlie complex formation. While such thorough efforts have been undertaken to understand structural strategies of binding to HLA-A2 [Blevins 2016], the potential evolutionary conservation of TRBV8-2 in binding MHC molecules [Scott-Browne 2009, Scott-Browne 2011, Garcia 2012, Feng 2007], and the by residue contributions of binding of the A6 TCR [Piepenbrink2013], the diversity inherent to the TCR-pMHC interaction makes such efforts impossible to scale across all possible binding partners.</p><p>The work presented here cannot replace these comprehensive experimental techniques. However, it can provide a good first estimate of how well given TCR-MHC pairs may bind. Absent rich experimental data on major parts of the TCR and MHC repertoire space, can we attempt to approximate how a fictitious TCR-MHC interaction would occur absent peptide and CDR3? Comparisons of our computational results to experiment suggest that yes, in fact, we can generate some strong approximations to build off of, with clear deviations from these predictions largely driven by outlier structures. As we continue to build these interaction potentials and the AIMS software as a whole, we hope to continually add modular improvements to consider how these initial germline interaction assumptions are altered by peptide and CDR3 to build more predictive tools for interactions and binding.”</p><p>In short, crystallography and biochemistry are the gold standard for understanding the many of nuances of TCR-pMHC interactions. Structural modeling could provide insights, but thus far has proven unreliable for adaptive immune interactions [Evans et al. 2022 https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.04.463034]. Likewise, structure-free machine learning approaches have largely failed to be predictive outside of narrow parameter spaces [Montemurro et al. 2021. PMID: 34508155; Jokinen et al. 2022. PMID: 36477794; Meysman et al. 2023. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuno.2023.100024 ]. Our goal is to explore how well a reductionist model that encodes some degree of physical realism can generate explanations for experimental observations made thus far.</p><p>Inclusion of phenomena such as specific sidechain-main chain interactions or shape complementarity would imply knowledge of the structures of interest, which is grossly overestimating the scope of our knowledge of these interactions thus far. Referring specifically to the percentages of complex space crystallized to date (lines 70-78)<bold>,</bold> we simply don’t have the data to extrapolate out to all possible complexes. Absent these data, we would need to generate strong assumptions about the presumed structural interactions between the TCR and the MHC, which are going to be strongly influenced by the CDR3, the peptide, the TRAV/TRBV pairing, and the MHC involved in the interaction.</p><p>Despite the lack of inherently structure-dependent interactions in AIMS, the newest version of the manuscript now more explicitly counts SC-backbone interactions in our structural analysis (Supplemental Figure S10). While we could potentially generate an empirical SC-backbone interaction matrix from these values, we find that the contact maps are too strongly biased by the structures crystallized thus far.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors investigate the origins of TCR:MHC docking orientation using information-theoretic sequence analysis simplified biophysical scoring, and inter-atomic contact analysis of solved TCR:pMHC ternary complexes. First, the authors show that the TCR CDR loops are more variable in sequence and in biophysical properties than the surface-exposed regions of the MHC. They conclude that &quot;This mismatched diversity between the TCR germline-encoded CDR loops and the MHC α-helices suggests that conserved germline-encoded interactions are unlikely to exist for every possible molecular combination&quot;. Though not conclusive, this is consistent with the observed variability in the solved ternary structure databases, which show smoothly varying binding orientations rather than discrete recurring binding solutions. The authors also claim to see very little mutual information between TCR and MHC sequence positions, but they appear to be matching them up randomly (rather than using established TCR:MHC pairings from epitope-specific TCRs, for example, or TCRs from HLA-typed individuals), so it's not clear how this analysis could possibly find any covariation.</p><p>1A.The heart of the study relies on a simplified 20x20 amino acid interaction matrix that is meant to capture basic biophysical interaction propensities. The sign of the values in the matrix is chosen to accord with intuition (opposite charges are favorable, like charges are unfavorable, etc), but the absolute values of the matrix values seem pretty arbitrary (all either 0, 0.5, 1, or 2).</p></disp-quote><p>See response 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1B.

The core calculation is to take all the residues in a given CDR loop (regardless of orientation: pointing toward MHC or toward the core of the TCR), and look up the interaction matrix scores for all surface residues (or maybe even all residues, period, it's hard to tell) of an MHC molecule, and sum up all the interaction scores. This single number (averaged over all HLA alleles) then reports the &quot;interaction propensity&quot; for that CDR1 loop sequence; if it's negative, then the loop/V gene has &quot;severely limited interaction potential with HLA molecules&quot;. Despite the obvious problems with this – that the matrix is crude and arbitrary, that the sum involves many pairs of residues that couldn't possibly interact, etc, etc – the authors take these summed interaction scores as the basis for subsequent conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to multiple confusions regarding the calculation of the interaction scoring, a more precise description has been provided in the methods (lines 604-614).

In the main text, the entirety of the TCR-accessible residues on both MHC α-helices are included in the calculation, to reflect the fact that, a priori, we don’t have a reason to expect any given TCR to bind in the “canonical” conformation. However, including just amino acids on the “proper” α helix does not strongly change the calculations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>By-gene interaction scores with “proper” helix interactions (i.e. TRAV interactions with Class I alpha2 helix, TRBV interactions with Class I alpha1 helix).</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90681-sa2-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>2.</bold> For example, Figure 4 shows that TRBV7-2 and 7-3 have limited interaction potential (which appears to be related to them having glycine and alanine in their loops) with class I MHC; this finding is linked by the authors to the fact that these V genes are enriched in certain epitope-specific responses in celiac disease and multiple sclerosis, despite these enrichments being found in CD4 T cells. I looked at several TRBV7-2/7-3 containing ternary complexes (4mji, 5eu6, 5d2l, 4grl, 4ozh) and in fact, the TRBV7 segments are making extensive MHC contacts, dominating the TRAV segments in every case (4grl is a great example). It seems doubtful that the interaction scores derived from all pairwise residue matrix values are telling us anything about the intrinsic binding properties of the TCR V genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the mistake made in the text. We were well aware that the TRBV7 enrichments were found in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and instead meant to point readers to the interaction matrix with Class II MHC found in Supplemental Figure S8. This has now been fixed in the text.</p><p>We hope that our previous responses to reviewers clear up what the interaction scoring matrix is telling us about the intrinsic binding properties of the TCR V-genes. Further, we greatly appreciate the list of specific PDBs to examine to back up our claims to an even greater extent. We can go through point by point and discuss the binding mechanisms of these example PDBs using structural visualization and the PRESTO software with new interaction cutoff settings.</p><p>5EU6 [Altered Self Antigen] – At first glance, CDR2B does appear to dominate the interface [17/26 SC-SC contacts], although these appear to simply be an artifact due to tight packing of CDR2B, which makes 8 backbone-backbone contacts according to our new, permissive interaction cutoffs. This is far above the median number of backbone backbone contacts in our analysis (see Figure 5D). A closer inspection of the structure suggests this tight packing is a due to CDR3B dominating the interface, both with peptide and with MHC. This in turn forces the germline CDR loops into closer contact with MHC. Details of the contacts made by CDR2B confirm this loop is unlikely responsible for tight packing, as the majority of contacts involve nonspecific packing interactions between hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues near the edge of the interaction cutoff [all above 4Å, near the more generous packing cutoff]. More specific interactions (salt bridges) are formed between TCRB and MHC, but these are TCR framework interactions, again due to the biased docking angle generated by CDR3B.</p><p>5D2L [CMV Antigen] – Not dominated by TCRB, only 8/36 SC-SC contacts made by TCRB. There are some interactions between CDR2B and MHC sidechains and backbone atoms, but these are limited. Further, these non-sidechain interactions are not meant to be covered by the AIMS interaction potential, as discussed elsewhere in the manuscript and in these review responses. Further, we should expect by the AIMS interaction potential that TRAV contributes just slightly more contacts than TRBV, as TRAV24 is likewise binned on the lowest end of the “moderately interacting” TRAV genes. We would predict, as we find here, that CDR3 would need to dominate the interface.</p><p>4MJI [HIV Antigen] – Not dominated by TCRB, only 16/45 SC-SC contacts made by TCRB. Of these 16, 10 are nonspecific packing C-C interactions between hydrophilic amino acids. Again, the dominance of TCRA is consistent with the predictive power of the AIMS interaction potential, as TRAV17 is a predicted strong binder. Indeed, we see multiple strong, specific interactions [ILE-LEU hydrophobic interaction, THR-ARG Hbond, ASN-GLN Hbond, ARG-GLU Salt Bridge, ARG-GLN Hbond, ASN-ARG Hbond]. Suggesting the AIMS interaction potential’s exceptional ability to provide insights into the intrinsic binding properties of TCR V genes.</p><p>40ZH [Celiac Autoimmune] – While a cursory look at the structure or the PRESTO structure parser may suggest a strong involvement of TCRB [10/23 SC-SC contacts], the original study provides further context [PMID 24777060]. The authors find that while there is skewed TRBV7-2 usage in DQ2.5-glia-α2 reactive TCRs, CDR1B and CDR2B only contribute a combined 14% to the overall buried surface area. Further, mutagenesis of what appear to be key contacting residues in CDR1B and CDR2B were insufficient to abrogate binding. Contrast this with mutations in TRAV germline regions or CDR3 loops, which did result in undetectable binding. Consistent with TRBV7-2 as an inherently weak interacting germline gene.</p><p>4GRL [MS Autoimmune] – Certainly PRESTO agrees with these structural interpretations, suggesting CDR2B dominates the germline interactions here, with 13/15 SC-SC contacts. However, yet again we have an abnormally high number of CDR2B backbone-backbone interactions, 14, suggestive of nonspecific tight packing not driven by TCRB specific interactions. Indeed, the original study [PMID 24136005] suggests that the titular dominating “single loop” is CDR3A. Suggesting that the CDR2B contacts are essentially bystanders in the binding process that happen to make contact with MHC due to the strong docking angle enforced by CDR3A.</p><p>Each of these structures offer important lessons that have been highlighted both throughout the manuscript and throughout this response to reviewers.</p><p>1. The CDR3 loops are capable of dominating interactions, bypassing every other “rule” imposed in this and other papers. In multiple cases, these CDR3-dominated interactions occur in the context of autoimmune events.</p><p>2. In considering a given TCR-pMHC complex, a distinction should likely be made between “contacts” and “interactions”, akin to the original PRESTO analysis that distinguished between hydrophobic-hydrophilic and hydrophobic-hydrophobic carboncarbon interactions. In the former (hydrophobic-phillic) case, which could be referred to as a simple “contact” there exists some VDW contribution to the binding energy, but potentially not a large enough contribution to overcome the de-solvation penalty of the hydrophilic residue. In the latter (hydrophobic-phobic) case, there is no such desolvation penalty for the hydrophobic residues, and this interaction can contribute strongly to the overall interface.</p><p>In the case of PDBs 40ZH and 4GRL, we see many such “contacts” made between MHC and TRBV7-2, but as is backed up by mutagenesis studies, these contacts contribute little to the overall binding free energy. Consistent with what the AIMS interaction potential suggests the intrinsic binding properties of TRBV7-2 should be.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Next is a section entitled &quot;Structural Data Validate Interaction Scores&quot;, in which they analyze atomic contacts in ternary complexes. Figure 5A certainly looks impressive at first glance, with tall bars for &quot;predicted binders&quot; and short or non-existent bars for &quot;predicted NonBinders&quot;. But the problem is that there is no correction for the number of &quot;nonbinder&quot; V genes, and for example for CDR1A there only appear to be only 2 or 3 (Figure 4B), which may or may not have contributed to the database of solved structures. Thus the preponderance of observed contacts coming from &quot;predicted binders&quot; could just be due to the structural database composition, with binder and non-binder V genes making interactions at the same rate. The other problem with this analysis is that the contact analysis itself is flawed: the distance threshold is too small for hydrophobic interactions (4.5A would be better); there are too few total contacts being found (average of 1.35 per structure) the atom types included (referring here to the jupyter notebook https://github.com/ctboughter/PRESTO/blob/main/AIMS_interact_compare.ipy nb) don't look right, since oxygen-oxygen and nitrogen-nitrogen can both form an Hbond donor-acceptor pair, and there's no evidence that hydrogens are being added to the structure; and the rules for counting &quot;productive&quot; contacts are too prescriptive (no carbon-carbon hydrophobic contacts allowed between polar or charged residues, even arg and lys with their long side chains). This latter has the consequence that the comparison to interaction scores becomes a little circular because the contact counting is driven by the same simplified biochemical intuition embodied in the pairwise interaction matrix. Much better would be to combine unbiased contact analysis (including backbone atoms) with an orthogonal measure such as buried surface area, and then look to see if predicted non-binder V genes really do make fewer interactions with MHC.</p></disp-quote><p>See response 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The remainder of the manuscript uses these interaction-matrix sums to investigate the determinants of the TCR:MHC docking mode. This is just not convincing, for the reasons outlined above, and also because there appear to be logical inconsistencies here. The concept is that MHC surfaces of &quot;low interaction potential&quot; (ie, alanine and glycine) define guardrails that limit the binding mode. Figure 8E has a nice cartoon showing the central ala/gly region in the class I alpha2 helix. The problem is that there are actually contacts throughout and on both sides of that &quot;guardrail&quot;, which can be seen from Figure 7C, lower panel (161,164,165) or from a cursory examination of a few ternary complex structures. It's also not clear why, for class I α helix 2, MHC positions 143 and 144 have such low interaction scores (Figure 7C, upper panel) when in the alignment in Figure 8C those positions look similar to other R/K-containing positions.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that we have largely addressed the “reasons outlined above” regarding how convincing our use and validation of the interaction matrix is.</p><p>We thank the author for their comments regarding Figure 8. The cartoon has been changed to more accurately reflect how the TCRs lay over the MHC, which is not as some singular shape laying over the surface, but rather as distinct loops contacting distinct portions of the MHC surface. These distinct loops reflect the results of Figure 7, but also were checked structurally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Author response image 6</xref>).

This part of the methods is super-confusing (and I couldn't find it in the code): &quot;Further, given that any single pair of amino acids on adjacent interfaces of protein binding partners can potentially form strong interactions without being meaningful for the formation of a given complex, we require that any productive interaction include a triad of at least weakly interacting residues&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the methods to hopefully clarify this confusion, and refer the reviewer to the updated methods section mentioned earlier in this response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. As mentioned above, the whole mutual information analysis seems bonkers. How could there be any mutual information if the pairing between TCR and MHC is random/arbitrary? Please explain this part better:</p><p>&quot;…every TCR should interact with every HLA allele. Humans largely possess the same TRAV and TRBV alleles, but each individual possesses a maximum of 12 HLA alleles. We expect that specific alleles that are unable to enforce the supposed evolutionary rules for canonical docking will not be allowed to persist in the population. Continuing from this assumption we then subsample the data and calculate the mutual information on this subsampled dataset. Each TRAV and TRBV allele (the input) is matched with a single HLA allele (the output), and the mutual information is calculated for these pairings&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now calculated this mutual information for crystallized complexes. However, the PDB must be considered a strongly biased source for these calculations. Of the 140 crystallized human class I structures, only 68 of these are unique in their</p><p>TRAV/TRBV/HLA usage. Further, as many as 91/140 involve HLA-A*02:01. All of these could potentially alter the mutual information in unpredictable ways that are not at all indicative of how these molecules were evolved.</p><p>Despite these caveats, new calculations of the mutual information using only those structures found in the PDB suggest that our initial approach to calculating the mutual information was accurate (Supplemental Figure S4). We see similar trends in the mutual information between CDR loops and the MHC α-helices, with no clear increase in information for interacting regions (TCRA-alpha2 and TCRB-alpha1). Instead, we see higher mutual information between the TRAV-TRBV pairings than TRAV-MHC or TRBVMHC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors take an all-encompassing computational approach to analyzing TCR CDR – MHC interactions with the goal of identifying repetitive use of complementary protein-protein interaction events. On a first pass, there does not appear to be a significant contribution (to the T cell repertoire) of truly conserved pairwise interactions that drive MHC restriction. In contrast, their 'whole repertoire-wide approach' strongly supports the general concept that TCRs find opportunistic ways to bind pMHC using biochemically similar interactions.</p><p>1. First, I want to state that I really enjoyed reading this paper. I think it is written very well, which is quite important for papers on this topic as it can be a struggle even for seasoned immunologists to comprehend how there might be 'rules of engagement' when both the TCR and MHC/HLA are highly variable proteins. My comments will largely focus on issues that may help the authors provide the readers with a better understanding of the background and what their program does, and does not do. I will use statements within the manuscript to highlight these challenges.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these encouraging comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In the abstract, &quot;The formation of the TCR-peptide-MHC complex (TCR-pMHC) can be broken into two types of interactions, one between the hypervariable TCR CDR3α/β loops and the presented peptide and the second between germline-encoded regions of the TCR and MHC. &quot;</p><p>– This is not an accurate statement. There are significant interactions between the CDR3 and MHC, as well as CDR1 and peptides. E.g., CDR1a often engages p-1 and p2 peptide residues, CDR3b almost always engages at some level, MHC-IIa61 area, and CDR3a with MHC-IIb 60area. Within the manuscript, the authors back off a bit from their hyper-simplistic statement, however, having such a blunt untrue statement in the abstract is not reasonable.</p></disp-quote><p>See response 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. &quot;Instead, binding properties such as the docking orientation is defined by regions of biophysical compatibility between these loops and the MHC surface.&quot;</p><p>– The authors spend a lot of effort working through certain variables that contribute to the binding reaction. I am wondering if the authors took account of shape complementarity (e.g., PMID: 9628472) and CDR loops that carry different types of conserved canonical structures (e.g., PMID: 10656805). One could imagine that based on the protein folding requirements of CDR regions, certain residues are in the interface whereas others are internal to the CDR structure and cannot actually contribute directly to binding.</p></disp-quote><p>See response 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. &quot;We selected a key hydrogen bonding network in the KIR2DL2-HLA-C*07:02 interface [50] and compared this to the evolutionarily conserved YXY motif of CDR2β [19, 21]&quot;</p><p>– This is a good example to discuss the point above. it is important to know structurally, where each residue is. For example, the first Y (46 or 48 depending upon the nomenclature, above) often does not directly contribute to pMHC binding but may be important for the &quot;outline structure&quot; of the CDR loop itself. In addition, the authors do not discuss Van der Waals interactions really at all. Much of the TCR-pMHC interface (binding affinity) is driven by the exclusion of water, a property that is very difficult to assess on an amino acid-amino acid pairwise allotment of interaction energy. I was hoping that once the authors started to discuss &quot;areas of binding potential&quot; the contribution of non-side chain to side chain interactions would be discussed. It is unclear to this reviewer if these types of interactions are accounted for within their algorithm or if they are largely ignored.</p></disp-quote><p>See response 5.</p><p>Diving into this a bit more, this section was explicitly focused on debunking the concept of “conserved contact regions” where TCRs might be expected to frequently contact the same regions of the MHC molecule. The biophysical property analysis and sequence based analysis of Figure 3 suggests such rigidity in binding modes is unlikely. So, while one or the other Tyr may be involved in interacting with the MHC molecule, our main point is to say that we cannot know, a priori, precisely how these sidechains are arranged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Does a binding reaction care if a contact is a side chain-side chain, backbone-backbone, or mix?

It has also been suggested that some side chains can contribute negatively to interfaces (e.g., PMID: 17041605).

Unfortunately, there are too few structures of TCRs with singular autoimmune antigens and TRAV/TRBV usage to make any broad claims about repeated regions of recognition. Further, our results actually predict that these autoimmune TCRs may not have matching contact regions on the HLA surface. Rather, the weaker interacting TRAV/TRBV alleles should encourage an increased dependence on CDR3 involvement.</p><p>Instead of adding further speculation regarding how our results may tie into the recognition of autoimmune pMHC complexes, we have added an extra paragraph to the discussion to provide context as to where our analysis is currently incapable of explaining certain patterns of autoimmunity:</p><p>“While over-reliance on CDR3 may bias TCRs towards auto- and cross-reactivity, the role of the MHC molecule in autoimmunity remains unclear from these results. In contexts such as celiac disease, a particular allele (HLA-DQ2.5) is enriched in patients with the disease [Qiao 2014, Gunnarsen 2017]. Given that the interaction potentials largely predict similar interaction strengths across HLA molecules (Figures 4, S8) such enrichment cannot yet be explained by AIMS. However, considering that the majority of diversity across HLA alleles is concentrated in the peptide binding regions (Figure 2), these correlations between HLA molecules and disease may largely be related to the peptides presented by these molecules, as has been suggested previously [Ishigaki 2022]. In trying to understand how allelic variation alters peptide presentation, and how this in turn impacts the onset of autoimmunity, the lack of strong rules for binding again complicates the problem. While HLA molecules have amino acid preferences at certain anchor positions, there are many exceptions to these &quot;rules&quot; [Nguyen 2021], and mutations to peptides that should improve stability in the HLA binding pocket can have unintended consequences on T cell activation [Smith 2021]. The substantial diversity of possible presented peptides makes the systematic analysis of this aspect of the autoimmunity problem exceptionally challenging.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The interaction potentials also succeed in predicting TCR complexes that will not make contact with MHC. 20 of the 22 structures predicted to have poor CDR2β binding make no contact with MHC, while the last two only make one contact with MHC (Figure 5C). Further, all 8 structures predicted to have poor CDR1β binding make no contact with MHC. (Figure 5C). Again, this prediction accuracy is lower for class II predictions (Figure 5D).</p><p>– This is a super interesting idea that may unlock a lot of what is going on. One wonders how much of this is random chance, i.e., if a different TCR-pMHC with the same V genes and HLA would behave similarly. Also, do these structures preclude (or are driven by) CDR1-peptide contacts, or are the structures carry such a different docking orientation as to completely preclude the CDR1 and CDR2 regions from being part of the binding interface?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the excitement of the reviewer, but as reviewer 1 pointed out, our original methods were somewhat flawed. Our original definition of “contacts” was too stringent. However, with these new, more lenient definitions of contacts, we still find that AIMS-identified weak interacting V-gene encoded CDR loops still make fewer contacts than those that AIMS predicts to be strong interactors.</p><p>Looking at the Reviewer 1 Comment 2 Response, we can see an entire list of TCR-pMHC complexes that utilize the same V-gene. In some cases, there really is little involvement of the CDR1 and CDR2 loops in the interface. In others, we see that many of these germline “interactions” might be more properly classified as “contacts” that have limited energetic contributions to the interaction interface. So, the AIMS interaction potential may provide less of a prediction of where or how sidechain contacts will form, but more of a prediction of the relative contributions of these contacts. The docking orientations in many cases will likely be dominated by CDR3, especially in the case of weakly interacting V-gene encoded CDR loops.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The exposed residues on the α2-helix of HLA class I molecules are enriched in alanine and glycine relative to the α1- helix, which is highly unlikely to be involved in a specific, orientation-altering productive interaction.</p><p>- In practice, it is this reviewer's understanding that there are exit contributions of Van der Waals interactions at these sites. Indeed, early ideas suggested that the diagonal area of pMHC (MHCa 61, MHCb73) used this divot for shape complementary purposes.</p></disp-quote><p>See response 3</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. It is important to note that these interaction potentials take an unbiased approach, calculating every possible interaction between TCR and MHC residues to produce this final score.</p><p>– It was unclear if the authors mean position by position, or did they weigh whether a residue was actually surface exposed and capable of being part of the binding interface.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in lines 579-587 we take only surface exposed residues of the MHC and the CDR loops of TCRalpha and TCRbeta as defined by IMGT:</p><p>“As with all AIMS analyses, the first step is to encode each sequence into an AIMS compatible matrix. In this encoding each amino acid in structurally conserved regions is represented as a number 1-21, with zeros padding gaps between these structurally conserved features. The encoding is straightforward for the TCR sequences, with only the germline encoded regions of the CDR loops included for each gene. For the MHC encoding, only the structurally relevant amino acids are included for optimal alignment of each unique sequence. In this case, the structurally relevant amino acids of the class I (or class II) molecules were divided into three distinct groups; the TCR-exposed residues of the alpha1 (or α) helix, the TCR-exposed residues of the alpha2 (or β) helix, and the peptide-contacting residues of the given MHC.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Productive side-chain interactions between CDR loops and the solvent-exposed residues of the MHC helices.</p><p>– There does seem to be an (over) emphasis on side-chain interactions. And less so on the clustered ability for VDW and/or inhibitory interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>This is true, and is again due to our structure-free treatment of the interaction. As SCSC interactions are the most common in the interface, we believe this is a good first approximation to understanding how the germline regions of the TCR interact (see Response 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. In general, there are quite a number of T cell development citations with actually very little discussed the role of thymic selection in and/or clonal T cell responses in skewing the TCR-pMHC interface to conform to selective pressures. E.g., TCRs can't be too good/cross-reactive or they would undergo central tolerance.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, given the datasets currently available to us for the analysis of the effects of selection and clonal expansion on repertoire skewing, any of our thoughts on this matter would be purely speculative in nature. We discuss the fantastic work done on the role of selection in shaping the docking angle solely to introduce the concept of “conserved contacts”. Our calculated interaction potentials are assumed to be antigen independent, and act as first approximations to the probable TCR-pMHC interface that is then likely altered by the antigen-CDR3 interaction. We briefly discuss these concepts in the results (Lines 292-304) and the Discussion (Lines 475-481).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. &quot;In calculating the interaction score, we assume that productive contacts are only made by the side chains of the interacting residues. This simplification does not capture all TCR-pMHC complex contacts, but here we are looking for selectivity enforced by specific TCR-MHC interactions mediated by side-chains.&quot;</p><p>– Though stated as a caveat, perhaps some effort could be made to include side-chain to the backbone, etc interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to the incorporation of SC-backbone interactions in the parsing of deposited structures, we had initially also hoped to be able to include a backbone scoring function into the AIMS analysis. However, this appears to be beyond the scope of the current study, as the propensity for each sidechain to participate in backbone hydrogen bonding (either as the backbone partner or sidechain partner) is strongly determined by the distribution of the amino acids in either the CDRs or MHC α-helices of structures crystallized thus far.</p><p>The ideal backbone interaction scoring matrix would be unbiased, allowing for us to make estimates into the interactions between as yet uncrystallized TCR-MHC pairs. Currently, the Tyr-Ala and Tyr-Gln interactions would dominate the SC-backbone interaction scoring matrix, despite this potentially being a consequence of other, stronger interactions across the interface.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Boughter and Meier-Schellersheim describe an analysis of TCRpeptide/MHC complexes, aiming to gain an understanding of the underpinnings of the &quot;common&quot; TCR binding geometry. This is fundamental to understanding the MHC restriction of TCRs and how T cells scan and readout peptides. They begin with a comprehensive bioinformatics approach, move to a structural analysis to help interpret the informatics, and bring in biophysical computations. The overall conclusion that specific contacts between TCR genes and MHC proteins are not necessarily preprogrammed and that traditional TCR binding geometries emerge from biophysical compatibility is supported by the data and consistent with recent findings. In general, the work and the conclusions are an advance and place recent findings into perspective. However, the strength of evidence is weakened by choices made in characterizing structures, computing energies, and a strained reliance on &quot;roles&quot; played the parts of the interface which have been discounted many times yet persist in the literature. The latter in particular weakens the discussion and how the authors view the impact of their work.</p><p>The major strength of the paper is the approach taken; I found the comparative analysis of TCR and MHC genetic variability at the sequence level particularly compelling. Bringing in KIRs as a control was also a strong way to support the arguments. There is one major technical weakness in that, as far as is clear from the methods, interatomic interactions were considered with a 3.5 Å cutoff. This is woefully inadequate. Electrostatic interactions can be strong at long distances, which the authors really need to consider – say, going out to 6 Angstroms or so (there is much-published literature on short- and long-range electrostatics in protein interfaces). The importance of long-range electrostatics in TCR-peptide/MHC complexes has been demonstrated previously, particularly in prior work that aimed to address the same problem studied here. The authors also fall victim to the common immunology trope that CDR3-peptide interactions drive specificity, leaving CDR1/CDR2 to bind MHC proteins, i.e., the CDR loops have &quot;roles&quot; in binding. In the very first high-resolution structure of a TCR-peptide/MHC complex, CDR3 interactions with a class I MHC were noted and remarked on, as were CDR1 and CDR2 interactions with the peptide. Later work showed that these CDR3MHC and CDR2-peptide interactions were critical for binding. These findings have been replicated several times now. The authors' introduction of this perspective of different loops of the TCR playing evolved roles (CDR3-&gt;peptide, CDR1/2-&gt;MHC), and their interpretation of their findings in light of it, weakens the papers' conclusions and impact, and it is a missed opportunity that can be addressed with the authors' approach.</p><p>The authors also should consider other literature for a greater impact on their work. For example, they also exclude backbone interactions – this is a curious omission from a biophysical perspective, and others in the field have published on the importance of backbone-mediated interactions (hydrogen bonds mostly) in stabilizing TCR interfaces. The authors also mention but fail to address T cell selection and the role of selection (and possibly coreceptor) in 'enforcing' what we get and have seen structurally (i.e., the idea that pre-selection TCRs bind all over the place, but selection ensures we get ones that bind right and work). Much has been written about this and it should be included.</p><p>1) The very first high-resolution crystal structure of a TCR-pMHC complex by Garboczi and Wiley in the 90s (PMID 8906788) showed CDR3 contacts to the MHC and germline CDR1/2 contacts to the MHC. Later biophysical studies by our own group showed these were crucial for binding (PMID 23736024). Other work has shown the same. Thus, although it is common to say that diverse CDR3 loops bind peptide and germlineencoded CDR1/2 loops bind the MHC, this is not supported at the atomic or energetic level. It actually plays INTO the authors' argument about opportunism/compatibility, but curiously the authors do not discuss it. They should. These observations and the idea that &quot;roles&quot; are not hardcoded into the TCR CDR loops play right into the authors' opportunistic argument introduced at the end of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>See response 5. Additionally, we have added this point about the “opportunism” of CDR1/2 binding peptide and CDR3 binding MHC to the discussion, elaborating further on our previous point about these loops needing to adapt to each individual target (as in the case of the super-bulged peptide)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A 3.5 Å cutoff is far too limited and ignores long-range electrostatics. Our own work addressing the same problem (which also introduced the notion of opportunism/compatibility) found signals for some &quot;sloppy&quot; evolved compatibility but only if we moved to longer ranges (PMID 26884163). The authors should re-evaluate their energetic analysis using longer-range cutoffs. To avoid greatly complicating the analysis, longer ranges could be done only with charged side chains. It was also very curious to omit main chain interactions, something which the authors might want to work back in (see PMID 17041605).</p></disp-quote><p>See response 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should really address the question of how thymic education influences what we see. For example, we recently published a TCR that binds with an outlier geometry (not reverse) which signals just fine – an example of a class-mismatched TCR (emerged from a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell but binds a class I). This TCR is a bit weird in that it has an unusually long CDR3b loop that contacts both peptide and MHC (point 1 again). We also concluded that this is a weird TCR that somehow escaped normal thymic selection, implying that maybe the pre-selection repertoire has TCRs that bind crazily and one role of thymic selection is to filter these, giving us TCRs that are somehow &quot;better&quot; biologically (maybe they signal better, or possess lower x-reactivity, etc.). The authors need to work this thinking in. Relevant papers are PMID 36424374 and PMID 30833553.</p></disp-quote><p>At the time of depositing this preprint, your group’s very interesting class-mismatched TCR structure was not yet published. It does, however, fit nicely into our existing discussion of the reverse-docking TCRs and super-bulged peptide. It provides another, distinct example of non-canonical binding. Further speculation into how this fits into the greater picture of TCR-pMHC binding has now been added to the discussion lines 498508<italic>:</italic></p><p>“New results further suggest the extent of the germline interaction permissiveness, with a class-mismatched CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell capable of binding to and being activated by MHC class I, albeit with a slightly abnormal, but not reversed, docking orientation [Singh 2022]. These results further highlight the opportunism, expanding on previous work in this space [Blevins 2016], of TCR interactions in general, where the &quot;rules&quot; of TCR-pMHC binding seem to be more like guidelines. The literature has long focused on rules of interaction and commonalities between structures [Ysern 1998, al-lazikani 2000], which have been very helpful in guiding research over the past few decades. However, results such as the class-mismatched TCR, reversed docking TCRs, and super-bulged peptide suggest that perhaps such TCR-MHC specific rules may be too restrictive, and that these interactions may frequently involve more opportunistic configurations that call for unbiased evaluation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors use &quot;compatibility&quot; and &quot;opportunistic&quot; to describe TCR binding from a biophysical perspective, contrasting this with the hard-coded model. These are not new concepts though, and although the authors have greatly expanded on the topic (albeit with the limitations above), they should make note of this. They do reference some of the appropriate literature, but clarifying how they are expanding on the topic would strengthen the impact of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We of course realize that this idea of broad biophysical compatibility and opportunism is not solely our own.

We hope these changes address the concerns of the reviewer and editor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, the detailed analysis of the TRBV7-2 containing complexes provided by the authors in the response appears to disprove the AIMS-based prediction that this gene has low interaction potential: &quot;Certainly PRESTO agrees with these structural interpretations, suggesting CDR2B dominates the germline interactions here, with 13/15 SC-SC contacts.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Here we do concede the selected text in the initial response to reviewers displays unclear writing.

What exactly is &quot;nonspecific tight packing&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if the notion of 'nonspecific tight packing’ was unclear in this context. We were using this term to describe regions of close contacts between two proteins that are formed not due to their own strong interactions, but instead due to distal interactions elsewhere on the TCR-pMHC interface<bold>.</bold></p><p>We note that the authors of the PDB 4GRL study [PMID 24136005] highlight that CDR3A “dominate[s] the energetic landscape” of the interaction, supporting our interpretation of the predicted interaction propensity of TRBV7-2/7-3 and its agreement with experimental results.</p><p>In this case, CDR3A is the aforementioned “distal interaction” driving the complex formation, and the tight packing of CDR2B is merely a consequence of the docking, i.e. nonspecific. Briefly, CDR3A is the cause of the tight packing of CDR2B, and CDR2B in turn has no specific side chain interactions with the MHC. These claims are further quantitatively supported by Supplemental Table S5 of PMID 24136005 where mutagenesis of the β chain has only a modest impact on binding affinity, yet again suggestive of a limited interaction between the side chains of TRBV7-3 and the MHC α helix, further supporting the claims put forward by our analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also continue to over-sell their findings in the newly introduced text. For example, in describing the new Figure 5, the authors state: &quot;This comparison shows exceptional agreement between our bioinformatic results and structural analyses&quot;. But when one compares Figure 5a and 5b, for example, the agreement is pretty dubious.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted before, we are now even more careful and have modified the text and replaced “exceptional agreement” by “good agreement”. However, we can quantify this agreement more rigorously by flattening the matrices of Figure 5a and 5b and comparing the distributions of contacts for each residue pair interaction potential score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig7">Author response image 7</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 7.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90681-sa2-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We see that in the case of AIMS interactions scores greater than or equal to zero, we find the majority of our high frequency amino acid contacts. Note that the poor correlation (correlation coefficient 0.2) is expected for multiple reasons. First the TCR-pMHC crystal contact matrix is sparse, giving a high instance of “0” contact pairs. Further, hydrophobic amino acids are relatively rare both in the CDR loops and in the TCR contacting residues on the MHC helix. Lastly, “negative” interactions, such as Lys-Lys or Arg-Phe pairings, cannot have a corresponding negative contact count. Instead we see a higher proportion of 0 contacts between residue pairs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And in 5d, *none* of the differences are significant, and many show the wrong directionality, for example, the median value for &quot;Weak TRBV&quot; is always greater than or equal to the median value for &quot;Moderate TRBV&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Looking at Figure 5C/5D and Supplemental Figure S7, the data are consistent with the differences (or lack thereof) pointed out by us. Whereas the TRAV alleles identified as “strong” binders have much higher AIMS interaction scores than either the “moderate” (~1.5 unit difference) or the “weak” (~2 unit difference) binders, these interaction score differences are more modest for TRBV (~1 unit difference between “strong” and “weak” highest scores). This rationale is already highlighted in the text:</p><p>“Interestingly, these interaction potentials show better experimental agreement and predictive power for TRAV-encoded sequences compared to TRBV-encoded sequences. This could be due either to a fundamental difference in how TCRα and TCRβ contact the MHC α-helices, or in part due to the aforementioned higher interaction potential variance for TRAV-encoded CDR loops (Figure S7).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And in the new text describing the AIMS potential: &quot;The AIMS interaction potential, which can swiftly analyze thousands of sequences, has significantly outperformed more physically detailed and computationally expensive models. In a binary classification of a large database of structurally similar protein complexes, the AIMS interaction potential was capable of distinguishing binders and non-binders to an accuracy of 80%, whereas calculations run on over 45µs of simulated all atom trajectories could only distinguish to an accuracy of 50%. &quot; I looked back at this reference, and what the authors neglect to mention is that the 80% performance comes from a highly parameterized model based on a linear discriminant analysis fitting a weight for each pair of residues in the interface-- it's not at all analogous to the calculation here in which AIMS scores are directly summed up. It's also a single family of interacting proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the parametrization of the model plays an important role here. But we also wish to point out that in the reference in question [PMID 35787023] the more physically detailed and computationally expensive model used the same linear discriminant analysis-based approach on a similarly highly parametrized model, and was still substantially outperformed by the AIMS model (Figure 8: Computationally expensive method, Figure 9: AIMS model, in the referenced manuscript). Nonetheless, we have updated the text to highlight that the AIMS accuracies highlighted in the text do come from a linear discriminant-based analysis.</p><p>Further, this reference is directly analogous to the calculations presented in this manuscript, we just do not currently have a similar classification scheme in which to test TCR-pMHC binding. In fact, to our knowledge there exists no dataset where some number of CDR3-peptide pairings are kept constant while CDR1/2 are varied. This would provide the ideal test for the predictions included herein.</p><p>Lastly, while the Dpr-DIP interactome does concern a single family of interacting proteins, the TCR-pMHC interactome likewise concerns a single family of interacting proteins. Using a minimalist coarse graining of interactions between protein families with conserved structural features, we are able to provide reliable estimates of the tendencies for specific side chains to form productive interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>With regards to the manuscript in general, in some places, the authors seem to want to have their cake and eat it too. Particularly, the idea that TCRs are evolutionarily biased to recognize MHC, included stating support for the &quot;codon model&quot; while at others suggesting that CDR1s and CDR2s have only minimal (complementary) roles in binding. With the extension suggesting that some TRAVs and TRBVs have no (or very minimal) MHC/HLA binding potential.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer 2 that our conclusions could be more directed, and hope that the added text in the discussion reflects this. Specifically, we have added the point:</p><p>“Further, while the interaction codon hypothesis suggests co-evolved interaction interfaces between the TCR and MHC, our analysis instead suggests that each TRAV-TRBV pairing finds a unique approach to binding within the constraints permitted by the MHC molecular surface. In other words, the MHC molecule largely defines the interface.”</p><p>We note that we do not suggest that TCRs are evolutionarily biased to recognize MHC anywhere in the text. While we say our results are somewhat in agreement with the “codon model”, we note a “broader, dynamic interpretation” of the interaction is suggested by AIMS. In other words, there is no evolutionary bias. The “biophysical compatibility” we suggest is a much weaker assumption than an explicit evolutionary bias at the sequence level.</p><p>We wish to point out that, while reviewer 2 presents the codon model and a model with minimally interacting CDR 1/2 loops as models in opposition, both models are compatible with the data presented in this manuscript.</p><p>Specifically, we do not disregard or attempt to disprove the previous finding of evolutionary TCR-pMHC interactions involving TRBV8-2. Instead, we suggest that such conserved interactions are rare, and that some TRAV/TRBV alleles may exist that show very different tendencies, with a limited propensity for binding MHC. Indeed, this diversification of binding strategies may be evolutionarily advantageous, giving TCRs a range of possible strategies for recognizing antigen. In other words, given the large number of possible TRAV and TRBV combinations, TCRs can realize a multitude of distinct binding strategies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This later argument would suggest that antibodies, fully capable of creating diverse CDR3s, should similarly have a (modest, strong) ability to bind pMHC ligands. I suppose a computational test of the general idea the authors are putting forward would be to use their AIMs platform with human antibody CDR1s and CDR2s to see if these were all net no-binding or negative binding with MHC. However, I do not like the idea of bringing up additional questions/tests of the model during a re-review.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern with our workload in this re-review. However, we have already considered antibody CDR loops as a negative control, and were surprised to find that they represent a poor negative control.

The authors of this review note that despite excellent synthetic CDR loop libraries, most TCR-like antibodies are “isolated from libraries built on endogenous variable gene repertoires”. In other words, using native IGHV/IGLV/IGKV libraries does not preclude these antibodies from binding to pMHC. While some (or perhaps the majority) of these “TCR-like” antibodies do not adopt this canonical TCR-pMHC docking orientation, at least one study [PMID 19307587] finds a “TCR-like” antibody that does. Importantly, while the heavy chain overlaps with the TCR-α interface and the light chain overlaps with the TCR-β interface, the antibody germline CDR loops bear little to no resemblance to either chain (Author response table 2).</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of CDR loop sequences of TCR 1G4 and the TCR-like antibody that binds to the same pMHC complex.</title><p>Sequences identified via PMID 19307587</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Loop</th><th>CDR1A/H</th><th>CDR2A/H</th><th>CDR1B/L</th><th>CDR2B/L</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">TCR Seq</td><td align="left" valign="top">DSAIYN</td><td align="left" valign="top">IQSSQRE</td><td align="left" valign="top">MNHEY</td><td align="left" valign="top">SVGAGI</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Antibody Seq</td><td align="left" valign="top">GFTFSTYQ</td><td align="left" valign="top">IVSSGGST</td><td align="left" valign="top">TGTSRDVGGYNYVS</td><td align="left" valign="top">DVIERSS</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>As such, the latter argument outlined by reviewer 2 does seem, at least in part, to be consistent for antibodies, and further they do not represent a suitable negative control.</p></body></sub-article></article>
