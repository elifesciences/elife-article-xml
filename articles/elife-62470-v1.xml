spliced (PS), and completely spliced (CS) classes of RNAs, each playing distinct roles in viral replication. Elucidating their host protein ‘interactomes’ is crucial to understanding virus-host interplay. Here, we present HyPR-MS<sub>SV</sub> for isolation of US, PS, and CS transcripts from a single population of infected CD4+ T-cells and mass spectrometric identification of their in vivo protein interactomes. Analysis revealed 212 proteins differentially associated with the unique RNA classes, including preferential association of regulators of RNA stability with US and PS transcripts and, unexpectedly, mitochondria-linked proteins with US transcripts. Remarkably, &gt;80 of these factors screened by siRNA knockdown impacted HIV-1 gene expression. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed several to co-localize with HIV-1 US RNA and exhibit changes in abundance and/or localization over the course of infection. This study validates HyPR-MS<sub>SV</sub> for discovery of viral splice variant protein interactomes and provides an unprecedented resource of factors and pathways likely important to HIV-1 replication.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>RNA binding proteins</kwd><kwd>RNA

alternative splicing of a single primary RNA transcript to produce three major classes of viral RNA variants: unspliced (US), partially spliced (PS), and completely spliced (CS). The individual variants perform distinct roles during HIV-1 replication through dynamic interactions with specific viral and host proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coffin et al., 1997</xref>). These protein ‘interactomes’ guide the RNA through required cellular pathways encompassing splicing, RNA nuclear export, mRNA translation, and packaging of full-length, US RNA genomes into progeny virions that assemble at the plasma membrane. Each HIV-1 splice variant performs a distinct function and is thus predicted to interface with a unique protein interactome.</p><p>HIV-1 gene expression is traditionally divided into two phases referred to as ‘early’ and ‘late.’ Early gene expression involves translation of auxiliary proteins Tat and Rev as well as the accessory protein Nef from CS transcripts. Tat and Rev localize to the nucleus where Tat facilitates viral transcription and Rev mediates nuclear export of intron-retaining US and PS transcripts. Late gene expression is marked by translation of the US transcript to synthesize Gag and Gag-Pol capsid proteins and translation of PS transcripts to generate Envelope glycoproteins as well as the Vpu, Vpr, and Vif immunomodulatory factors.</p><p>HIV-1 splicing generates vast numbers of splice variants, with over 50 proposed to be physiologically significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Emery et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ocwieja et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Purcell and Martin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vega et al., 2016</xref>). The locations of splice donor and acceptor sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sertznig et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vega et al., 2016</xref>), the identities of several <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans-</italic>regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mahiet and Swanson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sertznig et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stoltzfus, 2009</xref>), and the transcript and protein product abundances needed for efficient viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cullen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karn and Stoltzfus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weinberger et al., 2005</xref>) are still topics of intensive investigation toward the development of antiviral therapies.</p><p>Previous works have shown that the HIV-1 splice variant classes interact differentially with both viral and host proteins. For example, HIV-1 US and PS transcripts hijack the cellular XPO1 (also known as CRM1)-mediated nuclear export pathway through the activities of Rev and a <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA structure known as the Rev-response element (RRE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pollard and Malim, 1998</xref>). Rev multimerizes on the RRE and recruits XPO1 to form a functional RNA export complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daugherty et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daugherty et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DiMattia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DiMattia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fang et al., 2013</xref>). This is in contrast to CS transcripts that do not require Rev and recruit components of the NXF1/NXT1 export machinery, similar to the bulk of cellular fully spliced mRNAs. A second example is HIV-1 genome packaging wherein US transcripts are packaged into virions due to favored interactions between the Gag polyprotein and a structured RNA packaging signal known as ‘psi’ in the 5’-untranslated region of the US transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berkowitz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lever et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Luban and Goff, 1994</xref>). These binding sites are lost in PS and CS transcripts due to splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Purcell and Martin, 1993</xref>). Additional host factors have been implicated as RNA interactors regulating US, PS, and CS RNA expression and packaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolinger and Boris-Lawrie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Freed and Mouland, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jin and Musier-Forsyth, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mbonye and Karn, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McLaren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meng and Lever, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Swanson and Malim, 2006</xref>). However, the list is far from complete.</p><p>In the current study, we describe a novel strategy for efficient isolation of the three major HIV-1 splice variant classes from a single population of natively infected CD4+ T-cells and define distinct US, PS, and CS in vivo RNA-protein interactomes using mass spectrometry. We identify over 200 proteins differentially associated with the US, PS, and CS HIV splice variant pools, 102 of which are previously unkown HIV-1-host interactors. Gene-specific siRNA knockdown (KD) of 121 host proteins indicated more than 80 are effectors of HIV-1 RNA regulation. We further demonstrate, using fluorescence microscopy, several instances of identified host protein co-localization with HIV RNA and changes to the single-cell abundance and/or subcellular distribution of several identified host proteins over the course of HIV-1 infection. Collectively, we detail a powerful new approach for probing virus-host interactions and use it to expose new host factors with apparent roles in the HIV-1 replication cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Purification of HIV-1 splice variant classes</title><p>We recently described HyPR-MS (<italic>Hy</italic>bridization <italic>P</italic>urification of <italic>R</italic>NA-Protein Complexes Followed by <italic>M</italic>ass <italic>S</italic>pectrometry), a strategy to identify the in vivo protein interactomes of specific viral RNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Knoener et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Spiniello et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Spiniello et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we present HyPR-MS<sub>sv</sub>, a strategy that expands the capabilities of HyPR-MS to differentiate in vivo protein interactomes for multiple splice variants (SV) derived from a single primary transcript and isolated from a single-cell population. Applied here, we purified the three major classes of HIV-1 splice variants (US, PS, and CS) from a single population of infected Jurkat CD4+ T-cells, then identified and characterized their protein interactomes using mass spectrometry.</p><p>To preserve in vivo viral RNA-protein complexes prior to cell lysis, Jurkat cultures were treated with formaldehyde at 48 hr post-infection (h.p.i.) (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of ~1 infectious unit per cell). The Jurkat cell line was chosen because it is a well-characterized CD4+ T-cell line previously confirmed to support replication of the HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> reporter virus used for this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Knoener et al., 2017</xref>). To isolate the US, PS, and CS RNA pools, three biotinylated capture oligonucleotides (COs) were designed complementary to three distinct regions of the HIV RNA genome: intron-1 (unique to US), intron-2 (present in both US and PS), and the 3’-exon (present in US, PS, and CS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Cell lysates were first depleted of the US HIV RNA through hybridization to the intron-1 CO, followed by its capture with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, and subsequent release using toehold-mediated oligonucleotide displacement. Additional hybridization, capture and release steps were subsequently repeated iteratively using first the intron-2 CO and then the 3’-exon CO for isolation of the PS and CS RNA pools, respectively. Once purified, proteins cross-linked to each isolated HIV RNA class were identified by mass spectrometry (overview in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HyPR-MS for purification of HIV splice variant interactomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Capture oligonucleotides (COs) were designed to complement specific regions of the HIV genome to make possible the isolation of the three HIV splice variant classes from a single- cell lysate.

These common interactors also featured several proteins previously implicated in HIV-1 replication including host factors regulating RNA transport and translational initation (e.g., NCBP1, DHX9, DDX3, EIF4G, and PABP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boeras et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolinger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Soto-Rifo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stake et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yedavalli et al., 2004</xref>), known HIV splicing factors (e.g., HMGA1, HNRNPA1, HNRNPAB, HNRNPH, HNRNPF, SRSF1, SRSF2, SRSF3, SRSF6, SRSF7, TRA2B, and U2AF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dlamini and Hull, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mahiet and Swanson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sertznig et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stoltzfus and Madsen, 2006</xref>), RNA nuclear export and transport proteins (e.g., ABCE1, RAB11A, RANBP2, and XPO1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friedrich et al., 2011</xref>), and proteins implicated in HIV-1 virus particle assembly (e.g., AP-2, PDCD6IP [ALIX], STAU2, UPF1, and VPS4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friedrich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meng and Lever, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, several common interactors matched proteins previously identified in RNA capture screens that had used partial segments of HIV-1 RNA as bait, including 27 of 32 proteins identified by Kula et al., 32 of the 41 identified by Marchand et al., and 93 of the 121 identified by Stake et al.

Therefore, we conducted three pairwise comparisons: US vs PS, US vs CS, and PS vs CS. Using the Student’s t-test and a permutation-based false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%, we identified 212 proteins that differentially interacted with one or more of the HIV splice variant classes: 101, 93, and 68 proteins in the US, PS, and CS captures, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Hierarchical clustering was used to organize the 212 proteins into a heatmap for visualization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The associated gene tree indicates the extent of similarity in ‘interaction profiles’ for the proteins shown; the length of the branches directly correlates with the degree of similarity. This analysis revealed clusters of proteins elevated for each individual class as well as proteins common to members of two HIV splice variant classes. The most abundant of these were proteins preferentially associated with both the US and PS HIV transcripts but not the CS pool (45 proteins) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Determination and analysis of HIV splice variant protein interactomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap depicts relative intensities for each of the 212 proteins (rows) in each of the three biological replicates of the unspliced (US), partially spliced (PS), and completely spliced (CS) (columns) differential interactomes.

This analysis revealed over-representation of several GO terms in the interactome of each splice variant class; some common to more than one class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). Notable among these were nine proteins, known to regulate RNA stability, associated with both the US and PS, but not CS, transcripts (FXR1, YBX1, YBX3, IGF2BP1, IGF2BP3, SYNCRIP, HNRNPR, YTHDF2, and UPF1). Proteins involved in mRNA splicing, and the regulation thereof, were also elevated in the US and PS relative to the CS capture samples (YBX1, SYNCRIP, HNRNPR, HNRNPL, BCAS2, RBMX, and MBNL1) but with less congruence. A subset of these proteins were elevated only in the US capture samples (HNRNPA2B1 and HNRNPK; negative regulators of splicing) or PS capture samples (DAZAP1 and TRA2A; positive regulators of splicing), but not in both. PS captures were also exclusively enriched for proteins found in nuclear bodies. For cytoplasmic activities, proteins involved in translation were highly enriched in both the US (12 proteins) and CS (18 proteins) interactomes. Interestingly, however, while the CS interactome included translation initiation proteins (as may be expected), the US interactome was enriched for proteins linked to mRNA translation in the mitochondria. Cellular component GO term enrichment analysis further revealed 45 mitochondrion proteins enriched in the US RNA interactome; eight are mitochondrial nucleoid proteins and several have known roles in the carboxylic acid metabolic process, a GO term also over-represented in the US RNA interactome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Validation of HyPR-MS<sub>sv</sub> defined HIV-1 RNA interactors using RNA silencing</title><p>To determine their potential relevance to HIV-1 gene expression, 121 host proteins identified by HyPR-MS<sub>SV</sub> were targeted for siRNA KD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) and passed cell viability criteria in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

The first two goals were achieved by configuring HyPR-MS<sub>SV</sub> to sequentially deplete specific classes of HIV RNA from the same pool of natively infected cell lysates using three independently targeted sets of short (~30 nt) biotinylated capture oligos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To our knowledge, all previous studies for discovery of HIV RNA protein interactors, with the exception of our prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Knoener et al., 2017</xref>), utilized synthetic viral RNAs as bait added to cellular lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marchand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Singh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stake et al., 2015</xref>) or viral constructs engineered to encode artificial RNA sequences for the purpose of RNA ‘tagging’ (e.g., MS2 loops) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kula et al., 2011</xref>). While effective at identifying protein interactors, both of these strategies may complicate the interpretation of results by eliminating the cellular context of interactions (e.g., interactions may occur at specific stages of the viral replication cycle) or by introducing non-native components that might interfere with native interactions. A majority of the proteins identified in the abovementioned studies were also identified by HyPR-MS<sub>SV</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), providing validation of our strategy. Many of these proteins were differential interactors of the HIV RNA splice variant classes showing HyPR-MS<sub>SV</sub> provides the novel capability to resolve not only the stage at which a given host factor interacts with the viral RNA (i.e., time of cross-linking post-infection) but also the specific class of HIV-1 splice variant with which it associates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Furthermore, this strategy can, in theory, be expanded to differentiate the protein interactomes of each individual protein-coding HIV-1 RNA, can be used to extract native RNA transcripts produced from any strain or infected cell type, and can easily be adapted to study other viruses or cellular RNA splice variants.</p><p>By isolating the HIV-1 splice variant classes, we were able to compare RNAs containing both shared and distinct sequences, and likely corresponding secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, to decipher how their protein interactors may consequently differ. We validated the sequential capture of US, PS, and CS HIV RNAs using RT-qPCR and showed at least 200-fold specificity relative to cellular RNAs and at least 10-fold specificity for the splice variant class of interest in each capture.

By contrast, a subset of the factors preferentially associated with US RNA, but not PS or CS transcripts, may play roles in US RNA genome packaging and/or the virus assembly pathway.

Eleven of these host proteins were known stress granule components and/or had functions in splicing. Ten were determined to be positive effectors of late gene expression, six of which affected late gene expression significantly more than early. Within this group, a subcluster of three proteins (HNRNPR, FAM120A, and IGF2BP3) exhibited markedly similar HyPR-MS RNA interaction profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), siRNA KD effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), and subcellular localization patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Intriguingly, YBX1, IGF2BP1, and HNRNPR have previously been suggested to have roles in HIV replication: YBX1 was shown to stabilize HIV US RNA and enhance virus production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mu et al., 2013</xref>), overexpression of IGF2BP1 was shown to reduce HIV infectivity through its interaction with Gag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>), and HNRNPR was shown to interact with HIV Rev (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hadian et al., 2009</xref>). By contrast, FAM120A has not previously been linked to viruses but has been shown to protect RNAs from Ago2-mediated degradation through the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>), which frequently serves in an antiviral role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eckenfelder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harvey et al., 2011</xref>). Our functional analysis showed a decrease in late HIV gene expression upon KD of all five of these proteins (IGF2BP1, YBX1, HNRNPR, IGF2BP3, and FAM120A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), consistent with shared roles for these clustered host proteins as positive regulators of US HIV RNA transport and/or stability. That HNRNPR, IGF2BP1, and FAM120A were co-localized with Gag at plasma membrane punctae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), likely assembling virions, may suggest that that these proteins play a role in the virion assembly pathway.</p><p>Analysis of the HyPR-MS and siRNA KD screen data also revealed a trend for mitochondria-linked proteins that interacted with US and/or PS HIV RNA and served as negative effectors of HIV gene expression. Of particular interest were LRPPRC and MBOAT7 because they both preferentially interacted with US and PS HIV RNA, were categorized as negative effectors of late gene expression, and were detected co-localizing with US RNA both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. LRPPRC was previously shown to localize to the nucleus and to mitochondria as a putative effector of RNA metabolism in both locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mili and Piñol-Roma, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ruzzenente et al., 2012</xref>). One study showed that nuclear LRPPRC directly interacted with XPO1, eIF4E, and a signature RNA secondary structure found in a subset of cellular RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Volpon et al., 2017</xref>), features similar to how Rev and the RRE are known to drive US and PS RNA export. Interestingly, another study implicated LRPPRC in HIV-1 replication but as affecting the pre-integration stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schweitzer et al., 2012</xref>). By contrast, MBOAT7 is an intramembrane protein and acyltransferase that incorporates polyunsaturated fatty acids into phosphatidylinositol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2012</xref>) and has not previously been implicated in viral or cellular RNA metabolism. However, in addition to perinuclear and ER localization, MBOAT7 has been reported to localize to mitochondrial associated ER membranes which bridge the ER to the mitochondria to regulate antiviral signaling through the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling viral RNA sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hirata et al., 2013</xref>). Based on our combined results, we hypothesize that both LRPPRC and MBOAT7 link US RNA transport to mitochondrial signaling pathways capable of dampening HIV-1 late gene expression.</p><p>Notably, many metabolic and enzymatic proteins were identified as US HIV RNA interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Prior studies have indicated that many metabolic enzymes, including ALDH18A1, HSD17B10, IDH2, and SUCLG1 identified here, ‘moonlight’ as RNA binding proteins. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beckmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cieśla, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hentze et al., 2018</xref>). The precise role in RNA regulation for most of these enzymes is still unknown; however, it is thought that they may regulate RNA expression directly through binding, or conversely, the RNA could influence the enzyme’s metabolic function by outcompeting the enzyme’s typical substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hentze et al., 2018</xref>). In our siRNA screen, the KD of HSD17B10 and IDH2 both resulted in a statistically significant change in HIV late gene expression but not early gene expression, with HSD17B10 acting as a negative effector and IDH2 as a positive effector (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). This suggests that metabolic proteins may play an important role in HIV gene expression, but further investigation is need to decipher the unique role of each.</p><p>It should be noted that the HyPR-MS interactome determination, siRNA KD screen, and RNA-protein co-localization and expression analysis were completed using three different cell lines: Jurkat, 293T, and HeLa, respectively. Each cell line was selected for its previously demonstrated utility in HIV-1 research and its compatibility with each technology being used here. We acknowledge that differences in gene expression profiles or protein functions among these cell lines result in some limitations in the conclusions potentially derived from these data. Here, we have limited our analysis to proteins that were shown to be HIV-1 RNA interactors or effectors in the analyses done using all three cell lines. To overcome some of these limitations, future work will include conducting similar screens in primary CD4+ T-cells and monocytes/macrophages using more relevant R5-tropic HIV-1 founder strains for elucidation of innate immune signaling host factors involved in HIV-1 RNA biology.</p><p>Overall, this study describes and validates a powerful new biochemical approach for deep interrogation of the complex interplay of viral and cellular RNA and protein factors during viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Using siRNA KD and single-cell imaging experiments, we also generated a catalog of host protein candidates for positive and negative regulation of HIV-1 gene expression. Interestingly, a subset of proteins (HNRNPR, RBM4, and RBMX) were frequently observed both at US RNA transcription sites as well as at putative sites of virus particle assembly, suggesting that these factors may be capable of strong, persistent association with viral RNA throughout the entire productive phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The changes seen in subcellular distribution of HNRNPR are consistent with a role in stability and nuclear export of intron-retaining HIV-1 transcripts while the expression changes and localization of IGF2BP3 support a role in cytoplasmic US RNA transport and stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Finally, we identified a set of host factors linked to mitochondria (including LRPPRC and MBOAT7) that may represent new effectors of HIV-1 antiviral surveillance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Jurkat E6 cells are T lymphocytes established from the peripheral blood of a 14-year-old male with acute T-cell leukemia and were obtained through the NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH: Jurkat Clone E6-1 from Dr. Arthur Weiss (cat# 177) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weiss et al., 1984</xref>).

Media was exchanged with fresh media 24 h.p.i. The cells were fixed 48 h.p.i. by washing with PBS, incubating with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, then washing three times with PBS. Cells were then made permeable by incubating with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature and washing three times with PBS. Endogenous RNases were then deactivated by incubating with 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) in PBS for 15 min, removing the solution then incubating again with fresh 0.1% DEPC in PBS for 15 min; the cells were then washed three times with PBS and stored at 4°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>IF labeling</title><p>All IF steps were conducted at room temperature. Blocking buffer (Western blocking buffer, Roche) was added to each well, incubated for 30–60 min, then removed.

For some protein/antibody pairs (DNM2, HNRNPR, FAM120A, MBOAT7, MOV10, RBM4, RBMX) the IF signal was superior if the IF was conducted prior to FISH. For other antibodies (CSDE1, LRPPRC, TRIM56) the IF signal was superior if the IF was conducted after FISH. For G3BP1 and IGF2BP3, either order was fine. If a Gag primary antibody was used, it was added at the same time as the host protein primary antibody. The protocols for each procedure remained consistent, the order in which they were done was only reversed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-5"><title>HIV RNA, Gag, and host protein single-cell imaging</title><p>Single-cell imaging experiments were performed on a Nikon Ti-Eclipse inverted wide-field epifluorescence deconvolution microscope (Nikon Corporation). Images were collected using an Orca-Flash 4.0 C11440 (Hamamatsu Photonics) camera and Nikon NIS Elements software (version 4.20.03) using Nikon 60x (N.A. 1.40; Plan Apo) or 100× (N.A. 1.45; Plan Apo) objective lenses and the following excitation/emission filter set ranges (wavelengths in nanometers): 405/470 (DAPI), 430/470 (CFP), 490/525 (AlexaFluor488), 585/610 (CAL Fluor Red 590), 645/705 (AlexaFluor647). Images were generally acquired in z-stacks containing various numbers of images along the z-axis of the cells. Images were processed and analyzed using FIJI/ImageJ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rueden et al., 2017</xref>). All z-frames within a z-stack were examined for instances of co-localization; however, the fluorescence from only a single z-frame was used to produce co-localization images. For determining HIV RNA, Gag, and host protein expression differences in cells, four z-frames were merged additively for fluorescence quantitation of each component.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantitation of HIV RNA, Gag, and host protein IF</title><p>Fluorescence for each channel (HIV-RNA, Gag protein, and each host protein) was quantified using FIJI/ImageJ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rueden et al., 2017</xref>). Nuclear and total cellular fluorescence were measured by drawing perimeters around the nucleus (defined by DAPI staining) and the entire cell (defined by Gag protein fluorescence in late stage cells or autofluorescence in uninfected/early stage cells), then using FIJI quantitation tools to measure the fluorescence within each drawn perimeter. Cytoplasmic fluorescence was calculated by subtracting nuclear fluorescence from total cell fluorescence and the nuc/cyto ratio was calculated by dividing the nuclear fluorescence by the cytoplasmic fluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). For determining correlation of host protein expression with HIV gRNA expression, cells with outlier values in total HIV gRNA fluorescence were excluded from the dataset. An outlier here is defined as a value that is more than 1.5 interquartile ranges (IQRs) below the 1st quartile (Q1) or above the 3rd quartile (Q3). IQR is defined as (Q3–Q1), with Q3 and Q1 calculated using the quartile function in Excel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). The Pearson’s R value was calculated, excluding outliers, to determine correlation of US HIV RNA and host protein fluorescence expression in the nucleus, cytoplasm, total cell, and for the nuc/cyto ratios using the CORREL function in Excel. R<sup>2</sup> values were calculated using the chart tools in Excel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>For determining host protein expression and distribution changes, outliers were determined, as described above, for host protein expression values in early and late cells in four categories: nuclear, cytoplasmic, total cellular, and nuc/cyto ratio. To determine if ‘early’ and ‘late’ cells showed statistically significant differences in host protein expression, a Student’s t-test, excluding outliers, was used to determine a p-value. The percent change in each category was calculated using the mean values for each category within early and late cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical methods are described in the appropriate ‘Materials and Methods’ section or figure captions for all data analyses.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by National Institutes of Health [R01AI110221, U54AI150470 to NMS, R01CA193481 to LMS, T32CA009135 to ELE]; the Greater Milwaukee Foundation's Shaw Scientist Program [to NMS]; a UW-Madison UW2020 Infrastructure Award [to NMS]; two National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships [DGE-1256259 to JTB and BEB], an OVCGRE Dissertation Completion Fellowship [to JTB]; an Advance Opportunity Fellowship from the UW-Madison SciMed/GRS program [to ELE].

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Knoener et al. describe a new method for identifying proteins that interact with different splice variants of HIV-1 RNA, called HyPR-MS<sub>SV</sub> (Hybridization Purification of RNA-Protein Complexes Followed by Mass Spectrometry for splice variants). The method was developed to identify cellular RNA binding proteins that bind to each of three major HIV-1 RNA species: unspliced RNA, partially spliced RNA, and completely spliced RNA. The authors present a comprehensive study of subcellular localization, co-localization with other viral factors, and results of knockdowns of identified host factors to reveal potential roles in HIV-1 RNA biology. This is a technical tour-de-force, the experiments are rigorously performed, and the results are presented in detail. A limitation is the lack of virology (e.g., testing for loss of viral infectivity upon factor knockdown), but as a methodology paper this is valuable resource, and the results will lead to further studies that will add to improved understanding about host factors that influence RNA trafficking and function in HIV-1 infection.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The probe used for CS RNA is within the 3' exon that is present in all 3 RNA species (US, CS, and PS) yet the analysis was performed in a pairwise fashion (CS vs. PS and US vs. CS). Were there host factors that bound to all 3 RNA species? if so, please indicate them and provide an explanation for why this may be so. Are there any RNA binding proteins that have been shown previously to interact non-specifically to RNA that could potentially be discounted?</p><p>2) Did the authors note that several factors were omitted from their identified protein list that have been previously shown to have an effect on HIV-1 RNA or were packaged into virus particles? Factor that comes to mind include DHX9 (RHA), DDX3, eIF4E, PABP, and nuclear cap binding complex, which are missing from the analysis and have been shown to be important in HIV biology. It would be informative if the authors would comment on why factors previously shown to be important were not found in their study?</p><p>3) A previous study that examined host factors that bind to unspliced HIV-1 RNA (5'UTR) was not cited, although some of the factors in that paper and this work are overlapping (HNRNPR, SRSF6, IGF2BP3, SYNCRIP, YBX1 as examples) (Stake et al., 2015). In a similar vein, the authors should briefly discuss how their HIV RNA-protein interactome compare to other studies that used segments of the genome as bait or where affinity handles were engineered in.</p><p>4) The HYPER-MS<sub>SV</sub> studies were performed in Jurkat cells while the validation experiment were carried out in 293T or He La cells. While this is acceptable given the questions being asked, the different cell lines might differentially express other factors that influence the activity of the protein being KO or IF. The authors should clarify whether they consider this a limitation of the study and what interpretations it might impact.</p><p>5) Figure 2B shows that the largest group of cellular proteins that preferentially interact with US viral transcripts belong to carboxylic acid and coenzyme metabolic pathways. This is an interesting observation that the authors did not validate or discuss a in terms of a potential virological function. Although we will not require it, the authors could consider performing similar KO/FISH experiments to better understand how a subset of those metabolic enzymes regulate HIV gene expression.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62470.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The probe used for CS RNA is within the 3' exon that is present in all 3 RNA species (US, CS, and PS) yet the analysis was performed in a pairwise fashion (CS vs. PS and US vs. CS).

Indeed, we identified over 900 host factors associated with all three splice variant pools. We agree that including these factors and discussing their significance and specificity to HIV-1 RNA would be valuable. To this end, we made the following changes to the revised manuscript:</p><p>1) We constructed a list of 926 proteins identified in at least two biological replicates for all three splice variant capture types (US, PS, and CS). This list and the data are included as a tab named “Common Protein Interactors” in Supplementary file 2.</p><p>2) We mined the literature for prior studies that used PolyA-tail capture strategies to identify “common” cellular RNA-associated proteins and then annotated our “Common Protein Interactors” tab in Supplementary file 2 to highlight which of the proteins identified in our HIV-1 study are most likely to represent “non-specific” mRNA-associated proteins.</p><p>3) We also added a tab named “Differential Protein Interactors” to Supplementary file 2 that highlights which of the 212 proteins identified as differential HIV-1 splice variant interactors in our study were previously identified as more general RNA-associated proteins in the studies noted above.</p><p>4) Finally, we modified the text to discuss these data in the Results and Discussion sections (see below).</p><p>“In all, 926 proteins were identified in at least two biological replicates of all three HIV splice variant captures (Supplementary file 2). […] Furthermore, several common interactors matched proteins previously identified in RNA capture screens that had used partial segments of HIV-1 RNA as bait, including 27 of 32 proteins identified by Kula, et al., 32 of the 41 identified by Marchand, et al., and 93 of the 121 identified by Stake, et al. (Supplementary file 2) (Kula et al., 2011; Marchand et al., 2011; Stake et al., 2015).”</p><p>“Over 900 proteins were detected in the interactomes of all three HIV splice variant classes (Supplementary file 2); many of these are likely “general” RNA regulatory factors as they were found associated with cellular polyadenylated RNAs in prior studies (Hentze et al., 2018; Queiroz et al., 2019). However, many of these common interactors included RNA regulatory proteins already demonstrated to play important roles in HIV-1 replication (e.g., DHX9, DDX3, SR proteins, and ABCE1) (Boeras et al., 2016; Bolinger et al., 2010; Friedrich et al., 2011; Mahiet and Swanson, 2016; Soto-Rifo et al., 2013; Stoltzfus and Madsen, 2006; Yedavalli et al., 2004) or were identified in prior pull-down studies (Kula et al., 2011; Marchand et al., 2011; Stake et al., 2015).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Did the authors note that several factors were omitted from their identified protein list that have been previously shown to have an effect on HIV-1 RNA or were packaged into virus particles? Factor that comes to mind include DHX9 (RHA), DDX3, eIF4E, PABP, and nuclear cap binding complex, which are missing from the analysis and have been shown to be important in HIV biology. It would be informative if the authors would comment on why factors previously shown to be important were not found in their study?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we did not include sufficient description or discussion of known HIV-1 RNA host co-factors and regret this deficiency. Many of the known factors noted by the reviewers (e.g., DHX9, DDX3, PABP, NCBP1 (component of the nuclear cap-binding complex)) were identified as common protein interactors; and they, among other known host regulatory factors, are now each featured in Supplementary file 2 (see also response to Essential revisions #1). We also added a more thorough discussion of these proteins and other known HIV-1 RNA effectors to the Results and Discussion sections (see below).</p><p>“These common interactors also featured several proteins previously implicated in HIV-1 replication including host factors regulating RNA transport and translational initation (e.g., NCBP1, DHX9, DDX3, EIF4G, and PABP) (Boeras et al., 2016; Bolinger et al., 2010; Soto-Rifo et al., 2013; Stake et al., 2015; Yedavalli et al., 2004), known HIV splicing factors (e.g., HMGA1, HNRNPA1, HNRNPAB, HNRNPH, HNRNPF, SRSF1, SRSF2, SRSF3, SRSF6, SRSF7, TRA2B, and U2AF2) (Dlamini and Hull, 2017; Mahiet and Swanson, 2016; Sertznig et al., 2018; Stoltzfus and Madsen, 2006), RNA nuclear export and transport proteins (e.g., ABCE1, RAB11A, RANBP2, and XPO1) (Friedrich et al., 2011) and proteins implicated in HIV-1 virus particle assembly (e.g., AP-2, PDCD6IP (ALIX), STAU2, UPF1, and VPS4) (Friedrich et al., 2011; Meng and Lever, 2013). Furthermore, several common interactors matched proteins previously identified in RNA capture screens that had used partial segments of HIV-1 RNA as bait, including 27 of 32 proteins identified by Kula, et al., 32 of the 41 identified by Marchand, et al., and 93 of the 121 identified by Stake, et al. (Supplementary file 2)”.</p><p>“However, many of these common interactors included RNA regulatory proteins already demonstrated to play important roles in HIV-1 replication (e.g., DHX9, DDX3, SR proteins, and ABCE1) (Boeras et al., 2016; Bolinger et al., 2010; Friedrich et al., 2011; Mahiet and Swanson, 2016; Soto-Rifo et al., 2013; Stoltzfus and Madsen, 2006; Yedavalli et al., 2004) or were identified in prior pull-down studies (Kula et al., 2011; Marchand et al., 2011; Stake et al., 2015).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A previous study that examined host factors that bind to unspliced HIV-1 RNA (5'UTR) was not cited, although some of the factors in that paper and this work are overlapping (HNRNPR, SRSF6, IGF2BP3, SYNCRIP, YBX1 as examples) (Stake et al., 2015). In a similar vein, the authors should briefly discuss how their HIV RNA-protein interactome compare to other studies that used segments of the genome as bait or where affinity handles were engineered in.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not citing the Stake et al. paper (Stake et al., 2015) considering its importance to our study. This was a mistake that occurred during editing and we have remedied the oversight. We also appreciate the reviewers’ request that we better compare our findings to those of others that used HIV RNA baits in different contexts. To do so, we now cross-reference both our differential and common protein interactor lists in Supplementary file 2 to the lists of proteins identified by Stake et al. and two additional studies (Kula et al; and Marchand et al.) and indicate which proteins were common among them. We also added discussion of these studies to the Results and Discussion sections (see below).</p><p>“Furthermore, several common interactors matched proteins previously identified in RNA capture screens that had used partial segments of HIV-1 RNA as bait, including 27 of 32 proteins identified by Kula, et al., 32 of the 41 identified by Marchand, et al., and 93 of the 121 identified by Stake, et al. (Supplementary file 2) (Kula et al., 2011; Marchand et al., 2011; Stake et al., 2015).”</p><p>“To our knowledge, all previous studies for discovery of HIV RNA protein interactors, with the exception of our prior study (Knoener et al., 2017), utilized synthetic viral RNAs as bait added to cellular lysates (Marchand et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2016; Stake et al., 2015) or viral constructs engineered to encode artificial RNA sequences for the purpose of RNA “tagging” (e.g., MS2 loops) (Kula et al., 2011). […] Furthermore, this strategy can, in theory, be expanded to differentiate the protein interactomes of each individual protein-coding HIV-1 RNA, can be used to extract native RNA transcripts produced from any strain or infected cell type, and can easily be adapted to study other viruses or cellular RNA splice variants.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The HYPER-MS<sub>SV</sub> studies were performed in Jurkat cells while the validation experiment were carried out in 293T or He La cells. While this is acceptable given the questions being asked, the different cell lines might differentially express other factors that influence the activity of the protein being KO or IF. The authors should clarify whether they consider this a limitation of the study and what interpretations it might impact.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comment and now detail in both the Results and Discussion sections (see below) the reasons for selecting these cell lines for each application and acknowledge the limitations of these choices. Although using highly tractable cell systems was invaluable for establishing and validating the HyPR-MS<sub>SV</sub> technology, it is certainly our intention that the strategy next be applied to study more relevant R5-tropic HIV-1 founder strains primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and monocytes/macrophages.</p><p>“The Jurkat cell line was chosen because it is a well characterized CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell line previously confirmed to support replication of the HIV-1<sub>NL4-3</sub> reporter virus used for this study (Knoener et al., 2017).”</p><p>“The HEK293T cell line was selected here due to its extensive use in studies of HIV-1 expression and its compatibility with siRNA transfection experiments (Konig et al., 2008).”</p><p>“HeLa cells were chosen based on their microscopy-conducive size and shape (large and flat) and their common use to study HIV-1 gene expression (Jouvenet et al., 2008; Pocock et al., 2016).”</p><p>“It should be noted, the HyPR-MS interactome determination, siRNA knockdown screen and RNA-protein co-localization and expression analysis were completed using three different cell lines; Jurkat, 293T, and HeLa, respectively. […] To overcome some of these limitations, future work will include conducting similar screens in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and monocytes/macrophages using more relevant R5-tropic HIV-1 founder strains for elucidation of innate immune signaling host factors involved in HIV-1 RNA biology.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 2B shows that the largest group of cellular proteins that preferentially interact with US viral transcripts belong to carboxylic acid and coenzyme metabolic pathways. This is an interesting observation that the authors did not validate or discuss a in terms of a potential virological function. Although we will not require it, the authors could consider performing similar KO/FISH experiments to better understand how a subset of those metabolic enzymes regulate HIV gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point and we have added text to both the Results and Discussion sections (see below) that better highlight these findings and briefly discuss what has recently been discovered with regards to metabolic proteins having functions as RNA-binding proteins. We have also now added these proteins in Figure 4C so that readers can readily interrogate the lists. We agree that pursuing this category of proteins for further validation and functional analysis will be an important future avenue of study.</p><p>“…and several have known roles in the carboxylic acid metabolic process, a GO term also over-represented in the US RNA interactome (Figure 2C, Figure 2—source data 2).”</p><p>“Notably, many metabolic and enzymatic proteins were identified as US HIV RNA interactors (Figure 2B and C). […] This suggests that metabolic proteins may play an important role in HIV gene expression, but further investigation is need to decipher the unique role of each.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
