In diseased skeletal muscle, it would be therapeutically advantageous to replace defective MuSCs, or rejuvenate them with drugs to enhance their self-renewal and ensure long-term regenerative potential. One limitation of the replacement approach has been the inability to efficiently expand MuSCs ex vivo, while maintaining their stemness and engraftment abilities. Herein, we show that inhibition of type I protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) with MS023 increases the proliferative capacity of ex vivo cultured MuSCs. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of ex vivo cultured MuSCs revealed the emergence of subpopulations in MS023-treated cells which are defined by elevated Pax7 expression and markers of MuSC quiescence, both features of enhanced self-renewal. Furthermore, the scRNAseq identified MS023-specific subpopulations to be metabolically altered with upregulated glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Transplantation of MuSCs treated with MS023 had a better ability to repopulate the MuSC niche and contributed efficiently to muscle regeneration following injury. Interestingly, the preclinical mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy had increased grip strength with MS023 treatment. Our findings show that inhibition of type I PRMTs increased the proliferation capabilities of MuSCs with altered cellular metabolism, while maintaining their stem-like properties such as self-renewal and engraftment potential.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>muscle stem cell</kwd><kwd>arginine methylation</kwd><kwd>type I PRMT</kwd><kwd>MS023</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>duchenne muscular dystrophy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN-154303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dominici</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibition of type I PRMTs increases the proliferation capabilities of MuSCs with altered cellular metabolism, while maintaining their stem-like properties such as self-renewal and engraftment potential.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) reside on the periphery of muscle fibers in skeletal muscle and are activated following injury to drive muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lepper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>). Major challenges arise when attempting to manipulate MuSCs ex vivo. Purified MuSCs spontaneously differentiate upon ex vivo expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fu et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sacco et al., 2008</xref>), limiting the potential of CRISPR Cas9-based applications and stem cell engraftment therapy. It is known that ex vivo cultured MuSCs are vastly inferior at engrafting and contributing to muscle regeneration compared to freshly isolated MuSCs, indicating the importance of retaining stemness for MuSC engraftment and muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montarras et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sakai et al., 2017</xref>). Cell-intrinsic defects in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) prevent MuSCs from maintaining a proper balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, ultimately leading to depletion of regeneration-competent MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentzinger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dumont et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>MuSCs have metabolic flexibility that allows them to adapt to demands presented by their changing environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Relaix et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, metabolic signatures are strong contributors to the heterogeneity observed in isolated MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho and Doles, 2017</xref>). Several findings have indicated that the metabolic state of MuSCs is inextricably tied to their function and fate. Quiescent MuSCs predominantly rely on fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Machado et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ryall et al., 2015</xref>). While glycolysis remains low in quiescent cells, it is upregulated as MuSCs begin to proliferate following activation, representing a metabolic shift in activated MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">L’honoré et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ryall et al., 2015</xref>). The dynamic regulation of metabolic state during the transition from MuSC quiescence to proliferation therefore presents a unique avenue to regulate MuSC regenerative capacity.</p><p>There is growing evidence to suggest a role for the post-translational modification arginine methylation in muscle cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanc and Richard, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saber and Rudnicki, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">vanLieshout and Ljubicic, 2019</xref>). Arginine methylation is carried out by 9 protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu and Richard, 2021</xref>). PRMTs are classified according to their catalytic activity: type I enzymes (ex: PRMT1, PRMT2, PRMT3, CARM1, PRMT6 and PRMT8) catalyze arginine asymmetrical dimethylation (ADMA), type II enzymes (ex: PRMT5, PRMT9) catalyze arginine symmetrical dimethylation (SDMA), and the unique type III enzyme PRMT7 catalyzes arginine monomethylation (MMA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedford and Clarke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jain and Clarke, 2019</xref>). PRMTs methylate many cellular proteins including histones and are known epigenetic regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu and Richard, 2021</xref>).</p><p>PRMTs are known regulators of MuSCs. PRMT1-null mouse MuSCs are highly proliferative and can be expanded in culture, but are unable to terminate differentiation, leading to a severe muscle regeneration defect in vivo following muscle injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanc et al., 2017</xref>). CARM1 is a well-known transcriptional coactivator for nuclear receptors and p300/CPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedford and Clarke, 2009</xref>) and it is a mediator of skeletal muscle plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saber and Rudnicki, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">vanLieshout and Ljubicic, 2019</xref>). CARM1 methylates the myogenic transcription factor, PAX7, to complex with histone methyltransferase complex to allow the expression of myogenic transcription factor Myf5 during asymmetric stem cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kawabe et al., 2012</xref>). CARM1 regulates MuSCs metabolism by methylating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stouth et al., 2020</xref>). PRMT5 regulates MuSC proliferation by epigenetically downregulating expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 and deletion of PRMT5 in MuSCs blocks their expansion ex vivo and causes defects in muscle regeneration in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). PRMT7 functions in the myogenic process and is required for MuSC self-renewal and muscle regeneration, as deletion of PRMT7 in MuSCs leads to persistent p21 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanc et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Given the importance in maintaining MuSC stemness and the enhanced MuSC proliferation observed with PRMT1 deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanc et al., 2017</xref>), we aimed to determine whether the reversible inhibition of type I PRMTs using the MS023 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eram et al., 2016</xref>) would affect cellular metabolism and fulfil the requirements of generating a stem-like MuSC in culture with subsequent regenerative capabilities. Small molecule inhibitors of epigenetic regulators are a promising avenue to pursue in the treatment of muscle wasting diseases. Indeed, an inhibitor of Setd7-mediated lysine methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Judson et al., 2018</xref>), was shown to have beneficial effects on self-renewal and regeneration.</p><p>Herein, we show that MS023, an inhibitor of type I PRMTs, fulfiled the requirements of a reversible inhibitor which maintained the stemness of cultured MuSCs, while allowing for engraftment and regenerative capabilities. Although type I PRMTs have well-known indications as epigenetic modulators, we show that targeting type I PRMTs promoted the proliferation of MuSCs and maintained their self-renewal and ability to engraft.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Type I PRMT inhibitor MS023 enhances self-renewal and in vitro expansion of MuSCs</title><p>We isolated single muscle fibers from 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice, cultured them in vitro with MS023 or vehicle (DMSO) for 48 hr, and stained them for the myogenic transcription factor Pax7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seale et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Soleimani et al., 2012</xref>), and the proliferation marker ki67. The number of Pax7<sup>+</sup>/ki67<sup>+</sup> cells increased significantly in the presence of MS023 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eram et al., 2016</xref>) for 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). We observed a significant increase in the number of clusters with 3 or more cells with MS023 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), as observed for PRMT1-deficient MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanc et al., 2017</xref>). Treatment with a specific CARM1 inhibitor TP-064 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakayama et al., 2018</xref>) over the course of 6 days did not increase MuSC cell number, ruling out that MS023 increased proliferation was mediated by CARM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, we investigated the expression of other type I PRMTs from publicly available single cell RNAseq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oprescu et al., 2020</xref>), which were performed on skeletal muscle at different time points post-cardiotoxin injury (uninjured, and 0.5, 2, 3.5, 5, 10, and 21 days post-injury). Their findings show that PRMT1 is by far the most expressed type I PRMT in MuSCs at every time point tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). CARM1 (PRMT4) is expressed at high level in a small/moderate subset of cells, especially during regeneration. PRMT6 is expressed at low level in a small proportion of cells, while PRMT8 expression was not detected. These findings show that PRMT1 is the predominant type I PRMT1 in MuSCs. Taken together, these data show that type I PRMT inhibition causes in vitro MuSC expansion and is likely mediated by the inhibition of PRMT1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Enhanced self-renewal of MS023-treated MuSCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Muscle fibers cultured for 48 hr with MS023 or DMSO.

Interestingly, MS023 treatment restricted the proportion of committed Pax7<sup>-</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup> cells, while expanding the proportion of activated and cycling cells (Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>).</p><p>MuSCs spontaneously differentiate into non-cycling myoblasts and lose their stemness in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montarras et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ryall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sacco et al., 2008</xref>). The enhanced proliferation of MuSCs observed with type I PRMT inhibition on muscle fibers prompted us to examine whether similar effects could be achieved with FACS-purified MuSCs cultured in vitro. MuSCs incubated with MS023 for 48 hr had reduced ADMA containing proteins, as visualized by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and had increased proliferative capacity of MuSCs, as determined by ki67 expression by immunofluorescence and FACS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). These data are consistent with what was observed in muscle fiber-associated MuSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Importantly, immunofluorescence analysis of myogenic markers in cultured MuSCs revealed that MS023 treatment prevented initiation of differentiation, as indicated by the significantly reduced sub-population of committed Pax7<sup>-</sup>/MyoD<sup>+</sup> cells compared to control DMSO culture (13% vs 31%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Additionally, there was an increase in the proportion of cells that have retained their stemness by delaying expression of MyoD (Pax7<sup>+</sup>/MyoD<sup>-</sup>) in the MS023-treated samples compared to DMSO (40% vs 9%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>).

Therefore, the retention of a transcriptional signature indicating high levels of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in MS023-treated cells was unexpected.

We isolated MuSCs from C57BL/6 mice and seeded them onto matrigel-coated 96-well plates treated with 1 μM MS023 or DMSO for 48 hr (n=3 mice per treatment condition).

As further indicators of glycolysis, the growth media supernatant of d4 and d4MS023 cultured cells was analyzed using a Nova Biomedical Bioprofile 400 analyzer. As expected, d4MS023 cells had significantly higher levels of glucose uptake (measured as grams/liter per 10,000 cells, p=0.004). Additionally, the glycolytic byproduct lactate was present in higher concentrations d4MS023 media and was undetectable in the d4 media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Cells treated for 4 days were switched to differentiation media with the continued presence of DMSO or MS023. Washout cells were switched to differentiation media without DMSO or MS023.

These whole-body measurements as measured by tail biopsies show MS023 promotes the decrease of proteins with ADMA and a slight increase in proteins with SDMA. It is known that inhibition of type I PRMTs or PRMT1 deletion diminishes ADMA and increases SDMA due to substrate scavenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhar et al., 2013</xref>).

Additionally, endurance was tested by placing mice on a wire grid and inverting them so that the amount of time spent hanging could be recorded (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> for schematic). We observed a 50% increase in 2-paw grip strength (p=0.0113) and a 45% increase (p=0.0089) in 4-paw grip strength in the MS023-treated mice versus those that received vehicle at the 10-day time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

MS023-specific subpopulations harboured unique transcriptional signatures of stemness and energy metabolism. The MS023-treated MuSCs exhibited elevation of both glycolysis and OxPhos. Engrafted MuSCs treated with MS023 were efficient at regenerating injured muscle and at repopulating the niche. Treatment of the <italic>mdx</italic> mouse model of DMD with MS023 resulted in enhanced grip strength and force generation. Repression of type I PRMTs altered the metabolic state of cultured MuSCs while maintaining their capacity for self-renewal and to effectively participate in muscle regeneration. These findings suggest that type I PRMT inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for treating certain skeletal muscle diseases.</p><p>The ability to tailor energy metabolism to the specific demands of cell proliferation and differentiation is known as metabolic plasticity, and is required for maintaining tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Folmes et al., 2012</xref>). The transition from quiescence to proliferation is regulated by a shift from OxPhos to glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pala et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ryall et al., 2015</xref>). During MuSC quiescence, high levels of NAD +are generated by oxidative metabolism which in turn activates Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) to deacetylate and repress expression of differentiation genes required for the myogenic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ryall et al., 2015</xref>). The shift from OxPhos to glycolysis upon exit from quiescence results in reduced NAD +levels and subsequent activation of differentiation genes. Furthermore, it has been shown that entry to the process of terminal differentiation is mediated by the activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), marking a switch from glycolysis to OxPhos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hori et al., 2019</xref>). Another key player in metabolic plasticity in MuSCs is AMP kinase, a major energy sensor in the cell, regulating energy balance and metabolic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hardie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herzig and Shaw, 2018</xref>). Null alleles of AMPK have contributed to the understanding of its role in MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fu et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Theret et al., 2017</xref>). Activated AMPK stimulates autophagy, mitophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis, thus maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herzig and Shaw, 2018</xref>). Our data showed that inhibition of type I PRMTs in MuSCs stimulated the expression of autophagic markers (<italic>Atg5, Lamp1, Lamp2, Sqstm1</italic>) downstream targets of AMPK, however it remains to be determined whether AMPK is involved in MS023-treated cells.</p><p>PRMT1 has been shown to interact with AMPK in skeletal muscle during the early stages of muscle atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stouth et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, CARM1 directly methylates AMPK to regulate its activity during muscle response to denervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stouth et al., 2020</xref>). PRMT1 has also been shown to play a signaling role to regulate thermogenesis. PRMT1 acts through the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1αin human and mouse adipocytes to regulate thermogenic fat activation, and PRMT1-deficient mice were unable to induce the thermogenic program following cold exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qiao et al., 2019</xref>). Methylation of PGC-1αby PRMT1 was also shown to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and may regulate nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Teyssier et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, PRMT1-mediated methylation positively regulates the insulin receptor (IR)-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway which is required for glucose transport in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iwasaki and Yada, 2007</xref>). Overexpression of PRMT1 in the liver under hypoxic conditions causes hypermethylation of FoxO1 and increased translocation to the nucleus, resulting in reduced glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bayen et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, these findings indicate that PRMT1 methylates key regulators of cellular metabolism and highlight a crosstalk between metabolic effectors and type I PRMTs.</p><p>Treatment of MuSCs with MS023 resulted in metabolic reprogramming of MuSCs, supporting a role for type I PRMTs as metabolic regulators. In vitro, MS023 has been shown to inhibit several type I PRMTs at nanomolar (nM) concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eram et al., 2016</xref>). It is well-documented that PRMT1 is the major cellular type I enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pawlak et al., 2000</xref>) and this is why PRMT1, but not the other type I PRMTs are embryonic lethal in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guccione and Richard, 2019</xref>). The numerous published data <italic>in cellulo</italic> with MS023 are thus far only reproduced by PRMT1-deficiency by siRNA or knockout, suggesting that MS023 actions in vivo are predominantly mediated by inhibiting PRMT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Plotnikov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, PRMT1 is by far the most expressed type I PRMT in MuSCs at every time point tested in skeletal muscle post-cardiotoxin injury (uninjured, and 0.5, 2, 3.5, 5, 10, 21 days post-injury) by single cell RNAseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oprescu et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the effects of MS023 on MuSCs are most likely mediated by inhibition of PRMT1.</p><p>scRNAseq analysis of MS023-treated MuSCs identified new transitional clusters which harboured transcriptional signatures of stemness and energy metabolism. DMSO clusters M1/M2/M4 and MS023 clusters M3/M5 were both enriched for proliferation markers (<italic>Cdk1, Mki67</italic>), and M3/M5 also uniquely harboured elevated metabolic genes including components of the electron transport chain (<italic>Atp5k, Cox5a, Ndufa2</italic>) and components of glycolysis (<italic>Eno1, Gapdh</italic>). The simultaneous elevation of both glycolytic and OxPhos components in MS023 subpopulations likely contributes to the enhanced proliferation phenotype. MuSC subpopulations have been characterized at the single-cell level during muscle regeneration, revealing regulatory mechanisms that guide the transition from quiescence to activation, proliferation, and differentiation. A general progressive elevation of metabolic enzyme expression has been noted from low levels in MuSCs isolated from uninjured muscle, to slightly elevated levels in MuSCs isolated from acutely injured muscle (60 hr after injury), to the highest levels in cultured proliferating MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dell’Orso et al., 2019</xref>). A more in-depth analysis of MuSC subpopulations throughout muscle regeneration investigated additional time points after injury (2, 5, and 7 days) and generated a hierarchical continuum model of MuSCs throughout the regeneration process, with a focus on ligand-receptor cell communication networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Micheli et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, analysis of young and aged MuSCs revealed that, while they have similar transcriptional signatures, aged MuSCs display delayed activation state dynamics when exiting quiescence, thus preventing them from entering the differentiation program as efficiently as young MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kimmel et al., 2020</xref>). It has been previously reported that the quiescent MuSCs captured by scRNAseq exist in two groups, one 'quiescent' and one 'early activation', wherein the early activation group highly expresses <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Jun</italic> while down-regulating <italic>Hox</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van den Brink et al., 2017</xref>). Our Q1 and Q2 clusters are in alignment with these two states (Q1 - quiescence; Q2 - early activation), and bare transcriptional similarities to our MS023-specific clusters M3 and M5, such as upregulated <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Jun</italic>, as well as high levels of <italic>Pax7</italic>. Notably, capture of rare transient MuSC states remains difficult due to poor sampling or limited cell number. To overcome these issues, one study evaluated 365,000 single cells/nuclei from over 100 combined datasets, allowing for the characterization of short-lived MuSC subpopulations that emerge throughout the myogenic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McKellar et al., 2021</xref>). We show that MS023 treatment generates subpopulations of self-renewing MuSCs that have not been previously identified, suggesting that transient cell states may be also amplified through treatment with epigenetic inhibitors, thus facilitating a more in-depth understanding of their function and contributions to muscle regeneration.</p><p>PRMTs are known as epigenetic regulators by methylating histones directly and by serving as coactivators/repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu and Richard, 2021</xref>). We now show MuSC cells treated with type I PRMT inhibitors have altered metabolism favouring proliferation and self-renewal, however, the mechanism whether epigenetic, regulating of mRNA splicing or a signaling cascade remains to be defined. It has been shown that inhibition of the epigenetic modulator <italic>Setd7</italic> enhances the proliferation of cultured MuSCs, while retaining their stemness by preventing transport of β-catenin into the nucleus, thereby failing to activate the differentiation program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Judson et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that inhibiting methyltransferases can affect MuSC fate and perhaps both lysine (Setd7) and arginine (MS023) inhibitors might provide a more favorable combination to promote the expansion of MuSCs, while maintaining their stem-cell-like properties.</p><p>We report heightened engraftment capabilities of MS023-treated MuSCs accompanied by high Pax7 expression levels. It has been shown that freshly isolated MuSCs retain high Pax7 expression levels and are superior at engrafting compared to cultured MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montarras et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sacco et al., 2008</xref>). Generating stable Pax7 expression in myogenic precursor cells with lentiviral delivery of transgenes is a strategy for enhancing engraftment potential following ex vivo expansion of MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2021</xref>), although this approach may be hampered by safety concerns. Therefore, we have identified an additional strategy for increasing Pax7 expression and improving engraftment efficiency and self-renewal of ex vivo expanded MuSCs through inhibition of type I PRMTs. Furthermore, our findings show that injection of MS023 in the dystrophic mouse <italic>mdx</italic> model led to enhanced muscle strength with effects lasting up to 30 days. We cannot exclude if the effect of MS023 was mediated by an expansion of the MuSC pool or by an effect on other cell types, such as a direct impact on the myofibers. The goal of this experiment was to provide a therapeutic perspective for the possible use of type I PRMT inhibitor for the treatment of DMD. Our findings suggest that type I PRMT inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for treating certain skeletal muscle diseases. For instance, to improve the efficacy of autologous cell therapy, the dystrophin-deficient MuSCs collected from DMD patient and corrected by CRISPR prime editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Happi Mbakam et al., 2022</xref>) could be treated with MS023 to maintain their stemness and enhance their cell engraftment capacity.</p><p>In sum, our findings show that inhibition of type I PRMTs increased the proliferation capabilities of MuSCs with altered cellular metabolism, while maintaining their stem-like properties such as self-renewal and engraftment potential.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 J (Jackson Laboratory 000664) were the wild type mice used for MuSC FACS purification for scRNAseq, muscle fiber isolation, and for all other in vitro experiments.</p><p>β-Actin GFP mice (C57BL/6-Tg(CAG-EGFP)10 sb/J, Jackson Laboratory 003291) were used to obtain GFP<sup>+</sup> MuSCs for further implantation experiments.

Fiber-associated satellite cells were then visualized on a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood NY), and resulting images were analyzed using Zeiss' ZEN Digital imaging suite software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>scRNAseq sample preparation and computational analysis</title><p>Each biological replicate for the scRNAseq corresponded to one C57BL/6 mouse. The purified MuSCs were cultured in Ham’s F10 (Gibco) with 20% FBS (HyClone), 2.5 ng/mL human recombinant bFGF (Gibco), 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Wisent Inc) with 0.033% DMSO or 1 μM MS023 in 0.033% DMSO. The medium was changed on day 2 and day 4 of culturing. The purified MuSCs from each replicate were stained for viability with calcein-AM and ethidium-homodimer1 (P/ N L3224 Thermo Fisher Scientific). scRNA libraries were generated using the GemCode Single- Cell Instrument (10 x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) and Single Cell 3’ Library &amp; Gel Bead Kit v2 and ChIP Kit (P/N 120236 P/N 120237 10 x Genomics). The sequencing ready libraries were purified with SPRIselect, quality controlled for sized distribution and yield (LabChip GX Perkin Elmer), and quantified using qPCR (KAPA Biosystems Library Quantification Kit for Illumina platforms P/N KK4824) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Couturier et al., 2020</xref>). Libraries were subsequently shipped and sequenced using Illumina NovaSeq6000 at IGM Genomics Center, UCSD, San Diego, CA. Cell barcodes and UMI (unique molecular identifiers) barcodes were demultiplexed and paired-end reads were first aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using the Cell Ranger software v3.1.0 (10X Genomics, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger">https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger</ext-link>). Pre-processing was then carried out with the Seurat v3.2.0 R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butler et al., 2018</xref>). Genes detected in less than 3 cells as well as cells containing less than 200 genes detected were removed. Cells were further filtered out for each sample based on the distribution of genes detected as well as the percentage of mitochondrial counts to balance the number of cells per sample to ~4000, and the raw count matrices of all samples were merged. Read counts for each cell were then normalized by the cell total, multiplied by 10,000 and natural-log transformed. The expression of the 2000 genes with highest cell-to-cell variation was standardized and the heterogeneity associated with mitochondrial contamination was regressed out. Principal component analysis was performed on the scaled data and the top 10 principal components were used to construct a K-nearest neighbor cell graph. Clustering of cells was carried out through the Louvain algorithm with the granularity parameter set to 0.4 and visualized with the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becht et al., 2018</xref>) dimensional reduction technique using the Scanpy v1.5.2 python module (). Cluster biomarkers were identified using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Cell trajectories across pseudotime were analyzed by the Monocle v2.16.0 R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>). Cell progress was defined by differentially expressed genes based on the clusters identified by Seurat. The dimensionality of the data was reduced through the Discriminative Dimensionality Reduction with Trees (DDRTree) algorithm to two dimensions and the cells were ordered along the trajectory according to pseudotime. Genes with branch-dependent expression were identified through the branched expression analysis modeling (BEAM) test. RNA velocity analysis was performed by the scVelo v0.2.2 python module (). Spliced and unspliced mRNAs were first distinguished through the velocyto v0.17.17 python module (). Velocities representing the direction and speed of cell motion were then computed and projected onto the UMAP embedding.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification measurements</title><p>Oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were measured using a Seahorse XFe96 Flux Analyzer and analyzed with Wave 2.6.0 software (Agilent Technologies). FACS sorted muscle stem cells were seeded in a matrigel-coated 96-well plate and cultured with MS023 or DMSO for 48 hr. Cells were incubated in MitoStress test assay media (DMEM 5030 media, 10 mM glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine, PH7.4) or GlycoStress test assay media (DMEM 5030 media, 2 mM glutamine, pH 7.4) 1 hr prior to OCR and ECAR measurements, respectively. Oligomycin (3 mM, Sigma-Aldrich), carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone (FCCP; 1 mM, Abcam) and rotenone-antimycin A (RAA; 2.5 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) were added to cells to measure OCR parameters while glucose (10 mM, Sigma-Aldrich), Oligomycin (1 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) and 2-DG (100 mM) were used to measure ECAR parameters. Following the assay, cells were stained with crystal violet and nuclei were counted in each well for normalization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>MuSC engraftment and muscle histology</title><p>Primary MuSCs were FACS-purified from donor GFP mice and cultured with MS023 or DMSO for 5 days. Cells were then trypsinized, resuspended in 1 X PBS, and pelleted for 10 min at 1800 RPM. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 1 X PBS and counted using a haemocytometer. A total of 15,000 cells from each condition were then injected into the TA muscle of wild type mice. Recipient mice were also injected with 50 μl of 10 μM cardiotoxin (CTX) 24 h prior to MuSC engraftment to induce muscle regeneration. Recipient mice were sacrificed 3 weeks after CTX injection, and the TA muscles were dissected and fixed in 2% PFA at 4 °C for 16 hr. Fixed TA muscles were then embedded in OCT and frozen prior to cryosectioning onto a glass microscope slide. Resulting tissue sections were permeabilized for 12 min with 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.125 M glycine in PBS at RT. Blocking followed with M.O.M blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories) for 1 hr at RT. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking reagent to detect Pax7 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, 1:10) and laminin (Sigma, 1:50). After 16 hr incubation at 4 °C, sections were washed 3 times with 1 X PBS for 10 min. Secondary antibody (AlexaFluor anti-mouse or anti-rabbit 488 nm or 568 nm) was used at a dilution of 1:400 in blocking reagent for 45 min in the dark at RT. Sections were then washed three times for 10 min with 1 X PBS. Tissue sections were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (ThermoFisher Scientific) and covered with a coverslip. Visualization was performed on a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood NY), and resulting images were analyzed using Zeiss' ZEN Digital imaging suite software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>MS023 injection in mdx mice</title><p>12-week-old <italic>mdx</italic> mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 80 mg/kg MS023 (Sigma) dissolved in 50 μl N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 200 μl Captisol, 200 μl polyethylene glycol 400 and 550 μl PBS once per day for three consecutive days. As control, 12-week-old mice received vehicle (50 μl N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 200 μl Captisol, 200 μl polyethylene glycol 400 in 550 μl PBS) alone. Tail pieces were collected 48 h after the last injection and lysed for western blot analysis with anti-ADMA and anti-SDMA and β-actin antibodies. Grip strength and hanging test measurements were taken at 10 days after the final injection. Twenty-nine days after the final injection, mice were anesthetized and sacrificed for endpoint ex vivo force measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Grip strength measurements and hanging test</title><p>Grip strength was measured for the front two paws and for all four limbs using a Bioseb Grip Strength Test instrument. Each mouse was placed on the rod (2 paws) or mesh (4 paws) and pulled from the tail three times with 1 min rest between trials. The highest measurement was retained for subsequent analysis. To assess endurance, mice were placed on a plastic mesh taped to a hollow cylinder. The cylinder was slowly inverted over soft bedding to allow mice to grip the mesh, and the amount of time each mouse remined suspended before falling onto the bedding was recorded 3 times with 2 min rest between trials. The longest time measurement was retained for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Ex vivo force measurements of mdx mice</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg). Proximal and distal tendons of the EDL were attached with silk suture (3.0) and the muscle was carefully isolated and placed in a buffered physiological solution (Krebs-Ringer supplemented with glucose and bubbling carbogen gas) maintained at 25 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dort et al., 2021</xref>). The distal tendon of the EDL muscle was attached to the electrode, and the proximal tendon was attached to the force lever arm (300C-LR dual-mode lever; Aurora Scientific, Canada). Muscle length was adjusted to find the optimal muscle length (L<sub>0</sub>) at which it generates the maximum isometric twitch tension. The EDL muscle was allowed to equilibrate in the contractile bath for 10 min equilibration prior the contractile measurement. Muscle was stimulated at different frequencies (10, 25, 50, 80, 100, 150 Hz), with 2 min rest between each stimulation, to obtain a force-frequency curve. Thereafter, muscle length and weight were measured. Specific muscle force (N/cm<sup>2</sup>) was determined using the following formula: (force (N) x fiber length (0.44 x L<sub>0</sub> for the EDL muscle) x muscle density (1.06 g/cm<sup>3</sup>))/muscle mass (g).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Project administration, Formal analysis, Writing - review and editing, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The experiments with the Dmdmdx mice were performed at Sainte-Justine and were approved by the CHU Sainte-Justine Research Ethics Committee and performed in compliance with the Comité Institutionnel des Bonnes Pratiques Animales en Recherche (CIBPAR; approval number 2020-2668) in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines.

Importantly, once the inhibitor is removed these stem cells differentiate &quot;normally&quot;. This advance will likely facilitate CRISPR-based screening approaches and stem cell engraftment therapy. Furthermore, they show that when a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy is treated with these same inhibitors these mice rather rapidly gain grip strength, demonstrating the therapeutic value of these findings.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- Previous studies from the same group have shown that the conditional ablation of PRMT1 in MSCs results in the expansion of this cell type, but this expanded PRMT1-null MSC pool cannot terminate the myogenic differentiation program. This raises the question of whether PRMT1 small molecule inhibition of MSCs will also facilitate the expansion of these cells, and if the removal of the inhibitor after expansion will result in a large functional pool of MSCs, which could then be used for both in vitro and in vivo studies.</p><p>- Using a combination of muscle fiber culture, myoblast culture, and single-cell RNA-seq, this is indeed what they show.</p><p>- They also perform two types of in vivo experiments to validate their cell culture findings; (1) MSCs expanded under the treatment of MS023 were washed clean of the inhibitor and engrafted into the tibialis anterior muscle. These cells were marked with GFP to allow efficient tracking. Mice receiving the MS023-treated MSCs produced more than double the mature GFP+ muscle fibers than cells treated with DMSO. (2) A mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy displayed grip strength improvement after just one treatment of MS023.</p><p>- MS023 is a Type I PRMT inhibitor and thus can also target CARM1. CARM1 has been implicated in MSC function by the Rudnicki group. Importantly, they exclude a role for CARM1 in the expansion of MSC cell numbers by treatment with a very specific CARM1 inhibitor, TP064. Thus, indicating that PRMT1 inhibition is likely the main driver of this expansion phenotype.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84570.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this manuscript, Dominici et al. aim to determine whether the reversible inhibition of the type I protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT) would maintain the stemness of muscle stem cells in culture and enable subsequent regenerative capacities. They demonstrate that the type I PRMT inhibitor MS023 enhances self-renewal and in vitro expansion of muscle stem cells isolated from mice. Using a very rigorous single-cell RNA-sequencing approach, they further demonstrate that distinct sub-populations of cells emerge under type I PRMT inhibition and that these cells entered the differentiation program more efficiently. Moreover, they revealed a shift in metabolism in these cells, which they confirmed in vitro. Finally, they demonstrate that MS023 enhances muscle stem cell engraftment in vivo and that the direct injection of MS023 increases muscle strength in a mice model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p><p>This study will have a great impact on the field of stem cells and offer potential therapeutic avenues for diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84570.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Dominici et al studied the effects of the type I PRMT inhibitor MS023 on skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) and on muscle strength in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. The authors observed an enhanced proliferative capacity of cultured MuSCs with an increase of Pax7+/MyoD- cells. The observations are more or less in line with previous studies of the same group, describing reduced differentiation but enhanced proliferation of MuSCs after genetic inactivation of Prmt1. scRNA-seq identified different subpopulations of MuSCs, showing a shift to increased Pax7 expression and elevated oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis after treatment with MS023. Treatment of MuSC with MS023 during expansion in vitro enhanced engraftment of MuSCs and treatment of dystrophic mdx mice increased muscle strength.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript provides new insights into the beneficial effects of the type I PRMT inhibitor MS023 for skeletal muscle regeneration. The description of the MS023-induced transcriptional and metabolic changes in MuSC is interesting and the effects on MuSC transplantation and muscle strength are stunning. However, I have the following comments and concerns:</p><p>* Control experiments with the TP-064 inhibitor (previously shown to be specific for CARM1/PRMT4) were not done for the transplantation and muscle strength experiments, which is a clear shortcoming in my view. Since MS023 is a non-selective inhibitor of type I PRMTs with comparable IC50 values for PRMT1 and PRMT4 (CARM1), and lower IC50 values for PRMT6 and PRMT8, it is still not clear whether the enhanced transplantation efficiency and the increased muscle strength is indeed only caused by inhibition of PRMT1. The authors justify their statements by pointing out that gene expression of Prmt1 is highest among the type I PRMTs in MuSCs, which is a rather poor argument, as seen by the strong effects caused by the inactivation of PRMT4.</p><p>* Clustering of the M1-M5 subpopulations. I expressed my concern about the separation of the subclusters, which appear more or less in the same cloud. The authors answered that each cluster has some genes, which are only expressed in the respective cluster. I do not doubt this observation but apparently, the transcriptional differences are minor, otherwise one would have seen a much better separation of the subpopulations.</p><p>* The authors have not done additional experiments but simply toned-down the statements about the relevance of the proposed &quot;metabolic reprogramming&quot; of MuSC by the type I PRMT inhibitor MS023, which was a major conclusion in the original submission. Again, the changes in the expression of metabolically relevant genes upon MS023 treatment are interesting and should be analyzed in respect to causality. It is not a solution to more or less disabandon the original hypothesis by changing the wording.</p><p>* I specifically asked the authors to check whether the dramatic six-fold increase of MuSC engraftment after MS023 treatment really goes along with the incorporation of transplanted MuSC into the MuSC niche, raising concerns that a huge share of the transplanted cells may linger around in the interstitium. It should be very easy to identify and quantify transplanted MuSC outside and inside the basal lamina. Instead of doing the requested experiment, the authors argue about suppression of endogenous MuSC competition by irradiation, at the same time admitting that several GFP-negative fibers have formed.</p><p>* I expressed my doubts that a 3-day treatment with MS023 is sufficient to dramatically enhance muscle function in mdx mice via &quot;improvement&quot; of the MuSC population, as reported by the authors, even 30 days after administration of MS023. It seems much more likely that MS023 exerts additional effects that are responsible for the dramatic improvement of muscle function in mdx mice. I maintain my view that this needs to be interrogated more carefully since the improvement of muscle function of dystrophic mice is a central point of the study. It has to be made clear whether this is really due to &quot;improved&quot; functions of MuSC. Many other processes might be involved or responsible for the effect (e.g. impact on inflammation?).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84570.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response:</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dominici</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Villarreal</surname><given-names>Oscar D</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dort</surname><given-names>Junio</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Heckel</surname><given-names>Emilie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yu Chang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ragoussis</surname><given-names>Ioannis</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Joyal</surname><given-names>Jean-Sebastien</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dumont</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Richard</surname><given-names>Stéphane</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors' response to the original reviews.</p><p>We’d like to thank the three reviewers for reviewing in depth our work and providing insightful comments and suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. The evidence that MS023 is actually working in vivo in their last experiment (Fig 6) needs to be strengthened. This could be due to the timing of the experiment. Tail tips were collected 48 h after the final injection and analyzed by Western for ADMA and SDMA levels. They do see subtle changes, in the right directions, of SDMA and ADMA (but these changes are really not very obvious). Perhaps the inhibitor has already been largely metabolized two days after injection. Have they looked at MMA levels?</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified the ADMA and SDMA levels of Fig. S6. We have not measured MMA levels. The text has been edited as follows:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“The average ADMA relative expression was 0.95 for vehicle treated mice and 0.83 for MS023 treated mice (p &lt; 0.00041). The average SDMA relative expression was 0.92 for vehicle treated mice and 0.94 for MS023 treated mice (p &lt; 0.17). These whole-body measurements as measured by tail biopsies show MS023 promotes the decrease of proteins with ADMA and a slight increase in proteins with SDMA. It is known that inhibition of type I PRMTs or PRMT1 deletion diminishes ADMA and increases SDMA due to substrate scavenging (Dhar et al, 2013).”</p><p>2. The authors need to explain why they would expect an increase in SDMA levels in these mice after MS023-treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the text as follows:</p><p>“It is known that inhibition of type I PRMTs or PRMT1 deletion diminishes ADMA and increases SDMA due to substrate scavenging (Dhar et al, 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In the discussion, it would be valuable to address the types of CRISPR-screens that could be performed in these MS023-expanded MSCs. They mention this as a benefit in the introduction, but to expand on this idea in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The idea here was not necessarily to perform a CRISPR screen on the MS023-treated cells (although it is an interesting idea), but rather to correct the genetic mutation by CRISPR-Cas9 to enhance the success of genetically corrected autologous cell transplantation. The addition of MS023 to MuSC in vitro would allow to expand the cells while maintaining their self-renewal potential, thereby providing the opportunity to correct the mutation on the dystrophin gene using technologies such as CRISPR prime editing (Mbakam et al., 2022 Mol Ther Nucleic Acids 30:272-285). Our results demonstrating that MS023 enhances cell engraftment suggest that this method could be used to improve autologous cell transplantation efficiency. We have edited the text in the discussion as follows:</p><p>“Our findings suggest that type I PRMT inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for treating certain skeletal muscle diseases. For instance, to improve the efficacy of autologous cell therapy, the dystrophin-deficient MuSCs collected from DMD patient and corrected by CRISPR prime editing (Happi Mbakam et al, 2022) could be treated with MS023 to maintain their stemness and enhance their cell engraftment capacity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Also, could they address the potential value of MSC culture and expansion using a combination of SETD7 inhibition and PRMT1 inhibition?</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We have edited the text as follows:</p><p>“These findings suggest that inhibiting methyltransferases can affect MuSC fate and perhaps a combination of Setd7 and MS023 inhibitors would provide a more favorable combination to promote the expansion of MuSCs while maintaining their stem cell-like properties.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In figure 2 the authors show that upon removal of MS023, the cells differentiate more efficiently. In figure 5E-F they show that the mice that received MS023-treated cells had more GFP mature muscle fibers. However, in figure 5C-D these cells have the same capacities to terminally differentiate. This reviewer was wondering if these cells would differentiate faster? Have the authors look into this?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting point. Our in vitro experiments shown in Supplemental Figure S1 indicate that MS023-treated cells are actively more cycling (more ki67+ cells) and are less committed to differentiation (less Pax7-MyoD+ cells), which would suggest that they would need to exit the cell cycle and differentiate faster to reach the same fusion capacity after 3 days of differentiation without MS023. Future experiments with a time course including earlier time points will be needed to confirm if these cells differentiate faster.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. MS023 is a non-selective inhibitor of type I PRMTs. It has comparable IC50 values for PRMT1 and PRMT4 (CARM1), and lower IC50 values for PRMT6 and PRMT8. The authors argue that the cellular phenotype caused by MS023 is solely mediated via PRMT1, since the specific PRMT4-inhibitor TP-064 has no effects on MuSC expansion. TP-064 treatment was not used as a control for the transplantation and muscle strength measurement experiments. Are PRMT6 and PRMT8 expressed in MuSC and are thy inhibited by the applied concentrations of MS023? Kawabe et al reported that CARM1 methylates Pax7, thereby inducing Myf5 transcription during the asymmetric division of MuSC (PMID: 22863532). Is the expression of Myf5 reduced upon MS023 treatment? scRNAseq of MuSC 4-day after culture is too late to address this question, since the majority of the cells are already committed to differentiation. Staining for Myf5 using ex vivo cultured fibers or regenerating muscles in vivo should be used.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we mention throughout the text that MS023 is a type I PRMT inhibitor. We have edited the text as follows suggesting the effect are most likely mediated by inhibition of PRMT1 <italic>in vivo.</italic></p><p>“Treatment of MuSCs with MS023 resulted in metabolic reprogramming of MuSCs, supporting a role for type I PRMTs as metabolic regulators. In vitro, MS023 has been shown to inhibit several type I enzymes at nM concentrations (Eram et al., 2016). It is well-documented that PRMT1 is the major cellular type I enzyme (Pawlak et al, 2000) and this is why PRMT1, but not the other type I PRMTs are embryonic lethal in mice (Guccione &amp; Richard, 2019). The numerous published data in cellulo with MS023 are thus far only reproduced by PRMT1-deficiency by siRNA or knockout, suggesting that MS023 actions in vivo are predominantly mediated by inhibiting PRMT1 (Gao et al, 2019; Plotnikov et al, 2020; Wu et al, 2022; Zhu et al, 2019). Thus, the effects of MS023 on MuSCs are most likely mediated by inhibition of PRMT1.”</p><p>Moreover, we investigated the expression of other type I PRMTs as suggested by the reviewer. We investigated their expression from publicly available single cell RNAseq dataset (Oprescu SN et al, iScience 2020, 23:100993), which performed analysis on skeletal muscle at different time points post-cardiotoxin injury (uninjured, and 0.5, 2, 3.5, 5, 10, 21 days post-injury). The findings show that <italic>Prmt1</italic> is by far the most expressed type I PRMT in MuSCs at every time point tested. <italic>Carm1</italic> (<italic>Prmt4</italic>) is expressed at high level in a small/moderate subset of cells, especially during regeneration. <italic>Prmt6</italic> is expressed at low level in a small proportion of cells, while <italic>Prmt8</italic> expression was not detected. These findings are coherent with our observation that Prmt1 is the predominant type I Prmt in MuSCs, which further support our hypothesis that it is the main target of MS023. These findings were added in Suppl. Fig 1B.</p><p>The expression of Myf5 during asymmetric division is indeed well characterized on muscle fiber-associated MuSCs (Dumont et al., 2015 Nat Med 21:1455; Kawabe et al., 2012 Cell Stem Cell 11:333). As the reviewer states, the 4-day time point is too late to investigate Myf5 expression. Additionally, these cells were cultured ex-vivo and were not fiber-associated. Therefore, scRNAseq is not an ideal method to address the question of whether MS023 treatment modulates Myf5 expression, and further experiments would be required to examine Myf5 in an appropriate context (i.e. on ex-vivo cultured myofibers).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 2 is not very informative, while the second paragraph of the result parts is excessive and too complicated. The extensive description of differential gene expression in each potential subpopulation is neither very informative nor helpful to convince the reader that the M3/M5 population has acquired more stemness-like features due to the MS023 treatment. From my point of view, the data just reflect the increased proliferative capacity of MS023-treated cells with elevated cell cycle markers, ribosomal protein, and metabolic state. Do the M1-M5 populations show any different distribution along the trajectory? The authors need to show cell trajectories for each sample and cluster in Figure S3A. It is also imperative to present the distribution of signature genes for each individual cluster. Essentially, M1-M5 all located together in one cloud. What justifies segregation into different subclusters? The color code for the different clusters (including the trajectories) to allow better distinction.</p><p>MS023 treated MuSCs contain a subpopulation with higher Pax7 expression (Supplementary Figure S2F, S2G), which is consistent with the IF results in Figure 1 and emphasized in the abstract. Why are these data in the supplements and not in a main figure (e.g. in figure 2)?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the thoughtful and detailed comments on our single-cell data. Please see below for a response to each point:</p><p>To address the concern that the results section is excessive, our intention was to simply provide the reader with a descriptive overview of the identity of each subcluster that the software identified. In fact, to ensure clarity and conciseness, we elected to provide only the names of a select few cluster markers rather than list all of the significant cluster markers that were generated. We kindly refer the reviewer to Supplementary Table S1 for a more extensive list of markers.</p><p>In response to the reviewer’s comment: “The color code for the different clusters (including the trajectories) to allow better distinction,” we agree that colour-coding is helpful, please refer to Figure 2A for a colour-coded map of the clusters.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s question regarding what justifies segregation into different subclusters for M1-M5, refer to Supplementary Table S1 for a list of uniquely enriched markers for each cluster. This list was filtered to include marker genes that were present only in a given cluster, thus contributing to its uniqueness and explains why that cluster was identified as being distinct from another given cluster.</p><p>Lastly, since the elevated Pax7 levels in MS023-treated MuSCs was already presented and discussed thoroughly in Figure 1, we elected to avoid repetition in the main Figures and presented the ridge plots showing elevated Pax7 in the Supplementary Material for Figure 2</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The same group has reported previously that PRMT1-deficient MSCs show reduced expression of MyoD due to disruption of Eya1/Six1 recruitment to the MyoD promoter (PMID: 27849571). However, the scRNAseq result does reflect this finding. MyoD levels are not significantly changed in d4 MS023 compared with d4 (Supplementary figure S2G). The authors need to provide an explanation. Furthermore, the authors previously described that &quot;the majority of PRMT1-deficient MSCs repressed Pax7 expression at day 3 while being Ki67 positive (Fig. 5B). How does that fit to the current observations, which indicate an increase of Pax7+ cells after MS023 treatment? This discrepancy needs to be resolved.</p></disp-quote><p>While the scRNAseq does not show a reduction in overall MyoD expression in MS023-treated MUSCs, there is indeed a reduction in the proportion of MyoD+ myofiber-associated MuSCs (Figure 1C, 1D). Supplemental Figure S2G further shows a subpopulation in the d4MS023 group with lower MyoD expression that was not present in the d4 group, reflective of the findings in Figures 1C and 1D. Therefore, although the average expression was not shifted significantly with MS023, there was indeed a subpopulation of MuSCs with lower MyoD expression.</p><p>The reviewer additionally points out that Fig. 5B from a previous study (Blanc et al., 2017 MCB 37:e00457) performed by our group, shows that Pax7 expression was repressed at day 3 of culture in PRMT1-null MuSCs. However, this quantification was based on immunofluorescence staining where cells are marked positive or negative for Pax7 expression and does not look at the intensity of Pax7 expression levels. In our current study, we examine the expression levels of Pax7 in discrete subpopulations of MuSCs and found that there is a subpopulation of MuSCs that emerges with MS023 treatment that has higher Pax7 expression than untreated counterparts. Therefore, the results of the two experiments are not directly comparable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. I do have a major problem with the interpretation of the metabolic changes in MS023-treated MuSC. In the abstract, the authors wrote, &quot;These findings suggest that type I PRMT inhibition metabolically reprograms MuSCs resulting in improved self-renewal and muscle regeneration fitness.&quot; There is simply no causal evidence to support this claim, which is solely based on a correlation. If the authors want to maintain this claim they either need to stimulate OXPHOS and glycolysis by other means to see whether such a manipulation recapitulates the effects of MS023 or attenuate OXPHOS and glycolysis to see whether this abrogates the effects of MS023. To prove whether increased OXPHIS is a cause for improved self-renewal, the authors might simply co-treat MuSC with MS023 and an OXPHIS inhibitor and analyze consequences for the Pax7+/MyoD- population.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the excellent suggestions of experiments that would solidify a causal relationship between increased metabolism and increased self-renewal. We will certainly consider them for future studies. We agree that the relationship in the present study is correlative, and the text has been modified in the abstract as follows:</p><p>“Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of ex vivo cultured MuSCs revealed the emergence of subpopulations in MS023-treated cells which are defined by elevated Pax7 expression and markers of MuSC quiescence, both features of enhanced self-renewal. Furthermore, the scRNAseq identified MS023-specific subpopulations to be metabolically altered with upregulated glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Transplantation of MuSCs treated with MS023 had a better ability to repopulate the MuSC niche and contributed efficiently to muscle regeneration following injury. Interestingly, the preclinical mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy had increased bilateral grip strength 10 days after a single intraperitoneal dose of MS023. Our findings show that inhibition of type I PRMTs increased the proliferation capabilities of MuSCs with altered cellular metabolism, while maintaining their stem-like properties such as self-renewal and engraftment potential.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Ryall et al reported that MuSCs undergo a metabolic switch from fatty acid oxidation to glycolysis with reduced intracellular NAD+ levels and reduced activity of SIRT1, leading to elevated H4K16 acetylation. Here, both OXPHOS and glycolysis are increased after treatment of MuSC with MS023. Are the NAD+ and H4K16ac levels changed in MS023-treated MuSC?</p></disp-quote><p>This is another excellent study that would help to support a causal relationship between MS023 treatment and increase OXPHOS and glycolysis and could certainly be addressed in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Ryall et al.'s results, there was no difference in the basal mitochondrial OCR between freshly isolated MuSCs and cultured MuSCs. Importantly, stimulation of OXPHOS will increase ROS concentration, resulting in premature differentiation of MuSC (PMID: 30106373). Furthermore, increased ROS levels will most likely enhance DNA damage rather than improve self-renewal. The authors have to address these issues and also monitor ROS and DNA damage levels.</p></disp-quote><p>The lack of cell death upon treatment with MS023 in the present study would indicate that there is no major ROS-induced DNA damage occurring. Additionally, the propensity of MS023-treated MuSCs to retain their stemness while in long-term culture (Supplemental figure S1E) would indicate that in this context, premature differentiation is not a concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors used FACS-analysis of MuSCs three weeks after transplantation to demonstrate that MS023 treatment enables better engraftment into the MuSC niche. The six-fold increase of transplanted cells in the MuSC niche is difficult to understand, Why shall transplanted cells compete so efficiently with endogenous MuSC for repopulation of the niche? Is it possible that some of the transplanted MuSC are still lingering within the interstitium and erroneously counted as bona fide MuSC? The authors have to determine the localization of transplanted MuSC. Are all transplanted cells indeed situated in the proper niche or are they also present outside the basal lamina of muscle fibers?</p></disp-quote><p>The hindlimbs which received the engraftment were irradiated 24h prior to engraftment, therefore the ability of endogenous MuSCs to compete is compromised. Additionally, Figure 5E shows that the regenerated muscle indeed has GFP negative fibers that would have been generated from endogenous MuSCs, indicating that MS023-treated MuSCs did not fully outcompete endogenous MuSCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The authors reported that an only 3-day treatment with MS023 is sufficient to dramatically improve muscle function in mdx mice even 30 days later, which is hard to swallow. What is the evidence that such strong effects are primarily mediated by stimulation of MuSC expansion? Are there other pathways or cells that respond to MS023 treatment and stimulate muscle strength? To support the claim of a 'better' stem cell function as the major cause for MS023-dependent stimulation of muscle strength in mdx mice, the authors need to determine the total number of Pax7+ cells, Pax7+/Ki67+, Pax7+/MyoD+, Pax7+/MyoD-, Pax7-/MyoD+ and myonuclei. It is also absolutely mandatory to include wildtype controls in the muscle strength measurements. Does MS023 treatment also increase muscle strength in wild-type controls?</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We cannot exclude if the effect is mediated by an expansion of the MuSC pool or by an effect on other cell types, such as a direct impact on the myofibers. The manuscript has been modified to include the following text:</p><p>“Furthermore, our findings show that injection of MS023 in the dystrophic mouse model mdx led to enhanced muscle strength with effects lasting up to 30 days. We cannot exclude if the effect of MS023 was mediated by an expansion of the MuSC pool or by an effect on other cell types, such as a direct impact on the myofibers. The goal of this experiment was to provide a therapeutic perspective for the possible use of type I PRMT inhibitor for the treatment of DMD.”</p><p>The goal of this figure was to provide a therapeutic perspective for the use of type I PRMT inhibitor for the treatment of DMD. Muscle wasting/weakness in DMD is a complex and multifactorial process (e.g., myofiber fragility, MuSC defects, chronic inflammation, fibrofatty accumulation). If MS023 can target multiple aspects of the physiopathology of the disease it would increase its therapeutic applicability. Further studies will be needed to determine the exact mechanism by which MS023 mediate its beneficial effect. These future studies could include the use of wild type control, as the reviewer suggests, to investigate the role of MS023 in a non-muscle degenerative context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Ideally, a genetic inactivation-reactivation of PRMT1 should be done to validate the results with MS023 and to make sure that indeed the transient inhibition of PRMT1 is responsible for the beneficial effects of MS023. Of course, this would be a major effort when done in genetically manipulated mice and therefore is not adequate to ask for. However, it should be possible to use PRMT1-deficient MuSC, which the authors have in hand, and re-express PRMT1 in these cells with an AAV or a lentivirus.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that genetic ablation of PRMT1 is a key experiment to validate MS023 results. Please refer to previous work from our group, which shows that PRMT1-KO MuSCs have an enhanced self-renewal phenotype (Blanc et al., 2017 MCB 37:e00457), similar to what was observed in the present study with MS023 treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Some claims are overstated and/or to aggressive. E.g.: &quot;Therefore, through repression of type I PRMTs with MS023, we have reprogramed MuSCs to acquire a unique and previously uncharacterized identity.&quot; I do not see clear evidence that MS023 treatment 'reprograms' MuSC to a 'unique identity'. The observed changes are in large parts compatible with a simple stimulation of proliferation.</p></disp-quote><p>The unique finding in our data is that treatment with MS023 resulted in a shift in identity as compared to the DMSO-treated proliferating MuSCs (M1, M2 and M4), creating transcriptionally distinct M3 and M5 clusters. M3 and M5 had elevated markers for metabolism (E.g. Eno1, Atp5k, etc) and early activation (E.g. Fos, Jun), while the untreated MuSCs in clusters M1, M2 and M4 did not. Furthermore, M3 and M5 had higher baseline levels of Pax7 expression when compared to untreated cells. Together, these findings describe a transitional subpopulation of MuSCs unique to MS023 treatment which not only harbour stem like/early activation markers Pax7, Fos and Jun, but also elevated proliferative markers related to cell cycle and energy metabolism. This particular combination of characteristics is unique to the MS023-treated MuSCs, thus identifying a unique subtype of MuSC identity. In accordance with our scRNAseq data, we validated experimentally that MS023-treated cells have higher energy metabolism and increased self-renewal potential, thereby confirming that the unique transcriptomic signature of these cells also lead to a different cell fate decision.</p></body></sub-article></article>
