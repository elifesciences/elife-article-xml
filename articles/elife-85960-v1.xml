The regulation of these traits often requires precise control of hormone levels across diverse timescales. However, fine tuning circulating hormones in-vivo has traditionally been experimentally challenging. Here, using the naturally short-lived turquoise killifish (<italic>N. furzeri</italic>), we describe a high-throughput platform that combines loss- and gain-of-function of peptide hormones. Mutation of three primary pituitary hormones, growth hormone (<italic>gh1</italic>), follicle stimulating hormone (<italic>fshb</italic>), and thyroid stimulating hormone (<italic>tshb</italic>), alters somatic growth and reproduction. Thus, suggesting that while the killifish undergoes extremely rapid growth and maturity, it still relies on vertebrate-conserved genetic networks. As the next stage, we developed a gain-of-function vector system in which a hormone is tagged using a self-cleavable fluorescent reporter, and ectopically expressed in-vivo through intramuscular electroporation. Following a single electroporation, phenotypes, such as reproduction, are stably rescued for several months. Notably, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by using multiplexing, dose-dependent, and doxycycline-inducible systems to achieve tunable and reversible expression. In summary, this method is relatively high-throughput, and facilitates large-scale interrogation of life-history strategies in fish. Ultimately, this approach could be adapted for modifying aquaculture species and exploring pro-longevity interventions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In humans and other vertebrates, a pea-size gland at the base of the brain called the pituitary gland, produces many hormones that regulate how individuals grow, reproduce, and age. Three of the most prominent hormones are known as the growth hormone, the follicle-stimulating hormone, and the thyroid-stimulating hormone.</p><p>It is important that the body precisely controls the levels of these hormones throughout an individual’s life. One way researchers can investigate how hormones and other molecules work is to artificially alter the levels of the molecules in living animals. However, this has proved to be technically challenging and time-consuming for pituitary gland hormones.</p><p>Moses et al. studied the growth hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone in the turquoise killifish, a small fish that grows and matures more rapidly than any other vertebrate research model. The experiments revealed that mutant fish lacking one of the three primary pituitary hormones were smaller, took longer to reach maturity, or were completely sterile. This suggests these three hormones play a similar role in killifish as they do in other vertebrates.</p><p>The team then developed a new experimental platform to precisely control the levels of the three hormones in killifish. Genes encoding individual hormones were expressed in the muscles of the mutant fish, effectively making the muscles a ‘factory’ for producing that hormone. Treating mutant fish this way once was enough to restore growth and to fully return reproduction to normal levels for several months. Moses et al. also demonstrated that it is possible to use this platform to express more than one hormone gene at a time and to use drugs to switch hormone production on and off in a reversible manner. For example, this reversible approach made it possible to effectively adjust fertility levels.</p><p>The new platform developed in this work could be adapted for modifying a variety of traits in animals to explore how they impact health and longevity. In the future, it may also have other applications, such as optimizing how farmed fish grow and reproduce and regulating hormone levels in human patients with hormone imbalances.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nothobranchius furzeri</kwd><kwd>peptide hormones</kwd><kwd>somatic

life-history events, including growth, reproduction, metabolism, and aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In many cases, regulation of these traits requires precise control of hormone levels over a diverse range of temporal scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>). While genetic perturbations of pituitary hormones have been instrumental in understanding their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu and Lin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2019</xref>), experimental approaches primarily depend on whole-body loss-of-function. As a result, interpretations are subject to bias due to stage-dependent hormonal requirements, or potential compensatory mechanisms. Thus, developing reversible control of pituitary hormones is imperative for a mechanistic understanding. Gain-of-function methodologies, primarily in fish, have so far depended on laborious and repeated injections of pituitary extracts (which are non-specific), or require purification of recombinant hormones (which is time consuming; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mylonas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taranger et al., 2010</xref>). Such challenges significantly hamper the interpretation and scalability of these experiments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Perturbation of the killifish hypothalamic-pituitary-somatic axis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of the vertebrate hypothalamic-pituitary system, including members of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG), the hypothalamic-pituitary-somatic axis (HPS), and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (HPT).

Interestingly, while these versatile models share a range of experimental advantages, they also exhibit several characteristics that are less compatible with high-throughput exploration of adult physiology. For example, both fish undergo relatively slow sexual maturation (~3–4 months), and depend on the germline to develop into phenotypic females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Slanchev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kurokawa et al., 2007</xref>). Accordingly, perturbations that affect the germline, such as mutations in the follicle stimulating hormone receptor gene (<italic>fshr</italic>), produce an all-male sex-reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Slanchev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kurokawa et al., 2007</xref>) (while merely causing ovarian failure in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aittomäki et al., 1995</xref>). Since many peptide hormones also affect gonadal development, it can therefore be challenging to explore both male and female physiology using these classical models.</p><p>Here, we use the naturally short-lived turquoise killifish, which exhibits one of the fastest recorded times to puberty among all vertebrate species (2–3 weeks, ~ sixfold faster than zebrafish and medaka). An additional and underexplored advantage of the killifish model is that, similar to mammals, sexual differentiation is germline-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harel et al., 2015</xref>). This enables us to investigate the effect of a wide range of hormonal manipulations that can affect germline development on both sexes. Based on this mammalian-like trait, we hypothesize that hormonal perturbations in killifish might produce phenotypes that more faithfully recapitulate the corresponding mouse models, than do similar mutations observed in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Slanchev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kurokawa et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here we describe the effect on somatic growth and reproduction of perturbing three primary pituitary hormones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), namely growth hormone (<italic>gh1</italic>, the pituitary-somatic axis), follicle stimulating hormone (<italic>fshb</italic>, the pituitary-gonadal axis), and thyroid stimulating hormone (<italic>tshb</italic>, the pituitary-thyroid axis). The subsequent phenotypes indicate that although the killifish undergoes rapid growth and puberty, it still follows a vertebrate-conserved genetic program. This allows us to use our data to improve the understanding of how these hormones regulate the onset and duration of specific traits across evolutionary distances.</p><p>In addition, we report the use of a gain-of-function approach in which the investigated hormone is tagged using a self-cleavable fluorescent reporter. This vector is then ectopically expressed in vivo through intramuscular electroporation. Our results indicate that a single electroporation is enough to restore growth and reproductive phenotypes for several months. In addition, we describe the development of a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible system, which enables tunable expression patterns, and we demonstrate the feasibility of multiplexing interventions. Our platform therefore represents a simple and robust system for investigating the loss/gain-of-function of circulating factors in fish. Importantly, this strategy is highly effective after a single injection, and can readily be adapted to other fish species. Ultimately, a better understanding of how pituitary hormones shape the vertebrate life-history could allow us to uncouple specific traits, such as somatic growth or reproduction, from lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of a growth hormone CRISPR mutant in killifish</title><p>The hypothalamic–pituitary–somatic (HPS) axis involves the secretion of growth hormone (GH) from the pituitary gland and the consequent stimulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) production in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Le Gac et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">List et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Canosa et al., 2007</xref>).

Most of this reduction can be attributed to their significantly smaller size, since smaller fish are more easily outcompeted in the communal tanks until individually housed following genotyping (at 4 weeks of age). No growth phenotype was detected in heterozygous fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), possibly due to the over saturated GH expression required for rapid killifish growth.</p><p>Quantifying fish length, indicated that while both males and females are roughly 40% smaller than wild-type fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), they remain fertile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

The maximal number of eggs at peak fertility is also reduced in mutant couples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right).

In order to address such issues, we introduced a Dox-inducible overexpression system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, top). This system includes a Dox-dependent transcriptional activator protein (rtTA) and a tet operator (tetO) containing promoter (TRE promoter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Das et al., 2016</xref>) where the rtTA binds to the tetO promoter and activates gene expression only in the presence of doxycycline.

This apparent co-regulation is in accordance with several evolutionary theories that predict functional trade-offs between life-history traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Austad and Hoffman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maklakov and Chapman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kirkwood and Holliday, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kirkwood and Austad, 2000</xref>). Similarly, pituitary hormones also link somatic growth with organismal lifespan in the long-lived Ames and Snell dwarf mice, which suffer from a deficiency of pituitary growth hormone (among other hormones; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flurkey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flurkey et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartke and Brown-Borg, 2004</xref>). Mice with a mutated growth hormone receptor are long-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">List et al., 2011</xref>), and in humans, longer lives and cancer protection are observed in Laron Syndrome patients (dwarfism due to a growth hormone receptor mutation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laron et al., 2017</xref>). These complex relationships raise interesting predictions. For example, could a specific delay in maturity drive proportional changes in vertebrate lifespan? A better understanding of these mechanisms will allow us to uncouple life-history traits, such as somatic growth and reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Possible implications.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Onset of maturity can negatively affect growth. Identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate these seemingly opposing traits, and potentially uncoupling them, holds great promise for basic research and aquaculture.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85960-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Our hormonal perturbations highlight several interesting aspects in killifish. One observation is that a very low level of FSHB is required to support normal reproduction. This might be linked to the extremely rapid maturation process and asynchronous cycle in killifish, which might require high sensitivity. In addition, the delay between Dox treatment and the maximal effect on reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), is probably linked to the length of the natural egg maturation process in killifish. The question of whether rescue of growth prior to the onset of puberty can indeed lead to a more pronounced phenotype will require further investigation.</p><p>Notably, some hormonal perturbations in killifish mutants seem to recapitulate mammalian models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zaczek et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Danilovich et al., 1999</xref>) more faithfully than similar alterations in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). For example, while zebrafish <italic>gh</italic> mutants exhibit an 80% death rate, possibly due to gut malformations, the lower death rate seen in killifish is apparently due only to housing conditions, and the fish display relatively normal gut architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, while zebrafish <italic>gh</italic> mutants display an arrest of female maturity, with only a few mutant females undergoing puberty, fertility is merely delayed in killifish HPS axis mutants and fecundity is reduced due to spatial constraints, while all germline developmental stages are normally present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast to mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rowland et al., 2005</xref>) and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2019</xref>), a heterozygous <italic>gh1</italic> mutation does not have an obvious effect on the growth of killifish. This phenomenon may be due to the explosive growth killifish exhibit, or to the possibility that heterozygotes killifish are merely able to ‘catch up’ (similar to zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>So far, we and others have primarily perturbed one hormone at a time. However, in the real world, multiple signals are integrated to determine the duration and onset of life-history traits. Importantly, our method is compatible with multiplexing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and could allow an investigation of the combinatorial effects of several hormones. Similarly, the dose-dependent and doxycycline-inducible system can be used to provide information about the temporal windows required to achieve a sequential or reversible gain-of-function.</p><p>We predict that our approach will be of great use in the optimization of commercially valuable traits in aquaculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taranger et al., 2010</xref>). For example, current manipulations in certain eel species are extremely time consuming and require ~16 weekly injections of pituitary extracts to induce maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Okamura et al., 2014</xref>). Our system, which has a long-lasting effect without modifying the host genome, will allow simple plasmid electroporation to replace traditional methods of hormone administration for the purposes of manipulation of the reproductive cycle, growth, and resistance to disease.</p><p>We have recently demonstrated that the killifish model can be used to identify novel regulators of aging, which involve systemic modulation of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Astre et al., 2022a</xref>). Therefore, it should be possible to utilize this platform to investigate systemic factors as modifiers of health and longevity. For example, recent studies have demonstrated that circulating factors in young plasma can rejuvenate old mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baht et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conboy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Katsimpardi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loffredo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Salpeter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Villeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Villeda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grunewald et al., 2021</xref>). So far, only a handful of these factors, including VEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grunewald et al., 2021</xref>) (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor), and GDF11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>) (Growth Differentiation Factor 11) have been experimentally tested, and there are many possible candidates for age-dependent changes in the plasma proteome that remain to be explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lehallier et al., 2019</xref>). In conclusion, our platform significantly advances the state-of the-art by providing easy and efficient tools that can be used to dissect the mechanisms that regulate vertebrate life history at an unprecedented resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

In case of repeated measures over time, we used a two-way repeated measures ANOVA test with time as one variable. To calculate proportions within a group we used a χ<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher’s exact test.

Significance compared to the WT was calculated using repeated measures two-way ANOVA with a Sidak post-hoc.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Histology</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Hematoxylin and eosin</title><p>Tissues samples were processed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Astre et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harel and Brunet, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Astre et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nathan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Theis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harel and Tzahor, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benayoun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rozenberg et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Astre et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rozenberg et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van Keymeulen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moses and Harel, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Valenzano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gruenbaum-Cohen et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, fish were euthanized with 500 mg/l tricaine (MS222, #A5040, Sigma). Paraffin sections were prepared by opening the body cavity of the fish and following a 72 hr fixation in 4% PFA solution at 4 °C, samples were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin using standard procedures. Sections of 5–10 μm were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin, and examined by microscopy. A fully motorized Olympus IX23 microscope with an Olympus DP28 camera was used to collect images.

The OCT- sucrose solution is composed of 20% sucrose w/v (Bio-Lab #001922059100) and 30% OCT v/v (Scigen Scientific Gardena #4586) in PBS. Tissues were then transferred to OCT (12 h at 4 °C) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. All immersions were performed with mild shaking. Serial 20 µm sections were taken using a cryostat, airdried, and stored at –20 °C. For immunostaining, slides were washed 3 X in PBS, and permeabilized for 10 min in a permeabilization buffer containing 0.1% Triton (Avanator Performance materials #X198-07) and 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldritch #A7906 in PBS). Sections were then blocked for 10 min (DAKO #X0909), and incubated with primary antibodies overnight. The following primary antibody was used: rabbit anti-Nile Tilapia GH antibody (1:100), a generous gift from Prof. Berta Levavi-Sivan. After several washes, the sections were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with donkey anti rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 secondary antibody (Abcam #150064, 1:500) in antibody diluent (DAKO #S0809). After several washes, autofluorescence was quenched using TrueVIEW autofluorescence quenching kit (Vector Labs #SP8500) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and mounted with VECTASHIELD containing DAPI (Vector Labs #30326). Samples were imaged using a fully motorized Olympus IX23 microscope with a Photometrics BSI camera, and processed in imageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abràmoff et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Injection and ectopic over-expression of plasmids via electroporation</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Cloning of killifish cDNAs</title><p>Killifish cDNAs were cloned from brain tissues from male and female killifish by homogenization in TRIreagent (Sigma #T9424) using 3 mm Nirosta disruption beads (PALBOREG FEDERAL #BL6693003000) and a tissue homogenizer (TissueLyser LT, Qiagen #85600). Total RNA was isolated from the lysed tissues using the Direct-zol RNA miniprep kit.

Fish were then electroporated using 7 mm tweezer electrodes (NEP GENE #CUY650P10) with the ECM 830 generator. (BTX #45–0661). Electrodes were coated with wet cotton to minimize the risk to the fish. Fish were electroporated with 6 pulses of 28V (14 V for small fish, such as <italic>gh1<sup>Δ4/Δ4</sup></italic>), for 60ms each with an interval of 1 s between each pulse. Bright field and florescent Images were recorded by a Leica MC190HD camera mounted on a Leica M156FC microscope.

Fish were treated for 72 hr, and fresh water with Dox was changed every 24 hr. Due to possible light sensitivity of the drug, tanks were protected from light during treatment. Immediately following the treatment fish were imaged using a Leica MC190HD camera mounted on a Leica M156FC microscope.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All turquoise killifish care and uses were approved by the Subcommittee on Research Animal Care at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (IACUC protocols #NS-18-15397-2 and #NS-22-16915-3).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-85960-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All plasmids and corresponding annotated maps are available via Addgene.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Dario Riccardo Valenzano as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Eve Seuntjens (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should validate their rescue model better (timing, expression levels, duration of rescue, whole body or local), including proper controls.</p><p>2) The authors should provide a deeper characterization for the electroporation and Dox inducible system (see reviewer #3).</p><p>3) The authors need to thoroughly revise the English in the written text.</p><p>4) The manuscript does not obviously follow a question-driven flow and the authors do not make a compelling case about the necessity of developing such platform.</p><p>The manuscript could be framed as a tool/resource, showcasing the interventions with gh and fshb to support the tool.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While I am a big fan of this work, I find the manuscript not thoroughly edited. There are several sentences that are hard to understand, starting with the abstract.</p><p>Authors should check and review extensively for improvements to the use of English. The abstract contains several arbitrary (non substantiated) statements (&quot;…particularly in females&quot;' &quot;As killifish 20 maturation is germline-independent,…&quot;).</p><p>Overall, I find this manuscript more as a container of successfully developed tools (about which I congratulate the authors) for the killifish community.</p><p>I wonder whether <italic>eLife</italic> is the right fit for this work.</p><p>I find a large disconnect between the way in which the manuscript is written and the quality of the figures. While the figures have a very high quality standard, Abstract, Introduction and Discussion are not doing justice to the work done, as they appear to be in an early draft format.</p><p>Scientific questions to address:</p><p>– Do gh1-d4/d4 display embryos of similar size to the wt (line 77-80)?</p><p>– &quot;our findings demonstrate that GH deficiency delays both somatic growth and maturity&quot;. Was this known? Is this new? It's not clear what was the initial hypothesis. There seems to be no clear hypothesis to justify the experiment. The hypothesis needs to be spelled out more clearly.</p><p>– Is the approach generally new? Or, rather, is the approach new in the specified model system (killifish)?</p><p>– In figure 4: what is labelled as &quot;M&quot;? I see that &quot;M&quot; also appears in Figure 2. However, &quot;mature&quot; is an adjective, not a noun. The authors need to explain more clearly what is this structure.</p><p>– line 176-177: &quot;Our method is compatible with multiplexing&quot;. Do the authors know this already, have they multiplexed interventions or is this a speculation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It is clear from Figure 2B that the gh1 deletion has a drastic impact on fertility in addition to somatic growth. The number of embryos per collection appears to be significantly lower as well. It is only mentioned in passing in the manuscript, but this aspect should be characterized and discussed in depth.</p><p>The statistics in Figure 2B are unclear. Are P-values from weekly pairwise comparison? If this is the case, the stages being compared are different because the mutant matures later, so I'm not sure what the statistics mean. If the goal is to compare delay in the onset of peak fertility, the statistics should be between the time it takes to reach the peak fertility. Alternatively, a different comparison based on the objective should be done.</p><p>The sections in Figure 2C appear to be from different parts of the mutant and WT ovaries. I am not an expert in histology, but I find it difficult to see the similarities between the two conditions. Can the authors provide a zoomed-out image and ensure that all the images used throughout the manuscript come from the same regions?</p><p>It is unclear if the authors detect endogenous or injected gh because electroporation is performed on WT fish (lines 97-103), which should have gh already. Therefore, WT injection is not a good controls for the electroporation efficiency. First, it needs to be established that the mutant has no gh. An appropriate control for electroporation will be injecting gh plasmid construct in gh1-/- fish, and quantifying gh protein in isolated muscle before and after electroporation.</p><p>A control GFP image after injection but before electroporation is also needed in Figure 3A.</p><p>The rescue experiment also needs a bit more characterization. First, Figure 3B needs the size data from mutant fish right before electroporation and after the increase in size. Second, pictures of the fish before and after the size increase should be included. Third, gh has a growth-promoting effect systematically on all tissues, including bones, cartilage, etc., which raises several interesting questions. Is the gh from the injected construct also transported throughout the body? Can it be detected in other tissues and organs? If not, what is the mechanism of the growth increase? It is important to characterize or discuss how the size increase is accomplished. Finally, it should be assessed if there is rescue of embryo production in injected fish (Figure 2B). Or is the effect restricted to growth only?</p><p>The rescue of the infertility phenotype due to fshb loss of function is interesting. The authors say that the plasmid is stably expressed for several weeks. Is the expression localized to muscle, or is fshb transported and detectable in the ovaries, where it is expected to act (Figure 4)?</p><p>The dose dependent gh1 expression needs to be quantified in dissected muscle using the gh1 antibody. GFP image is not convincing as a proxy for gh1 expression without proper controls (see above). Also, does this rescue the gh loss of function phenotype in a dose dependent manner?</p><p>The Dox inducible system is the most interesting part of this work. But in its current form, it is the most under-developed. It is unclear which gene is rescued here. And does it also rescue the associated phenotype in a dose dependent manner?</p><p>My final point concerns the study's diffused focus. The authors state that they are working on another manuscript with the detailed characterization of the defects due to fshb and other pituitary hormones, which is fine. But likely due to that, the current manuscript lacks details in the characterization of both the methods and the biology of phenotypes. In my opinion, it will be better to focus on one or two genes but thoroughly characterize every aspect of the tools and biology.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Validation of the knockout models</p><p>For all hormones tested, are the genes you chose the only copies in the genome? Is there only 1 gh, fshb, tshb gene or are there duplicates? Have you measured plasmid concentrations of these hormones to validate the fact they are mutant? Or alternative ways to validate absence of hormone at protein level?</p><p>Rescue modalities</p><p>Rescue was induced by a single electroporation using a CMV-driven plasmid. How did you decide on the age of rescue? Have you tested different ages of rescue induction? If not, can you speculate on the outcome of such an experiment? Did you include a control where an empty plasmid was electroporated in the mutants? This would be the correct additional control to calculate your rescue percentage. The latter would be important for gh, where you seem to have a sex-specific difference in rescue efficiency. The females do not seem to be rescued efficiently: please adapt lines 109-110: this conclusion might only hold for male fish.</p><p>How long does overexpression last? Is this a lifelong effect?</p><p>Regarding the &quot;dose-response&quot; in Figure 5B: Can you quantify this? Is there a limit to the overexpression? Electroporations are notoriously variable: what was the variability of your system? Can you comment?</p><p>Doxycycline system</p><p>Here, you use EF1a as a general promoter: how efficient is this promoter compared to CMV? The GFP signal you observe as a readout seems to be rather limited in expression compared to the previous overexpression systems: can you benchmark this system better? For instance can you rescue the gh or fshb ko phenotype using the doxycycline construct to prove the system is comparably efficient?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85960.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>While I am a big fan of this work, I find the manuscript not thoroughly edited.

As the manuscript was originally submitted as a ‘Tools and Resources’ article, the narrative used the <italic>gh1</italic> and <italic>fshb</italic> mutations, primarily to support the gain-of-function tool that we have developed. to support the tool. However, we now describe that several phenotypes of hormonal perturbations in killifish are more similar to mouse, and not to zebrafish and medaka. We believe this might be related to the germline independent sexual differentiation. We now discuss this throughout the text, including:</p><p>“Based on this mammalian-like trait, we hypothesize that hormonal perturbations in killifish might produce phenotypes that more faithfully recapitulate the corresponding mouse models, than do similar mutations observed in zebrafish.”</p><p>We aimed to develop a reversible control of hormone function, focusing on evolutionary conserved pathways. Thus, allowing us to better generalise our findings to other vertebrate species. We now indicate the following in the introduction:</p><p>“The subsequent phenotypes indicate that although the killifish undergoes rapid growth and puberty, it still follows a vertebrate-conserved genetic program.

Specifically, we have imaged the dissected gonads of WT fish, <italic>gh1</italic> mutants, and rescued <italic>gh1</italic> mutants (see new Figure 3F). We have also imaged transverse histological sections showing the entire body cavity of WT and gh mutant females (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). Using these images, we suggest that a constraint on fertility could be simple space. Specifically, while egg size does not change (see new Figure 2—figure supplement 1B), and the fish size does change, space for mature eggs is restricted. Additionally, we have characterised the effect of the <italic>gh1</italic> rescue on reproduction (see new Figure 3E) and size of the ovary (see new figure 3F) and show there is both a rescue of fertility and an accompanying increase in the ovary size. We discuss all of this extensively throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The statistics in Figure 2B are unclear. Are P-values from weekly pairwise comparison?

Alternatively, a different comparison based on the objective should be done.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer this might be confusing. Therefore, we have now added two new graphs to more directly compare specific parameters: (a) The difference in the timing of peak fertility (temporal); and (b) the difference of fecundity at peak fertility (reproductive output) (new Figure 2C). In addition, we think that presenting the comparison of the WT and mutant fish at the same biological age (Figure 2B) might be still visually informative, and retains biological meaning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The sections in Figure 2C appear to be from different parts of the mutant and WT ovaries.

While both pictures did show oocytes from comparable regions, they were at different stages of development. We now display in Figure 2D oocytes at similar stages, and have labelled these stages accordingly.

It is important to characterize or discuss how the size increase is accomplished. Finally, it should be assessed if there is rescue of embryo production in injected fish (Figure 2B). Or is the effect restricted to growth only?</p></disp-quote><p>First, as the GH antibody did not work well in WB, we chose several alternatives. As this is also relevant to the next comment, concerning <italic>fshb</italic>, we selected <italic>fshb</italic> as a proof-of-principle to measure the body-wide distribution of an electroporated hormone.</p><p>Specifically, we generated a new construct of FSHB-GFP fusion protein, and demonstrate that this construct was able to fully rescue <italic>fshb</italic> mutant infertility (see new Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). While some GFP signal was observed in the gonads following muscle electroporation, it was not robust (see new Figure 4figure supplement 1C). This could be due to the extremely low amount of hormone required for a functional effect, and is now extensively characterised using the Dox system (new Figure 5).</p><p>In regard to the body-wide effect, we now demonstrate that the growth of GH-rescued fish maintains the correct body proportions (length vs. width) (See new Figure 3—figure supplement 1B), as well as completely rescues fertility output (see new Figure 3E). This is in contrast to altered body proportions observed, for example, in the <italic>tshb</italic> mutants (see new Figure 4C). These data support that notion that the rescue affects multiple systems and organs. Similarly, GH therapy in humans is administered systemically by injection, and effects are body-wide through the circulation. This is now discussed in the text, for example:</p><p>“Fish retain normal body dimensions (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B), suggesting uniform body-wide hormone effect.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The rescue of the infertility phenotype due to fshb loss of function is interesting. The authors say that the plasmid is stably expressed for several weeks. Is the expression localized to muscle, or is fshb transported and detectable in the ovaries, where it is expected to act (Figure 4)?</p></disp-quote><p>We generated a new construct of FSHB-GFP fusion protein, and demonstrate that while some GFP signal was observed in peripheral organs (i.e. the gonads) following muscle electroporation, it was not robust (see new Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). This could be due to the extremely low amount of hormone required for a functional effect, and is now functionally characterised using the Dox system (new Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The dose dependent gh1 expression needs to be quantified in dissected muscle using the gh1 antibody. GFP image is not convincing as a proxy for gh1 expression without proper controls (see above). Also, does this rescue the gh loss of function phenotype in a dose dependent manner?</p></disp-quote><p>We now demonstrate the staining of GH in <italic>gh1</italic> mutant fish (with or without electroporation, at 2 different doses, new Figure 3A).</p><p>Due to the extremely small size of GH fish, experiments using large numbers of mutants, are more technically challenging. Therefore, alternatively, to test the dose-dependent physiological effect of our platform, we used the FSHB knock-outs. Specifically, we mated rescued female <italic>fshb</italic> homozygous fish, either injected with 5μg or 0.5μg of the <italic>fshb-GFP</italic> plasmid, and measured fertility. The dose did not affect the fertility output (see new Figure 5C). We think this is because very low amounts of the hormone are sufficient for complete rescue. This is also supported by the fact that heterozygous fish demonstrate comparable fertility to WTs (see new Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). To further explore this, we generated an inducible construct (see next comment), which provided better control of hormone levels, by switching production on and off, and assessing fertility at extremely low hormone concentrations (new Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Dox inducible system is the most interesting part of this work. But in its current form, it is the most under-developed. It is unclear which gene is rescued here. And does it also rescue the associated phenotype in a dose dependent manner?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now constructed a Dox-dependent <italic>fshb</italic> system, and excitingly, demonstrate that fertility could be reversibly switched on and off. Additionally, it appears that minor leakiness of the Dox system is sufficient to restore limited fertility. This further highlights the low concentration of FSHB required for a functional effect (e.g. the functional threshold is lower than the detected GFP signals) (see new Figure 5E, F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My final point concerns the study's diffused focus. The authors state that they are working on another manuscript with the detailed characterization of the defects due to fshb and other pituitary hormones, which is fine. But likely due to that, the current manuscript lacks details in the characterization of both the methods and the biology of phenotypes. In my opinion, it will be better to focus on one or two genes but thoroughly characterize every aspect of the tools and biology.</p></disp-quote><p>As the manuscript was originally submitted as a ‘Tools and Resources’ article, the narrative highlighted primarily the gain-of-function interventions. We agree with the reviewer and now expand the characterization of the mutant and rescue phenotypes, as well as the ability to finely control expression using our tools. Accordingly, the narrative of the entire manuscript is now altered.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Validation of the knockout models</p><p>For all hormones tested, are the genes you chose the only copies in the genome? Is there only 1 gh, fshb, tshb gene or are there duplicates? Have you measured plasmid concentrations of these hormones to validate the fact they are mutant? Or alternative ways to validate absence of hormone at protein level?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this, we have built a phylogenetic tree showing that all selected genes are more closely related to their orthologs than to other genes in the family. Thus, confirming the annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). In addition, the evolutionary-conserved phenotypes of our genetic models imply there is no redundancy. Because of the low quality of antibodies in killifish (and fish in general) we were unable to validate the mutants on the protein level (when not overexpressed via electroporation, as seen for GH). We hope that the functional assays and phenotypic rescue mitigate this challenge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Rescue modalities</p><p>Rescue was induced by a single electroporation using a CMV-driven plasmid. How did you decide on the age of rescue? Have you tested different ages of rescue induction? If not, can you speculate on the outcome of such an experiment? Did you include a control where an empty plasmid was electroporated in the mutants? This would be the correct additional control to calculate your rescue percentage. The latter would be important for gh, where you seem to have a sex-specific difference in rescue efficiency. The females do not seem to be rescued efficiently: please adapt lines 109-110: this conclusion might only hold for male fish.</p></disp-quote><p>While the younger the better, the specific age of intervention in <italic>gh1</italic> mutants was selected since at a younger age these fish (which are extremely small) are more fragile, and therefore died from the procedure itself. We can speculate that the remaining time to grow could have an effect. We now discuss this in the text:</p><p>“The partial rescue in somatic growth might be due to the age at intervention. Specifically, electroporation was performed at 8 weeks of age, which is already past the period during which the fish exhibit a growth spurt and the onset of puberty. This timepoint was selected because of the difficulties in injection and electroporation in the extremely small young mutants. In contrast to the partial growth rescue, reproductive defects were fully rescued in GH-electroporated mutant couples (Figure 3E), as evidenced by an increase in the size of the ovary (Figure 3F). Together, these results demonstrate that ectopic muscle electroporation can rescue many aspects of GH deficiency. “</p><p>Additionally, we have now added the empty plasmid injected controls. With these controls, we now demonstrate that while both sexes are similarly affected (i.e. increase in average length), males (which grow to be much larger), probably provide more dynamic range to detect statistically significant growth changes. See new Figure 3D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How long does overexpression last? Is this a lifelong effect?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now functionally tested the fertility of <italic>fshb</italic> mutant females injected with 5μg or 500ng of an fshbgfp plasmid at the age of 1 month. We show that the fertility of both concentrations is comparable to WT females for at least 2 months (see new Figure 5D). As at the age of 4 months both WT and rescued fish experience age-related decline in fertility, we terminated the experiment. Importantly, we now further demonstrate precise temporal control by using the Dox system, in which a switch-on and off can be achieved in a matter of 2-3 weeks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the &quot;dose-response&quot; in Figure 5B: Can you quantify this? Is there a limit to the overexpression? Electroporations are notoriously variable: what was the variability of your system? Can you comment?</p></disp-quote><p>To quantify electroporation variability, we have analysed the GFP intensity in images from two doses of plasmid. Though there is some variability within each concentration, the difference between concentrations is significant (see new Figure 5D).</p><p>The overexpression is limited by plasmid concentration. While beyond the scope of this manuscript, we speculate that multiple injections are theoretically possible, though our data indicated that saturation is already reached al lower concentrations (see new Figure 5E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Doxycycline system</p><p>Here, you use EF1a as a general promoter: how efficient is this promoter compared to CMV? The GFP signal you observe as a readout seems to be rather limited in expression compared to the previous overexpression systems: can you benchmark this system better? For instance can you rescue the gh or fshb ko phenotype using the doxycycline construct to prove the system is comparably efficient?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, CMV is stronger than Ef1a. Accordingly, we now show that we are able to obtain comparable GFP signals using the <italic>Ef1a:Dox</italic> system, simply by increasing the plasmid concentration (see new panel in Figure 5E). Additionally, we now perform an <italic>fshb</italic> rescue under dox control, see new Figure 5F.</p></body></sub-article></article>
