However, how these phenomena are coordinated to form functional organs is poorly understood. Here, we show that cell differentiation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> trachea is sequentially determined in two steps and that the second step is synchronous with the invagination of the epithelial sheet. The master gene <italic>trachealess</italic> is dispensable for the initiation of invagination, while it is essential for maintaining the invaginated structure, suggesting that tracheal morphogenesis and differentiation are separately induced. <italic>trachealess</italic> expression starts in bipotential tracheal/epidermal placode cells. After invagination, its expression is maintained in the invaginated cells but is extinguished in the remaining sheet cells. A <italic>trachealess</italic> cis-regulatory module that shows both tracheal enhancer activity and silencer activity in the surface epidermal sheet was identified. We propose that the coupling of <italic>trachealess</italic> expression with the invaginated structure ensures that only invaginated cells canalize robustly into the tracheal fate.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45145.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells in developing organs have two important decisions to make: where to be and what cell type to become. If cells end up in the wrong places, they can stop an organ from working, so it is vital that one decision depends upon the other. The so-called progenitor cells responsible for forming the trachea, for example, can either become part of a flat sheet or part of a tube. The cells on the sheet need to become epidermal cells, while the cells in the tube need to become tracheal cells. Work on fruit flies found that a gene called '<italic>trachealess</italic>' plays an important role in this process. Without it, developing flies cannot make a trachea at all.</p><p>At the start of trachea development, some of the cells form thickened structures called placodes. The progenitor cells in the placodes start to divide, and the structures buckle inwards to form pockets. These pockets then lengthen into tubes. The <italic>trachealess</italic> gene codes for a protein that works as a genetic switch. It turns other genes on or off, helping the progenitor cells inside the pockets to become tracheal cells. But, it is not clear whether <italic>trachealess</italic> drives the formation of the pockets: the progenitor cells first decide what to be; or whether pocket formation tells the cells to use <italic>trachealess</italic>: the progenitor cells first decide where to be.</p><p>To find out, Kondo and Hayashi imaged developing fly embryos and saw that the <italic>trachealess</italic> gene does not start pocket formation, but that it is essential to maintain the pockets. Flies without the gene managed to form pockets, but they did not last long. Looking at embryos with defects in other genes involved in pocket formation revealed why. In these flies, some of the progenitor cells using <italic>trachealess</italic> got left behind when the pockets started to form. But rather than forming pockets of their own (as they might if <italic>trachealess</italic> were driving pocket formation), they turned their <italic>trachealess</italic> gene off. Progenitor cells in the fly trachea seem to decide where to be before they decide what cell type to become. This helps to make sure that trachea cells do not form in the wrong places.</p><p>A question that still remains is how do the cells know when they are inside a pocket? It is possible that the cells are sensing different mechanical forces or different chemical signals. Further research could help scientists to understand how organs form in living animals, and how they might better recreate that process in the laboratory.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>trachea</kwd><kwd>epithelial morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>invagination</kwd><kwd>cell differentiation</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP18gm5810020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kondo</surname><given-names>Takefumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15H05597</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kondo</surname><given-names>Takefumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Building of Consortia for the Development of Human Resources in Science and Technology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kondo</surname><given-names>Takefumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> tracheal fate is stabilized by the combination of transcriptional programs to control tissue architecture and tissue-level input sensitive to tubular geometry, ensuring the robust mechanism of organ determination.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A fundamental question in biology is how cells coordinately shape functional organs with complex architecture during embryogenesis. Extensive studies have uncovered how inductive signals, such as morphogens, prime cell differentiation and morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heisenberg and Bellaïche, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perrimon et al., 2012</xref>), leading to segregated organs with uniquely specified cells. Due to the graded nature of the inductive signals, the initial territories of an organ primordial placode are occupied by cells with various degrees of commitment. Furthermore, cells modulate their own physical properties by changing gene expression to drive morphogenesis, but each cell behavior is dynamic and fluctuating. Therefore, mechanisms to coordinate these phenomena are of critical importance. Without a coordination mechanism, tissues would be mixed with improperly specified cells that would interfere with organ functions. The sequence of signaling, gene expression and morphogenesis is not unidirectional, and the feedback input from morphogenesis to gene expression is proposed to be crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilmour et al., 2017</xref>). However, the generality of the proposed feedback mechanisms from morphogenesis to gene expression and cell differentiation in a wide range of developmental systems remains to be determined.</p><p>Epithelial invagination is an important morphogenetic process in which three-dimensional tubular organs are formed from a two-dimensional flat sheet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrew and Ewald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kondo and Hayashi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sawyer et al., 2010</xref>), and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> trachea is a useful model system for analyzing three-dimensional epithelial morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayashi and Kondo, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Loganathan et al., 2016</xref>). Tracheal morphogenesis is initiated by placode specification; ten pairs of tracheal placodes form in the dorsal anterior part of the epidermis in each segment by stage 10, followed by invagination, branching and fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In this process, the tracheal placodes first appear as a group of cells expressing <italic>trachealess</italic> (<italic>trh</italic>), which is considered to be a master regulator of tracheal morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Isaac and Andrew, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilk et al., 1996</xref>), and then EGF signaling and mitosis synergistically drive invagination by generating centripetal pressure and inducing epithelial sheet buckling, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kondo and Hayashi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nishimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ogura et al., 2018</xref>).

Its expression is primarily induced under the combinatorial control of activation through JAK-STAT signaling and inhibition through Wg and Dpp signaling before invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilk et al., 1996</xref>), and STAT-responsive enhancers for <italic>trh</italic> have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sotillos et al., 2010</xref>). After invagination, all of the tracheal cells continue expressing <italic>trh,</italic> while no other surrounding epithelial cells, such as epidermal cells, express this factor. However, it is not well understood how <italic>trh</italic> expression is strictly restricted only to invaginated tracheal cells. Although <italic>trh</italic> is proposed to maintain its own expression through an auto-regulatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilk et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zelzer and Shilo, 2000</xref>), it is still unclear whether all the cells that start expressing Trh expression take part in the invagination and generation of trachea, or if some of these cells fail to invaginate, and if so, how they shut off the auto-regulatory control of <italic>trh</italic>.</p><p>In this article, we first show that <italic>trh</italic> plays a critical role in maintaining the invaginated structure but not in initiating invagination. Second, we reveal that the tracheal placode cells initiating <italic>trh</italic> expression later become either tracheal or epidermal cells, and the maintenance of <italic>trh</italic> expression is tightly associated with the change from the epithelial sheet to the invaginated structure. On the basis of our findings, we propose that the transcriptional coordination of <italic>trh</italic> expression, tracheal cell fate specification and invaginated structures during epithelial invagination ensures that only the invaginated cells are canalized robustly into the tracheal fate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>trh</italic> is required to maintain invaginated structures</title><p>We previously reported that mitosis can drive tracheal invagination, alone or in combination with EGFR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kondo and Hayashi, 2013</xref>). Although all embryonic cells undergo multiple cell divisions, mitosis-induced invagination occurs only in the tracheal placode. Non-tracheal epidermal cells quickly recover their flat epithelial architecture after mitosis, suggesting that the tracheal placode cells possess a special ability to couple mitosis with invagination and tubule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kondo and Hayashi, 2013</xref>). Since <italic>trh</italic> is considered a master regulator of tracheal morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Isaac and Andrew, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilk et al., 1996</xref>), we reasoned that <italic>trh</italic> is involved in this mitosis-induced invagination.</p><p>Previous studies showed that in <italic>trh</italic> mutants, the tracheal tissue is completely missing in late-stage embryos, and no invagination occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Isaac and Andrew, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilk et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Younossi-Hartenstein and Hartenstein, 1993</xref>). However, in the stage-10 tracheal placode, di-phosphorylated ERK, a hallmark of EGFR activation, was detected even in <italic>trh</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ogura et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that some early tracheal development processes were taking place. Live imaging of <italic>trh<sup>1</sup></italic> (an EMS-induced missense allele) mutants at single-cell resolution revealed an unexpected finding: apical constriction forming a tracheal pit appeared in the center of the placode region, followed by mitosis in the pit cells and rapid, deep invagination as seen in the control, although the onset of invagination was delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Over the next 90 min, the invaginated structure gradually returned to the surface epidermal layer and merged with these cells to form a segmental furrow, leaving no trace of the tracheal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Consistent with this live imaging analysis of <italic>trh<sup>1</sup></italic>, in fixed samples with a heteroallelic combination of TALEN-induced <italic>trh</italic> null alleles (<italic>trh<sup>A14-3</sup></italic>/<italic>trh<sup>B16-11</sup></italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kondo et al., 2014</xref>), would-be tracheal placode cells labeled with the <italic>R14E10 trh</italic> primary enhancer (containing the <italic>trh66</italic> STAT-responsive element that mediates stage-10 <italic>trh</italic> expression in the placode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sotillos et al., 2010</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) also formed a tracheal pit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and formed invaginated structures during stages 11–13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These <italic>R14E10-</italic>positive cells returned to the surface epidermal layer at stage 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The appearance of invaginated structures at stage 12 and the disappearance of these structures at stages 15–16 were observed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>, respectively, with 100% penetrance (stage 12: eight embryos, stage 15–16: ten embryos). In addition, the overexpression of <italic>trh</italic> (<italic>trh</italic>-OE) by <italic>R14E10-GAL4</italic> in the <italic>trh</italic> mutants rescued the phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). One of the Trh target genes is <italic>breathless</italic> (<italic>btl</italic>), which encodes an FGF receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohshiro and Saigo, 1997</xref>), and we reported that FGF signaling through Btl is able to trigger invagination independent of EGF signaling and mitotic rounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kondo and Hayashi, 2013</xref>). However, the <italic>btl</italic>-OE in the <italic>trh</italic> mutants using <italic>R14E10-GAL4</italic> did not rescue tracheal formation from the transiently invaginated tracheal placodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>), indicating that other <italic>trh</italic> target genes are required to support FGF signaling-triggered tracheal morphogenesis. In addition, inhibiting apoptosis by <italic>p35</italic> did not prevent the transiently invaginated cells from returning to the epidermis, indicating that apoptotic cell removal is not the major cause of this anomaly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). These results demonstrated that <italic>trh</italic> is essential for maintaining the invaginated structure, whereas it is dispensable for initiating invagination. Thus, tracheal formation proceeds by two successive and genetically separable steps: (1) invagination triggered by the mechanical forces generated through the combined activities of mitosis, EGFR, and FGFR signaling; and (2) maintenance of the invaginated structure controlled by <italic>trh</italic>. Since mitosis-triggered invagination was maintained in <italic>rho bnl</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kondo and Hayashi, 2013</xref>), EGFR and FGFR signaling are dispensable for the maintenance of the invaginated structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Only invaginated tubule cells maintained Trh expression</title><p>For Trh to function as a determinant of the invaginated structures, its expression must be tightly sustained only in the invaginated cells but not in the surface epidermal cells.

In <italic>rho bnl</italic> double mutants that lose both EGF and FGF signaling in tracheal cells, tracheal invagination is impaired, and the trachea is composed of a smaller number of cells than that of the control. If a similar number of cells initiates <italic>trh</italic> expression in control and <italic>rho bnl</italic> mutants, some <italic>trh</italic>-positive placode cells are expected to remain in the surface epidermis, and these cells may face a conflict between their fate and tissue geometry.</p><p>JAK-STAT signaling induces <italic>trh</italic> expression through a STAT-responsive <italic>trh</italic> enhancer in the tracheal placodes at stage 10 of embryogenesis before invagination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sotillos et al., 2010</xref>). After invagination, Trh is detected only in all invaginated cells, including the most proximal spiracular branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,F</xref>). The number of initial Trh+ cells in the tracheal placode before invagination (stage 10) was 58.2 ± 5.1 (mean ±S.D.) in controls and 67.2 ± 8.5 in the <italic>rho bnl</italic> mutants, respectively, indicating that tracheal fate specification was not compromised in the <italic>rho bnl</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B,G</xref>). The increase in the number of initial Trh+ cells in the <italic>rho bnl</italic> placodes reflects the expansion of the tracheal placode due to the earlier role of <italic>rho</italic> in restricting the size of tracheal placode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raz and Shilo, 1993</xref>). The <italic>R14E10</italic> fragment contains the <italic>trh66</italic> STAT-responsive element that mediates stage9-10 <italic>trh</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sotillos et al., 2010</xref>), and the number of initial <italic>R14E10</italic> + cells (57.9 ± 2.7 cells, monitored by using the <italic>R14E10-lacZ</italic> transgene at stage 10) is almost the same as the number of initial Trh+ cells. In contrast, after cycle-16 mitosis and invagination, the resultant tracheae of the <italic>rho bnl</italic> mutants were composed of a smaller number of Trh+ cells (<italic>trh</italic>-on cells, 31.2 ± 6.2 cells) than those of the controls (87.6 ± 6.3 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D,G</xref>). These findings demonstrate that in the <italic>rho bnl</italic> mutants, the number of initial Trh+ cells at stage 10 was reduced at stages 13–14. This reduction is due to either the disappearance of Trh+ cells from the epithelium or the loss of Trh expression in cells that failed to invaginate.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45145.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Trh expression is maintained only in invaginated tracheal cells.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Trh expression in a tracheal placode of a control (<italic>rho<sup>del1</sup> bnl<sup>P1</sup></italic> /+) (<bold>a</bold>) and a <italic>rho<sup>del1</sup> bnl<sup>P1</sup></italic> mutant (<bold>B</bold>) embryo at stage 10 before invagination. (<bold>C–E</bold>) Trh and β-gal expression in a control embryo (<bold>C</bold>), a <italic>rho<sup>del1</sup> bnl<sup>P1</sup></italic> mutant (<bold>D</bold>), and a <italic>rho<sup>del1</sup> bnl<sup>P1</sup></italic> mutant with p35 overexpression (<bold>E</bold>) at stage 14 after invagination. β-gal and p35 expression were driven by <italic>R14E10-GAL4</italic>.

The results showed that 27% of the initial <italic>trh+</italic> cells lost their Trh expression, all of which remained in the epidermis. Many of the <italic>trh</italic>-off cells remained during the rest of embryogenesis and formed trichomes on their apical surface (data not shown), suggesting that they adopted the epidermal fate.</p><p>We next asked if the loss of <italic>trh</italic> expression in <italic>trh</italic>-off cells was due to their failure to become part of the tube by tracing the fate of <italic>trh</italic>-expressing cells in the <italic>rho bnl</italic> mutants. After invagination, the resultant tracheae were composed of a smaller number of <italic>trh</italic>-on cells (31.2 ± 6.2 cells), as mentioned above, and surrounded by an increased number of epidermal <italic>trh</italic>-off cells (50.4 ± 7.2 cells) than those of the controls, with a total of 81.6 ± 9.8 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,G</xref>).

In the <italic>rho bnl</italic> mutants with or without p35, 62% of the surviving initial <italic>trh+</italic> cells remained in the epidermis and lost their <italic>trh</italic> expression. These findings indicated that the reduction in <italic>trh</italic>-on cells in the <italic>rho bnl</italic> mutants was not simply due to their disappearance from the epithelium. Losses of EGF, FGF, and mitosis in the <italic>rho CyclinA (CycA) bnl</italic> triple mutant caused a more severe invagination defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kondo and Hayashi, 2013</xref>).

If the cells maintaining Trh expression and forming tubes are predetermined before invagination, the triple mutants are supposed to possess half the number of <italic>trh</italic>-on cells observed in the <italic>rho bnl</italic> double mutants because the <italic>CycA</italic> mutation eliminates cycle-16 mitosis. However, although all the invaginated cells were Trh-positive, the number of Trh-on tracheal cells in these triple mutants was much smaller than expected (6.0 ± 2.5 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), which strongly argues against the model in which the tube-forming <italic>trh</italic>-on cells are predetermined before invagination. These observations support the possibility that the <italic>trh</italic> expression in the stage 10 tracheal placodes is maintained only in the successfully invaginated tubule cells, independent of the depth of invagination. The placode cells that failed to invaginate and remained in the epidermis lost their <italic>trh</italic> expression.

We propose that under these two mechanisms, the only successfully invaginated cells establish tight coupling between different hierarchies, tracheal cell fate and tubular architecture. <italic>trh</italic>-positive placode cells that do not take part in tubules lose their <italic>trh</italic> expression and adopt the epidermal fate with a flat sheet architecture.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Driving forces of morphogenesis and the stable structures of epithelial tissue</title><p>We found that in <italic>trh</italic> mutants, a subset of the would-be tracheal placode cells undergo invagination but fail to maintain the invaginated structure.

We consider that our results based on live imaging of early tracheal invagination processes identified crucial tracheal cell behavior that was missed in previous works that mainly focused on late embryonic phenotypes. The phenotype of <italic>trh</italic> mutants indicates that the conversion of the epithelial sheet of the tracheal placode into a tube through invagination and the stabilization of the invaginated structures are genetically separable steps. In addition, inductive signals, such as JAK/STAT signaling, are considered to prime both tracheal differentiation (i.e., <italic>trh</italic> expression) and invagination separably. This finding is also consistent with the idea that morphogenetic movement and cell differentiation can be uncoupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ip et al., 1994</xref>). We suggest that epithelial tissue can assume two alternative stable structures, sheet or tube, and according to cell fate, each epithelial tissue assumes one of these structures. In the tracheal system, invagination forces include the contraction of myosin cables regulated by EGF signaling and a cell migratory force stimulated by FGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kondo and Hayashi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nishimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ogura et al., 2018</xref>). If both signaling pathways are absent, transient tissue instability caused by clustered mitosis allows invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kondo and Hayashi, 2013</xref>). This mitotic cue is sufficient for the conversion of the Trh + placodes from the sheet state to the more stable tube state. Once invaginated by any driving forces, the tracheal cells robustly maintain the invaginated structure under the control of Trh.</p><p>In <italic>trh</italic> mutants, although the placode cells are able to initiate invagination, the degree of invagination is much smaller than that of the control. This is consistent with our recent report that <italic>trh</italic> controls the propagation of EGFR activation but not the initial activation of EGFR in the placodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ogura et al., 2018</xref>), indicating that <italic>trh</italic> contributes to tracheal invagination through EGFR signaling propagation in part. However, even when both EGFR and FGFR signaling are lost, Trh+ cells are able to maintain the invaginated structure. In addition, although <italic>btl,</italic> which encodes an FGFR, is one of the important downstream genes of <italic>trh</italic> and FGFR signaling can trigger invagination when EGFR signaling and mitosis 16 are eliminated in the placodes, the <italic>btl</italic>-OE in the <italic>trh</italic> mutants was not sufficient to rescue invagination and tubule maintenance. These results indicate that the maintenance of the invaginated structure is largely dependent on <italic>trh</italic> in an EGFR and FGFR signaling-independent manner.</p><p>While canonical tissue-folding processes are driven by apically concentrated myosin through active apical constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin and Goldstein, 2014</xref>), tracheal invagination has unique properties, including passive apical constriction under centripetal pressure from neighboring cells, the acceleration of the invagination through mitotic cell rounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kondo and Hayashi, 2013</xref>), and a lack of apically concentrated myosin localization in the invaginating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kondo and Hayashi, 2013</xref>). This is consistent with a recent report that myosin regulatory light chain depletion using the deGradFP system does not cause significant abnormalities in tracheal morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ochoa-Espinosa et al., 2017</xref>). Candidates for Trh-downstream effectors that maintain invaginated structures are Crossveinless-c (cv-c), a Rho family GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP), and Crumbs (Crb), both of which are expressed in the tracheal cells under the control of <italic>trh</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brodu and Casanova, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Letizia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Röper, 2012</xref>).

It has recently been reported that in the salivary gland, the overexpression of a constitutive active form of Arp2/3 activator causes reversal of invaginated structures into epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that the difference in F-actin organization is also important to stabilize epithelial structure (sheet or tube). In addition, <italic>trh</italic> is also known to re-organize microtubule structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brodu et al., 2010</xref>). During dorsal fold formation in the gastrulating fly embryo, the invaginating cells do not show apical myosin enrichment, whereas the apical microtubule network plays an important role in cell shortening through a polarity-dependent basal shift of AJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takeda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, re-organization of both F-actin and microtubule architectures, but not apically concentrated myosin, might synergistically support the maintenance of invaginated structures. Further investigation of the <italic>trh</italic>-downstream transcriptome profile and tubule stabilization mechanisms will be important for understanding the diversity of cellular mechanisms of epithelial morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Induction, priming, and completion of tracheal cell differentiation coupled with epithelial morphogenesis</title><p>We found that <italic>trh</italic> expression is strictly maintained only in invaginated cells, whereas it is extinguished in cells remaining in the adjacent surface epidermis, irrespective of the depth of invagination. Because some of the initial Trh-expressing cells do not invaginate and lose their Trh expression, the initial priming of Trh expression is not sufficient for cells to take part in invagination and does not result in autocatalytic maintenance of its expression. Therefore, there should be a mechanism that determines cells that maintain Trh expression after the initial primed state. One possibility is that these cells are predetermined independent of initial priming of <italic>trh</italic> expression before invagination and then form the tubular architecture precisely. The other possibility is that maintenance of Trh expression is tightly associated with invagination. Our data using various invagination mutants (especially the comparison between <italic>rho bnl</italic> mutants and <italic>rho CycA bnl</italic> mutants, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, as mentioned in the results section above) strongly suggest that the cells that retain <italic>trh</italic> expression and invaginated structures are not predetermined, and tissue-geometry-dependent mechanisms are involved in tight coupling of invaginated structures and Trh expression. Since Trh is essential for stabilizing invaginated structures, this coupling may ensure that only invaginated cells canalize robustly into the tracheal fate and further supports the formation of a tubular tracheal system after invagination.</p><p>Our findings strongly suggest that the <italic>R15F01</italic> CRM is crucial for invagination-restricted Trh expression and is composed of multiple enhancers and redundant epidermal silencers. We also note that because <italic>R15F01</italic> is activated in part of the placode cells before invagination, there should be a mechanism for this transient activation, regardless of tissue architecture. After invagination, <italic>R15F01</italic> activity is maintained only in invaginated cells independent of the degree of invagination, suggesting that <italic>R15F01</italic> senses both initial placode activation cues and morphogenetic invagination cues for <italic>trh</italic> expression. In addition, <italic>R15F01</italic> is also reported to be a conserved Polycomb response element (PRE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hauenschild et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schuettengruber et al., 2014</xref>). ChIP signals for several Polycomb factors, such as Polycomb, Pleiohomeotic, Polyhomeotic distal, and Dorsal switch protein 1, are highly concentrated along the <italic>R15F01</italic> region, especially in the D1 region, which shows strong silencer activity for <italic>mini-y</italic>, and this pattern is conserved across <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schuettengruber et al., 2014</xref>) (ChIP atlas; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chip-atlas.org">http://chip-atlas.org</ext-link> and GSE60428). Since these analyzes were performed using whole embryos, it is still unclear in which cells these Polycomb factors associate with the <italic>R15F01</italic> locus. It was also recently reported that some developmental enhancers can also function as PREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erceg et al., 2017</xref>). These findings suggest that <italic>R15F01</italic> functions as a developmental enhancer in tracheal cells, while it operates as a PRE in other cells, including epidermal cells. If so, counteracting this PRE activity at the <italic>trh</italic> locus only in invaginated cells may be the critical step for coupling Trh expression and tubular architecture.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Control mechanisms of <italic>R15F01</italic> CRM activity and Trh maintenance</title><p>The terminal differentiation of tracheal cells is likely to be a consequence of the relocation of tracheal primordial cells from the surface epidermis to the inside of the trachea and the suppression of the epidermal silencer activity of <italic>trh</italic>. An essential remaining question is how the tracheal cells couple Trh expression with invaginated structures during morphogenesis. This study showed that known signaling pathways involved in early tracheal morphogenesis, such as JAK-STAT, EGFR and FGFR signaling, are dispensable for maintaining <italic>R15F01</italic> activity only in invaginated cells. One possible mechanism is sensing the change in epithelial geometry from sheet to tube through mechano-transduction pathways. Cells are known to sense rigidity in their environment, mechanical stress, and their own morphology and cytoskeletal architecture and to control gene expression and chromatin organization in response to these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kirby and Lammerding, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Panciera et al., 2017</xref>). Another possibility is that the cell can detect geometrical conversion through a change in the local concentration of secreted molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilmour et al., 2017</xref>). Buckling and bending of the intestinal epithelium affect the local concentration of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) to help define the positions of stem cells in chicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shyer et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, lumen formation and the luminal accumulation of FGF promote differentiation at the zebrafish lateral line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Durdu et al., 2014</xref>). At present, we do not have evidence that any signaling pathways affected by secreted ligands or known mechano-transduction pathways, such as Hippo, Src-Arm, or Ca<sup>2+</sup>, are involved in invagination-responsive Trh expression. In addition, it is still unclear whether cells directory sense the invaginated structure to terminally differentiate into tracheal cells or whether the relocation from the surface epidermis to the inside of the embryos just allows cells to acquire a non-epidermal fate. It remains a future challenge to discriminate among these possibilities.</p><p>Because all tissues and organs must match their architecture with their cellular phenotype to function properly, similar canalization mechanisms that couple gene expression, cell fate, and tissue geometry may play fundamental roles in shaping functional organs. Although morphogenetic feedback is proposed to be important for organogenesis, the cellular mechanisms for sensing tissue geometry have only begun to be elucidated. Further study into the cellular and genetic mechanisms by which tracheal cells monitor the process of morphogenesis and adjust their cell fate would help us understand the robustness of animal

Embryos were washed in PBSTwx (PBS with 0.2% Tween 20% and 0.2% Triton X-100) 3 times for 15 min each and blocked in PBSTwx with 1% BSA for 60 min at room temperature. Samples were stained with the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight and washed in PBSTwx 3 times for 15 min each. Secondary antibody or phalloidin staining was performed at room temperature for 3 hr. The antibodies used in this study are listed in the Key Resources Table. For dpERK antibody staining, the fluorescent signal was amplified using the Tyramide Signal Amplification system with anti-mouse IgG-biotin, Reagents A and B in the ABC kit, and Cy3 Tyramide.

All images were acquired with a 63x water immersion objective (Objective C-Apochromat 63x/1.20 W, Zeiss) were smoothed with a 1-Sigma (radius) Gaussian Blur filter. The dynamic range of intensity was adjusted while avoiding saturation of the signal. For the <italic>D</italic>E-cad signal, the intensity was adjusted to show the epithelial tissue geometry more clearly; therefore, some dense signals were oversaturated.

Exact Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Tests were performed using the Wilcox_test function from the coin package. Steel-Dwass tests were performed using pSDCFlig from the NSM3 package with the Asymptotic method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Adult fly imaging</title><p>Images of 1-day-old adult flies were taken using a Leica S8APO stereomicroscope equipped with an Olympus AIR01 digital camera.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom served as a guest Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study described in the submitted manuscript from Kondo and Hayashi explores the genetic and morphological programs underlying the initial developmental stages of the tracheal system in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. Major findings described include:</p><p>• The bHLH-PAS transcription factor Trachealess (Trh), long considered a &quot;master regulator&quot; of tracheal system development, is shown to govern tracheal system differentiation only following invagination and segregation of (future) tracheal cells from the surface ectodermal layer, but to be dispensable for the definition of the tracheal domain and the invagination process itself.</p><p>• Restriction of Trh activity to differentiating cells is achieved by refining the relatively broad initial expression pattern of <italic>trh</italic>, so that expression is maintained in invaginated cells but extinguished in cells that remain at the surface. The authors identify a 5' regulatory element, <italic>R15F01</italic>, which appears to harbor the sequences critical both for maintenance and silencing of <italic>trh</italic> expression in relevant cells.</p><p>• Data is provided in an attempt to support a scenario where Trh governs tracheal system differentiation via regulation of a RhoGTPase-actomyosin cytoskeletal network.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a valuable and interesting study whose primary message is the coupling of morphogenesis (in this case- invagination of surface epidermis) with the expression pattern of a key transcription factor that governs further tissue differentiation. All three reviewers viewed both the subject matter and the quality of much of the experimental work with high regard. All three, however, raised a number of non-trivial concerns regarding the significance of different results obtained, as well as aspects of the text, which seemed at times excessive in its interpretation of the data. The major critiques and suggested ways of addressing them include the following:</p><p>I) The reported results can be divided conceptually into three groups-</p><p>1) The role of Trh: the claim that Trh function is required only subsequent to invagination is a key observation at the heart of this study, which also contrasts with current &quot;dogma&quot; in the field. It is imperative therefore that a strong case be made.</p><p>• Can the authors demonstrate that invagination followed by retraction is a prevalent phenotype in <italic>trh</italic> mutant embryos (i.e.- how often is it observed)?</p><p>• Can this be shown for full nulls (rather than/in addition to the hypomorphic <italic>trh<sup>1</sup></italic> allele)?</p><p>• Finally- the authors should explicitly address and discuss the discrepancies between their observations and those of previous studies in the Results or Discussion sections.</p><p>2) Upstream of <italic>trh</italic>: There was general agreement that the strong part of the study was the focus and analysis of how <italic>trh</italic> expression is regulated in invaginated vs. surface cells, and the identification of the <italic>R15F01</italic> regulatory element as the key mediator of this program. Two additional experiments that could support and provide added significance to this notion were requested:</p><p>• Assessment of whether driving <italic>trh</italic> expression using <italic>R15F01</italic> alone is sufficient for rescue of the <italic>trh</italic> mutant phenotype.</p><p>• Express GFP throughout the embryonic epidermis (e.g. via da-GAL4) via a UAS-based construct which also harbors <italic>R15F01</italic>, and examine whether GFP expression is silenced in the surface epidermal cells and maintained in invaginated cells of nascent salivary glands (an analogous tubular organ system). If this were to be the case, it would considerably strengthen the notion that the enhancing and silencing functions of <italic>R15F01</italic> may indeed be sensitive to &quot;tissue architecture&quot;, as claimed in the text.</p><p>3) Downstream of <italic>trh</italic>: Two of the reviewers found multiple problems and weaknesses in the sections on downregulation of Rho activity (possibly via Cv-c) and subsequent effects on actomyosin functions as a mechanism via which Trh governs tracheal morphogenesis. These related to the quality and interpretation of the data, and to the lack of coherent cellular and molecular scenarios that could account for formation of a tubular network. Given the extent of these criticisms, it appears premature to include this aspect of the study- certainly in its present state- in the manuscript, and the consensus among the reviewers is to remove it altogether. This would include the second and third sections of the Results. It is recommended, however, that demonstrations showing that invaginated tracheal cells have different expression or activation of markers than the surface epidermis be retained in some fashion, in order to support the notion of distinct fates. The authors could also speculate on possible downstream mechanisms on the basis of the Trh target list they compiled (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><p>This shortening of the text should not detract from the significance of the remaining portions of the study. Characterization of the cell biological program governed by <italic>trh</italic> will certainly merit future publication on its own.</p><p>II) The reviewers felt that a &quot;toning down&quot; of some of the language used in the text was called for, to better reflect just what the data was able to show. Much of this centered on properly interpreting the role of Trh, where two specific issues were raised:</p><p>• The <italic>trh</italic> mutant phenotype implies that Trh function is necessary for maintaining an invaginated structure, but stating that Trh mediates &quot;tube formation&quot; and &quot;tube architecture&quot; is not warranted. This (excessive) terminology appears throughout the text and in key section headings as well as the title of the paper. Alternative terms such as &quot;morphogenesis&quot; (Thus- &quot;Two-step regulation of <italic>trachealess</italic> ensures tight coupling of cell fate with morphogenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> trachea&quot; for the title) and &quot;invaginated structure&quot; rather than &quot;tube&quot;-containing terms should be substituted for the ones now used.</p><p>• Furthermore, <italic>trh</italic> expression may be turned on/maintained in the invaginated cells not because these cells somehow sense their new morphology, but because they have adopted a non-epidermal fate. This interpretation should be brought up and included when discussing the significance of the results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45145.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a valuable and interesting study whose primary message is the coupling of morphogenesis (in this case- invagination of surface epidermis) with the expression pattern of a key transcription factor that governs further tissue differentiation.

These TALEN alleles are supposed to be null, as described below. We have added this statement in the Results section (subsection “<italic>trh</italic> is required to maintain invaginated structures”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Can this be shown for full nulls (rather than/in addition to the hypomorphic trh<sup>1</sup> allele)?</p></disp-quote><p>As we previously reported (Kondo et al., 2014), each TALEN allele has a frameshift mutation in the most upstream common exon among all isoforms. We predicted the amino acid sequences of the <italic>trh<sup>A14-3</sup></italic> and <italic>trh<sup>B16-11</sup></italic> mutants and demonstrated that both frameshift mutations lead to premature translational termination and the loss of the PAS A, PAS B and transcription activation domains in Figure 1—figure supplement 2A. The A14-3 allele also loses the bHLH domain. In addition, we showed that no anti-Trh signal was observed in the <italic>trh<sup>A14-3/B16-11</sup></italic> mutants in Figure 1—figure supplement 2B. These results indicate that these alleles are null. We have shown that the heteroallelic combination of these two alleles replicated the phenotype observed with <italic>trh<sup>1</sup></italic> (Figure 1D-G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Finally- the authors should explicitly address and discuss the discrepancies between their observations and those of previous studies in the Results or Discussion sections.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>The trh</italic> mutant phenotype that we observed contradicted previous reports claiming that <italic>trh</italic> is required for invagination(Isaac and Andrew, 1996; Wilk et al., 1996). This conclusion was based mainly on the observation of a complete lack of tracheal structures and late tracheal markers in stage 15 or later. By looking closely into published data in the literature, we noted that signs of tracheal invagination are detectable in the early stage but are lost later in <italic>trh</italic> mutants (see, for example, Chung et al., 2011, Figure 2B, J, M, Figure 4B, E). The live imaging data in our present study provided definitive proof for the role of <italic>trh</italic> in the maintenance of the invaginated structures. We stated this point in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Upstream of trh: There was general agreement that the strong part of the study was the focus and analysis of how trh expression is regulated in invaginated vs. surface cells, and the identification of the R15F01 regulatory element as the key mediator of this program. Two additional experiments that could support and provide added significance to this notion were requested:</p><p>• Assessment of whether driving trh expression using R15F01 alone is sufficient for rescue of the trh mutant phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>R15F01</italic> activity is later and/or limited to a smaller number of trachealcells than <italic>R14E10</italic> (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). <italic>trh</italic>-overexpression by <italic>R15F01-GAL4</italic> in the <italic>trh</italic> mutants partially rescued tracheal morphogenesis (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). While the invagination anomaly of the <italic>trh</italic> mutants was not fully rescued at stage 12, <italic>R15F01</italic>-driven <italic>trh</italic> was able to maintain invaginated structures, although they showed an incomplete branching pattern, possibly due to a limited number of <italic>R15F01-</italic>positivecells. These results are consistent with the idea that <italic>R15F01</italic> activity is maintained in invaginated cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Express GFP throughout the embryonic epidermis (e.g. via da-GAL4) via a UAS-based construct which also harbors R15F01, and examine whether GFP expression is silenced in the surface epidermal cells and maintained in invaginated cells of nascent salivary glands (an analogous tubular organ system). If this were to be the case, it would considerably strengthen the notion that the enhancing and silencing functions of R15F01 may indeed be sensitive to &quot;tissue architecture&quot;, as claimed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this experiment is an important challenge, and we have performed additional experiments following the reviewer’s suggestion. We constructed 3xUAS and 3xUAS-<italic>R15F01</italic>-fused GFP reporters and integrated them into the same landing site (attP2). When we crossed them with arm-GAL4, which is an epithelial ubiquitous GAL4 driver, the 3xUAS-GFP reporter activity was detected ubiquitously with intense activity in surface epidermal and tubular hindgut cells. Since the reporter activity in salivary gland cells was relatively weak in our experimental setting, we focused on these two tissues. When we crossed the 3xUAS-<italic>R15F01</italic>-fused GFP reporter with arm-GAL4, epidermal GFP expression was repressed, while hindgut GFP expression was still detectable. Embryos harboring only the 3xUAS-<italic>R15F01</italic>-fused GFP reporter without arm-GAL4 did not show hindgut GFP expression, indicating that the hindgut activity was driven by GAL4. These results are also consistent with the notion that the silencing activity of <italic>R15F01</italic> is prominent in surface epidermal cells but is not functional in the cells of internal tubular organs relocated from the surface epidermis. We have added these results as Figure 5G-I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Downstream of trh: Two of the reviewers found multiple problems and weaknesses in the sections on downregulation of Rho activity (possibly via Cv-c) and subsequent effects on actomyosin functions as a mechanism via which Trh governs tracheal morphogenesis.

According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we decided to remove the section related to factors downstream of Trh and describe possible downstream mechanisms from the Discussion section. We will publish these results elsewhere in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>II) The reviewers felt that a &quot;toning down&quot; of some of the language used in the text was called for, to better reflect just what the data was able to show.
