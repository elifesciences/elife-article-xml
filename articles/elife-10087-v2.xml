The cytokine profile of γδ T cells is hard-wired already during thymic development. Yet, the molecular pathways underlying this phenomenon are incompletely understood. Here we show that signaling via the NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK) is essential for the formation of a fully functional γδ T cell compartment. In the absence of NIK, development of Vγ5<sup>+</sup> dendritic epidermal T cells (DETCs) was halted in the embryonic thymus, and impaired NIK function caused a selective loss of IL-17 expression by γδ T cells. Using a novel conditional mutant of NIK, we could show in vivo that NIK signaling in thymic epithelial cells is essential for the thymic hardwiring of γδ T cell cytokine production.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10087.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10087.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10087.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our bodies are protected from infection and disease by several different types of immune cells.

However, while the essential role of αβ T cells and B cells for the induction of long-lasting protective immune responses is undisputed, γδ T cells due to their low abundance in peripheral lymphoid organs have been often ignored by the scientific community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allison and Havran, 1991</xref>). This has changed in the past decade, as it became evident that γδ T cells are important players not only during protective immune reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lockhart et al., 2006</xref>), but also in various models of autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Petermann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pantelyushin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Several features distinguish γδ T cells from their αβ counterparts (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vantourout and Hayday, 2013</xref>). Most notably, γδ T cells recognize qualitatively different antigens. The scope of the potential antigens has not been revealed entirely, but known targets include non-classical MHC molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Strid et al., 2008</xref>), phosophoantigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Constant et al., 1994</xref>) as well as a discrete set of non-self proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zeng et al., 2012</xref>). The second main characteristic of γδ T cells is their ability for rapid production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as INF-γ and IL-17 independent of TCR engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sutton et al., 2009</xref>). This feature has been suggested to be hardwired in developing γδ T cells already during thymic development, probably in dependency of self-antigen recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jensen et al., 2008</xref>). The surface molecule CD27, which belongs to the tumor necrosis (TNF) receptor superfamily has been shown to distinguish IFN-γ-producing from IL-17-producing γδ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ribot et al., 2009</xref>), as does the differential expression of the transcription factors T-bet and RORγt and certain chemokine receptors such as CCR6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haas et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Although the genetic diversity of the TCR γδ locus would theoretically allow an even higher number of different TCR specificities than for αβ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonneville et al., 2010</xref>), γδ T cells show a remarkable limitation in their TCR variability. Moreover, γδ T cells with a given TCR specificity often home to non-lymphoid organs, where the majority of mature γδ T cells can be found. The prime example of tissue homing-behavior is observed in dendritic epidermal T cells (DETCs), which are found in the murine epidermis and almost exclusively express a clonotypic TCR consisting of the Vγ5 and Vδ1 chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asarnow et al., 1988</xref>). Vγ5<sup>+</sup> DETCs are among the very first T cells to develop during embryogenesis, populating the epidermis already around day 15/16 of fetal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xiong et al., 2004</xref>). Also other subsets of γδ T cells, such as Vγ4<sup>+ </sup>γδ T cells (mostly IL-17 producers), which migrate predominantly to the dermis and lung tissue, have been shown to develop only early in ontogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allison and Havran, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Prinz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The underpinning signaling pathways and precise developmental program as well as the mechanisms underlying the pre-determined cytokine profile of γδ T cells have been only partially resolved. One major step forward was the identification of Skint-1 (Selection and upkeep of intraepithelial T cells-1), which has an essential function for the development of Vγ5<sup>+</sup> DETCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lockhart et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lewis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyden et al., 2008</xref>). Expression of Skint-1 by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbee et al., 2011</xref>) leads to a signaling cascade in developing γδ thymocytes that induces the typical gene expression profile of DETCs, concomitant to their preferential homing to the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Turchinovich and Hayday, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vantourout and Hayday, 2013</xref>). On the other hand, the induction of the typical gene signature of IL-17-producing Vγ4<sup>+ </sup>γδ T cells depends on the function of the transcription factor Sox13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray et al., 2013</xref>), while the required receptors remain elusive.</p><p>It has been known for some time that signaling pathways leading to activation of NFκB are essential for the function of various immune cell compartments (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li and Verma, 2002</xref>). The so-called classical pathway of NFκB activation is induced mainly by molecular danger signals such as LPS or certain cytokines such as TNF or IL-1β. Non-canonical NFκB signaling, which requires the NFκB-inducing kinase (hereafter referred to as NIK, the encoding gene being <italic>Map3k14</italic>,) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malinin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yin, 2001</xref>) is activated by a discrete subset of TNF family members, including CD40L, Lymphotoxin (LT), BAFF (B cell activating factor) and RANKL (Receptor activator of NFκB ligand). Signaling via the non-canonical pathway has been shown to fulfill roles in B cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sen, 2006</xref>), activation of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matsumoto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ribot et al., 2009</xref>), maturation and function of dendritic cells (DCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hofmann et al., 2011</xref>) as well as the induction of tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonneville et al., 2010</xref>), but it has not been studied in the context of γδ T cell biology in detail. Previous work has suggested that signaling via the CD70-CD27 axis (which belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily) can activate NFκB p52 processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ribot et al., 2010</xref>). Also, LTβR signaling has been implicated in the differentiation program of bulk γδ thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Silva-Santos, 2005</xref>), and the NFκB family members RelA and RelB were shown to guide the development of IL-17-producing Vγ4<sup>+ </sup>γδ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Powolny-Budnicka et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the genesis of invariant NKT cells was claimed to depend on signaling via NIK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elewaut et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In the present study we set out to systematically analyze the impact of non-canonical NFκB signaling on the development and function of γδ T cells. In line with previous studies that were using knockout models of the TNF receptor family member RANKL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>) we found that NIK-deficient mice showed a drastic loss of DETCs in the epidermis. Of note, in the absence of NIK most of the IL-17 production by splenic and lung-resident γδ T cells was lost, while their ability to express IFN-γ was not affected. Mechanistically, this was accompanied by a loss of <italic>Rorc</italic> and <italic>Sox13</italic> expression in NIK-deficient CD27<sup>- </sup>γδ T cells, while in turn expression of <italic>Tbet</italic> and <italic>Egr3</italic> was increased.

Indeed, these cells were present in NIK-deficient thymi, albeit at reduced numbers and with a consistent reduction in staining intensity of the TCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In order to assess the maturation status of the developing Vγ5<sup>+</sup> thymocytes, we evaluated the expression level of various molecules that have been associated with normal DETC development, such as CD45RB, CD122, CD24 and CD62L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lewis et al., 2006</xref>).

Contrary to the findings by Eshima and colleagues we could not observe a consistent overall reduction in the number of γδ T cells (except the DETC pool), yet we observed functional impairment of CD27<sup>-</sup> IL-17-producing γδ T cells. This discrepancy might result from two mutually non-exclusive explanations: first, <italic>aly/aly</italic> mice as well as <italic>Map3k14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice due to their complex phenotype (including impairment of thymic negative selection) are prone to develop some degree of tissue inflammation over time, which is accompanied by an expansion of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsubata et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishimaru et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>) and could thereby induce a relative decrease in the proportion of γδ T cells. Second, it has recently been established that the γδ T cell compartment cannot be fully reconstituted using bone-marrow chimeric animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gray et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haas et al., 2012</xref>). Using a genetic model that allows the cell-type specific deletion of NIK avoids all these confounding phenotypes of mice in which the gene locus of NIK (<italic>Map3k14</italic>) has been deleted in the germ-line.</p><p>Two members of the TNFR family, namely CD40 and RANK, have been implicated both in the development of DETCs and full maturation of mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hikosaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2008</xref>). In embryogenesis, these events occur at similar time points post conception, and it seems that in the embryonic thymus, developing DETC precursors signal via the RANKL-RANK axis to immature mTECs, inducing their full maturation to Aire<sup>+</sup> MHC-II<sup>high</sup> mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, <italic>Tnfrsf11a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice have reduced numbers of DETCs. Given that NIK is downstream of RANK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Darnay et al., 1999</xref>), one would expect a similar phenotype in <italic>Map3k14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals, but the DETC deficiency that we observed in newborn <italic>Map3k14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was much more pronounced than in <italic>Tnfrsf11a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals, suggesting that during DETC development several upstream receptors converge in their signaling to NIK, making it a key pathway during thymic DETC development. Importantly, our data obtained using the conditional NIK-mutant strongly suggests that for normal function of the γδ T cell compartment, NIK signaling does not act γδ cell-intrinsically but in trans by its function in thymic epithelial cells. Conditional deletion of NIK solely in thymic epithelial cells was sufficient to copy the DETC phenotype seen in complete germ-line NIK-knockout animals. We believe this to be the first genetic <italic>in vivo</italic> demonstration that non-canonical NFκB signaling is not required in DETCs in a cell-intrinsic manner, but through its activity in TECs.</p><p>The ability of CD27<sup>- </sup>γδ T cells to rapidly produce IL-17 even after being activated only by cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sutton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ribot et al., 2009</xref>) has been the focus of intense research. Only the neonatal thymic microenvironment appears to have the capacity to imprint a stable cytokine profile to γδ T cells, since the IL-17-producing γδ T cell subsets cannot be reconstituted in adult animals by bone marrow transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haas et al., 2012</xref>). Very recently, a hallmark paper has provided mechanistic insights into how this can be achieved: during embryonic development of certain γδ T cell subsets, the signaling threshold for activation of the TCR becomes markedly altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wencker et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, mature γδ T cells do not necessarily rely on a TCR stimulation as “‘signal one”’, although they can still respond to that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Strid et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>However, while this intriguing mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wencker et al., 2013</xref>) explains the behavior of several γδ T cell subsets, the thymic cues orchestrating this hard-wiring of γδ T cells remain unclear. Previous work suggested either LTβR-dependent trans-conditioning by double positive thymocytes or γδ T cell intrinsic RelB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Silva-Santos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Powolny-Budnicka et al., 2011</xref>). Further work by Silva-Santos and colleagues emphasized the role of TNF-receptor family members such as CD27 as well as NFκBp52 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ribot et al., 2010</xref>). However, the contribution of thymic stromal cells to these processes has not been experimentally addressed <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our data suggest that NFκB signaling via NIK seems to be dispensable both within CD27<sup>- </sup>γδ T cells as well as αβ T cells, at least for their ability for expression of pro-inflammatory IL-17. Of note, deletion of NIK in all thymic epithelial cells using <italic>Foxn1-Cre</italic> phenocopied the complete NIK-knockout in terms of IL-17 expression by CD27<sup>-</sup>γδ T cells, while this was not the case using <italic>Ccl19-Cre</italic>. The latter has been reported to target only maturing medullary thymic epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Onder et al., 2015</xref>). This would suggest that the instruction of γδ T cells is mediated by early or junctional TECs, or that the timing of <italic>Ccl19-Cre</italic>-mediated recombination sharply coincides with the expression of the γδ T cell instructing program in TECs. Based on our observation that NIK signaling in the early thymic stroma has a profound and long-lasting effect on the maturation and cytokine profile of developing γδ T cells, further studies are required in order to precisely define the nature of γδ T cell instructing molecules, and which thymic epithelial cell type is required for delivery. While our data does not exclude a role for canonical-NFκB signaling via RelA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Powolny-Budnicka et al., 2011</xref>), the impact of non-canonical signaling via NIK on the development of DETC precursors and IL-17-producing γδ T cells stems from signaling within the thymic stroma, for which the conditional NIK mutant is a unique tool for further studies. Future work will reveal whether NIK-deficient thymic stroma influences only γδ T cell development, or also the functional profile of the subsequently emerging αβ T cell compartment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and animal experiments</title><p>C57Bl/6 (wildtype) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and bred in-house at the Laboratory Animal Science Center (LASC) of the University of Zurich under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. <italic>Map3k14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were kindly provided by Robert Schreiber (Washington University School of Medicine, USA), backcrossed to C57Bl/6 background and bred in-house.

This paper is not cited and should be discussed.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for not including the work by Eshima et al. in our original reference list. However, this study investigates the mere presence or absence of γδ T cells in various organs, and has in our opinion the following limitations: First and foremost, bone marrow chimeric mice do not permit the study of γδ T cell development and function, because chimeric mice do not reconstitute all γδ T cell compartments (Haas et al., Immunity, 2012 and Gray et al., JI, 2011). Second, neither in Materials and methods nor in the figure legend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) do Eshima et al. state how the absolute numbers of γδ T cells have been measured and calculated. In our hands, systematic quantification of the γδ T cell pool in large numbers of NIK<sup>-/-</sup> mice never showed such a drastic reduction of absolute γδ T cell counts in spleen, blood or lung. The relative reduction of TCRγδ<sup>+</sup> cells within the CD3 gate could also be explained by an expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We have included and discussed the study by Eshima et al. in our revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) A major conceptual gap which is neither addressed nor properly discussed is which upstream receptor(s) control NIK activity in CD27<sup>-</sup> γδ T cells. Is it LTbR? Or RANK? The issue of upstream receptors is also relevant for DETC development since NIK<sup>-/-</sup> mice have a stronger phenotype than RANK<sup>-/-</sup> animals. The authors should at a minimum discuss these issues carefully. Another possibility would be to stimulate thymic stroma (from FTOC) with agonists for these receptors and biochemically check NIK activation.</italic> </p><p>We regret to not have clarified this important point better. Based on our analysis of the conditional NIK allele, NIK signaling neither within γδ T cells nor in αβ T cells is required for the expression of IL17. Instead, only the TEC-specific knockout of NIK led to a loss of IL17 secretion by γδ T cells. Hence, at least for this function of γδ T cells, γδ T cell intrinsic NIK activity is not essential.</p><p>We have revised the discussion of this aspect in our revised manuscript in order to state clearly that NIK signaling probably via activation of LTβR and RANK in thymic epithelial cells is required for IL-17 secretion by γδ T cells.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows reduced IL-17 producers in the spleen and lung of NIK<sup>-/-</sup> mice. What about the dermis – in steady-state and upon psoriasis induction – a model fully established in the Becher lab? Furthermore, how is the disease scored in these animals (if there is an IL-17 phenotype in the dermis)?</italic> </p><p>We have performed additional experiments to analyze the cytokine production by γδ T cells in the dermis, as well as the clinical response of NIK-deficient mice to Aldara-induced skin inflammation. We found that during steady state the functional impairment of NIK-deficient dermal γδ T cells was comparable to the lung γδ T cell compartment. This resulted in a minor change in clinical score after Aldara-induced skin inflammation and a modest albeit not significant reduction of skin thickness. One likely explanation is that innate lymphocytes also contribute to the delivery of IL-17 and IL-22 to the inflamed skin and are likely to compensate for the loss of γδ T cell derived IL-17 (Pantelyushin et al., JCI, 2012).</p><p>These additional datasets have been included and discussed in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: what is the embryonic THYMIC Vγ5<sup>+</sup> phenotype (at E15-E16) of the CCL19-conditional NIK<sup>-/-</sup> mice?</italic> </p><p>We have attempted those experiments over the past months and observed that the timing of CCL19-Cre mediated recombination of the NIK gene locus in our hands appears too variable to draw definitive experimental conclusions. That is the reason why we decided to target thymic epithelial cells using FoxN1-Cre, which is active earlier and in our hands had a consistent penetrance. We have discussed this aspect in the context of point 5 and amended the Discussion of our manuscript accordingly.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: in comparison with FoxN1-conditional NIK<sup>-/-</sup> mice, what is the SPLENIC IL-17 phenotype of CCL19-conditional NIK<sup>-/-</sup> animals? (This could also be shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</italic> </p><p>This astute question relates also to point 4. Our analysis of the IL17-production by splenic γδ T cells in CCL19-Cre NIK<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice showed no difference compared to littermate controls. This is in contrast to our observations with FoxN1-Cre NIK<sup>flox/flox</sup> animals, and in all likelihood a result of the different time points of Cre expression during development in these two strains: while FoxN1-Cre targets all TECs from an early embryonic stage onwards (Gordon et al., BMC Dev Biol., 2007), CCL19-Cre is active only in maturing mTECs (Onder et al., EJI, 2015). Since the “window” for the development of IL-17-producing γδ T cells is tightly regulated within an early stage in the embryonic thymus (Haas et al., Immunity, 2012), this would explain our observations using these two different Cre lines. In addition, as mentioned above, we have observed variability in the penetrance of the CCL19 transgene, which might also reflect the delicate timing in the development of the thymic medulla (Onder et al., EJI, 2015). We have included and discussed the data obtained from CCL19-Cre NIK<sup>flox/flox</sup> splenic γδ T cells in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>6) The title is misleading: the effect on skin-resident γδ T cells (DETC) is not functional, but rather developmental/maturation.</italic> </p><p>We agree and have changed our title to “The NFκB-inducing kinase is essential for the developmental programming of skin-resident and IL-17-producing γδ T cells”.</p><p><italic>7) The authors should cite Ribot et al., J Immunol, 2010 in the fifth paragraph of the Introduction when discussing the role of non-canonical NKkB signalling in γδ T cell biology.

We have changed the wording in the revised version accordingly and discussed this aspect in the context of our experiments with E17 embryonic thymi (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and point 9 below).</p><p><italic>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1: V</xref>γ5<sup>+</sup> thymocyte development peaks at E15-E16, not at E19 when the analysis was performed.

However, in our revised manuscript we have included previously generated data on the development of Vγ5<sup>+</sup> DETC precursors in E17 thymi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We hope that the E17 data, which show similarly impaired development of DETC precursors as on E19, will satisfy this referee. However, we are continuing to attempt analysis of earlier time points. We leave it to the editor to decide whether E17 data are sufficient or whether E16 data are still required. To do so we would require an additional 6-8 weeks in order to set up more timed pregnancies.</p><p><italic>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>: did the authors check the Vγ4 versus Vγ6 repertoire of IL-17+ γδ T cells in the lung of NIK<sup>-/-</sup> and control mice?</italic> </p><p>We have performed additional experiments to investigate this and observed that although, as reported, the overall frequency of IL-17-producing γδ T cells in the lung of NIK<sup>-/-</sup> mice was consistently reduced, the relative proportion of Vγ4<sup>+</sup> and Vγ6<sup>+</sup> cells within this pool remained unaltered. We have included this dataset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>11) Discussion: The authors should qualify their conclusion as follows &quot;the impact of non-canonical signaling via NIK on the development of DETC precursors and IL-17-producing γδ T cells stems from signaling within the thymic stroma&quot;. They cannot generalize this conclusion to other aspects of γδ T cell development which were not addressed in this study.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for this generalization and have rephrased our conclusions based on your suggestion.</p><p>In addition to the above mentioned points we have generated new data showing not only that the expression of RORc and IL23R are affected in NIK-deficient CD27<sup>-</sup>γδ T cells, but also the expression of the essential transcription factors Sox13 (Gray et al., Nat Immunol., 2013) and Egr3 (Turchinovic, Immunity, 2011) is deregulated in NIK-deficient CD27<sup>-</sup>γδ T cells. We have incorporated these additional data sets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>Also, as suggested, we have hyphenated “IL-17-producing” as well as “NFkB-inducing” throughout our text. Furthermore, when addressing gene deficient mice, we have replaced “NIK” with the official name of the gene locus, Map3k14.</p></body></sub-article></article>
