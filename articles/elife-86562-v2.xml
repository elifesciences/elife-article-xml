It includes men and women of five racial and ethnic groups: African American, Japanese American, Latino, Native Hawaiian, and White. In 2020, surviving participants were sent an invitation to complete an online survey on the impact of COVID-19 on their daily life activities, including adherence to cancer screening and treatment. Approximately 7,000 MEC participants responded. A cross-sectional analysis was performed to investigate the relationships between the postponement of regular health care visits and cancer screening procedures or treatment with race and ethnicity, age, education, and comorbidity.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Women with more education, women with lung disease, COPD, or asthma, and women and men diagnosed with cancer in the past 5 years were more likely to postpone any cancer screening test/procedure due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19 was declared a worldwide pandemic on March 11, 2020, after its discovery in late December 2019. As of March 10, 2023, 6,881,955 deaths had been reported among 676,609,955 cases worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dong et al., 2020</xref>). Due to the rapid spread and high infectivity rates, stay-at-home orders were decreed to allow for physical distancing and self-isolation. Populations at high risk of contracting COVID-19 and developing severe illness were the elderly and people of all ages with pre-existing medical conditions (such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, or cancer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">WHO, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Cancer patients were not only at a higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 but changes in cancer care were also reported. One example is the finding of the COVID-19 and Cancer Outcomes Study, which is a multicenter prospective cohort study comprised of adult patients with a current or history of hematological malignancy or invasive solid tumor, who were scheduled for an outpatient medical oncology visit at the Tisch Cancer Institute in New York City or the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Researchers found that 10% of patients in the cohort had treatment delayed during the pandemic and, of that subset, 48% had treatment delayed due to a COVID-19 diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Schmidt et al., 2020</xref>). In the United States, COVID-19 disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans, with an observed two-fold higher rate of hospitalization and a greater than two-fold higher rate of death, as compared to Non-Hispanic Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Newman et al., 2021</xref>). The disparity seen with COVID-19 was consistent with patterns of disparities observed for cancer; it is well-documented that 5-year survival rates for multiple cancers are lower in African Americans compared to White Americans. While cancer is a multifactorial disease that is influenced by genetic and environmental factors, COVID-19 is an infectious disease that is enabled by the cellular expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. However, preexisting comorbidities, socioeconomic disadvantages, living conditions, health literacy, and access to health care appear to fuel underlying risks for both cancer and COVID-19 disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Newman et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the pandemic has affected access to cancer screenings, especially for colorectal cancer (CRC) and breast cancer. The recommendation for CRC screening among average-risk adults aged 50–75 years is to undergo an annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT) or colonoscopy every 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Corley et al., 2021</xref>). Screening and appropriate follow-up can reduce incidence and mortality, which is important because CRC is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Nodora et al., 2021</xref>). One study found that CRC screening rates are particularly low in Hispanic and Asian American adults, recent immigrants, those with low incomes, and the uninsured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Nodora et al., 2021</xref>). During the COVID-19 pandemic, colorectal cancer screenings were reported to have dropped by 84.5% at a network of 20 United States institutions with more than 28 million patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">London et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>For breast cancer, which is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy and the second most lethal tumor among women in the US, the recommendation is biennial mammography in women ages 50–74 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Corley et al., 2021</xref>). In the MEC, Native Hawaiian participants have the highest risk of breast cancer, followed by Japanese American and White participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pike et al., 2002</xref>). Nationwide, the breast cancer mortality rate is 40% higher for African American patients compared with White patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>). During the COVID-19 pandemic, breast cancer screenings dropped by 89.2% at a network of 20 United States institutions with more than 28 million patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">London et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, studies have suggested that educational attainment is associated with adherence to cancer screening. For breast cancer, a positive association was found between education level and adherence to mammography screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Damiani et al., 2015</xref>). For colorectal cancer, a study on United States veterans aged 50–75 years concluded that both education and income show a statistically significant dose-dependent direct association with screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Rodriguez and Smith, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In summary, COVID-19 has impacted medical care delivery, access to cancer screening, and the day-to-day life of individuals worldwide. However, the full impact of the pandemic on cancer screenings and cancer care is not entirely known. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to understand how COVID-19 affected access to cancer screening and treatment, by studying the participants in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) study.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>The Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) was established in 1993–1996 at the University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center (UHCC) and the University of Southern California (USC) with the goals of elucidating lifestyle and genetic risk factors responsible for explaining the ethnic/racial disparities that exist for cancer and other chronic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kolonel et al., 2000</xref>). The cohort has followed over 215,000 residents of Hawai‘i and Los Angeles, aged 45–75 years old at recruitment, and includes men and women of five main ethnic and racial origins: African American, Japanese American, Latino, Native Hawaiian, and White. Participants entered the cohort by returning a 26-page mailed questionnaire. They also were sent follow-up questionnaires every five years. Disease ascertainment was primarily conducted by linking the cohort to SEER cancer registries, death certificate registries, CA hospital discharge diagnoses, and Medicare. Approximately 100,000 MEC members (median age: 82) were still alive as of 2019. Demographics (i.e. race/ethnicity, maximum years of education attained, birthplace), pre-existing and incident disease outcomes, and lifestyle risk factors were available from the MEC database.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>In May 2020, MEC participants were invited to participate in an online survey (implemented in Qualtrics) on the impact of COVID-19 on their everyday life and health-related behaviors. Emails were sent to over 39,000 and a letter to ~100,000 MEC participants. The initial and a second invitation were sent to all living MEC participants, while a third invitation was sent to those who were 75 or younger. A paper survey was provided if requested. Participants registered online by providing their Email Address, First name, Middle name, Last name, Sex, Birth year, and Zip Code. The entered data linked each participant back to the MEC database. A Spanish registration page was available for registration in Spanish. Each participant was sent a unique identifier and login to answer the survey online after providing informed consent. Participants who answered the baseline survey were invited to fill out a weekly, then, monthly shorter follow-up online survey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Paper follow-up surveys were not available. The surveys started in May 2020 and ended in April 2021. The last baseline survey (the last opportunity to enter the study) was collected on September 25, 2020. The survey was approved by the University of Hawaii (CHS 9575) and University of Southern California (HS-17–00714) Institutional Review Boards.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Timeline of the MEC COVID-19 Study.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86562-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All baseline surveys with at least 50% completion were used for this analysis. Descriptive statistics were utilized to summarize patient demographics, including means ± standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. A cross-sectional analysis was performed to investigate the relationships between the outcomes of postponement of regular health care visits and cancer screening tests/procedures/treatment with race and ethnicity, age, education, and comorbidity. Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression models of the outcomes of postponement and screening were used to calculate odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) and/or p-values (≤0.05 was taken as statistically significant) in each sex to describe these relationships using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS), version 9.4. Whites were taken as the reference group when comparing associations across racial and ethnic groups. For comorbidities, the reference was reporting no comorbidity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> presents the number of COVID-19 survey participants by various characteristics. A total of 6,974 MEC members answered the baseline survey, 6,068 via the online survey, and 906 via the paper survey. Fewer men (43.5%) than women (56.5%) responded. 76.6% of COVID survey participants were from Hawai‘i and 23.6% were from Los Angeles. The survey response rate was 7.2% for men and 6.3% for women. The racial/ethnic group with the highest response rates was White (13.2%) for men; 12% for women, followed by Japanese American (8.9; 7.4), Native Hawaiian (7.3; 7.5), Other (2.7; 4.5), African American (2.7; 2.8), and Latino (2.2; 2.0). In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, the distribution of the MEC cohort survivors in 2019 is compared with the distribution of the COVID survey participants in 2020 by race and education. For both males and females, the COVID survey respondents included a larger representation of Whites and Japanese Americans and a smaller representation of Latinos, African Americans, and Others compared to the entire 2019 surviving cohort. The proportion of the sample that was Native Hawaiians was similar to the MEC survivors. For education, a greater percentage of COVID-19 survey respondents had at least some college education compared to the entire 2019 surviving cohort. This pattern of higher attained education was observed for each racial/ethnic group.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Demographics of baseline COVID

These numbers are consistent with a report published by The Commonwealth Fund in May 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Mehrotra et al., 2020</xref>). In the U.S., early in the pandemic from February 2020, the number of visits to ambulatory care practice declined by nearly 60% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Mehrotra et al., 2020</xref>). Declines in visits varied by geographic area and clinical specialty. By April 2020, a rebound of in-person visits had occurred and appears largest in the South Central (East and West) census division (Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, and Kentucky) but the number of visits was still roughly one-third lower than before the pandemic. As in-person visits declined, telehealth visits increased rapidly before plateauing. By mid-May 2020, a rebound in visits had occurred across all specialties. But the relative decline in visits remained largest among surgical and procedural specialties and pediatrics. The greater effect on surgical and procedural specialties was observed in the MEC survey responses, as visits with eye specialists, dermatologists, cardiologists, and dentists, were more often reported to be postponed. In the Commonwealth Fund study, the relative decline was smaller in other specialties, such as adult primary care. The MEC study findings differ as visits for this specialty were the most frequently postponed in our data. In addition, researchers from Harvard Medical School examined the trends in outpatient care delivery and telemedicine in a cohort of 16,740,365 enrollees captured from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse. The weekly rate of telemedicine visits increased during the pandemic period starting from January 1, 2020, and peaking in the week of April 15, 2020, before declining by the week of June 10, 2020. By the last 4 weeks of the study period, May 20 through June 16, Hawai‘i had a –73.2% change and California had a –31.0% change from baseline in weekly total visits per 1000 members. For visits delivered via telemedicine, Hawai‘i had a 24.5% increase from baseline and California had a 29.5% increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Patel et al., 2021</xref>). Although the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in medical care, it is possible that patients who avoided hospital visits had a positive outcome of lower risk of catching COVID-19. There may have been some benefit to the strategy of keeping patients out of the hospitals and physician offices. In the baseline MEC COVID Survey, only 49 men and 68 women, overall, reported an episode of COVID-19.</p><p>The likelihood of postponing healthcare visits being related to the presence of comorbidities was also investigated. In the MEC Survey, men with heart disease (by 37%), women with hypertension (by 16%), kidney disease (by 49%), and those diagnosed with cancer in the past 5 years (by 51%) were more likely to postpone regular health care visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings were consistent with a study that examined factors associated with postponed health checkups during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hajek et al., 2021b</xref>). Researchers found the probability of postponed health checkups was positively associated with the presence of chronic disease (OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.15, 2.47), higher concern for a COVID-19 infection (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.78), and higher presumed severity of COVID-19 (OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.35).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Effect on cancer screening</title><p>Not many MEC survey respondents reported postponing a cancer screening test or procedure due to COVID-19. Only 5.7% of men and 11.0% of women did so. These numbers were lower than expected but could be explained by the older age of our sample. The recommended cut-off age for breast and colorectal cancer screening is 75 years old. Half of the respondents were aged 75 and older. However, when focusing on participants 75 years and younger, the numbers were similar to the overall sample size: 6.1% vs 5.7% of men overall and 12.3% vs 11.0% of women overall. The screening procedure the most frequently missed was mammography, followed by skin examination and colorectal cancer screening. Postponement of these cancer screening procedures is consistent with data from a published study looking at a sample of health claims clearinghouse records from 18 states containing 184 million claims from 30 million patients in 2019 and 94 million claims from 20 million patients for the first 6 months in 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Martin et al., 2022</xref>). Mammograms and Pap smears were down nearly 80% in April 2020 compared to 2019. However, numbers for both services recovered throughout the summer and fall, with Pap smears and mammograms rebounding above 2019 levels in August 2020 and November 2020, respectively. Colonoscopies were down almost 90% in mid-April 2020, compared to 2019, and in December 2020 were still down about 15% compared to the previous year, representing a substantial but incomplete rebound in care delivered. The overall number of colonoscopies performed in 2020 declined by almost 25% from 2019.</p><p>The likelihood of postponing cancer screenings was also analyzed in relation to age. In the MEC study, women with each additional year of age were less likely by 4% per year of age (OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.08; p=0.04) to postpone any cancer screening test/procedure. This finding is consistent with a study examining determinants of postponed cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hajek et al., 2021a</xref>). Multiple logistic regressions were conducted with postponed cancer screenings since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic as the outcome measure (0=no, attended as planned, 1=postponed). Regressions revealed that the likelihood of postponing cancer screening was positively associated or more likely with higher concern for a COVID-19 infection (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.16, 2.35), whereas it was negatively associated or less likely with older age (e.g. 65 years and over, OR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.89, compared to individuals 30–49 years).</p><p>Effective cancer screenings can lead to an early diagnosis of cancer and improve the 5-year relative survival rate. The CDC and the National Cancer Institute utilize a staging system called Summary Stage. Summary Stage groups invasive cancers as localized (the tumor is only in the organ it started in), regional (the tumor has spread to nearby organs, structures, or regional lymph nodes), distant (the tumor has spread to parts of the body far from where it started), and unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cent Dis Control Prev, 2023</xref>). A study conducted in 2020 examined the 5-year relative survival rate for cancers diagnosed from 2009–2015 by race and stage of diagnosis. For breast cancer, the 5-year relative survival rate for all races in the localized, regional, and distant stages is 99%, 86%, and 27%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>). For colorectal cancer, the 5-year relative survival rate for all races in the localized, regional, and distant stages is 90%, 71%, and 14%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>). For both cancers, there is an obvious decline in the survival rate with progressive disease, which is concerning as a percentage of participants elected to postpone their cancer screenings, which could lead to a delay in diagnosis. However, it is important to note that our study was conducted during a four-month period at the height of the pandemic (May to September 2020) in the United States when vaccinations for COVID-19 hadn’t been released. The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on December 10, 2020, a few months after the final baseline survey was collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">FDA, 2021</xref>). So our study does not address changes in health behaviors that may have occurred subsequent to the introduction of preventive vaccines.</p><p>The backlog of postponed or delayed cancer screenings will have a long-term clinical impact and potentially increase the cancer burden. A study from Canada examined the impact of episodic screening interruptions for breast and colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Yong et al., 2021</xref>). Using a simulation model, researchers projected a surge of cancer cases when screening resumes. For breast cancer screening, the simulation model suggests that a three-month interruption of breast cancer screening due to COVID-19 would result in 644,000 fewer screens being performed in Canada in 2020. A three-month interruption starting in 2020 could increase cases diagnosed at advanced stages (310 more) and breast cancer deaths (110 more) in Canada from 2020 to 2029. A six-month interruption starting in 2020 could lead to 670 extra advanced breast cancers and 250 additional breast cancer deaths in Canada from 2020 to 2029. For colorectal cancers, without service interruption, the simulation model estimated that 68,000 colonoscopies would have been performed in the six months since March 2020 in Canada. A six-month suspension of primary screening could increase cancer incidence by 2200 cases with 960 more cancer deaths over the lifetime. Longer interruptions, and reduced volumes of patients when screening resumes, would further increase excess cancer deaths. Since cancer diagnoses and deaths in the MEC are identified through linkages to cancer registries in HI and California, we will be able to examine whether a greater proportion of cancers were diagnosed at a late stage in the aftermath of the pandemic and investigate any differences among ethnic/racial groups. Similarly, through the linkage of the cohort to Medicare, we will be able to identify MEC members who developed COVID-19 and investigate long-term complications and survival across age and race.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Limitations</title><p>There are several limitations to our study. Although our study population is diverse, some subgroups of race/ethnicity (African Americans and Latinos) were under-represented compared to other subgroups. Additionally, the study sample is not fully representative of the entire MEC cohort, as the participants were more educated with higher percentages with at least some college education across all races/ethnicities. The survey respondents included a larger representation of Whites and Japanese Americans and a smaller representation of Latinos and African Americans compared to the MEC survivors in 2019. The effect of COVID-19 on cervical cancer screening was not investigated due to the older age of our participants. The data was self-reported so there is a chance of misclassification due to recall error. Lastly, the response rates were low across all races/ethnicities, and only 0.9% of male and 1.7% of female survey participants are living in a retirement or care home so these populations were most certainly underrepresented.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The MEC COVID-19 survey demonstrated the possibility of using a mature cohort study of well-characterized individuals to characterize the effect of a public health emergency. The study revealed associations of factors like sex, race/ethnicity, age, education level, and comorbidities with cancer-related screening and healthcare among MEC participants during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hawai‘i and Los Angeles. The MEC COVID-19 survey results were consistent with other studies regarding the postponement of healthcare visits, surgical procedures, and cancer screenings during the pandemic. In the wake of the pandemic, increased monitoring of patients in high-risk groups for cancer and other diseases is of the utmost importance as the chance of undiagnosed cases and poor prognosis due to delayed screening and/or treatment increases.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: All participants provided informed consent before filling out the survey.

Please submit a revised version that addresses these concerns directly. Although we expect that you will address these comments in your response letter, we also need to see the corresponding revision clearly marked in the text of the manuscript. Some of the comments may seem to be simple queries or challenges that do not prompt revisions to the text. Please keep in mind, however, that readers may have the same perspective as the reviewer. Therefore, it is essential that you amend or expand the text to clarify the narrative accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study takes advantage of a cohort (the multi-ethnic cohort) and conducted a survey to understand various measures that might be associated with delays to cancer screening and healthcare-seeking behaviors. Overall, this is a very good study, and the authors acknowledge the limitations of their work. One thing that might be added to the discussion is the temporal changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors, including early diagnosis of cancer or other screenings. As we know, the changes in infection rates over time and eventual access to preventive vaccines made a huge difference in the public's confidence to seek and attend healthcare; I think the author should comment on this since this work was conducted within six months during the height of the pandemic, and before vaccination.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86562.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>One thing that might be added to the discussion is the temporal changes in healthcare-seeking behaviors, including early diagnosis of cancer or other screenings.

We have clarified this as follows:</p><p>“Effective cancer screenings can lead to an early diagnosis of cancer and improve the 5-year relative survival rate. The CDC and the National Cancer Institute utilize a staging system called Summary Stage. Summary Stage groups invasive cancers as localized (the tumor is only in the organ it started in), regional (the tumor has spread to nearby organs, structures, or regional lymph nodes), distant (the tumor has spread to parts of the body far from where it started), and unknown.<sup>18</sup> A study conducted in 2020 examined the 5-year relative survival rate for cancers diagnosed from 2009 to 2015 by race and stage of diagnosis. For breast cancer, the 5-year relative survival rate for all races in the localized, regional, and distant stages is 99%, 86%, and 27%, respectively.<sup>9</sup> For colorectal cancer, the 5-year relative survival rate for all races in the localized, regional, and distant stages is 90%, 71%, and 14%, respectively.<sup>9</sup> For both cancers, there is an obvious decline in the survival rate with progressive disease, which is concerning as a percentage of participants elected to postpone their cancer screenings, which could lead to a delay in diagnosis. However, it is important to note that our study was conducted during a four-month period at the height of the pandemic (May to September 2020) in the United States when vaccinations for COVID-19 hadn’t been released. The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on December 10, 2020, a few months after the final baseline survey was collected.<sup>19</sup> So our study does not address changes in health behaviors that may have occurred subsequent to the introduction of preventive vaccines.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
