Here, we assessed the metabolomic profile of the rat hippocampus at different developmental ages both at baseline and following episodic learning. We report that the hippocampal metabolome significantly changes over developmental ages and that learning regulates differential arrays of metabolites according to age. The infant hippocampus had the largest number of significant changes following learning, with downregulation of 54 metabolites. Of those, a large proportion was associated with the glutathione-mediated cellular defenses against oxidative stress. Further biochemical, molecular, and behavioral assessments revealed that infantile learning evokes a rapid and persistent increase in the activity of neuronal glutathione reductase, the enzyme that regenerates reduced glutathione from its oxidized form. Inhibition of glutathione reductase selectively impaired long-term memory formation in infant but not in juvenile and adult rats, confirming its age-specific role. Thus, metabolomic profiling revealed that the hippocampal glutathione-mediated antioxidant pathway is differentially required for the formation of infantile memory.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metabolome</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>episodic learning</kwd><kwd>brain development</kwd><kwd>glutathione</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH065635</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alberini</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH100822</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alberini</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001068</institution-id><institution>Dana Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alberini</surname><given-names>Cristina M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hippocampal metabolomic analyses following episodic learning at different ages revealed a critical role for neuronal glutathione reductase activity in long-term infantile memory formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The hippocampus and related brain structures of the medial temporal lobe, which play critical roles in the formation of spatial and episodic memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Squire et al., 2004</xref>), undergo a protracted postnatal developmental during which significant molecular, cellular, and structural changes accompany circuit maturation and refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandeira et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lavenex and Banta Lavenex, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Travaglia et al., 2016a</xref>).

To fill this knowledge gap, we employed an untargeted metabolomic analyses in rats to determine how the hippocampal metabolome changes over the course of postnatal development under basal conditions and following inhibitory avoidance (IA) training, an aversive episodic event. We found that unique metabolomic profiles accompany learning at different ages. Subsequent biochemical, pharmacological, and behavioral studies based on unique metabolomic regulations in the infant hippocampus established that infantile learning selectively recruits the glutathione-mediated antioxidant defenses for the formation of long-term memory.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The metabolic profile of the hippocampus significantly changes across developmental ages</title><p>Metabolomic profiling was carried out on hippocampal extracts (five to seven individual replicates) obtained from untrained rats at four early prepuberal developmental ages (postnatal day 1 [PN1], PN7, PN17, and PN24) and compared to the profile obtained from young adult (PN80) rats. These ages were chosen because they correspond to critical stages in the functional development of the hippocampal memory system: at PN1 and PN7, rats cannot perform IA; at PN17, they form short-term memories that are rapidly forgotten; and at both PN24 and PN80, they form and express strong and long-lasting IA memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Travaglia et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Travaglia et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bessières et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The metabolomic profiling of the hippocampi was preformed using an untargeted ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, PCA revealed that all samples clustered without overlap into five distinct populations, which corresponded to the five developmental ages. This analysis revealed that the metabolomic profiles were homogenous among samples from each age group, whereas samples of different ages differed dramatically, suggesting that the rat hippocampus undergoes major metabolic changes over the course of development. No separation of the samples between males and females was observed following PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that there was no significant sex-related difference in the dataset (see Materials and methods section for additional information).</p><p>Next, to better characterize the changes in the hippocampal metabolome over development, we compared the total peak number, as a measure of the total number of metabolites detected at each age, and the total peak intensity (following median scaling) of the identified metabolites across ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Total peak number and scaled intensity were similar between PN1 and PN7, but then significantly increased between PN7 and PN17, increased further between PN17 and PN24, and then significantly decreased between PN24 and PN80.

From PN1 to PN7, 49.6% of the detected metabolites changed significantly, and changes were similarly distributed between up- and downregulations. Comparisons of PN17 to PN7 and PN24 to PN17 revealed significant changes in a large number of metabolites (62.78% between PN7 and PN17; 63.66% between PN17 and PN24), the majority of which were upregulated. From PN24 to PN80, 72.03% of the metabolites changed significantly, and the great majority of them were significantly downregulated.

Sphingolipids are important second messengers that play roles in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation, cell growth, cell differentiation, cell migration, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and endothelial barrier integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Soriano et al., 2005</xref>), as well as in myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schmitt et al., 2015</xref>). Myelin is a spiral extension of the oligodendroglial cell membrane that increases axonal conduction velocity and efficiency, provides additional metabolic support to axons, and stabilizes axonal projections in the developing and adult mammalian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nave, 2010</xref>). Myelin contains a very high lipid-to-protein ratio, and formation of the myelin sheath requires a high level of lipid synthesis, which is temporally regulated during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schmitt et al., 2015</xref>). In the rat hippocampus, mature myelinated fibers appear during the second postnatal week, and their distribution reaches the adult level at PN25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Meier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">van Tilborg et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with the correlation between sphinganine and the myelination rate during development, we found that the level of sphinganine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), along with those of other sphingolipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), were much lower at PN1 than at PN80.

Imidazole acetate and its derivatives are the end products of the transformation of histamine, which is produced by decarboxylation of histidine, and can act as GABA<sub>A</sub> agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Glinton et al., 2019</xref>). Imidazole propionate and imidazole lactate are also produced from histidine and can be used as precursors for the synthesis of glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Glinton et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the increase in histidine-related metabolism during development may reflect higher glutamate synthesis in juvenile rats. Consistent with this hypothesis, the hippocampal levels of glutamate and other biochemicals involved in glutamate metabolism, including aspartate, glutamine, and GABA, peaked at PN24.</p><p>Moreover, four of the six lipids were associated with carnitine/acyl carnitine metabolism: arachidonoylcarnitine (C20:4), 3-hydroxybutyrylcarnitine, linoleoylcarnitine (C18:2), and myristoylcarnitine (C14); all peaked between PN17 and PN24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Carnitine and its acyl derivatives are important transporters of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for β-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jones et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the increase in the level of acyl carnitines during the first 3 weeks of life may indicate that the level of fatty acid β-oxidation is higher in the juvenile brain than in adulthood. In line with this hypothesis, previous studies revealed the ability of the developing brain to use ketone bodies through β-oxidation, as a complementary source of energy to sustain the dramatic metabolic demands of the brain during its development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cremer, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dombrowski et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nehlig, 2004</xref>). Finally, the decrease in nucleotide levels between PN1 and adulthood (aside from adenine, for which the level increased gradually from PN1 to PN24) may reflect a reduction in DNA and RNA synthesis, and hence a decrease in cell proliferation, over the course of postnatal development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Significant changes in the levels of carbohydrates and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites over development</title><p>Carbohydrates and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-related metabolites function as major metabolic substrates to fuel multiple cellular functions, including synthesis of neurotransmitters, nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids, needed for cell and axonal growth, myelination, and synapse formation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brekke et al., 2015</xref>).

In fact, the level of the oxidized form of glutathione (GSSG) significantly decreased after IA training at PN17, along with that of cysteine, a rate-limiting substrate in the biosynthesis of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) and five other major metabolites involved in cellular defense against oxidative stress: <italic>S</italic>-lactoylglutathione, the methyl donor <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine (SAM), 5-oxoproline, ascorbate, and alpha-tocopherol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and d</xref>). Despite cysteine decreases at 1 hr following learning, at this time point we did not detect significant change in GSH level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and d</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that the decrease in cysteine may not be linked to GSH biosynthesis but rather serves as a substrate for de novo protein synthesis, a process known to be required for long-term memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2009</xref>). None of these changes were observed at PN24 and PN80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b and c</xref>), indicating that infantile learning leads to differential activation of the cellular antioxidant defense.</p><p>The reasons why these antioxidant defense pathways are recruited only following infantile learning is unclear. We speculate that this recruitment could result from higher oxidative stress induced by higher metabolic activity underlying memory formation in infancy. Indeed, neuronal electrical activity is known to raise ATP demands, which must be met by increased metabolic activity, particularly oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Harris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fernandez-Fernandez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bolaños, 2016</xref>), which results in an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the mitochondrial respiratory chain, potentially leading to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hongpaisan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brennan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Frisard and Ravussin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Quijano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cobley et al., 2018</xref>). At any age, memory formation requires a great deal of energy as it involves, in addition to neuronal neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attwell and Laughlin, 2001</xref>), numerous cellular and molecular mechanisms in many cell types, which cooperate in producing the changes needed for memory consolidation and storage. One of these mechanisms is de novo protein synthesis, one of the most energy-costly processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buttgereit and Brand, 1995</xref>). Given the fact that infantile learning engages distinct biological mechanisms, which promote developmental maturation of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Travaglia et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bessières et al., 2020</xref>), we suggest that the high antioxidant response observed in the infant brain following learning may result from both a higher energy requirement necessary to promote the developmental maturation and an insufficient antioxidant capacity to contrast the consequent high level of oxidative stress induced by the increased metabolic demands. However, this explanation may be contrasted by a recent study showing that the mitochondrial respiration rate (i.e. metabolic activity) in neurons and astrocytes is inversely correlated to ROS production, hence potential oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lopez-Fabuel et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, it is likely that in order to promote developmental maturation, infantile learning recruits more energy compared to the adult, hence it differentially engages metabolic mechanisms in different cell types. In fact, adult rodents forming hippocampus-dependent memories recruit hippocampal astrocytes, which mostly rely on glycolysis, to provide energy to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Newman et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the higher energy demands of the infant brain supporting learning may over solicit astrocytes, which, compared to neurons, exhibit a lower mitochondrial respiration rate leading to a higher ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lopez-Fabuel et al., 2016</xref>). Future studies should assess the contributions of astrocytic-neuronal metabolic coupling associated to hippocampus-dependent memory formation in infants relative to adults.</p><p>Significant alterations in amino acid levels were also detected following training at PN17 and not at PN24, with 11 of 20 proteinogenic amino acids exhibiting statistically significant decreases (cysteine, asparagine, valine, alanine, tryptophan, glutamine, lysine, histidine, proline, serine, glutamate). One likely cause of these decreases is that these amino acids are rapidly consumed by learning-induced translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Salinas et al., 1990</xref>). It is also possible that, because infantile learning is more energy-demanding than learning at later ages, amino acids are used as an energy source. Infantile training also resulted in changes in glycolytic and TCA cycle intermediates, particularly in decreases in lactate, erythronate, fumarate, and malate implying that learning leads to a higher metabolic rate in the TCA cycle.</p><p>In addition, glutamate and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), as well as biochemicals involved in glutamate/glutamine/GABA metabolism, including asparagine, glutamine, <italic>N</italic>-acetylaspartate, and <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG), significantly decreased following training at PN17, suggesting that the hippocampus of infant rats rapidly consumes these neurotransmitters in response to learning.</p><p>On the other hand, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, the top three biochemicals upregulated by learning in adulthood were histidine-derived metabolites (1-methyl-4-imidazoleacetate, imidazole propionate, and gamma-glutamylhistidine). As previously mentioned, imidazole acetate and its derivatives can act as GABA<sub>A</sub> agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Glinton et al., 2019</xref>). Imidazole propionate is also produced from histidine and is used as precursor for the synthesis of glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Glinton et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the increase in imidazole propionate 1 hr after training may be due to the high level of glutamate synthesis and utilization after learning in adulthood. The increase in gamma-glutamylhistidine, a dipeptide composed of gamma-glutamate and histidine, after training at PN80 may reflect learning-induced incomplete breakdown product of protein degradation or learning-dependent synthesis of this peptide by formal condensation of the gamma-carboxy group of glutamate with the amino group of histidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kakimoto and Konishi, 1976</xref>). Furthermore, the learning-induced increase in the adult hippocampus of acylcarnitines (i.e. palmitoleoylcarnitine [C16:1], myristoylcarnitine [C14], oleoylcarnitine [C18:1], and palmitoylcarnitine [C16]) suggests that training leads to an increase in beta-oxidation of fatty acids in hippocampal mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jones et al., 2010</xref>). Catabolism of fatty acids could serve as an additional energy supply in adult brain after learning, but it remains unclear whether this increase is triggered by higher energy demand in trained animals or an adaptation to accept also lipids as energy substrates.</p><p>Finally, the significant decrease in two glycolytic metabolites, 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenol pyruvate, with adult learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>) suggests that glycolysis is differentially recruited in adult learning, in agreement with previous studies showing that glycolysis plays an essential role in brain plasticity and memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Newman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Descalzi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Future investigation shall analyze the relationship between developmental and learning-induced changes.

Furthermore, aside from the glutamate level, which reached a peak at PN24, the levels of the precursor amino acids cysteine and glycine were significantly lower at PN17 than at PN24 and PN80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), suggesting either a lower de novo GSH synthesis capacity or a higher rate of consumption at PN17 relative to the juvenile and adult ages.</p><p>Western blot analysis of dorsal hippocampal extracts from PN17, PN24, and PN80 rats revealed that the level of GR was significantly lower at PN17 than in adulthood, whereas that of GPx isozyme 1 was 45% higher at PN17 compared to PN24 and almost 100% higher relative to PN80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). These data suggested that there is a higher rate of glutathione oxidation in the infant brain. In addition, the levels of GCLC were similar across developmental ages, whereas the levels of GCLM at PN24 were 135% higher compared to PN17 and 70% higher compared to PN80. Finally, GSy was present at a higher concentration in adulthood than at infant and juvenile ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). These results support the idea that the infant brain has a lower capacity for de novo GSH synthesis compared to juvenile and adult brains.</p><p>Finally, we determined how the enzymatic activity of GR, GPx, GCL, and GSy change across development in the dHC. The levels of GR and GPx activity were significantly higher at PN17 and PN24 compared to PN80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>), suggesting a higher rate of glutathione oxidation/reduction cycle during development compared to adulthood. Moreover, the level of activity of GCL dramatically increased between PN17 and PN24 and then decreased in adulthood at a level that however remained significantly elevated compared to PN17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Likewise, the activity of GSy was significantly higher at PN24 and PN80 compared to PN17. These results, in line with the protein expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), suggest a reduced de novo GSH synthesis in infancy compared to juveniles and adults, which could be explained by a lower level of the rate-limiting GSH precursor cysteine and/or of GCLM at PN17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b and c</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these results suggest that the infant hippocampus has a lower glutathione-mediated antioxidant defense capacity relative to the juvenile and adult hippocampi.

Hence, we hypothesized that the learning-induced increase in the GSH/GSSG ratio could result from changes in the enzymatic activity of GR, GPx, GCL, and/or GSy. Assessments at 15 min, 1 hr, 24 hr, or 7 days after IA training at PN17 revealed that only the activity of GR significantly increased at 15 min after training relative to untrained controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>) and remained significantly elevated at 1 and 24 hr after training before returning to baseline by 7 days post-training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). These results suggest that learning at PN17 induces an increase in the regeneration of GSH from GSSG, while it does not change the conversion of GSH into GSSG and the biosynthesis of GSH. The mechanisms by which GR activity increases following learning without a change in GR expression level itself are not known. We speculate that this increased activity may result from posttranslational modifications and/or allosteric interactions with the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Deponte, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Krauth-Siegel et al., 2005</xref>).

We found that infant learning significantly increases GSH level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>) while decreasing GSSG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f</xref>) at 15 min after learning. While the level of GSH was back to basal level at 1 and 24 hr after training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>), at the same time points, the levels of GSSG remained significantly lower than those of untrained control rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f</xref>). This time course is consistent with our metabolomic data showing that GSSG was significantly decreased while GSH was unchanged relative to untrained controls at 1 hr after training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). However, the reason why GSH rapidly returned to basal level (at the 1 hr time point) while GSSG remains reduced and GR activity elevated compared to untrained rats remains unknown. One explanation could be that GSH is rapidly consumed between 15 min and 1 hr to maintain the redox balance or to respond to additional unknown metabolic requirements following learning. These learning-induced changes in GSH and GSSG were prevented by 2-AAPA-mediated GR inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e–g</xref>), providing evidence that the learning-induced GSH increase and GSSG decrease were mediated by an increase in GR activity following learning.</p><p>Consistent with these results, previous studies have reported that a transient GSH deficit during critical periods of neurodevelopment significantly affects several brain maturation processes, leading to immediate and delayed negative consequences on cognitive functions, including impairment of working memory, as well as spatial and episodic memory formation during infancy, adolescence, and adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cabungcal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kulak et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, memory impairments induced by reduction in the antioxidant capacity of the GSH system can be partly compensated by de novo synthesis of ascorbic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dalton et al., 2000</xref>). In our study, inhibition of GR during infantile learning resulted in memory impairment, revealing that the ascorbic acid was not sufficient to compensate for the decrease in GSH regeneration capacity. In fact, ascorbic acid was also significantly downregulated after training at PN17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and d</xref>).</p><p>The observation that the transient inactivation of the GR affects memory formation in infant but not in juvenile or adult rats strongly suggests that the hippocampal memory system is more vulnerable to redox dysregulation during infancy than at later ages. This result may reflect a lower antioxidant defense capacity in infancy relative to later in life, in the context of an already high baseline level of metabolic activity. The higher vulnerability of the infant brain to oxidative stress may also be reflective of the immaturity of the astrocytic-neuronal shuttling of GSH precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bélanger et al., 2011</xref>) leading to less antioxidant support supplied by astrocytes, which are still proliferating during this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandeira et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, both the activity-dependent intrinsic neuronal defenses, in combination with the non-cell-autonomous Nrf2-driven antioxidant support from astrocytes, have been shown to be optimal for maintaining neuronal redox balance in the face of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fernandez-Fernandez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baxter et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our results showing that inhibiting GR at the time of learning in juvenile or adult rats has no effect on memory performances could be explained by a higher level of GCL and GSy activities (as shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and/or of differential antioxidant mechanisms present in the adult and juvenile hippocampi. Future investigations will determine whether learning in juveniles and adults affects the activity of GCL and GSy and if these activities are required for memory formation. In a previous study, it has been shown that a moderate decrease of neuronal GSH in CA1 area of the hippocampus of adult mice by GCLC knockdown leads to dendrite disruption and cognitive impairment, revealing that hippocampal neurons of adult mouse require a large pool of glutathione to sustain cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fernandez-Fernandez et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Identifying the metabolic changes of the brain over development is key for a better understanding of the biology underlying the maturation of brain functions. As many neurodevelopmental disorders seem to be linked to metabolic dysregulations, knowing the evolution of brain metabolomics over development should provide novel insights for studying these diseases. We approached this metabolomic investigation at the whole rat hippocampus level over five developmental ages, which provided a comprehensive view of the hippocampal metabolomic changes over developmental and with learning. Guided by our current data, future investigations shall dissect how development and learning affect the metabolomic profile of specific cell types in the different hippocampal subregions.</p><p>Here, we found a higher diversity and concentration of metabolites at juvenile age (PN24), which declined in adulthood. Most of the amino acids and nucleotides decrease, while the majority of lipids and cofactors/vitamins increase over the course of the hippocampus postnatal development. Our results also showed that learning at different ages differentially regulates the hippocampal metabolome. Significant metabolite changes following learning were observed at PN17 and PN80, mainly involving amino acid, cofactor and vitamin, peptide, and lipid metabolisms. Our metabolomic analyses revealed that learning in infancy changes the levels of many metabolites belonging to the glutathione pathway.</p><p>Additional molecular, biochemical, and behavioral investigations demonstrated that infant learning induces a fast and long-lasting increase in the activity of the neuronal GR in the dHC, and that this activity is critical for the formation of long-term memory in infant rats, whereas it becomes dispensable in juveniles and adults. These results indicate, for the first time to our knowledge, that GR, and hence the glutathione pathway, plays a differential role in long-term memory formation in the infant hippocampus.</p><p>Although the mechanisms by which learning-induced activation of GR supports long-term memory formation in healthy infant hippocampi remain to be understood, some speculations are possible. Cell types particularly sensitive to GSH regulation are the parvalbumin-immunoreactive GABAergic interneurons (PV cells), the oligodendrocytes, and their progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Do et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Steullet et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it has been suggested that a developmental GSH deficit would disrupt PV cells and cause anomalies in myelination, which would in turn interfere with normal brain maturation, resulting in the onset of learning disabilities and neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorders later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Do et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kulak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Steullet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hardingham and Do, 2016</xref>). In light of the crucial role played by PV cells and myelination in sensory systems to regulate critical periods for plasticity and acquisition of functional competences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takesian and Hensch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Do et al., 2015</xref>), we speculate that the GSH-deficit mediating memory impairment in infancy could be due to the disruption of the initiation or closure of specific critical periods in the hippocampal memory system. This hypothesis is consistent with the idea that neurodevelopmental disorders are, to some extent, the result of defective critical periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberini and Travaglia, 2017</xref>). In sum, our metabolomic profiling of the rat hippocampus indicated that the ensemble of metabolites changes greatly over development, and that distinct metabolic pathways, such as the glutathione metabolism, are differentially regulated and engaged by learning at different ages.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal procedures complied with the US National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the New York University Animal Care Committees. One-, 7-, 17-, and 24-day-old male and female rats were obtained from E9–E10 pregnant Long-Evans female rats (purchased from Charles River Laboratories). Pre-weaning rats were housed with their littermates and mother in 30.8 cm × 40.6 cm × 22.2 cm plastic cages containing ALPHA-dri bedding. The birth date was defined as PN0, and the litters were culled to 10–12 pups (6 males and 6 females, if applicable) on PN1. After weaning (PN21), rats were group-housed (two to five animals per cage). Adult male Long-Evans rats (Envigo) weighing 200–250 g were used as PN80 specimens. Adult rats were housed two per cage. All rats were maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. All experiments were carried out during the light cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Inhibitory avoidance</title><p>IA was carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Travaglia et al., 2016a</xref>) in an IA chamber (Med Associates Inc, St. Albans, VT) consisting of a rectangular Perspex box divided into a safe compartment and a shock compartment (each 20.3 cm × 15.9 cm × 21.3 cm). The safe compartment was white and illuminated, and the shock compartment was black and dark. The apparatus was located in a sound-attenuated room with dim red light illumination. Animals were handled once a day for 3–5 min for 3 (pups) or 5 (adults) days before any behavioral procedure. During training sessions, each rat was placed in the safe compartment with its head facing away from the door. After 10 s, the door separating the compartments was automatically opened, allowing the rat access to the shock compartment. The door closed automatically when the rat crossed with all four limbs the invisible infrared light photosensors located in the shock compartment. Two seconds later, a footshock (2 s, 1 mA) was automatically delivered to the grid floor of the shock chamber via a constant current scrambler circuit. The animal remained in the dark compartment for additional 10 s, and was then returned to its home cage until testing for memory retention or euthanasia at the designated time points. As controls, we used untrained animals (handled and then returned to their home cage, termed naive) and rats exposed to a footshock without the IA context experience (shock-only). Shock-only treatment consisted of placing the rat onto grid of the shock compartment and immediately delivering a footshock of the same duration and intensity used in IA training. The animal returned to its home cage immediately after the footshock delivery. This protocol does not induce any association between the context and the foot shock. Retention tests were performed by placing the rat back in the safe compartment and measuring the latency to enter the dark compartment. Footshocks were not administered during the retention tests, and testing was terminated at 900 s. During retraining sessions, rats tested for memory retention received a footshock upon entering the dark compartment. Locomotor activity was measured during training and testing by automatically counting the number of times each rat crossed the infrared light photosensors located in both the safe and the shock compartment. Reminder footshocks (RS), with identical duration and intensity to those used in training, were administered in a novel neutral chamber with transparent walls, located in a different white light illuminated experimental room. For the metabolomics and biochemical studies, rats were not tested for memory retention to avoid the confound of changes resulting from testing. All behavioral tests were carried out blind to training and/or treatment conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Hippocampal extract preparation for metabolomic profiling</title><p>Rats were euthanized by decapitation, and their brains were quickly removed and placed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS 1×), pH 7.4. For each animal, the whole hippocampi (including both dorsal and ventral subregions) were dissected and immediately snap-frozen in isopentane on dry ice. All samples were stored at –80°C until processing. Frozen samples were shipped in dry ice to Metabolon Inc (Morrisville, NC) for metabolomic analysis using a proprietary methodology. Extraction of samples was performed using a MicroLab STAR automated liquid handling robot (Hamilton Robotics, Inc, Reno, NV); 450 μL of methanol was added to 100 μL of sample to precipitate proteins. Four recovery standards (DL-2-fluorophenylglycine, tridecanoic acid, cholesterol-d6 and 4-chlorophenylalanine) were added to each sample to determine extraction efficiency. To remove proteins, dissociate small molecules bound to protein, and recover metabolites, proteins were precipitated with methanol under vigorous shaking for 2 min (Glen Mills GenoGrinder 2000) followed by centrifugation (1300 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at room temperature [RT]). The resultant supernatants were placed in a TurboVap (Zymark) to remove the organic solvent. Each sample extract was then divided into five equal aliquots (see the <italic>Metabolomic profiling</italic> section), dried under nitrogen, and stored <italic>in vacuo</italic> prior to metabolomic profiling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Metabolomic profiling</title><p>Metabolomic profiling was performed by untargeted UPLC-MS/MS, which detected eight main classes of metabolites: amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleotides, peptides, lipids, cofactors or vitamins, metabolites involved in energy metabolism, and xenobiotics. Detailed descriptions of the protocols were published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Evans et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bridgewater, 2014</xref>). Briefly, UPLC-MS/MS was performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC (Waters, Milford, MA) and a Thermo Fisher Scientific Q-Exactive high-resolution mass spectrometer (Waltham, MA) interfaced with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI-II) source and Orbitrap mass analyzer. Aliquots previously dried under nitrogen were reconstituted in solvents compatible with four different methods described below; each reconstitution solvent contained a series of standards at fixed concentrations to ensure injection and chromatographic consistency. The first two aliquots were analyzed by two separate reverse-phase (RP)/UPLC-MS/MS methods with positive-ion mode electrospray ionization (ESI): one aliquot was analyzed using acidic positive-ion conditions, chromatographically optimized for more hydrophilic compounds. In this method, the extract was gradient-eluted from a C18 column (2.1 mm × 100 mm Waters UPLC BEH C18 1.7 µm column held at 40°C) using 5% water, 95% methanol and containing 0.05% perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPA) and 0.1% formic acid (FA) at pH 3.5. The second aliquot was also analyzed using acidic positive-ion conditions; however, it was chromatographically optimized for more hydrophobic compounds. In this method, the extract was gradient-eluted from the aforementioned C18 column using methanol, acetonitrile, water, 0.05% PFPA, and 0.01% FA at pH 3.5. A third aliquot was analyzed by RP/UPLC-MS/MS using basic negative-ion mode ESI in a separate dedicated C18 column. The basic extracts were gradient-eluted from the column using methanol (95%) and water (5%) with 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate at pH 8. The fourth aliquot was analyzed via negative ionization following elution from a Hydrophilic-Interaction Chromatography (HILIC) column (2.1 mm × 150 mm Waters UPLC BEH Amide, 1.7 µm column held at 40°C) using a mobile phase consisting of 10 mM ammonium formate in 15% water, 5% methanol, 80% acetonitrile (pH 10.8). For the four aliquots previously mentioned, the sample injection volume was 5 μL using a 2× needle loop overfill. A fifth aliquot was reserved for backup. Several types of quality control (QC) samples were analyzed in concert with the experimental samples: a pooled matrix sample (PMS) generated by taking a small volume of each experimental sample served as a technical replicate throughout the dataset; extracted water samples served as process blanks; and a cocktail of QC standards that were carefully chosen not to interfere with the measurement of endogenous compounds were spiked into every analyzed sample, allowing monitoring of instrument performance and chromatographic alignment. Instrument variability was determined by calculating the median relative standard deviation (RSD) of peak area for each internal standard that was added to each sample prior to injection into the mass spectrometers (RSD: 3%). Overall process variability was determined by calculating the median RSD for all endogenous metabolites (i.e., non-instrument standards) present in 100% of the PMS (RSD: 8%). Both RSD values met Metabolon’s acceptance criteria. Experimental samples were randomized across the platform run, with QC samples spaced evenly among the injections. The scan range varied slightly between methods but covered a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 70–1000 with a scan speed of ~9 scans per second (alternating between MS and MS/MS scans) and a mass resolution of 35,000 (measured at 200 m/z). Mass calibration was performed as needed to maintain &lt;5 ppm mass error for all standards monitored.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Metabolite identification and quantification</title><p>Data processing, including chromatographic alignment, QC utilization, and metabolite identification has been performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Evans et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bridgewater, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dehaven et al., 2010</xref>). The samples (including QC samples) were chromatographically aligned based on a retention index (RI) that used internal standards assigned with a fixed RI value. Spectral peaks were identified using Metabolon’s proprietary peak detection and integration software and were quantified using area-under-the-curve values. Criteria for peak detection included thresholds for signal-to-noise ratio, area, and width. Metabolites were identified by automated comparison of the ion features in the experimental samples to a reference library of purified chemical standard entries developed at Metabolon. Biochemical identification was based on the combination of three criteria: RI values, (m/z) ratio, and the MS/MS forward and reverse scores between the experimental data and the standards present in the library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dehaven et al., 2010</xref>). The MS/MS scores were based on the comparison of the ions present in the experimental spectrum to the ions present in the library spectrum. All proposed identifications were then manually reviewed and hand-curated based on the criteria described above. For metabolites that were not covered by the standards, additional library entries were added based on their recurrent and unique chromatographic and mass spectral signatures. For studies spanning multiple days, a data normalization step was performed to correct for variation resulting from inter-day differences in instrument tuning. Essentially, each compound was corrected in run-day blocks by registering the medians to equal 1.00 and normalizing each data point proportionately. This normalization minimizes any inter-day instrument gain or drift, but does not interfere with intra-day sample variability.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Hippocampal cannula implants and injections</title><p>On PN15, PN22, or PN80, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane mixed with oxygen. Stainless steel cannulas (26-gauge) were implanted bilaterally in the dHC (for PN15: –3.0 mm anterior, 2.2 mm lateral, and –2.3 mm ventral from bregma; for PN22: –3.4 mm anterior, 2.2 mm lateral, and –2.5 mm ventral from bregma; for PN80: –4.0 mm anterior, 2.5 mm lateral, and –2.5 mm ventral from bregma) through holes drilled in the overlying skull. The cannulas were fixed to the skull with dental cement. At the end of the surgery, rats were returned to the dam and littermates (PN15) or their home cage (PN22 and PN80) for a 2-day recovery period for the pups or a 10-day recovery period for the adults prior to further experimental manipulations. Hippocampal injections were performed using a 33-gauge needle that extended 1 mm beyond the tip of the guide cannula and was connected via polyethylene tubing to a Hamilton syringe. Injections were delivered using an infusion pump at a rate of 0.1 μL/min to deliver a total volume of 0.3 μL per side over 3 min. The injection needle was left in place for 2 min after injection to allow complete diffusion of the solution. The potent, selective, cell-permeable GR inhibitor 2-AAPA (Millipore-Sigma, cat# A4111) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Seefeldt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>) was dissolved in PBS 1× containing 10% dimethylsulfoxide. On each side, 0.3 µL 2-AAPA was injected at 100, or 200 μM in independent groups of rats, 15 min before IA training. To verify proper placement of the cannula implants, rats were euthanized at the end of the behavioral experiments, and their brains were frozen in isopentane, sliced in 40 μm coronal sections in a –20°C cryostat, and examined under a light microscope. Rats with incorrect placement (fewer than 3%) were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Western blot analysis was carried out as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Travaglia et al., 2016b</xref>).

Samples were homogenized in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris base, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 1% NP-40) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (0.5 mM PMSF, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM NaF, 1 μM microcystine, 1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and commercial protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails [Millipore-Sigma, St. Louis, MO]), and then centrifuged at 21,130 <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 30 min. The resultant supernatant were stored at –80°C until processing. Total protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Equal amounts of total protein (20 μg per well) were resolved on 4–20% Criterion TGX gradient gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and transferred to Immobilon-FL Transfer membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) by electroblotting. Membranes were dried, reactivated in methanol, and washed with water before being incubated in Odyssey blocking buffer (TBS) (LI-COR Bioscience, Lincoln, NE) for 1 hr at RT. Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C in the solution suggested by the manufacturer. Primary antibodies against the following proteins were obtained from the indicated suppliers: GR (1/2000, Abcam, cat# ab16801), GPx isozyme 1 (1/1000, Abcam, cat# ab22604), GSy (1/1000, Abcam, cat# ab133592), GCL catalytic subunit (1/1000, Novus Biologicals, cat# NBP2-45830), GCL regulatory subunit (1/1000, Abcam, cat# ab126704), NeuN (1/1000, Abcam, cat# ab104225), GFAP (1/2000, Abcam, cat# ab4674). The membranes were washed in TBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST), and then incubated for 1 hr at RT with a species-appropriate fluorescently conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IRDye 680LT [1:10,000], goat anti-rabbit IRDye 800CW [1:10,000], or donkey anti-chicken IRDye 800CW [1:10,000] from LI-COR Bioscience Lincoln, NE). Membranes were again washed in TBST and scanned using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging system (Li-Cor Bioscience). Data were quantified from pixel intensities using the Odyssey software (Image Studio 4.0). All membranes were co-stained with antibody against actin (1:10,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, cat# sc-47778); this signal was used as the internal loading control for all Western blots. When appropriate, membranes were stripped and re-probed with additional antibodies to detect multiple proteins on the same blot.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>GR activity assay</title><p>Rats were euthanized by decapitation at the indicated time points, and their brains were quickly removed and placed in ice-cold PBS 1×.

Total protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. GR activity was measured using the Glutathione Reductase Assay kit (Millipore-Sigma, cat# GRSA-1KT). This assay is based on the reduction of GSSG by GR in presence of NADPH. In addition, 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) reacts with GSH to form 5-thio(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Therefore, the GR activity was measured by the increase in absorbance at 412 nm caused by the reduction of DTNB. In brief, 10 μL of each sample was added to each well of a 96-well plate, and then 150 μL of 2 mM GSSG, 50 μL of assay buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, with 1 mM EDTA), 75 μL of 3 mM DTNB, and finally 15 μL of 2 mM NADPH were added to each well to start the reaction. Assay buffer containing yeast GR was used as positive control. Assay buffer was used as a blank. To calculate the GR activity, the absorbance was read at 412 nm every 10 s for 2 min using the kinetic program of a spectrophotometer (Infinite M200 Plate Reader). Finally, the GR activity was normalized to the total quantity of proteins measured in each sample. GR activity was expressed in nmol/min/mg protein. All samples were run in duplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>GPx activity assay</title><p>Dorsal hippocampal samples were defrosted and lysed on ice using a dounce homogenizer in 10 μL of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, 20 mM EDTA, 320 mM sucrose, pH 7.4) per mg of tissue.

GPx activity was measured using the Glutathione Peroxidase Assay Kit (Colorimetric) from Abcam (ab102530, Cambridge, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, cytosolic lysate (50 μL), standard (100 μL), GPx positive control (50 μL) or reagent control (50 μL) was added to a well in a 96-well plate. Then 40 μL of a mixture containing 33 μL of assay buffer, 3 μL of 40 mM NADPH solution, 2 μL of GR solution, and 2 μL of GSH solution were added to each well containing the samples, the positive control and the reagent control. The plate was incubated at RT for 15 min to deplete all GSSG in the samples, and the absorbance was read at 340 nm using a colorimetric microplate reader (Infinite M200 Plate Reader). Then 10 μL of cumene hydroperoxide solution were added to the sample, the positive control and the reagent control wells to start the GPx reaction, and the absorbance was measured at 340 nm every 10 s for 2 min to determine the GPx activity. Samples producing signals greater than that of the highest standard were diluted in appropriate buffer and reanalyzed. The concentration found was then multiplied by the appropriate dilution factor. The mean absorbance value of the blank wells was substracted for each data point and the corrected absorbance values were plot for each standard as a function of the final concentration of NADPH, to construct the standard curve used to determine the values of GPx activity of the test samples.

Reaction was started by adding 50 μL of 20 mM cysteine to samples and incubated for 20, 15, 10, and 5 min. The GCL reaction was stopped by adding 50 μL of metaphosphoric acid (2.5 g per 100 mL) to precipitate proteins, and samples were subsequently vortexed and placed on ice for 20 min. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 580 <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 5 min. Following centrifugation, 20 μL of reaction mixture was transferred to a black 96-well plate, and 180 μL of detection buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 10], 0.5 N NaOH, and 10 mM 2,3-napthalenedicarboxyaldehdye [Sigma] [v/v/v—1.4/0.2/0.2]) was added to each well. The 2,3-napthalenedicarboxyaldehdye in this mixture rapidly forms a fluorescent cyclic reaction product with the cysteine thiol and glutamyl amino groups of GSH and GCγ. The plate was left to incubate in the dark at RT for 30 min, and fluorescence intensity was measured (Ex/Em = 485/520 nm) with a microplate reader (Infinite M200 Plate Reader). GCL activity was determined by calculating the rate of fluorescence increase over time, normalized to protein content.

In brief, 96-well plates were set up in duplicate for GSH standards (50 μL), GSSG standards (50 μL), and samples (50 μL). GSH detection assay solution was prepared by diluting 100 μL of 100× Thiol Green Stock solution into 10 mL of assay buffer.

Animals were randomly assigned to treatments or behavioral groups for all experiments.</p><sec id="s3-14-1"><title>Metabolomic profiling</title><p>For the purpose of data visualization, the peak intensity for each metabolite was re-scaled by dividing the value for that metabolite in each sample by the median value for that metabolite across all samples, followed by log transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">van den Berg et al., 2006</xref>). Missing values (less than 10%) were imputed with the minimum observed value for a given metabolite, based on the assumption that they were below the threshold of instrument detection sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wei et al., 2018</xref>). Only metabolites with an assigned identity that were detected in more than 50% of the samples in a given group were included in the analysis. One- and two-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons tests were used to identify biochemicals that differed significantly between experimental groups. Statistical significance between two experimental groups was determined by Welch’s two-sample t-test (Prism 7, GraphPad Software Inc). An estimation of the false discovery rate using q-values was calculated to take into account the multiple comparisons. p-Values &lt; 0.05 and q-values &lt; 0.1 were set as levels of statistical significance. q-Values were calculated according to the method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Storey and Tibshirani, 2003</xref>, using Array Studio 7.2. Fold changes were calculated using the ratio of the mean scaled intensities of two groups. Volcano plots and unsupervised HCA (using Euclidean distances) were generated in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cran.r-project.org/">http://cran.r-project.org/</ext-link>) based on the fold change values. PCA and RF analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mitchell, 2011</xref>) were performed using Array Studio 7.2 and the online tool MetaboAnalyst 3.6 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/">http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xia and Wishart, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-14-2"><title>Biochemistry and behavior analyses</title><p>Analyses were performed using Prism 7 (GraphPad Software Inc). Data were analyzed by one- or two-way ANOVA for independent or repeated measures, followed by Tukey’s or Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons tests. Statistical significance of differences between two groups was evaluated by two-tailed Student’s t-test. All analyses were two-tailed. Results were considered significant at p &lt; 0.05.</p><p>The intent of this study was not to investigate sex differences; therefore, we included both female and male rats in our prepuberal groups. In the metabolomic analysis, preliminary statistical analyses of separate sex groups (n = 2–4 each sex) identified 3.08% of biochemicals that changed significantly between males and females (unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test, p &lt; 0.05); because this is less than 5%, it can be considered as a random effect. At PN80, only male rats were used, hence, we cannot exclude the possibility of differential expressions of metabolites studied in adult females and males or changes related to the female reproductive cycle. Regarding the biochemistry and behavior analyses, preliminary statistical analyses of separate sex groups (n = 3–4 each sex) yielded no significant difference (unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test, p &gt; 0.05), and the range of individual values was similarly distributed. Although these numbers are too low for any robust statistical analysis, we decided to group the subjects and not pursue sex-related questions.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s4" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Resources, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal procedures complied with the US National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the New York University Animal Care Committees.

The hippocampus is a highly heterogeneous brain structure in regards to types of neurons, glia cells, and other cells associated with blood vessels. The metabolomic profiling with the homogenates of the whole hippocampus make it difficult to interpret the data. Were the differences observed due to the differences in particular sub-regions, specific types of cells or something else? The possible input of astrocytes in the antioxidant defense during infantile learning seems to have been overlooked. For instance, in addition to the antioxidant boosts caused by NMDA extrasynaptic activity (page 20, lines 487-489; Baxter et al., 2015), in the same year (2015), another report showed that astrocytes respond to neurotransmission by boosting antioxidant support to neurons (Astrocyte NMDA receptors' activity sustains neuronal survival through a Cdk5-Nrf2 pathway. Jimenez-Blasco D, Santofimia-Castaño P, Gonzalez A, Almeida A, Bolaños JP. Cell Death Differ. 2015 Nov;22(11):1877-89. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2015.49. Epub 2015 Apr 24. PMID: 25909891). Moreover, in page 28, lines 683-685, besides the Cobley et al. (2018) paper, a subsequent study demonstrated that endogenous high mitochondrial ROS levels produced by astrocytes boost energy and redox metabolism, sustaining organismal behavior in mouse (Astrocytic mitochondrial ROS modulate brain metabolism and mouse behaviour. Vicente-Gutierrez C, Bonora N, Bobo-Jimenez V, Jimenez-Blasco D, Lopez-Fabuel I, Fernandez E, Josephine C, Bonvento G, Enriquez JA, Almeida A, Bolaños JP. Nat Metab. 2019 Feb;1(2):201-211. doi: 10.1038/s42255-018-0031-6. Epub 2019 Feb 4. PMID: 32694785). The authors should experimentally address this issue or at a minimum thoroughly discuss it since it is unclear what cell type GR activity is induced. Related to this issue, it is also unclear by what mechanism this enzyme activity is elevated after learning in a cell-free assay given that expression levels remain unaltered which should also be addressed.</p><p>2) This work consists of two major components: the metabolomic profiles of the developing hippocampus, and the metabolomic alterations caused by learning. It is not clear how these two components are linked to each other. Although reduction of GSSG was observed in both situations (in early development, and after learning in infants), it is not clear if the reduction in the two situations arise from the same or related mechanisms. The authors should address these points in the discussion.</p><p>3) Some reasoning and interpretation related to GSH, GSSG, and glutathione reductase is needed:</p><p>A) Figure 6 shows GSH/GSSG ratio, but not the level of GSH, which is more directly related to &quot;antioxidant capacity&quot;. The data also show a continuous increase in glutathione reductase and a continuous reduction in glutathione peroxidase from PN17 to PN80, but the GSH/GSSG was not different between PN17 and PN80. An explanation of the data is needed.</p><p>B) Figure 7 shows a reduction in only GSSG but not an increase/decrease in GSH after training, suggesting that there was no increase in the conversion of GSSG into GSH, which leads to two questions: What causes GSSG to reduce? and If GSSG-to-GSH conversion did not change, why would glutathione reductase play an important role here?</p><p>(C) It is difficult to understand the data in Figure 7F. If 2-AAPA was injected into the hippocampus, when the hippocampal lysate was collected later and used for glutathione reductase activity assay, 2-AAPA may either be diluted in the assay to a negligible concentration, or remain at a high concentration which blocks glutathione reductase activity. How could it only abolish the increase in glutathione reductase activity caused by training? (D) How did injection of 2-AAPA affect the levels of GSH and GSSH?</p><p>4) Given that both cysteine levels are lower after inhibitory avoidance, and even reduced levels of glutathione show a reduction by non-adjusted p-value, the take-home message needs to be more clearly stated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1) The metabolomes of the hippocampus is a largely unexplored territory, especially in terms of development and learning. This study provides valuable information on these topics.</p><p>2) Identified glutathione reductase activity as a critical factor for learning in infant but not in older rats, which helps to explain the behavioral difference between infant and older rats.</p><p>3) The experiments were designed elegantly and carried out well. The data were presented clearly and convincingly. The paper was well written.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors set out to understand the metabolic changes needed for early-life episodic memory in the hippocampus. Their main findings are that a learning paradigm of inhibitory avoidance caused a reduction in oxidized glutathione and increase in the GSH:GSSG ratio specifically in the infantile rats, associated with increased activity of glutathione reductase (GR), the enzyme which converts GSSG to GSH. Moreover pharmacological inhibition of GR impaired inhibitory avoidance at this age but not older rats. Thus, the main strength of the paper is to report a dependence on inhibitory avoidance on GR inhibition at a developmental stage when GR is activated and at which inhibitory avoidance is transient.</p><p>Main weaknesses of the paper are as follows:</p><p>i) The first 4 out of the 7 figures have little to do with the main message of the paper (as described above and corroborated by the abstract) and are instead concerned with a description of developmental changes to the hippocampal metabolome (of specialist interest).</p><p>ii) It is unclear in what cell type (neurons vs glia) GR activity is induced, and also unclear by what mechanism this enzyme activity is elevated after learning in a cell-free assay given that expression levels remain unaltered.</p><p>iii) Given that both cysteine levels are lower after inhibitory avoidance, and even reduced levels of glutathione show a reduction by non-adjusted p-value, it is not entirely clear what the take-home message is. The final sentence of the abstract &quot;Thus, metabolomic profiling revealed that the hippocampal glutathione-mediated antioxidant pathway is differentially required for the formation of infantile memory&quot; does not convey to me a large leap in conceptual understanding.</p><p>iv) Aside from the above, between the metabolic composition of homogenized tissue and learning/memory is a large gap, so there remain many mechanistic questions that intermediate analyses (e.g. electrophysiology, cell biology, cell-type specific KOs) would answer.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1. For a general interest journal, it would perhaps be best to focus on the key findings that contribute to the main message of the paper.</p><p>2. Consider cell-specific KO or KD to test hypotheses.</p><p>3. Although GSSG goes down with learning at P17, so does cysteine, as GSH does also show a tendency. The effect on GSH in particular needs more investigation. I'm not sure whether there is an increase or decrease in available GSH after learning, which is fundamental.</p><p>4. Westerns for glutathione peroxidase-there are many such Gpx enzymes-do they mean Gpx1?</p><p>5. Glutathione synthetase westerns-although there are differences observed the authors need to make the case that this could be rate-determining. Many studies have found that gclc activity is rate-determining.</p><p>6. The effect of the irreversible GR inhibitor drug AAPA is surprising-it does not block GR activity as one would expect (7F) but simply reduces it to the level of untrained mice. This is critical to the paper and I am unclear how this effect is modest.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is an original work showing that boosted hippocampal glutathione reductase enzymatic activity is required for learning, selectively during the infantile period of the rat. The study is elegantly designed and is experimentally very robust, giving rise to an important piece of work in which the main conclusions are supported by the data.

The hippocampus is a highly heterogeneous brain structure in regards to types of neurons, glia cells, and other cells associated with blood vessels. The metabolomic profiling with the homogenates of the whole hippocampus make it difficult to interpret the data. Were the differences observed due to the differences in particular sub-regions, specific types of cells or something else? The possible input of astrocytes in the antioxidant defense during infantile learning seems to have been overlooked. For instance, in addition to the antioxidant boosts caused by NMDA extrasynaptic activity (page 20, lines 487-489; Baxter et al., 2015), in the same year (2015), another report showed that astrocytes respond to neurotransmission by boosting antioxidant support to neurons (Astrocyte NMDA receptors' activity sustains neuronal survival through a Cdk5-Nrf2 pathway.

The authors should experimentally address this issue or at a minimum thoroughly discuss it since it is unclear what cell type GR activity is induced. Related to this issue, it is also unclear by what mechanism this enzyme activity is elevated after learning in a cell-free assay given that expression levels remain unaltered which should also be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for these great comments, which led us to better clarify the scope of our study and to extend our assessments to neuron vs. astrocyte selective regulations.</p><p>As detailed in the revised paper, we aimed at obtaining a metabolomic investigation at the whole hippocampus level because the goal was to gain a comprehensive knowledge of the hippocampal metabolome changes over ages and in response to learning. We think that identifying the cell-type- and subregion-specific metabolomes is a future goal, which will be guided by our current comprehensive data. Dissecting all or most cell-type and subregion metabolomes would have multiplied our metabolomic experiments to a number that would be unfeasible for a single manuscript. Furthermore, we would have missed the comprehensive profile of changes, which we believe is very valuable for designing future studies and analyses. Therefore, as suggested by the Reviewer, we now better detail the intent of the experimental approach and discuss that future goals should include the investigation of different cell types and hippocampal subregions (pages 16 and 20).</p><p>We also added discussion points on the possible role of astrocytes in the antioxidant defense during infantile memory formation. Taking into account recent studies, including the ones mentioned by the reviewers, we added the following point of discussion on page 16:</p><p>“As our biochemical analyses were obtained from hippocampal extracts, they did not dissect whether the learning-induced metabolomic changes and increase in GR activity are distinctively regulated within the different hippocampal subregions or cell types. […] Yet, a possible role of astrocytes in the antioxidant defense during infantile memory formation remains to be determined.”</p><p>Finally, we investigated whether the learning-induced increase in GR activity is differentially regulated in neurons and in astrocytes. We measured GR activity in FACS-sorted neurons, astrocytes and unlabeled counter-selected brain cell-types (i.e. oligodendrocytes, microglia, vascular cells etc.) from the dorsal hippocampus of PN17 untrained and trained rats euthanized 15 min post-training, a timepoint at which we found a significant induction of GR activity in the total dHC extract. We now report that infant learning significantly increases GR activity in neurons but not in astrocytes or the remaining brain cell fraction (new Figure 7g).</p><p>Regarding the possible mechanisms by which GR activity increases after learning despite its level remains unaltered, we now have added the following discussion point, in which we propose explanations (see page 15):</p><p>“The mechanisms by which GR activity increases following learning without a change in GR expression level itself are not known. […] Despite GR exhibits several phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitylation sites (Deponte, 2013), very little is known about the relevance of these posttranslational modifications in modulating GR activity, and the effects of learning on GR posttranslational modifications or allosteric modulations remain to be understood.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) This work consists of two major components: the metabolomic profiles of the developing hippocampus, and the metabolomic alterations caused by learning. It is not clear how these two components are linked to each other. Although reduction of GSSG was observed in both situations (in early development, and after learning in infants), it is not clear if the reduction in the two situations arise from the same or related mechanisms. The authors should address these points in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the reviewer’s suggestion and added a discussion point on this interesting question (see page 12):</p><p>“Future investigation shall analyze the relationship between developmental and learning-induced changes. […] Given our previously studies showing that biological and functional development of the hippocampus does not progress by default, but it is instructed by learning experiences especially in infancy (Bessières et al. 2020), we suggest that at least several changes that occur over development will be also found to be associated with learning.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some reasoning and interpretation related to GSH, GSSG, and glutathione reductase is needed:</p><p>A) Figure 6 shows GSH/GSSG ratio, but not the level of GSH, which is more directly related to &quot;antioxidant capacity&quot;. The data also show a continuous increase in glutathione reductase and a continuous reduction in glutathione peroxidase from PN17 to PN80, but the GSH/GSSG was not different between PN17 and PN80. An explanation of the data is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing this out. We updated Figure 6, and now show the levels of GSH and GSSG at the various ages, in addition to the GSH/GSSG ratios (Figure 6b). These data revealed that the level of GSH was significantly higher at PN24 compared to PN17 and PN80, whereas GSSG levels of PN17 and PN24 were significantly higher relative to that of PN80. As a result, the GSH/GSSG mean ratio was significantly higher at PN24 compared to PN80 and slightly but not significantly lower at PN17 relative to PN80. Despite the lack of significant decrease in the mean ratio of PN17 over PN80, there was a broader distribution of GSSG individual values at PN17 compared to PN80, suggesting that the regulation of the glutathione cycle might be different in the infant hippocampus. Overall, these results suggest a higher antioxidant capacity at PN24.</p><p>Furthermore, we also now report the assessment of the enzymatic activities of glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), and glutathione synthetase (GSy) across developmental ages. These new data, presented Figure 6d, show that the levels of GR and GPx activity were significantly higher at PN17 and PN24 compared to PN80, suggesting that there is a higher rate of glutathione cycle during early developmental ages compared to adulthood.</p><p>We also found that the level of activity of GCL dramatically increased between PN17 and PN24 and then decreased in adulthood at a level that however remained significantly elevated compared to PN17 (Figure 6d). Likewise, the activity of GSy was significantly higher at PN24 and PN80 compared to PN17. These results, in line with the protein expression levels (Figure 6c), suggest a reduced de novo GSH synthesis in infancy compared to juvenile and adults, which could be explained by a lower level of the rate-limiting GSH precursor cysteine and/or of GCLM at PN17 (Figure 6b,c).</p><p>Collectively, these results suggest that the hippocampal glutathione-mediated antioxidant defense capacity is lower in the infant than in the juvenile and adult hippocampus. We have added this new explanation and a discussion point on pages 14-15.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Figure 7 shows a reduction in only GSSG but not an increase/decrease in GSH after training, suggesting that there was no increase in the conversion of GSSG into GSH, which leads to two questions: What causes GSSG to reduce? and If GSSG-to-GSH conversion did not change, why would glutathione reductase play an important role here?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raised an important point regarding the absence of GSH variation at 1h after PN17 learning, despite there is an increase in GR activity, which in principle should increase the conversion of GSSG into GSH. To address this point we dissected how infant learning affects the activity of the critical enzymes involved in glutathione oxidation/reduction cycle (i.e. Gpx and GR) and biosynthesis (i.e. GCL and GSy), as well as the GSH and GSSG levels. Toward this end, we performed time course analyses of the activity of the four enzymes and of the levels of the two metabolites in the dorsal hippocampus following infant learning. We found that, following training, GR activity increased significantly at 15 min after training and remained elevated at 1h and 24h before returning to baseline by 7 days after training (new Figure 7c). The activities of all the other enzymes, i.e., GPx, GLC and GSy remained unchanged. These results suggest that learning at PN17 induces an increase in the regeneration of GSH from GSSG, while the conversion of GSH into GSSG and the biosynthesis of GSH remain unaltered.</p><p>We also found that infant learning leads to a significant increase in GSH level paralleled by a decrease in GSSG at 15 min after training. Notably, the level of GSH returns to baseline at 1h and 24h after training, whereas at the same time points, the levels of GSSG remained significantly lower than those observed in untrained rats (new Figure 8e-g). This timecourse is consistent with our metabolomic data showing that GSSG significantly decreased while GSH was unchanged relative to untrained animals at 1 hour after training (Figure 7a).</p><p>The reason why GSH rapidly returned to basal level (at the 1h time point) while GSSG level remains reduced and GR activity elevated compared to untrained rats remains unknown. We suggest that GSH is rapidly consumed between 15 min and 1h to maintain the redox balance or to respond to additional unknown metabolic requirements following learning.</p><p>Furthermore, we found that the learning-induced changes in hippocampal GSH and GSSG levels were prevented by bilateral injection of the GR inhibitor 2-AAPA (100 μM) in the dorsal hippocampus, 15 min before training (new Figure 8a and 8e-g). These results confirmed that the learning-induced GSH increase and GSSG decrease was mediated by an increase in GR activity following learning.</p><p>In sum we added several sets of data and relative discussion points (see page 18) showing the critical role played by GR activity to modulate GSH and GSSG levels evoked by learning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(C) It is difficult to understand the data in Figure 7F. If 2-AAPA was injected into the hippocampus, when the hippocampal lysate was collected later and used for glutathione reductase activity assay, 2-AAPA may either be diluted in the assay to a negligible concentration, or remain at a high concentration which blocks glutathione reductase activity. How could it only abolish the increase in glutathione reductase activity caused by training?</p></disp-quote><p>To address the Reviewer important point, we added the assessment of a higher 2-AAPA concentration. As shown by our previous data and mentioned by the reviewer, 2-AAPA injected at 100 μM in the dHC 15 min before training at PN17 prevented the learning-induced increase in GR activity. We hypothesized that at this concentration, 2-AAPA partially inhibits GR. When we injected before training a higher dose of 2-AAPA (i.e., 200 μM) in the dHC, we found that GR activity is decreased by more than 75% (new Figure 8a). Therefore 100μM of 2-AAPA indeed was partially inhibiting GR allowing us to block the increase in GR activity induced by learning. In sum, the partial effect of 100 μM concentration was not due to a temporal effect of 2-AAPA but to a partial inhibition. Our result also show that the injection of 2-AAPA at the time of training durably alter the ability of learning to increase GR catalytic activity, which is in line with the <italic>in vitro</italic> observations that the GR inhibition by 2-AAPA is irreversible (Seefeldt et al. 2009).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(D) How did injection of 2-AAPA affect the levels of GSH and GSSH?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to the comment 3 (B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Given that both cysteine levels are lower after inhibitory avoidance, and even reduced levels of glutathione show a reduction by non-adjusted p-value, the take-home message needs to be more clearly stated.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Regarding the small reduction of GSH following training in infancy, please see our response to comment 3 (B) and our new data showing that GSH significantly increases at 15 min after training (new Figure 8e). Regarding the significant decrease in cysteine level following IA training, we have added the following discussion point to address this question (see page 10).</p><p>“Despite cysteine decreases at 1 h following learning, at this timepoint we did not detect significant change in GSH level (Figure 5a and d). Therefore, we speculate that the decrease in cysteine may not be linked to GSH biosynthesis but rather serves as a substrate for de novo protein synthesis, a process known to be required for long-term memory formation (Costa-Mattioli et al., 2009).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Comments for the authors:</p><p>1. For a general interest journal, it would perhaps be best to focus on the key findings that contribute to the main message of the paper.</p><p>2. Consider cell-specific KO or KD to test hypotheses.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment and now better clarified the rationale of our experimental design (see page 16 and 20).</p><p>The main goal of this study was to provide a comprehensive analysis of the metabolomic changes occurring in the rat hippocampus across post-natal developmental ages and after learning, rather than focusing on specific cell types. To our knowledge, this topic has not been explored yet. Dissecting metabolomics of specific cell types is a different and, in our view, subsequent question. The technique of dissecting certain cell types may also lead to the loss of certain metabolites, which we wanted to avoid in this initial metabolomic study. A second question is: which cell types to choose? In the hippocampus we have neurons (to be divided in a variety of subpopulations), astrocytes, oligodendrogytes, microglia, endothelial cells, pericytes,… hence many different cell types. Why favoring neurons (which ones?) and astrocytes? Our intent was to not focus on 1 or 2 cell types but to get a comprehensive knowledge of the metabolomic changes of the region. We agree that diving into additional levels of cell type and subregion analyses is also very interesting and we see these questions as subsequent to this study.</p><p>Specifically, our goal was to define the global metabolomic changes driven by (1) development, which per se is important and (2) learning at different ages. Without defining the metabolomics of different ages, we could not have obtained meaningful profiling underlying learning over developmental ages. From these analyses we identified a few metabolic pathways significantly and differentially regulated by learning at different ages. Then we selected one of them that emerged as regulated by learning at PN17, the glutathione-mediated antioxidant pathway, for a more in-depth investigation of causality in memory formation. However, the intent of this study was not to investigate the detailed mechanistic aspects of the changes revealed by our metabolomic analysis, which may be the object of further investigations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Although GSSG goes down with learning at P17, so does cysteine, as GSH does also show a tendency. The effect on GSH in particular needs more investigation. I'm not sure whether there is an increase or decrease in available GSH after learning, which is fundamental.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this issue by adding several new data sets as described in the response to the comments 3 (B) and 4, above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Although some of these enzymes can be rate limiting in some conditions, our two timepoints after training do not reveal changes in the activity of these enzymes. These data do not exclude that activation of the enzymes are regulated (not their expression level) or that there are changes at other timepoints. Additional investigations should be the subject of future studies. We also emphasized that the activity of GCL is rate-limiting in the biosynthesis of GSH (page 13).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The effect of the irreversible GR inhibitor drug AAPA is surprising-it does not block GR activity as one would expect (7F) but simply reduces it to the level of untrained mice.

Future investigations will determine whether learning in juveniles and adults affects the activity of GCL and GSy and if these activities are required for memory formation. In a previous study, it has been shown that a moderate decrease of neuronal GSH in CA1 area of the hippocampus of adult mice by GCLC knockdown leads to dendrite disruption and cognitive impairment, revealing that hippocampal neurons of adult mouse require a large pool of glutathione to sustain cognitive functions (Fernandez-Fernandez et al., 2018).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
