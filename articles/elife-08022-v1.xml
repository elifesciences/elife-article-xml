Despite 20 years of research, APC's mechanistic function remains mysterious. We used FRAP, super-resolution microscopy, functional tests in mammalian cells and flies, and other approaches to define APC's mechanistic role in the active destruction complex when Wnt signaling is off. Our data suggest APC plays two roles: (1) APC promotes efficient Axin multimerization through one known and one novel APC:Axin interaction site, and (2) GSK3 acts through APC motifs R2 and B to regulate APC:Axin interactions, promoting high-throughput of βcatenin to destruction. We propose a new dynamic model of how the destruction complex regulates Wnt signaling and how this goes wrong in cancer, providing insights into how this multiprotein signaling complex is assembled and functions via multivalent interactions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08022.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08022.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08022.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>An embryo starts off as a small ball of stem cells, each of which has the potential to become any type of cell in the body. Adult organs and tissues also contain small numbers of stem cells that can replace old or damaged cells. In both of these processes, stem cells need to ‘decide’ when they should start to change into a more specialized cell type, and which cell fate to choose (e.g., liver cell vs kidney cell). A signaling pathway involving Wnt proteins helps to direct many of these decisions. But if the ‘Wnt signaling pathway’ becomes activated at the wrong time, it can lead to cancer. For example, the first step in development of colon cancer is the inappropriate activation of Wnt signaling, and is most often caused by mutations in the gene that encodes a protein called APC. The APC protein is a tumor suppressor and normally inhibits Wnt signaling. However, even after over 20 years of effort, it remains largely mysterious how APC does this.</p><p>APC is known to work with another protein called Axin as part of a large protein machine. This protein complex performs one of the first steps in a process that ultimately marks a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway for destruction. Pronobis et al. have now used a range of techniques to define APC's role in this so-called ‘destruction complex’. This analysis revealed the internal structure of a complex made from APC and Axin, and showed that cable- and sheet-like assemblies of Axin were intertwined with APC cables. Further experiments then revealed how APC and Axin proteins are added into or leave these complexes, and showed that this is critical for this protein machine to work.</p><p>Pronobis et al.'s data also suggest that APC plays two roles, which make the destruction complex more efficient. Firstly, it can interact with Axin via two separate interaction sites that help to assemble the destruction complex. Secondly, specific features in APC allow it to interact with a third protein (called GSK3), which can then regulate how APC interacts with Axin. One of the next challenges will be to uncover how APC helps to transfer the components of Wnt signaling to the next step of their destruction, and to clear up the role played by GSK3.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08022.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08022.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Wnt signaling</kwd><kwd>APC</kwd><kwd>Axin</kwd><kwd>beta-catenin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM47857</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peifer</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HHMI International Student Research Fellowship (no grant number)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pronobis</surname><given-names>Mira I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHBLI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIAHL006126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rusan</surname><given-names>Nasser M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new dynamic mechanistic model explains how the destruction complex negatively regulates Wnt signaling in development and oncogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Wnt signaling pathway is one of the most critical in animals, controlling both cell proliferation and fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>).

Like other powerful signaling pathways driving development and oncogenesis, animals evolved dedicated machinery to keep the Wnt pathway off in the absence of signal. In the OFF-state, βcat levels are kept low by the action of the multiprotein destruction complex, which includes APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the scaffold Axin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and the kinases GSK3 and CK1. In the current model, βcat is recruited into the destruction complex by binding APC or Axin and sequentially phosphorylated by CK1 and GSK3. This creates a binding site for the E3-Ligase SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> and βcat is ubiquitinated and destroyed. Wnt ligand binding to the Wnt receptor inhibits the destruction complex, through a series of events whose order and relative importance remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">MacDonald and He, 2012</xref>). βcat levels rise and it activates Wnt target genes.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08022.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>APC2's Arm rpts provide a second means of interacting with the Axin complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fly APC2 and Axin.

APC and Axin are destruction complex core components. Both are protein interaction hubs, combining folded domains with intrinsically disordered regions carrying peptide motifs that bind protein partners. APC was initially thought to be the scaffold templating βcat phosphorylation but subsequent work revealed that Axin plays this role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hart et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ha et al., 2004</xref>). Axin has binding sites for βcat, APC, GSK3, CK1 and PP2A, and self-polymerizes via its DIX domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which allows it to locally increase the concentration of proteins mediating βcat phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ikeda et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fagotto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fiedler et al., 2011</xref>). Thus while APC is essential for destruction complex function, its role in the complex remained a mystery.</p><p>APC combines an N-terminal Armadillo repeat domain (Arm rpts) with a more C-terminal intrinsically disordered region; each contains binding sites for multiple partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The Arm rpts bind cytoskeletal regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nelson and Nathke, 2013</xref>), and also help regulate Wnt signaling but the relevant binding partner(s) for this is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>). APC's SAMP repeats bind Axin's RGS region, helping mediate destruction complex assembly. Both the Arm rpts and SAMPs are essential for APC function. APC also has multiple βcat binding sites, the 15 and 20 amino acid repeats (15Rs and 20Rs), which have different affinities for βcat, and act redundantly to sequester βcat and fine tune Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>). However, surprisingly, these binding sites are not essential for APC's mechanistic role in βcat destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yamulla et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recent work led to significant insights into how Wnt signaling turns off the destruction complex. Axin turnover and Dvl-Axin hetero-polymerization may inhibit destruction complex function by disassembling the destruction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fiedler et al., 2011</xref>). However, recent studies revealed that the destruction complex remains intact for some time after Wnt signals are received, and can continue to phosphorylate βcat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Thus these studies suggest that Wnt signaling leads to either reduction in the rate of βcat phosphorylation by the destruction complex, or that it inhibits a key regulated step after phosphorylation, perhaps transfer to the E3 ligase, thus turning down an intact destruction complex, leading to high levels of βcat.</p><p>In contrast, less attention has been devoted to the active destruction complex when Wnt signaling is off, the state most relevant to what happens in colon tumors. Strikingly, these tumors lack wild-type APC but instead invariably express a truncated APC protein retaining some but not all functional domains—the reason for this remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albuquerque et al., 2002</xref>). Further, while tumor cells do not effectively target βcat for destruction, it is less clear at what step destruction is blocked by APC truncation. In the simplest model, mutant destruction complexes wouldn't template βcat phosphorylation, but Axin's ability to do this in vitro in APC's absence cast doubt on this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ha et al., 2004</xref>). Further, cancer cells with truncated APC have high levels of phosphorylated βcat, suggesting that the step blocked is after βcat phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kohler et al., 2008</xref>). One intriguing study proposed that APC acts in the destruction complex to protect βcat from dephosphorylation and then targets it to the E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Su et al., 2008</xref>). However phospho-βcat is elevated in APC-mutant cell lines, despite loss of APC function suggesting that protecting βcat from dephosphorylation is not APC's only role in the destruction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). Thus APC's key mechanistic function in the destruction complex remains largely unknown.</p><p>In exploring APC's mechanism of action when Wnt signaling is inactive, we recently focused on two conserved binding sites in APC, 20R2 (R2) and motif B (B; this is also known as the catenin interaction domain = CID; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kohler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schneikert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). R2 is related to the 20R βcat binding sites, but lacks a key interacting residue and cannot bind βcat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). B is immediately adjacent to R2—its function was initially unknown, though it was recently shown to bind α-catenin, and thus play a role in Wnt regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2013</xref>). Strikingly, although other 20Rs are individually dispensable, both R2 and B are essential for the destruction complex to target βcat for destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kohler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schneikert et al., 2014</xref>). Our data further suggested that R2/B negatively regulates APC/Axin interaction, a somewhat surprising role for an essential part of the destruction complex.</p><p>This prompted us to broaden our analysis. Most destruction complex models, even those that consider the kinetics of initial destruction complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2003</xref>), portray it as a static entity that binds, phosphorylates and hands off βcat. Recent work prompted us to consider an alternative hypothesis, viewing the destruction complex as a complex multiprotein entity whose assembly, structure and dynamics are key to its function in maintaining low βcat levels when Wnt signaling is off. To test this hypothesis, we used FRAP, super-resolution microscopy and other approaches to explore the structure and dynamics of the destruction complex. This provided new insights into APC's mechanism of action, providing evidence that it plays two roles inside the active destruction complex: (1) APC promotes efficiency of the destruction complex by enhancing complex assembly through two separate APC:Axin interaction sites, one of which is novel, (2) the novel APC:Axin interaction is dynamic, and regulation of this interaction by GSK3 acting via motifs R2 and B is essential to send phosphorylated βcat to destruction. More broadly, our data also provide insights into how intrinsically disordered regions assist in the assembly and dynamics of multiprotein signaling complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Goal and system used</title><p>Our goal is to define APC's mechanistic role in βcat regulation when Wnt signaling is off. In recent work, we discovered that two motifs in APC's intrinsically unstructured region, R2 and B, are essential for promoting βcat destruction in human cells and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>). Here we sought to define the mechanism by which these motifs and APC itself act, using as a model SW480 colon cancer cells. These cells have high βcat levels, as they lack wildtype human APC1 (hAPC1) and instead express a truncated APC1 protein ending before the mutation cluster region (MCR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). SW480 cells also express human APC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maher et al., 2009</xref>), but this is not sufficient to help mediate βcat destruction. We express in these cells fly APC2, the homolog of hAPC1, a full length APC that shares all conserved regions important for Wnt regulation with hAPC1 but is significantly smaller in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Fly APC2 effectively reduces βcat levels in SW480 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>), and thus can interact with all human destruction complex proteins needed to target βcat for degradation.</p><p>There is abundant evidence that the functional destruction complex is a multimer of the individual destruction complex proteins. One important underpinning of this idea is that Axin oligimerizes via self-polymerization of the DIX domain, and this multimerization is critical for its Wnt regulatory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kishida et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007</xref>). Endogenous Axin forms small puncta in cultured cells and when overexpressed these puncta become more prominent, in a DIX-domain dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fagotto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faux et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The level of Axin over-expression needed to trigger more prominent Axin puncta is not dramatic—for example, treatment of SW480 cells with tankyrase inhibitors increased levels of AXIN1 3-5x and AXIN2 5-20x and this was sufficient to trigger formation of Axin puncta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Roche et al., 2014</xref>). Axin puncta are dynamic multiprotein complexes that can recruit APC and other destruction complex proteins, and previous data from many labs are consistent with the idea that the puncta can serve as useful models of the smaller endogenous destruction complexes, based on correlations between puncta formation, dynamics, and function in βcat destruction (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faux et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fiedler et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We and others previously identified the key structural domains of APC and Axin that are essential for destruction complex function and βcat destruction (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>). Our current goal was to define how these proteins' domains function together to facilitate APC and the destruction complex's mechanisms of action. To do so, we used the APC:Axin puncta formed in SW480 cells as a visible and thus measurable read-out to study mechanisms underlying destruction complex structure, assembly, dynamics and function.</p><p>Our experiments and those of many earlier investigators used transfected human or in our case fly proteins to study Wnt signaling in cultured mammalian cells (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bilic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fiedler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). This strategy likely leads to both variable expression levels between cells and elevated expression relative to endogenous protein. We first investigated variation from cell to cell within a transfection, by quantitating whole cell fluorescence of GFP- or RFP-tagged APC2 or Axin and investigating whether different levels of Axin or APC2 expression altered the ability to down-regulate βcat levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). There was a substantial range of APC2 or Axin expression levels among cells (5- to 10-fold). Importantly, βcat levels were substantially reduced at all levels of APC2 or Axin expression, even the lowest levels assessed—this was true for Axin alone, APC2 alone, or Axin plus APC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In all cases, ability to reduce βcat levels was somewhat diminished at the highest levels of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>)—this may be because at very high expression levels, the transfected protein forms non-functional complexes with only a subset of the destruction complex proteins, as was previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>We next used immunoblotting to get order of magnitude estimates for the level of expression of our transfected constructs relative to the endogenous proteins. We describe the procedure used in detail in the Materials and methods. We began with Axin, to determine the level of over-expression of fly Axin vs endogenous human Axin. Since fly Axin is not recognized by hAxin1 antibodies we did this in two steps, first comparing levels of tagged human Axin1 vs <italic>Drosophila</italic> Axin using antibodies against the epitope tag, and then comparing the levels of the transfected human Axin1 vs the endogenous Axin1 protein in SW480, using antibodies against human Axin1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We then used these ratios and the transfection efficiencies to calculate the average ratio of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Axin:endogenous hAxin1. Transfected Axin accumulated at roughly 80- to 120-fold that of endogenous hAxin1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). For APC, estimating ‘overexpression’ was more problematic, as SW480 cells do not accumulate wild-type APC1—instead they accumulate a truncated APC1 ending at amino acid 1338 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We thus used a similar two-step process, comparing levels of tagged human APC1 cloned so as to mimic the truncated APC1 seen in SW480 cells vs tagged <italic>Drosophila</italic> APC2 using antibodies to the epitope, and then levels of tagged truncated human APC1 vs that of the endogenous truncated APC1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This ratio was roughly 1400–2400 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We suspect this is an over-estimate of the relative ratio of <italic>Drosophila</italic> APC2 to <underline>normal levels</underline> of hAPC1 in a wild-type colon cell, as the truncated APC1 protein present in SW480 cells would accumulate at lower levels than wild-type APC1 if it is subjected to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, like many other proteins with early stop codons and like other truncated <italic>APC1</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castellsagué et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Popp and Maquat, 2013</xref>). Further, we also may need to reduce the ratio by a further factor of two as it is probable SW480 cells carry only one copy of the truncated APC allele, as most colorectal tumors either have the second allele mutated early enough to not produce a truncated protein or have lost the second allele by deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christie et al., 2013</xref>). Regardless, it is important to remember that while the puncta provide a useful and visualizable model of the destruction complex, we are examining over-expressed proteins.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08022.006</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Quantitation of relative expression levels of transfected versus endogenous APC and Axin</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08022.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08022.006</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="4">Summary Axin overexpression</th></tr><tr><th>Experiment</th><th>I</th><th>II</th><th>III</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ratio GFP-FlyAxin to GFP-hAxin1</td><td>1.04</td><td>0.11</td><td>0.48</td></tr><tr><td>Ratio GFP-hAxin1 to endo hAxin1</td><td>33.87</td><td>431.67</td><td>62.82</td></tr><tr><td>Transfection efficiency</td><td>30%</td><td>42%</td><td>36%</td></tr><tr><td>Fold overexpression level of GFP-FlyAxin to endo hAxin1</td><td>117.41</td><td>113.06</td><td>83.76</td></tr></tbody></table><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="4">Summary APC2 overexpresssion</th></tr><tr><th>Experiment</th><th>I</th><th>II</th><th>III</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ratio Flag-FlyAPC2 to Flag-hAPC1-1338</td><td>17.31</td><td>138.45</td><td>28.02</td></tr><tr><td>Ratio Flag-hAPC1-1338 to endo hAPC1-1338</td><td>25.17</td><td>5.86</td><td>14.69</td></tr><tr><td>Transfection efficiency</td><td>30%</td><td>33%</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td>Fold overexpression level of Flag-FlyAPC2 to endo hAPC1-1338</td><td>1452.30</td><td>2458.54</td><td>1646.46</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A novel Axin:APC association site regulated by APC motifs R2 and B</title><p>To probe destruction complex structure and dynamics, we first need to define mechanisms of complex assembly. In the current model, destruction complex assembly is mediated by interaction of APC2's SAMPs and Axin's RGS domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fagotto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with this, deleting the SAMPs disrupted APC2 recruitment into Axin puncta. However a shorter APC2 mutant, lacking both the SAMPs and R2 and B and thus resembling the truncated hAPC1 in tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), did co-localize with Axin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>). We further found that deleting R2 and/or B, both of which are essential for APC function in flies and mammals, restored colocalization of Axin and APC2∆SAMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>). Thus a second means of mediating APC2:Axin interactions must exist, that is separate from the known SAMP:RGS interaction.</p><p>To identify the protein sequences mediating this putative R2/B regulated mechanism by which APC2 and Axin can interact, we truncated APC2 from its C-terminus, and assessed APC2 mutant colocalization with Axin. APC2's Arm rpts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) formed cytoplasmic puncta when expressed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), consistent with APC2's ability to self-oligimerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kunttas-Tatli et al., 2014</xref>). When co-expressed with Axin, the Arm rpts and Axin puncta associate, suggesting the Arm rpts are the Axin association site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> arrows; intriguingly they often did not precisely colocalize, in contrast with the full length proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>)). Next we defined where on Axin the Arm rpts associate, by expressing Axin fragments and conducting co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Both full length Axin and a region including the GSK3 binding site co-IPed with APC's Arm rpts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Axin's DIX domain was weakly detected in co-IPs, but this may occur by polymerization with full-length endogenous human Axin1 (hAxin1). Thus fly APC2's Arm rpts can mediate association with Axin's middle region. This was exciting, as it may explain the Arm rpts essential role in Wnt regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCartney et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To determine if this second APC:Axin interaction mechanism is conserved in humans and whether it occurs between proteins expressed at endogenous levels, we used SW480 cells, in which endogenous hAPC1 is truncated after 20R1 at 1338aa, thus lacking the SAMPs, R2 and B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). hAPC1-1338aa co-IPed with endogenous hAxin1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

When coexpressed, they colocalized in cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref> arrows), suggesting both hAPC1 and fly APC2 can associate with the Axin complex in two ways: the known interaction via the SAMPs and this novel interaction via the Arm rpts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Axin and APC2 form structured macromolecular complexes in vivo</title><p>Given this new data on destruction complex assembly, we next explored the structures assembled by Axin vs Axin plus APC, using the puncta formed in SW480 cells as a visualizable destruction complex model. While current data suggest Axin polymerization and APC recruitment are essential for destruction complex function, previous microscopy provided only limited information about the internal structure of Axin–APC complexes in vivo. In these images, Axin and APC colocalized in puncta without resolvable internal structure (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mendoza-Topaz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).

We thus used the superresolution approach Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) to visualize APC:Axin complexes, revealing a striking and previously undescribed internal structure.

To test this hypothesis, we quantified puncta cross-sectional area in Axin vs APC + Axin expressing cells, making z-projections of transfected cells and using the ImageJ particle analyzer. This revealed APC2:Axin puncta average almost twice the cross-sectional area of puncta formed by Axin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, left). We confirmed this by comparing the volume of Axin and APC:Axin complexes, as measured from our SIM data—once again APC + Axin puncta were on average significantly larger than those assembled from Axin alone, and the largest APC + Axin puncta were larger than any of the Axin puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). When we compared the average number of complexes in Axin alone vs APC2 + Axin expressing cells, we found twice as many complexes in cells expressing Axin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, right), suggesting that in the absence of functional APC, Axin forms more numerous but smaller puncta.

We began by measuring βcat fluorescence intensity in z-projections of cells transfected with either APC2 + Axin or Axin alone, using untransfected cells as internal controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–H</xref>). Interestingly, while Axin reduced total βcat levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>), βcat was further reduced in cells expressing both APC2 and Axin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,I</xref>) suggesting that APC2 promotes more effective destruction complex activity.</p><p>Cells expressing APC2 ‘alone’ also had strong βcat reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,H</xref>), presumably due to interaction with endogenous human Axin. We thus tested whether fly APC2 can and does interact with human Axin. Fly GFP-APC2 colocalizes in puncta with exogenous hAxin1-RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>), and more importantly, endogenous hAxin1 coIPs with Flag-APC2 expressed in SW480 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). One further caveat is that we were assessing the ability of APC2 and Axin to promote βcat destruction after over-expression. To determine if differing levels of over-expression might explain the differences between Axin and APC2 + Axin (or ‘APC2 alone’), we quantitated level of Axin or APC2 expression in a given cell by measuring levels of GFP/RFP fluorescence, and in parallel assessed levels of βcat in that cell (via fluorescence intensity). Strikingly, βcat levels were more effectively reduced by APC2 + Axin or by ‘APC2 alone’ than by Axin at <underline>all levels</underline> of expression assessed. As noted above, in all cases, ability to reduce βcat levels was somewhat diminished at the highest levels of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>)—this may be because at very high expression levels, the transfected protein forms non-functional complexes with only a subset of the destruction complex proteins, as was previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2003</xref>). Together these data support the hypothesis that APC2 enhances Axin's ability to promote βcat destruction.</p><p>Interestingly, in Axin-alone transfected cells, much of the excess βcat that accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) was in Axin puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G′</xref>, inset, arrow). In contrast, puncta in cells co-expressing APC2 and Axin had almost undetectable βcat levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I′</xref>, inset). We thus hypothesized that APC enhances Axin's ability to promote βcat exit from the destruction complex, and thus the destruction complex's βcat throughput. To further explore this, we examined phospho-βcat levels. SW480 cells, like other colon cancer cell lines with hAPC1 truncated before the Mutation Cluster Region (MCR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), have high phospho-βcat levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). This suggests that while Axin can facilitate βcat phosphorylation in these cells, Axin is less efficient at targeting βcat for destruction in the absence of wild-type APC1, and thus phosphorylated βcat accumulates. Strikingly, expressing APC2 alone or APC2 + Axin dramatically decreased phospho-serine 33/37 βcat (to ∼20% that in untransfected cells), while Axin alone reduced phospho-βcat to only 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L,M</xref>). These data further support the hypothesis that APC2 enhances Axin's ability to promote βcat destruction.</p><p>One potential caveat to the increased accumulation of βcat in puncta of cells expressing Axin alone vs those expressing APC2 plus Axin is that the former cells may simply have higher overall levels of βcat, thus resulting in higher accumulation in puncta. To address this, we inhibited βcat destruction using the proteasome inhibitor MG132. As others have previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sadot et al., 2002</xref>), proteasome inhibition elevates βcat levels. Proteasome inhibition elevates βcat levels both in cells expressing Axin alone and in those expressing APC2 plus Axin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Strikingly, this allows it to accumulate in puncta even in cells expressing Axin + APC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A vs B</xref>). However, cells expressing Axin still accumulate significantly higher levels of βcat than those expressing Axin plus APC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Together, these data are consistent with a model in which APC increases βcat throughput of the destruction complex by stabilizing Axin assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Both APC2's Arm rpts and SAMPs are required to stabilize APC2:Axin complexes and regulate its substructure</title><p>Since APC associates with Axin via two regions, the Arm rpts and SAMP motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we hypothesized each interaction helps stabilize destruction complex assembly. To test this, we first measured APC2 dynamics when either the Arm rpts or SAMPs were individually deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Deleting either region increased APC2 dynamics in Axin puncta; APC2ΔArm and APC2ΔSAMPs turnover reached higher plateaus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; 80–90% vs 40% for wild-type) in shorter times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; t<sub>1/2</sub> wildtype APC2 150 s; APC2ΔArm 75 s; APC2ΔSAMPs &lt;25 s). Thus, APC2 needs both the Arm rpts and the SAMPs to stably associate with Axin complexes. Next we examined Axin dynamics in the presence of each APC2 mutant. Both the Arm rpts and SAMPs were required to stabilize Axin in destruction complexes, since Axin coexpressed with either APC2ΔArm or APC2ΔSAMPs exhibited the fast dynamics characteristic of Axin expressed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

We thus tested whether both Axin interaction sites were essential for the effects on the structure of Axin puncta. APC2ΔArm, which retains the SAMPs, closely colocalized with Axin, even at SIM resolution, rather than forming filaments of its own within puncta, like wild-type APC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Further, Axin within these puncta remained simple in structure, similar to puncta formed by Axin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). APC2ΔSAMPs, which is much less tightly associated with Axin by either confocal localization or coIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hart et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>), did not strongly colocalize with Axin, instead forming a diffuse network surrounding Axin puncta. Importantly, APC2ΔSAMPs did not alter Axin structure within puncta as visualized by SIM. In the presence of APC2∆SAMPs, Axin puncta retained the simpler structure of those formed by Axin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–K</xref>). Further, neither APC2ΔArm nor APC2ΔSAMPs increased Axin puncta size or reduced Axin puncta number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L–N</xref>). Thus APC's ability to stabilize destruction complexes and stimulate growth of Axin cables requires both sites mediating Axin complex interaction, the Arm rpts and SAMPs. Both sites are also required to allow APC2 to efficiently downregulate βcat levels; APC2∆SAMPs did not stimulate βcat destruction below Axin-alone mediated levels, while APC2∆Armrpts could not downregulate βcat levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O</xref>).

Our data above reveal the new Axin complex-association site is in APC's Arm rpts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Since removing R2/B restored APC/Axin interaction even in the absence of the SAMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>), we hypothesized R2/B negatively regulates APC2 Armrpt:Axin interaction and that release of this interaction is essential to allow phosphorylated βcat to be moved on to destruction.</p><p>Our hypothesis predicted deleting either R2 or B should stabilize APC2:Axin interaction, by enabling APC2's Arm rpts to also productively mediate association with Axin.

Thus without R2, APC2's Arm rpts associate more robustly with Axin complexes, slowing APC2 dynamics. In contrast, SAMPs:Axin interaction was not regulated by R2 or B: APC2ΔArm (in which the only remaining interaction with Axin was via the SAMPs), APC2ΔArmΔR2, and APC2ΔArmΔB all had similar recovery plateaus and t<sub>1/2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>), and co-IPs showed no difference in APC2:Axin association among these constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>).

APC2∆SAMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) is only weakly recruited into Axin puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). If GSK3 phosphorylation of R2/B antagonizes Arm rpts:Axin association, inhibiting GSK3 should increase colocalization of APC2ΔSAMPs with Axin, as did deleting R2 or B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Strikingly, while APC2∆SAMPs is largely diffusely cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), BIO treatment strongly increased Axin:APC2ΔSAMPs colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> arrows), in a concentration dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Consistent with this, only 16% of untreated control cells had APC2ΔSAMPs:Axin colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), while inhibiting GSK3 with BIO increased colocalization to 75% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). LiCl also led to robust Axin:APC2ΔSAMPs colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H</xref>; quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1I</xref>). We used coIP to verify that APC2ΔSAMPs associates more robustly with Axin upon GSK3 inhibition. Deleting the SAMPs drastically reduced APC2:Axin coIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>; quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). GSK3 inhibition by either LiCl or BIO increased APC2ΔSAMPs coIP with Axin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,H</xref>). Thus GSK3 inhibition stabilizes steady state Axin:APC2∆SAMPs association, as did deleting R2 or B, consistent with our model that phosphorylating these motifs normally antagonizes Axin:Arm rpts association.</p><p>The hypothesis that association of APC2's Arm rpts with Axin is regulated by GSK3 also predicts inhibiting GSK3 should affect APC2 dynamics in the destruction complex, as did deleting R2 or B. Consistent with this, inhibiting GSK3 dramatically decreased APC2's dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>; plateau reduced from 40% to 10%; t<sub>1/2</sub> increased from 150 to &gt;1000 s). This suggests APC2 turnover in Axin complexes is regulated by GSK3. Our model further predicts that GSK3 regulates APC2 dynamics by regulating the APC2Arm rpts:Axin association. Thus GSK3 inhibition should stabilize APC2ΔSAMPs:Axin interactions and reduce APC2ΔSAMPs dynamics. As predicted, APC2ΔSAMPs rapid turnover was dramatically decreased by GSK3 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). In contrast, GSK3 inhibition had no effect on APC2∆Arm turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1J</xref>). These data suggest that GSK3 activity promotes release of APC2's Arm rpts from the Axin complex.</p><p>Our data are consistent with GSK3 acting via phosphorylating R2 and/or B, but could also be mediated via other effects of GSK3. To assess this, we examined whether inhibiting GSK3 affected turnover of an APC2ΔSAMPs mutant lacking both R2 and B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), reasoning this would assess the effect of GSK3 on regulation of the Axin:APC2Arm rpts interaction. Strikingly, the recovery plateau and t<sub>1/2</sub> of APC2ΔR2/BΔSAMPs were insensitive to GSK3 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>), in contrast to APC2∆SAMPs. These data are consistent with GSK3 affecting APC2 residence time in the destruction complex through R2/B. However, deleting R2/B and blocking GSK3 activity had different effects on APC2 recovery fraction, suggesting that not all effects of GSK3 are mediated through R2/B. GSK3 phosphorylates other targets in the destruction complex, and thus it is very likely GSK3 inhibition has additional means of altering destruction complex dynamics. Further, an unphosphorylated R2/B motif may affect APC's dynamics differently than deleting R2/B. Taken together, however, our data suggest that GSK3 acts in part through R2 and B to promote release of APC2's Arm rpts from the Axin complex.</p><p>If GSK3 inhibition stabilizes the interaction of APC2 and Axin, and as noted above, APC2 also can stabilize Axin in puncta, increasing their size (and thus decreasing puncta number), then GSK3 inhibition might synergize with APC, further increasing the size of Axin puncta. We thus inhibited GSK3 with either BIO or LiCl in cells co-expressing Axin and APC2 and examined both puncta size and number. GSK3 inhibition did not further increase puncta size or further decrease puncta number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>). These data are consistent with our analysis above of APC2∆R2 and APC∆B—these mutations also stabilize APC2 in the destruction complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) but do not further increase puncta size or decrease puncta number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F–J</xref>). We also tested whether proteasome inhibition might trigger enlargement of the APC + Axin complexes—this also did not further increase puncta size or further decrease puncta number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>). Thus, while APC2 can stabilize Axin complexes, inhibition of GSK3 or the proteasome does not synergize with this.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Mutating putative phosphorylation sites in B disrupts APC2's function in regulating βcat destruction in SW480 cells</title><p>We hypothesized that R2/B phosphorylation by GSK3 is a key step in APC2's mechanism to target βcat for destruction.

Our hypothesis suggests phosphorylation of R2/B promotes release of APC2's Arm rpts from the Axin complex, and that this would be essential for the catalytic cycle of the destruction complex—thus mutating these putative GSK3 phosphorylation sites in motif B would reduce APC2 function in helping mediate βcat destruction. To begin to test this, we replaced 2 (APC2AA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, red arrows), 4 or 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, magenta arrowheads) conserved serines in B that match the GSK3 consensus with alanine, to prevent phosphorylation. All reduced function in downregulating βcat levels (see below and data not shown). We thus focused on the least altered of these, the mutant that replaced the more N-terminal two serine residues with alanine (APC2AA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, red arrows), thus preventing phosphorylation. We also created a mutant that replaced these same two residues with aspartic acid, creating a phosphomimetic APC2 (APC2DD). Strikingly, while APC2DD effectively reduced βcat levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,F</xref>), APC2AA was unable to do so. APC2AA cells accumulated βcat at levels as high or higher than adjacent untransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D,F</xref>), suggesting these two amino acid missense mutations substantially reduced APC2 function. APC2DD substantially reduced βcat levels (to ∼30%), but was not quite as effective as wildtype APC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). This statistically significant difference may suggest dephosphorylation of these residues is also required for full APC2 function. We also found mutating a single conserved serine residue in R2 to alanine (APC2 R2S-&gt;A (=APC2S660A); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) strongly diminished APC2 function in reducing βcat levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref>). Together, these data are consistent with a model in which phosphorylation of conserved serines in APC2 motifs R2 and B are important for APC's function in the destruction complex to target βcat for degradation. Finally, we tested whether the first of these putative phosphomutants affected APC2 dynamics in the FRAP assay. Since GSK3 inhibition slowed APC's dynamics, we predicted APC2AA should have a lower turnover rate than wildtype APC or APC2DD. We saw a subtle but statistically significant reduction in APC2AA recovery fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). However this was not nearly as dramatic as that of deleting R2 or B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>); perhaps this due to the fact that we only altered two of several potential phosphorylation sites. Together these data are consistent with the idea that phosphorylation of conserved serine residues in R2/B regulates APC's function in the destruction complex, but since the effect on dynamics was substantially less dramatic than that of deleting R2 or B, it suggests other residues in R2 and B may also contribute to regulating APC2 dynamics. Further, it is clear that GSK3 has other effects on the complex, complicating interpretation of its inhibition. It will be important to examine this in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Mutating putative phosphorylation sites in B severely reduces APC2's function in regulating βcat destruction or cell fate in vivo in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>To test the role of these two putative phosphorylation sites in APC function in an in vivo context where we can examine both cells receiving and not receiving Wnt signals, we turned to <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where we can express mutant APC2 under control of the endogenous <italic>APC2</italic> promoter in the complete absence of all endogenous APC function, using embryos maternally and zygotically <italic>APC2 APC1</italic> double mutant<italic>.</italic> We generated transgenics expressing APC2DD or APC2AA using the endogenous APC2 promotor (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>), and crossed them into the <italic>APC2 APC1</italic> mutant background.

In wildtype embryos, a row of cells in each body segment expresses the Wnt homolog Wingless (Wg), thus regulating cell fate. In cells not receiving Wg signal, the destruction complex effectively destroys βcat that is not sequestered in cadherin-catenin complexes at the cell membrane, and cells choose anterior fates and secrete cuticle covered with denticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B1</xref>). In contrast, cells receiving Wg signal accumulate cytoplasmic and nuclear βcat, choose posterior fates, and secrete naked cuticle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B1</xref>). Maternal/zygotic <italic>APC2 APC1</italic> mutants cannot destroy βcat and thus all cells accumulate extremely high levels of βcat, resulting in a smaller embryo in which all surviving cells choose posterior fates and secrete naked cuticle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akong et al., 2002</xref>). Like our wildtype APC transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B3</xref>), APC2DD fully restored alternating anterior (denticle) and posterior (naked cuticle) fates, resembling wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B4</xref>). In contrast, APC2AA largely failed to restore cell fates. Most embryos lost nearly all denticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B5–7</xref>), thus resembling embryos expressing an indestructible form of βcat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pai et al., 1997</xref>). This suggested APC2AA has severely reduced regulatory function, though it is not completely dead.</p><p>The final test was to examine how well these APC2 mutants restored βcat destruction. In wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,J</xref>), Wg signal expressed in segmental stripes turns down destruction complex activity, leading to successive stripes of cells with only cortical βcat (destruction complex on) or with elevated cytoplasmic and nuclear βcat (destruction complex turned down). In contrast <italic>APC2 APC1</italic> maternal/zygotic mutants have exceptionally high βcat levels in all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). We scored mutant embryos blinded to genotype. Consistent with its rescue of viability and cell fate, APC2DD fully rescued βcat destruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F,K,O</xref>; 30/30 APC2DD embryos were scored as wild-type). In contrast, APC2AA had substantially reduced destruction complex function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9O</xref>; 14/29 embryos scored as mutant, consistent with 50% zygotic rescue). Maternal/zygotic <italic>APC2 APC1</italic> double mutants expressing APC2AA did not totally lose destruction complex function or the ability to respond to Wg signal. Stripes of cells with relatively reduced βcat levels were still present, but overall levels of βcat were substantially elevated and interestingly, levels were especially elevated in a subset of cells receiving Wg signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G–I,L–N</xref>). Together, these data suggest that these two putative phosphorylation sites in B are critical for APC2 function in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Mutations in APC disrupt embryonic development from its onset, and are the first step in most colon cancers. Although we know APC functions in the destruction complex to help target βcat for degradation, its mechanism of action remains unknown. Our study offers novel insights into APC's function in the destruction complex, providing the first glimpses of the internal structure of the APC:Axin complex, and leading to a novel dynamic and testable model of a regulated catalytic cycle of destruction complex function. Based on our data we propose an explicit mechanistic model for APC2 function inside the destruction complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). In step 1, APC2 stabilizes destruction complex assembly via its Arm rpts and SAMPs motifs. The assembled destruction complex then facilitates βcat phosphorylation (step 2) and protects it from dephosphorylation. GSK3, which phosphorylates βcat, Axin and other sites on APC, also phosphorylates APC2's R2 and B (step 3; CK1 may also be involved, as it is in the other phosphorylation events in the complex). We hypothesize this induces a conformational change in APC2 that releases the Arm rpts from association with Axin (step 4); since only a subset of APC2 molecules in the destruction complex would release the Arm rpts at any given time, the overall destruction complex would remain stable. We propose this conformational change allows transfer of phospho-βcat to the E3-ligase (step 5). Alternately, GSK3 may regulate the release of a complex of APC and phospho-βcat, allowing APC to shield phospho-βcat from dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Su et al., 2008</xref>) and guide it to the E3-ligase. The catalytic cycle of APC would then be reset by dephosphorylation (step 6). This provides a testable model for the mechanisms regulating a key signaling pathway. It also may provide insights into the assembly and dynamics of other large multiprotein complexes that assemble via dynamic multivalent interactions involving motifs within intrinsically disordered regions, leading to phase transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Toretsky and Wright, 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08022.025</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Speculative Model of APC2's catalytic cycle inside the destruction complex.</title><p>(1) APC2 assembles with Axin via its Arm rpts and SAMPs.

One mechanism involved was already known: the DIX domain of Axin polymerizes in a head-to-tail fashion, in which beta-sheet 2 of one DIX domain interacts with beta-sheet 4 of the next monomer, thus forming filaments, and this polymerization is essential for destruction complex function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fiedler et al., 2011</xref>). These Axin polymers are responsible for assembly of the cytoplasmic puncta we use as a model. Previous and current data from a number of labs are consistent with the idea that the puncta serve as useful models of the smaller endogenous destruction complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faux et al., 2008</xref>), based on correlations between puncta formation, dynamics, and function in βcat destruction.

Our FRAP and super-resolution microscopy data support a model in which one role of APC is to promote/stabilize Axin self-assembly and slow Axin turnover in the destruction complex, thus increasing destruction complex multimerization and its ability to process βcat. We found APC does so by interacting with Axin via <underline>two</underline> different kinds of interaction sites: the known direct interaction with the SAMPs, and a novel interaction via APC's Arm rpts, which may be direct or indirect. Both interactions are critical for targeting βcat for destruction since APC without either SAMPs or Arm rpts cannot reduce βcat levels effectively. Almost all truncations in colon cancers remove the SAMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kohler et al., 2008</xref>). Earlier data from our lab also implicated APC's Arm repeats in Wnt regulation—our new results provide a mechanistic basis for this effect.</p><p>APC2:Axin complexes were previously only resolved as co-localized spots.

Super-resolution microscopy revealed that Axin puncta consist of Axin cables/sheets, which we hypothesize are bundled Axin polymers, assembled by the previously observed DIX domain polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with our observation that APC2 promotes growth and reduces dynamics of Axin complexes, APC2 cables intertwine with and bridge Axin cables. Both Axin interaction sites are required for these effects. Stimulating growth of Axin complexes via destruction complex stabilization by APC2 may be essential when proteins are expressed at endogenous levels, increasing local concentrations of all destruction complex components, accounting for the highly efficient βcat destruction observed in the presence of APC. It will be interesting to explore the nature of the protein network involved at even higher resolution. As noted above, thus far we have visualized complexes of APC2 and Axin expressed at significantly elevated levels—it will be important to verify and extend these studies to the more modest size complexes found in vivo during normal development, using CRISPR to tag endogenous loci.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Axin and APC cooperate to ensure efficient βcat destruction</title><p>APC mutations in tumors do not eliminate APC; instead the N-terminus, Arm rpts and some βcat binding sites remain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kohler et al., 2008</xref>). Truncations cluster in the mutation cluster region (MCR), suggesting this region is critical. R2 and B, which are removed by truncations in the MCR, are essential for βcat downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kohler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>). In the textbook model, the destruction complex phosphorylates βcat and thus targets it to an E3 ligase. It was thus surprising that colon cancer cells with truncations disrupting R2/B have high levels of phosphorylated βcat, in contrast to tumors retaining R2/B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). Why do cells with non-functional APC have high levels of phosphorylated βcat?</p><p>Our data, together with earlier work, suggest Axin, the scaffold of the destruction complex, can mediate βcat phosphorylation even in cells with truncated APC, like the SW480 cells we use as a model, in which R2 and B are lost. Overexpressing Axin reduced total βcat levels, suggesting Axin can partially compensate for APC truncation, but phospho-βcat levels remained elevated inside the destruction complex. Interestingly, introducing APC2 reduced βcat accumulation in puncta and reduced phospho-βcat levels. These data suggest that without functional APC, Axin can mediate βcat phosphorylation, but transfer of βcat out of the destruction complex toward destruction is less efficient. It remains to be determined whether the accumulated phospho-βcat is actively transferred by Axin to the E3-ligase in the absence of functional APC, or if it is passively transferred due to a substantial increase in phospho-βcat. Thus while Axin can template βcat phosphorylation and can, at least in the presence of the truncated APC1 present in tumor cells, send it on to destruction, our data suggest APC promotes the rate at which βcat is transferred out of the destruction complex and sent to the proteasome. Future use of photoactivatible βcat constructs will further clarify this.</p><p>Based on our model APC mediated βcat transfer is only possible when R2 and B are maintained in the truncated APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). R2 and B are essential for function in the absence of endogenous APC function in vivo in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>). In SW480 cells our data suggest they are essential for APC2 to further simulate the rate of βcat destruction mediated by Axin transfection. Consistent with this, tumor cells that retain R2/B in the truncated APC have low levels of phospho-βcat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting APC is still able to facilitate βcat transfer out of the destruction complex due to the presence of the Arm rpts, R2 and B (although the transfer would be less efficient due to loss of the SAMPs, the Axin binding sites). In contrast, truncated APC mutants that disrupt R2 and B function can associate with the Axin complex via the Arm rpts, but would not be able to assist in βcat transfer out of the destruction complex. The development of CRISPR knockout technology will allow future examination of the importance of truncated APC1, as well as the endogenous APC2 and Axin expressed in colon cancer cells in destruction complex assembly and function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Destruction complex function requires dynamic APC2:Axin interactions regulated by R2/B</title><p>APC's Arm rpts bind cytoskeletal regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nelson and Nathke, 2013</xref>), but their mechanism of action in Wnt signaling remained unclear. The fact that overexpressing hAPC1 fragments lacking the Arm rpts in SW480 cells rescued Wnt regulation initially suggested the Arm rpts were dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rubinfeld et al., 1997</xref>). However these fragments were only tested in the presence of the truncated endogenous hAPC1 in these cells, which retains the Arm rpts. Thus hAPC1 fragments without Arm rpts may work with endogenous truncated APC, restoring partial function. In contrast, in flies, in the complete absence of endogenous APC, APC2 requires its Arm rpts for Wnt regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCartney et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>). Our data provide the first mechanistic role for the Arm rpts in Wnt function, demonstrating they act as a regulated Axin interaction site, and revealing that this interaction is conserved in humans. Whether this interaction is direct or indirect remains to be determined.</p><p>What then is the mechanism by which APC facilitates βcat destruction? Two conserved APC motifs, R2 and B, are essential to target βcat for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kohler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>). Deleting either leads to βcat accumulation in the destruction complex, suggesting R2 and B are critical for destruction complex throughput of βcat. Our colocalization, FRAP, and co-IP assays further suggest R2/B controls APC2:Axin association via APC2's Arm rpts. These data are consistent with a model in which APC2's R2 and B trigger an intramolecular conformational change in APC2, releasing the Arm rpts from association with the Axin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). In contrast, the SAMPs bind Axin independently of R2/B. In our model binding via the SAMPs would keep APC associated with Axin complexes when the Arm rpts are released, maintaining a functional destruction complex and facilitating βcat transfer to the E3-ligase. However, as noted above, it is also possible GSK3 may regulate the release of a complex of APC and phospho-βcat, allowing APC to shield phospho-βcat from dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Su et al., 2008</xref>) on the way to the E3-ligase.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>GSK3 phosphorylation of R2 and B may be the trigger for releasing the APC Arm repeat:Axin interaction</title><p>Motifs R2 and B include highly conserved serine/threonines matching the GSK3 and CK1 consensuses, and this region is phosphorylated by GSK3 in vitro. GSK3 increases APC2 dynamics, destabilizing the Arm rpts:Axin association via a mechanism that requires R2 and B. Strikingly, mutating two conserved serines in B to alanine blocked APC2's ability to reduce βcat levels, while a parallel phosphomimetic mutant did not disrupt APC2 function. We saw a similar reduction in APC2 function after mutating a conserved serine residue in R2. Consistent with our data, CK1epsilon phosphorylation of hAPC1 R2 occurs in an Axin-dependent fashion, and site directed mutagenesis blocking phosphorylation of two conserved serines in R2 (hAPC1 S1389 and S1392; distinct from and just C-terminal to the residue we mutated in APC2 R2) reduced the ability of a human APC1 fragment to down regulate Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubinfeld et al., 2001</xref>), further suggesting R2 phosphorylation also is important for APC function. Our data are consistent with a model in which GSK3 phosphorylation of R2 and B could be one major regulatory step in APC2's dynamic cycle in the destruction complex, triggering release of the Arm rpts from the Axin complex, and thus allowing APC2 to promote βcat release for destruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). However, our data also show that mutating two residues in motif B to prevent their phosphorylation had only a subtle effect on APC2 dynamics. This may suggest additive roles for multiple phosphorylated residues, or may suggest the connection between phosphorylation, dynamics and function is more complex. Further, GSK3 can phosphorylate most of the other proteins in the destruction complex, and thus it clearly plays multiple roles in its function.</p><p>Phosphorylation of R2/B itself could trigger release of APC's Arm rpts from the Axin complex, or alternately, phosphorylation may create a binding site for a binding partner that carries out this function. Intriguingly, a recent study found that α-catenin co-IPs with motif B of hAPC1, and suggests α-catenin is an essential player in destruction complex function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2013</xref>). Perhaps R2/B phosphorylation by GSK3 regulates association of α-catenin with APC, and its binding induces alterations in APC:Axin interactions. It will be exciting to test this hypothesis.</p><p>The multiple potential phosphorylation sites in R2/B, the hypomorphic nature of our double point mutant in <italic>Drosophila</italic> vs the complete loss of function after deleting either R2 or B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>), and the residual function of our two-residue phosphomimetic mutant may suggest different combinations of phosphorylated residues in R2 and B help tune and regulate APC function in the destruction complex. Our results also suggest GSK3 is likely to affect destruction complex structure and dynamics via several mechanisms, consistent with its known role in phosphorylating Axin and other sites in APC. Mathematical modeling suggests that a reduction in GSK3 ability to phosphorylate βcat is one key step in Wnt signaling activation, placing GSK3 activity in the center of ‘destruction complex inactivation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2003</xref>). It is intriguing to speculate about GSK3-mediated APC regulation in the context of Wnt signaling. Since GSK3 activity is inhibited by Wnt signaling, key residues in R2 and B that drive APC:Axin interaction dynamics would no longer be phosphorylated. Our data suggest this would decrease APC dynamics in the Axin complex (since APC's Arm rpts would more strongly associate with Axin), perhaps reducing βcat transfer out of the destruction complex. Thus the drop in GSK3 activity upon Wnt signaling would not only downregulate the destruction complex via its main target, βcat, but through a core destruction complex component, APC, by acting via R2 and B. It will be of interest to explore further these complex interactions in both Wnt off and Wnt on states.</p><p>One intriguing property of the APC2AA mutant in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is that Wnt regulation of βcat was maintained, but βcat levels were elevated in <underline>both</underline> Wnt off and Wnt on regions, presumably reflecting a less efficient destruction complex. This re-focused our attention on the much higher levels of βcat seen in <italic>APC2 APC1</italic> mutants than occur in wildtype cells where Wg signal turns the destruction complex ‘OFF’. These results suggest the destruction complex remains active when Wnt signal is on, but operates less effectively—this is very consistent with recent in vitro work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>). A destruction complex operating at reduced levels could lead to high enough βcat levels to activate Wnt target genes but could maintain low enough levels to be quickly shut down when needed; it would also prevent the apoptosis seen in some cell types at extremely high βcat levels. The drop in GSK3 activity upon Wnt signaling would both decrease phosphorylated βcat and, based on our model, inhibit APC facilitating βcat transfer to the E3-Ligase. This speculative hypothesis would merge two recent studies proposing either reduced βcat phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>) or a key regulated step involving transfer of βcat to the E3-ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2012b</xref>) as key steps in Wnt regulation of the destruction complex. It will be intriguing to further probe the role of phosphorylation of R2/B in the mechanism of destruction complex action.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> APC2, human APC's Arm rpts (1–1012aa), and Axin were cloned as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers felt that this manuscript provided important new information about APC protein function, and that the super-resolution and FRAP studies provided new insight into the destruction complex. The reviewers appreciated the use of both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and tissue culture models to probe the system, and felt the <italic>Drosophila</italic> rescue experiments were elegant. However, there were many places where the reviewers felt that there were additional experiments and important controls needed to support the conclusions of the manuscript. In particular, providing more information about the levels of overexpression in tissue culture cell lines would be helpful. More support is also needed for the conclusion that APC dynamics promotes beta-catenin flux through the DC (alternative approaches are suggested by the reviewers, such as the use of proteasome inhibitors). More explanation is needed for the selection of the sites focused on, and more mutational analysis should be considered in order to strengthen their conclusions. In addition, there were many places where more restricted (less-broad) conclusions were merited by the data presented in this manuscript (as detailed fully below, in the reviewers' comments). As an online journal <italic>eLife</italic> provides sufficient space to fully explain both rationales for and the important caveats of the experimental approaches used.</p><p>Detailed comments:</p><p>1) All of the cell biology analysis is done on punctae that are only observed when Axin or Axin/APC are overexpressed. There are a couple of general sentences stating that the field is comfortable with using these punctae as surrogates for the endogenous DC that are not very compelling. The super-resolution microscopy is cool and the images are gorgeous, though the fact remains they are large protein complexes caused by overexpression. They are probably are functional in regard to down-regulating beta-catenin, but are all their characteristics relevant to endogenous DC function? This is an inherent limitation of the manuscript. It would be helpful for readers to know what level of overexpression is being employed (compare to endogenous proteins) and what is variability of expression among individual cells transfected with APC or Axin constructs.</p><p>2) A key part of the authors' model is that APC dynamics promotes beta-catenin throughput through the DC. But the data supporting this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are unconvincing. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> that APC2 enhances Axin's ability to downregulate beta-catenin isn't informative: APC2 alone is as good as APC2 + Axin. This undercuts the utility of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G, I</xref> comparison, maybe there is undetectable levels of beta-catenin in Axin/APC2 punctae because there is less overall beta-catenin. The data with phospho-beta-catenin has the same fatal flaw. Perhaps using proteosome inhibitors would allow the authors to make more compelling conclusions, if conditions could be found where overexpression of APC and Axin did not affect beta-catenin levels.</p><p>3) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5 fig6 fig7">Figures 4–7</xref> lead the authors to conclude that GSK3 acts through the R2 and B motifs of APC to regulate its association with Axin and beta-catenin turnover in the DC. They then proceed to the next critical test: mutating predicted GSK3 sites in APC and testing them functionally. They mutate two serines in B, converting them to either alanines (APC2AA) or aspartic acid (APC2DD; hoping for a phosphomimic effect). Clearly the AA mutant is defective in APC function, nicely shown in the fly rescues in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. But the effects on punctae dynamics are absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>; comparing wild-type APC2 with APC2AA). The authors focus on the small difference between APC2DD and APC2AA, but this difference is also very, very subtle. The data don't fit into a coherent model, since they demonstrate that a surgical mutation that has a big effect on APC function has no detectable effect on APC/Axin dynamics. Perhaps a more comprehensive mutagenesis of the predicted phosphorylation sites would provide a clearer link between GSK3 phosphorylation of APC, APC dynamics in DC punctae and APC function. But the two mutants characterized are not sufficient.</p><p>4) The language of the Abstract and Discussion, proposing a GSK3 induced conformational change in APC is a bit overblown. It's very reasonable to invoke a phosphorylation induced conformational change: it's a common mechanism for regulating protein shape. But the manuscript doesn't provide direct evidence for a conformational change, and I don't think the data provides a paradigm for the broader field of researchers studying multiprotein complexes. Rather, I think this report does address important issues in APC function in the DC, and that is a significant goal.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> APC2 arm-repeat domain functions as a second means of interacting with Axin using co-IP and co-localization analysis. Since no direct binding interactions are shown, it is more accurate/clearer to state that “APC has two means of interacting with the Axin complex” rather than “with Axin”.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that APC2 and Axin form structured macromolecular complexes in vivo by SIM. APC2 nearly doubles the size/volume of the DC and there is a trade-off between DC punctae abundance and size. Since GSK3 inhibition leads to APC2 stabilization in the DC by virtue of activating a second Axin binding interaction (via Arm repeats)– does GSK3 inhibition reduce the abundance/increase the size of DC ‘factories’ in cells? I am trying to get a sense if/how size correlates with DC activity.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows that APC2 R2 and B domains regulate APC2 dynamics and β-cat removal from the complex. Given the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, is the data here also compatible with a model where APC and β-cat are together released for the ubiquitylation step? This seems plausible especially give the sense that there is a seemingly abundant diffuse cytosolic pool of APC and β-cat relative to Axin? Such a model might also be able to better integrate previous studies showing that APC shields the N-terminus of β-cat from dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Su et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: Is the increase in β-cat retention at punctae due to increased loading on APC or Axin? Simple co-IP analysis might allow one to infer this-so long as most of the complex is soluble in gentle detergents.</p><p>9) Evidence for differences in β-cat “flux” through the complex is largely inferred from its steady state accumulation of β-cat within punctae, rather than any direct measurement of this by FRAP or perhaps better, photoconversion at the punta. Have the authors tried this? I ask only because the β-cat accumulation at punctae is somewhat confusing-one can only see this structure if the diffuse pool was effectively degraded, and all of the mutants basically need to do this in order for the authors to capture differences in β-cat accumulation within punctae. I think it would be helpful to clarify that all of the mutants can degrade β-catenin (as evidenced by depletion of the diffuse cytosolic pool of β-cat), but that there must be rate differences due to accumulation differences in the punctae.</p><p>10) It would be helpful if <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> showed that domain B is also called the Catenin Interaction Domain (CID, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2013</xref>), and clearly define this since CID was not adequately described in the Introduction. Also, since all reviews cite that Axin binds CK1 in addition to GSK3, it would be helpful to have this interaction mapped for completeness (if precisely known)?</p><p>11) In the fourth paragraph of the Introduction it sounds like the Arm domain of APC behaves as an intrinsically disordered domain, but it seems more appropriate to use this description for the 15 and 20R downstream (especially since many β-cat binding ligands are ID in the region of binding. Please clarify or specify the regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> as “intrinsically disordered region, or IRD.”</p><p>12) To study the dynamics of APC-Axin interactions, the authors transfect various fly and human constructs into the well-known SW480 colon cancer cell line, which expresses a wild type copy of APC and a truncation of APC containing the first 1338 AA. In their analyses of Axin-APC interactions, they do not take into consideration the effect of endogenous proteins in mediating the interaction. The role of endogenous proteins is only briefly mentioned in the subsection “APC2 stabilizes the Axin complex and promotes DC throughput of βcat”.</p><p>13) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> the authors identified putative GSK3 phosphorylation sites. It is unclear how these meet the consensus for GSK3 other than being Ser/Thr residues. Usually there is a priming site 4-5 amino acids C terminal to the putative target site. The authors need to define what criteria they used to identify putative sites. I have a number of concerns about this experiment: The kinase assay is lacking positive controls. What is the band in the GST/GSK3 lane? Why are there multiple bands in the R2/B/GSK3 lane? What do the asterisks mean in the figure? Why are there GST-only bands in the coomassie lanes 3-6? What was the rationale for mutating the two selected Ser residues? They don't seem to match the consensus any better than the others. The logic given states that they are the most N terminal, when in fact two other Ser residues are more N terminal, and there are no potential CK1 priming sites. As the authors wisely state in subsection “Mutating putative phosphorylation sites in B disrupts APC2's function in regulating βcat destruction in SW480 cells”, it is very likely that GSK3 inhibition affects many aspects of DC dynamics, so all findings should be interpreted cautiously. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> work with the phospho-resistant and phospho-mimetic transgenes is very elegant.</p><p>14) In their model, as described in the Discussion, the authors suggest that GSK3 and CK1 phosphorylate R2 and B motifs. They cannot make this conclusion, since B has no CK1 motifs and no kinase assays with CK1 were performed. They also state that Axin assembles in a head to tail fashion via its DIX domain. I would argue this is a tail to tail interaction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08022.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers felt that this manuscript provided important new information about APC protein function, and that the super-resolution and FRAP studies provided new insight into the destruction complex.

More support is also needed for the conclusion that APC dynamics promotes beta-catenin flux through the DC (alternative approaches are suggested by the reviewers, such as the use of proteasome inhibitors).

There are a couple of general sentences stating that the field is comfortable with using these punctae as surrogates for the endogenous DC that are not very compelling. The super-resolution microscopy is cool and the images are gorgeous, though the fact remains they are large protein complexes caused by overexpression. They are probably are functional in regard to down-regulating beta-catenin, but are all their characteristics relevant to endogenous DC function? This is an inherent limitation of the manuscript. It would be helpful for readers to know what level of overexpression is being employed (compare to endogenous proteins) and what is variability of expression among individual cells transfected with APC or Axin constructs.</italic></p><p>The reviewers and editors were correct that this is in important point that needed to be further clarified, and which needed to be pointed out as an existing caveat to these (and many previous) studies. We have examined both issues. As people working with cell culture transfection can appreciate (and as the Reviewer pointed out), there are a number of variables in addressing this issue, which together mean we can only give a range, not a hard and fast number – these include variability in transfection efficiency between different constructs, between different experiments, and variations in DNA uptake and thus protein expression between different cells in a single experiment. We thus took two different approaches to assess this.</p><p>To explore the effect of variability of expression among individual cells transfected with GFP or RFP-tagged APC or Axin constructs in a given experiment, individual cells were quantitated for the levels of GFP-APC2, Axin RFP or both (for Axin plus APC transfected cells), using fluorescence quantitation, and simultaneously were assessed for total ßcat levels, normalized to untransfected cells on the same slide (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1B</xref>). This allowed us to determine if relative level of over-expression was important for the effect on ßcat levels. Strikingly, Axin was less efficient at modulating ßcat levels than both “APC alone” and than APC+Axin at all levels of expression – thus differences between the function of Axin versus APC2+Axin are not seen only at the highest levels of expression. Second, at the higher levels of expression, the constructs actually became less effective at mediating ßcat destruction. This may be consistent with the idea suggested previously by the Kirschner lab that at very high levels of expression, over-expressed proteins might form partial, non-functional complexes. It also may reflect the cytoplasmic retention of ßcat we previously observed by APC2 constructs that retain ßcat binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Second, we measured rough absolute levels of over-expression. Since we were transfecting fly proteins into human cells, we could not simply use human antibodies to answer this question. We thus used transfected human APC1 (truncated to be of the size of the endogenous truncated APC1 found in SW480 cells) and transfected human Axin1 as intermediates. Transfected Flag-tagged fly APC2 and Flag-tagged human APC1 or transfected GFP-tagged fly Axin or human Axin1 could thus be detected with the same anti-Flag or GFP antibodies and their levels compared by immunoblotting.</p><p>Transfected human APC1 could then be compared to endogenous truncated human APC1, or transfected human Axin1 compared to endogenous human Axin 1 using antibodies to the endogenous proteins. In each case, these numbers were then adjusted for transfection efficiency. Three independent experiments were assessed for each – representative Western blots are now presented in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C and D</xref>, and the full set of quantitations is in new <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. The results are reported in the first section of the Results, and the procedure used is described in detail in the Figure legend and the Methods.</p><p>For Axin, we could compare transfected <italic>Drosophila</italic> Axin to endogenous wild-type human Axin1 found in SW480 cells. Here the level of overexpression was 80-120 fold. This issue was more complex in the case of APC, as SW480 cells do not accumulate wild-type APC1 – instead they accumulate a truncated APC1 ending at amino acid 1338. We thus compared transfected fly APC2 to this truncated human APC1 protein, seeing ratios of roughly 1400-2400 fold. However, we think this is likely to significantly overestimate over-expression relative to what would be the normal level of accumulation of wild-type human APC1 in a normal colon cell for two reasons. First, the truncated APC1 protein present in SW480 cells is reasonably likely to accumulate at lower levels than wild-type APC1, as it is likely to be subjected to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay like many other proteins with early stop codons. In fact, a recent paper noted that 12/14 APC- mutation–positive families in whom the mutation was located before the last exon of the gene had allele specific imbalance at the mRNA level, which is consistent with a mechanism of nonsense-mediated decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castellsagué et al., 2010</xref>). Second, we also may need to reduce the difference by a factor of two as it is probable SW480 cells carry only one copy of the truncated APC allele, as most colorectal tumors either have the second allele mutated early enough to not produce a truncated protein or have lost the second allele by deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christie et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We now include these new data at the beginning of the Results section, outlining things as described above, and ending by noting this is an important caveat of the study as follows: “Regardless, it is important to remember that while the puncta provide a useful and visualizable model of the destruction complex, we are examining over-expressed proteins.” We added a similar caveat in the relevant section of the Discussion, as follows: “It is important to note that our data in SW480 cells involve significant over-expression – it will be useful in the future to examine destruction complex structure and function at endogenous levels, perhaps by tagging endogenous loci using CRISPR.”</p><p>In considering these issues, it is useful to remember that in our previous work (and that of many other labs) there are many constructs that we and others have tested that cannot downregulate ßcat, even when similarly over-expressed, including the constructs tested here with single or double point mutants in serine residues. It is also useful to note that with one exception (APC2∆SAMPS), in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>) and extensions of this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yamulla et al., 2014</xref>) there has been a perfect correspondence between function of constructs in restoring targeting ßcat for destruction when overexpressed in SW480 cells and when expressed at endogenous levels in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Finally, after submitting the manuscript we became aware of a relatively recent paper from the Bienz lab that further supports the idea that puncta formation is a normal feature of Axin, and that one need not substantially over-express it to be able to easily visualize puncta. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Roche et al., 2014</xref> explored the effects of tankyrase inhibitors on SW480 cells. They found that tankyrase inhibitors increased levels of AXIN13-5x and AXIN2 5-20x and this was sufficient to trigger formation of Axin-puncta (interestingly, ßcat also accumulated in these puncta to detectable levels). We now note this at the beginning of the Results section that describes the puncta.</p><p><italic>2) A key part of the authors' model is that APC dynamics promotes beta-catenin throughput through the DC. But the data supporting this in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>are unconvincing. The results in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3F</italic></xref> <italic>that APC2 enhances Axin's ability to downregulate beta-catenin isn't informative: APC2 alone is as good as APC2 + Axin. This undercuts the utility of the</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3G,I</italic></xref> <italic>comparison, maybe there is undetectable levels of beta-catenin in Axin/APC2 punctae because there is less overall beta-catenin. The data with phospho-beta-catenin has the same fatal flaw. Perhaps using proteosome inhibitors would allow the authors to make more compelling conclusions, if conditions could be found where overexpression of APC and Axin did not affect beta-catenin levels.</italic></p><p>We have addressed this in two ways. First, as the reviewer notes, our data showed that expression of either “APC2 alone” or APC2 plus Axin similarly stimulated ßcat exit out of the puncta to destruction. In our initial manuscript, we had suggested this was “presumably due to the presence of endogenous human Axin”. We now have tested whether fly APC2 can and does interact with human Axin. We found that Fly GFP-APC2 colocalizes in puncta with exogenous hAxin1-RFP (present in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>), and more importantly, endogenous hAxin1 coIPs with Flag-APC2 expressed in Sw480 cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Thus this is at least a reasonable possibility.</p><p>Second, we followed the reviewers’ suggestion and used proteasome inhibitors to slow ßcat destruction in cells expressing APC2 plus Axin. As we show in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>, proteasome inhibition allows ßcat to detectably accumulate in the puncta of cells expressing APC2 + Axin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A vs B</xref>). However, while proteasome inhibition elevates ßcat levels both in cells expressing Axin alone and in those expressing APC2 + Axin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1C</xref>), cells expressing Axin still accumulate significantly higher levels of ßcat than those expressing Axin + APC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1C</xref>). This suggests the difference in puncta accumulation is not solely due to the elevated ßcat levels. We also have softened the conclusion from this experiment, suggesting it is “consistent with our model”. The new text now reads: “One potential caveat to the increased accumulation of βcat in puncta of cells expressing Axin alone vs those expressing APC2 plus Axin is that the former cells may simply have higher overall levels of βcat, thus resulting in higher accumulation in puncta. To address this, we inhibited βcat destruction using the proteasome inhibitor MG132. As others have previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sadot et al., 2002</xref>), proteasome inhibition elevates ßcat levels. Proteasome inhibition elevates ßcat levels both in cells expressing Axin alone and in those expressing APC2 plus Axin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, this allows it to accumulate in puncta even in cells expressing Axin + APC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A vs B</xref>). However, cells expressing Axin still accumulate significantly higher levels of ßcat than those expressing Axin plus APC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1C</xref>). Together, these data are consistent with a model in which APC increases βcat throughput of the destruction complex by stabilizing Axin assembly.”</p><p><italic>3) The data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5 fig6 fig7"><italic>Figures 4-7</italic></xref> <italic>lead the authors to conclude that GSK3 acts through the R2 and B motifs of APC to regulate its association with Axin and beta-catenin turnover in the DC. They then proceed to the next critical test: mutating predicted GSK3 sites in APC and testing them functionally. They mutate two serines in B, converting them to either alanines (APC2AA) or aspartic acid (APC2DD; hoping for a phosphomimic effect). Clearly the AA mutant is defective in APC function, nicely shown in the fly rescues in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9</italic></xref><italic>. But the effects on punctae dynamics are absent (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8F</italic></xref><italic>; comparing wild-type APC2 with APC2AA). The authors focus on the small difference between APC2DD and APC2AA, but this difference is also very, very subtle. The data don't fit into a coherent model, since they demonstrate that a surgical mutation that has a big effect on APC function has no detectable effect on APC/Axin dynamics. Perhaps a more comprehensive mutagenesis of the predicted phosphorylation sites would provide a clearer link between GSK3 phosphorylation of APC, APC dynamics in DC punctae and APC function. But the two mutants characterized are not sufficient.</italic></p><p>These are important points and we have done a number of different things to address them. Before we describe them in detail, we would like to address the larger issue of what we have and have not learned from the work presented here and how we have clarified these issues in our revised manuscript.</p><p>New insights that precede this section of the manuscript: It is clear from earlier work from our and other labs that R2 and B are essential for APC function in ßcat destruction in both cultured cells and in vivo in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2 and 3</xref> we show that APC alters the structure of macromolecular complexes formed by Axin (as assessed by SIM) and alters Axin mobility in Axin puncta. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> we show that these effects require both the Arm rpts and the SAMPs. These data provide novel insights into roles of APC in the destruction complex. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6</xref> we address how R2/B fits into this picture, showing its normal role is to destabilize APC:Axin association, and that it does so by antagonizing association mediated by APC's Arm rpts. This provides novel insights into the role of R2/B in APC function. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> we show that GSK3 inhibition stabilizes APC:Axin association; our data suggest GSK3 activity antagonizes association mediated by APC's Arm rpts, and thus GSK3 activity and R2/B appear to act either together or in parallel to regulate APC function. This provides a novel role for GSK3 in destruction complex function, adding to its earlier described roles.</p><p>Making the connection between the role of GSK3 and particular phosphorylation sites: In our initial manuscript, we then went on to explore the role of particular phosphorylation sites in this region. We chose a pair of serine residues in region B, and made either phosphomimetic or non-phosphorylatable variants. We then went on to test these functionally in both SW480 cells and in flies, showing, as the reviewer(s) points out, that the APC2AA is significantly reduced in function in both contexts.</p><p>As the reviewers correctly point out, the double point mutant does not fully mimic the effects on APC dynamics of either R2 or B deletion or of GSK3 inhibition. They point out that this suggests our model is over simplified. We agree that in our initial manuscript we over-emphasized the match between function and dynamics, and thus under-stated the complexities. We have addressed this issue in several ways:</p><p>First, we have matched the number of samples analyzed for dynamics of wildtype, phosphomimetic and nonphosphorylatable. This revealed that the recovery fraction of the non-phosphorylatable is significantly different from that of wild-type APC and also significantly different from that of the phosphomimetic mutant. The differences in dynamics between wild-type and the phosphomimetic mutant are not statistically significant. We also have toned down the text to be very careful we do not overstate the case here, making it clear both that there are likely other phosphorylation sites and that GSK3 likely has effects not mediated solely by phosphorylating R2/B (see below).</p><p>A) As suggested by the reviewers, we analyzed the effect on APC2 function in SW480 cells of a single point mutant in a putative phosphorylation site in R2. Strikingly, this point mutant also largely abolishes function in ßcat destruction. We also note in the Discussion that the Polakis lab had already analyzed a different double point mutant in R2 serine residues, and similarly saw diminished function in ability to downregulate ßcat levels. We agree that it would be good to analyze additional point mutants in <italic>Drosophila</italic> in the future, but this will be a time-consuming process that we feel extends beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p>B) We significantly revised this section of the Results to more clearly state the caveats. Putting these changes together, this section of the Results now reads:</p><p>“R2 and B are essential for APC2's function in βcat degradation. Our hypothesis suggests phosphorylation of R2/B promotes release of APC2's Arm rpts from the Axin complex, and that this would be essential for the catalytic cycle of the destruction complex – thus mutating these putative GSK3 phosphorylation sites in motif B would reduce APC2 function in helping mediate ßcat destruction. To begin to test this, we replaced 2 (APC2AA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, red arrows), 4 or 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, magenta arrowheads) conserved serines in B that match the GSK3 consensus with alanine, to prevent phosphorylation. All reduced function in downregulating ßcat levels (see below and data not shown). We thus focused on the least altered of these, the mutant that replaced the more N-terminal two serine residues with alanine (APC2AA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, red arrows), thus preventing phosphorylation. We also created a mutant that replaced these same two residues with aspartic acid, creating a phosphomimetic APC2 (APC2DD). Strikingly, while APC2DD effectively reduced βcat levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,F</xref>), APC2AA was unable to do so.</p><p>APC2AA cells accumulated βcat at levels as high or higher than adjacent untransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D,F</xref>), suggesting these two amino acid missense mutations substantially reduced APC2 function. APC2DD substantially reduced βcat levels (to ∼30%), but was not quite as effective as wildtype APC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). This statistically significant difference may suggest dephosphorylation of these residues is also required for full APC2 function. We also found mutating a single conserved serine residue in R2 to alanine (APC2660; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) strongly diminished APC2 function in reducing ßcat levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref>). Together, these data are consistent with a model in which phosphorylation of conserved serines in APC2 motifs R2 and B are important for APC's function in the destruction complex to target βcat for degradation. Finally, we tested whether the first of these putative phosphomutants affected APC2 dynamics in the FRAP assay. Since GSK3 inhibition slowed APC's dynamics, we predicted APC2AA should have a lower turnover rate than wildtype APC or APC2DD. We saw a subtle but statistically significant reduction in APC2AA recovery fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). However this was not nearly as dramatic as that of deleting R2 or B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>); perhaps this due to the fact that we only altered two of several potential phosphorylation sites. Together these data are consistent with the idea that phosphorylation of conserved serine residues in R2/B regulates APC's function in the destruction complex, but since the effect on dynamics was substantially less dramatic than that of deleting R2 or B, it suggests other residues in R2 and B may also contribute to regulating APC2 dynamics. Further, it is clear that GSK3 has other effects on the complex, complicating interpretation of its inhibition. It will be important to examine this in the future.”</p><p>We also softened this conclusion substantially in the Discussion. For example, one of the relevant sections now reads: “Motifs R2 and B include highly conserved serine/threonines matching the GSK3 and CK1 consensuses, and this region is phosphorylated by GSK3 in vitro. GSK3 increases APC2 dynamics, destabilizing the Arm rpts:Axin association via a mechanism that requires R2 and B. Strikingly, mutating two conserved serines in B to alanine blocked APC2's ability to reduce βcat levels, while a parallel phosphomimetic mutant did not disrupt APC2 function. We saw a similar reduction in APC2 function after mutating a conserved serine residue in R2. Consistent with our data, CK1epsilon phosphorylation of hAPC1 R2 occurs in an Axin-dependent fashion, and site directed mutagenesis blocking phosphorylation of two conserved serines in R2 (hAPC1 S1389 and S1392; distinct from and just C-terminal to the residue we mutated in APC2 R2) reduced the ability of a human APC1 fragment to down regulate Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubinfeld et al., 2001</xref>), further suggesting R2 phosphorylation also is important for APC function. Our data are consistent with a model in which GSK3 phosphorylation of R2 and B could be one major regulatory step in APC2's dynamic cycle in the destruction complex, triggering release of the Arm rpts from the Axin complex, and thus allowing APC2 to promote βcat release for destruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). However, our data also show that mutating two residues in motif B to prevent their phosphorylation had only a subtle effect on APC2 dynamics. This may suggest additive roles for multiple phosphorylated residues, or may suggest the connection between phosphorylation, dynamics and function is more complex. Further, GSK3 can phosphorylate most of the other proteins in the destruction complex, and thus it clearly plays multiple roles in its function.”</p><p>We also note: “The multiple potential phosphorylation sites in R2/B, the hypomorphic nature of our double point mutant in <italic>Drosophila</italic> vs the complete loss of function after deleting either R2 or B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>), and the residual function of our two residue phosphomimetic mutant may suggest different combinations of phosphorylated residues in R2 and B help tune and regulate APC function in the destruction complex.</p><p>Our results also suggest GSK3 is likely to affect destruction complex structure and dynamics via several mechanisms, consistent with its known role in phosphorylating Axin and other sites in APC.”</p><p><italic>4) The language of the Abstract and Discussion, proposing a GSK3 induced conformational change in APC is a bit overblown. It's very reasonable to invoke a phosphorylation induced conformational change: it's a common mechanism for regulating protein shape. But the manuscript doesn't provide direct evidence for a conformational change, and I don't think the data provides a paradigm for the broader field of researchers studying multiprotein complexes. Rather, I think this report does address important issues in APC function in the DC, and that is a significant goal.</italic></p><p>We clearly became over-excited about this speculative possibility and thus carried away in our language. We removed the description of “conformational change” from the Abstract, revising it as follows:</p><p>“Our data suggest APC plays two roles: (1) APC promotes efficient Axin multimerization through one known and one novel APC:Axin interaction site, and (2) GSK3 acts through APC motifs R2 and B to regulate APC:Axin interactions, promoting high-throughput of βcatenin to destruction.”</p><p>We also have taken a look at the rest of the text and tried to restrict our use of the term conformation change to our description of the speculative model in the Discussion.</p><p>We also removed the overly broad claim about a paradigm from the Abstract – it now reads: “We propose a new dynamic model of how the destruction complex regulates Wnt signaling and how this goes wrong in cancer, providing insights into how this multiprotein signaling complex is assembled and functions via multivalent interactions.”</p><p><italic>5)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>shows that the Drosophila APC2 arm-repeat domain functions as a second means of interacting with Axin using co-IP and co-localization analysis. Since no direct binding interactions are shown, it is more accurate/clearer to state that “APC has two means of interacting with the Axin complex” rather than “with Axin”.</italic></p><p>This was a good point. We changed the title of this Figure to: “APC2's Arm rpts provide a second means of interacting with the Axin complex.” and also have gone through the rest of the text to make it clear we do not know if this is a direct or indirect interaction, using the terms “association” or “interaction with the Axin complex”.</p><p><italic>6)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>shows that APC2 and Axin form structured macromolecular complexes in vivo by SIM. APC2 nearly doubles the size/volume of the DC and there is a trade-off between DC punctae abundance and size. Since GSK3 inhibition leads to APC2 stabilization in the DC by virtue of activating a second Axin binding interaction (via Arm repeats)– does GSK3 inhibition reduce the abundance/increase the size of DC 'factories' in cells? I am trying to get a sense if/how size correlates with DC activity.</italic></p><p>This was an interesting issue, and we explored it as suggested. We inhibited GSK3 and measured both the size and number of APC2+Axin puncta. GSK3 inhibition did not further increase size or decrease number over the increase in size we saw by adding APC alone. This fits with our earlier analysis of deleting R2 or B – while each alteration stabilizes the APC-Axin interaction, it does not further increase puncta size or decrease puncta number. We also explored whether proteasome inhibition further increased the size or reduced the number of puncta. All of this new data in included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref> and in the Results as follows: “If GSK3 inhibition stabilizes the interaction of APC2 and Axin, and as noted above, APC2 also can stabilize Axin in puncta, increasing their size (and thus decreasing their number), then GSK3 inhibition might synergize with APC, further increasing the size of Axin puncta. We thus inhibited GSK3 with either BIO or LiCl in cells co-expressing Axin and APC2 and examined both puncta size and number. GSK3 inhibition did not further increase puncta size or further decrease puncta number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>). These data are consistent with our analysis above of APC2∆R2 and APC∆B – these mutations also stabilize APC2 in the destruction complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) but do not further increase puncta size or decrease puncta number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1F-J</xref>). We also tested whether proteasome inhibition might trigger enlargement of the APC+Axin complexes – this also did not further increase puncta size or further decrease puncta number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>). Thus, while APC2 can stabilize Axin complexes, inhibition of GSK3 or the proteasome does not synergize with this.”</p><p><italic>7)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>shows that APC2 R2 and B domains regulate APC2 dynamics and β-cat removal from the complex.

In step 1, APC2 stabilizes destruction complex assembly via its Arm rpts and SAMPs motifs. […] We propose this conformational change allows transfer of phospho-βcat to the E3-ligase (step 5). Alternately, GSK3 may regulate the release of a complex of APC and phospho-βcat, allowing APC to shield phospho-βcat from dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Su et al., 2008</xref>) and guide it to the E3-ligase. The catalytic cycle of APC would then be reset by dephosphorylation (step 6). This provides a testable model for the mechanisms regulating a key signaling pathway.”</p><p>We made similar alterations later in the Discussion and in the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>.</p><p><italic>8)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>: Is the increase in β-cat retention at punctae due to increased loading on APC or Axin?

Have the authors tried this? I ask only because the β-cat accumulation at punctae is somewhat confusing-one</italic> can <italic>only see this structure if the diffuse pool was effectively degraded, and all of the mutants basically need to do this in order for the authors to capture differences in β-cat accumulation within punctae. I think it would be helpful to clarify that all of the mutants</italic> can <italic>degrade β-catenin (as evidenced by depletion of the diffuse cytosolic pool of β-cat), but that there must be rate differences due to accumulation differences in the punctae.</italic></p><p>This is a good point. The photoconversion experiment would ultimately help to clarify this, and we now mention this in the Discussion as a useful future direction. We also clarify in the Discussion that, as noted, many of the mutants can stimulate ßcat degradation (at least when expressed together with Axin), and thus we must be looking at a rate difference. The relevant text in the Discussion now reads: “Thus while Axin can template βcat phosphorylation and can, at least in the presence of the truncated APC1 present in tumor cells, send it on to destruction, our data suggest APC promotes the rate at which ßcat is transferred out of the destruction complex and sent to the proteasome. Future use of photoactivatible ßcat constructs will further clarify this.” And “Based on our model APC mediated βcat transfer is only possible when R2 and B are maintained in the truncated APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). R2 and B are essential for function in the absence of endogenous APC function in vivo in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>). In SW480 cells our data suggest they are essential for APC2 to further simulate the rate of ßcat destruction mediated by Axin transfection.”</p><p><italic>10) It would be helpful if</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic>A</xref> <italic>showed that domain B is also called the Catenin Interaction Domain (CID,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6"><italic>Choi et al., 2013</italic></xref><italic>), and clearly define this since CID was not adequately described in the Introduction. Also, since all reviews cite that Axin binds CK1 in addition to GSK3, it would be helpful to have this interaction mapped for completeness (if precisely known)?</italic></p><p>Thanks for these suggestions. We had included the CID designation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> but somehow left it out of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, and we had not done full justice to the CID in the Introduction. We have fixed the Figure as suggested and added the following to the Introduction:</p><p>“In exploring APC's mechanism of action when Wnt signaling is inactive, we recently focused on two conserved binding sites in APC, 20R2 (R2) and motif B (B; this is also known as the catenin interaction domain = CID; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kohler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schneikert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). R2 is related to the 20R βcat binding sites, but lacks a key interacting residue and cannot bind βcat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). B is immediately adjacent to R2 – its function was initially unknown, though it was recently shown to bind α-catenin, and thus play a role in Wnt regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, although other 20 Rs are individually dispensable, both R2 and B are essential for the destruction complex to target βcat for destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kohler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schneikert et al., 2014</xref>). Our data further suggested that R2/B negatively regulates APC/Axin interaction, a somewhat surprising role for an essential part of the destruction complex.”</p><p>We also have added to the diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> the region defined by Reinhardt et al. (2007) as sufficient to bind CK1 (it overlaps with the PP2A binding region).</p><p><italic>11) In the fourth paragraph of the Introduction it sounds like the Arm domain of APC behaves as an intrinsically disordered domain, but it seems more appropriate to use this description for the 15 and 20R downstream (especially since many β-cat binding ligands are ID in the region of binding. Please clarify or specify the regions in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic>A</xref> <italic>as “intrinsically disordered region, or IRD.”</italic></p><p>Thanks for this suggestion. We now have labeled <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> to make it clear that the intrinsically disordered region is that downstream of the Arm repeats, containing the 15 and 20 AA repeats, the SAMPS, R2 and B. We also have made this clearer in the text as follows: “APC combines an N-terminal Armadillo repeat domain (Arm rpts) with a more C-terminal intrinsically disordered region; each contains binding sites for multiple partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).”</p><p><italic>12) To study the dynamics of APC-Axin interactions, the authors transfect various fly and human constructs into the well-known SW480 colon cancer cell line, which expresses a wild type copy of APC and a truncation of APC containing the first 1338 AA. In their analyses of Axin-APC interactions, they do not take into consideration the effect of endogenous proteins in mediating the interaction. The role of endogenous proteins is only briefly mentioned in the subsection “APC2 stabilizes the Axin complex and promotes DC throughput of βcat”.</italic></p><p>This is an important issue, and, as the reviewers points out, it needs to be made clear as these endogenous proteins may well be playing important roles (we assume there was a typo in the Review comments and that the Reviewer was referring to either the wildtype copy of APC2 or the wild-type copy of Axin expressed in these cells – they only express a truncated APC1).</p><p>We have addressed this in two ways. First, our data showed that expression of either “APC2 alone” or APC2 plus Axin similarly stimulated ßcat exit out of the puncta to destruction. In our initial manuscript, we had suggested this was “presumably due to the presence of endogenous human Axin”. We now have tested whether fly APC2 can and does interact with human Axin. We found that Fly GFP-APC2 colocalizes in puncta with exogenous hAxin1-RFP (present in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>), and more importantly, that endogenous hAxin1 coIPs with Flag-APC2 expressed in Sw480 cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Thus this is at least a reasonable possibility.</p><p>Second, we significantly expanded our description of the status and potential roles of endogenous proteins in SW480 cells. We now begin the Results section with a more complete description of this, as follows: “Here we sought to define the mechanism by which these motifs and APC itself act, using as a model SW480 colon cancer cells. These cells have high βcat levels, as they lack wildtype human APC1 (hAPC1) and instead express a truncated APC1 protein ending before the mutation cluster region (MCR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). SW480 cells also express human APC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maher et al., 2009</xref>), but this is not sufficient to help mediate βcat destruction.” We note the potential importance of truncated APC1 and APC2 in the residual function of Axin over-expression in these cells when we initiate examination of Axin vs Axin + APC2 function, as follows: “Axin cannot target βcat for destruction in APC's complete absence, even when Axin is overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mendoza-Topaz et al., 2011</xref>). However, in SW480 cells, which express both truncated hAPC1 and endogenous hAPC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maher et al., 2009</xref>), Axin overexpression can increase βcat destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakamura et al., 1998</xref>).” Finally, we now end the relevant section of the Discussion by pointing toward the importance of further resolving these issues in the future, as follows: “The development of CRISPR knockout technology will allow future examination of the importance of truncated APC1, as well as the endogenous APC2 and Axin expressed in colon cancer cells in destruction complex assembly and function.”</p><p><italic>13) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref> <italic>the authors identified putative GSK3 phosphorylation sites. It is unclear how these meet the consensus for GSK3 other than being Ser/Thr residues. Usually there is a priming site 4-5 amino acids C terminal to the putative target site. The authors need to define what criteria they used to identify putative sites. I have a number of concerns about this experiment:</italic></p><p>The reviewers made a number of good points, each of which we have addressed.</p><p><italic>The kinase assay is lacking positive controls.</italic></p><p>This was a good point – we had done a positive control with the GSK3 substrate peptide provided by the manufacturer and this is now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>.</p><p><italic>What is the band in the GST/GSK3 lane?</italic></p><p>When we incubated GSK3 with GST (not an expected substrate) we saw a labeled band consistent with autophosphorylation. We now note this in the Figure legend. This was not seen when GSK3 was incubated with a good substrate (e.g., hAPC1R2/B or even fly APC2R2/B). We observed this in both of our experiments (we now show a different experiment than that previously used to deal with the issue pointed out below).</p><p><italic>Why are there multiple bands in the R2/B/GSK3 lane?</italic></p><p>In both independent experiments there was a smaller Coomassie-stained band in the hAPC1R2/B purification that we presume is a breakdown product – this protein is also phosphorylated.</p><p><italic>What do the asterisks mean in the figure?</italic></p><p>These are the Coomassie bands that align with phosphorylated proteins – we now explain this in the Figure Legend.</p><p><italic>Why are there GST-only bands in the coomassie lanes 3-6?</italic></p><p>These were apparently background bands from the purification. We have now replaced the previous blots with our second experiment in which these bands are no longer present.</p><p><italic>What was the rationale for mutating the two selected Ser residues? They don't seem to match the consensus any better than the others. The logic given states that they are the most N terminal, when in fact two other Ser residues are more N terminal, and there are no potential CK1 priming sites.</italic></p><p>The reviewers correctly point out that this logic is faulty, though it does reflect the spirit of the thought process we went through. The choice of these residues has historical roots that are somewhat complex. We initially aligned APC sequences from a number of different species, including several different vertebrates and arthropods. The reviewer correctly points out that there are two more serines in “motif B” N-terminal to those we mutated. However, in fly APC1, fly APC2, and the single APC family member in the brine shrimp <italic>Daphnia</italic>, there is a cysteine residue deleted relative to the vertebrate APC1 or APC2 sequences, and thus the spacing of these more N-terminal serines was not exactly the same. As a result, one of these N-terminal serines doesn't share the correct spacing in the arthropod family members to be a match to the usual GSK3 consensus (S-X-X-X-S) (we now make this clear in the Figure). We thus initially confined our analysis to the region of motif B C-terminal to this deleted residue. We began with this more confined definition of motif B, and mutated two, four or six of the conserved serine residues to alanine. Each of these essentially eliminated function of APC2 in downregulating ßcat levels. We thus continued our analysis with the least altered of these, which altered the two residues on which we focused in our work. We now explain this more clearly in the text and remove the previous “faulty logic”, as follows:</p><p>“R2 and B are essential for APC2's function in βcat degradation. Our hypothesis suggests phosphorylation of R2/B promotes release of APC2's Arm rpts from the Axin complex, and that this would be essential for the catalytic cycle of the destruction complex – thus mutating these putative GSK3 phosphorylation sites in motif B would reduce APC2 function in helping mediate ßcat destruction. To begin to test this, we replaced 2 (APC2AA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, red arrows), 4 or 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, magenta arrowheads) conserved serines in B that match the GSK3 consensus with alanine, to prevent phosphorylation.</p><p>All reduced function in downregulating ßcat levels (see below and data not shown). We thus focused on the least altered of these, the mutant that replaced the more N-terminal two serine residues with alanine (APC2AA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, red arrows), thus preventing phosphorylation. We also created a mutant that replaced these same two residues with aspartic acid, creating a phosphomimetic APC2 (APC2DD).”</p><p>We also added additional annotations to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, making all of this clearer. We'd also note that we actually missed a match to the CK1 consensus near the C-terminus of motif B – we now have added this to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8">Figures 7A and 8B</xref>.</p><p><italic>As the authors wisely state in subsection “Mutating putative phosphorylation sites in B disrupts APC2's function in regulating βcat destruction in SW480 cells”, it is very likely that GSK3 inhibition affects many aspects of DC dynamics, so all findings should be interpreted cautiously. The Drosophila work with the phospho-resistant and phospho-mimetic transgenes is very elegant.</italic></p><p>This is also an important point. As we describe in detail above in response to reviewer point 3 above about the link between phosphorylation and dynamics, in the initial version of the manuscript we went too far in trying to firm up what was an admittedly speculative link. We have tried to tone this down as recommended here. We now emphasize that two different mutations of conserved serines (the previously described mutations in motif B and the new mutation we describe here in R2) all strongly reduce APC2 activity in SW480 cells, and in the case of the double point mutant in motif B, also do so in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. However, as the Reviewer correctly points out, none of our point mutants match in severity the effect on dynamics or function of either GSK3 inhibition or deletion of either R2 or B. We thus have tried to make this clearer in both the Results and Discussion.</p><p>For example, we now conclude this section of the Results as follows: “Together these data are consistent with the idea that phosphorylation of conserved serine residues in R2/B regulates APC's function in the destruction complex, but since the effect on dynamics was substantially less dramatic than that of deleting R2 or B, it suggests other residues in R2 and B may also contribute to regulating APC2 dynamics. Further, it is clear that GSK3 has other effects on the complex, complicating interpretation of its inhibition. It will be important to examine this in the future.”</p><p>And in the Discussion, state: “Our data are consistent with a model in which GSK3 phosphorylation of R2 and B could be one major regulatory step in APC2's dynamic cycle in the destruction complex, triggering release of the Arm rpts from the Axin complex, and thus allowing APC2 to promote βcat release for destruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). However, our data also show that mutating two residues in motif B to prevent their phosphorylation had only a subtle effect on APC2 dynamics. This may suggest additive roles for multiple phosphorylated residues, or may suggest the connection between phosphorylation, dynamics and function is more complex. Further, GSK3 can phosphorylate most of the other proteins in the destruction complex, and thus it clearly plays multiple roles in its function.”</p><p><italic>14) In their model, as described in the Discussion, the authors suggest that GSK3 and CK1 phosphorylate R2 and B motifs. They cannot make this conclusion, since B has no CK1 motifs and no kinase assays with CK1 were performed.</italic></p><p>The point is a good one. We did try in vitro phosphorylation with purified CK1 and there was phosphorylation of human APC1 R2/B, but the phosphorylation of fly APC2 R2/B was very weak at best. We thus do not have any evidence CK1 is involved in R2/B regulation. We thus have altered the text as follows (and made parallel changes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>):</p><p>“GSK3, which phosphorylates βcat, Axin and other sites on APC, also phosphorylates APC2's R2 and B (step 3; CK1 may also be involved, as it is in the other phosphorylation events in the complex).”</p><p>As noted above, we missed a match to the CK1 consensus near the C-terminus of motif B – we now have added this to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8">Figures 7A and 8B</xref>.</p><p><italic>They also state that Axin assembles in a head to tail fashion</italic> via <italic>its DIX domain. I would argue this is a tail to tail interaction.</italic></p><p>We apologize for our confusing description. The head-to-tail description of Axin polymerization comes from the original publication – in this case the authors refer to the isolated DIX domain, in which beta-sheet 2 of one DIX domain interacts with beta-sheet 4 of the next monomer, thus making it “head-to-tail” with respect to the two ends of the monomer. However, as the DIX domain is at the Cterminus (the tail) of the whole protein, we see how this caused confusion. We now have clarified this as follows (this also now makes the diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> clearer):</p><p>“One mechanism involved was already known: the DIX domain of Axin polymerizes in a head-to-tail fashion, in which beta-sheet 2 of one DIX domain interacts with beta-sheet 4 of the next monomer, thus forming filaments, and this polymerization is essential for destruction complex function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fiedler et al., 2011</xref>).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
