regionally and functionally specialized. Unipolar brush cells (UBCs), and Purkinje cell (PC) synapses made by axon collaterals in the granular layer, are both enriched in areas that control balance and eye movement. Here, we find a link between these specializations in mice: PCs preferentially inhibit metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1 (mGluR1)-expressing UBCs that respond to mossy fiber (MF) inputs with long lasting increases in firing, but PCs do not inhibit mGluR1-lacking UBCs. PCs inhibit about 29% of mGluR1-expressing UBCs by activating GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) and inhibit almost all mGluR1-expressing UBCs by activating GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs). PC to UBC synapses allow PC output to regulate the input layer of the cerebellar cortex in diverse ways. Based on optogenetic studies and a small number of paired recordings, GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated feedback is fast and unreliable. GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated inhibition is slower and is sufficiently large to strongly influence the input-output transformations of mGluR1-expressing UBCs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>unipolar brush cell</kwd><kwd>purkinje cell</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd><kwd>GABAB</kwd><kwd>target dependent</kwd><kwd>vestibular cerebellum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35NS097284</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Regehr</surname><given-names>Wade G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stuart H.Q. &amp; Victoria Quan Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Chong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Purkinje cell collaterals regulate processing in the input layer of the cerebellum by providing fast stochastic GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated and slow GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated inhibition to a specialized subset of unipolar brush cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although different lobules of the cerebellar cortex are engaged in diverse motor and non-motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim and Thompson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Massion, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murdoch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmahmann and Sherman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siuda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Van Overwalle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Villanueva, 2012</xref>), a basic circuit motif is repeated within each functional compartment. Mossy fibers provide excitatory inputs to granule cells (GrCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delvendahl and Hallermann, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DiGregorio et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sotelo, 2008</xref>), which in turn excite Purkinje cells (PCs) that provide the output of the cerebellar cortex. In addition, Golgi cells (GoCs) inhibit GrCs, and molecular layer interneurons inhibit PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eccles, 2013</xref>). Regional synaptic and cellular specializations exist beyond this basic circuit motif, presumably to meet the computational demands associated with specific behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cerminara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diño et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kozareva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sekerková et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suvrathan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>One of the most obvious specializations is that the density of unipolar brush cells (UBCs) exhibits large regional variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diño et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sekerková et al., 2014</xref>). UBCs are excitatory interneurons located in the granular layer that are usually innervated by a single MF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mugnaini and Floris, 1994</xref>). UBCs contribute to temporal processing by converting short-lived MF signals into long-lasting changes in UBC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kinney et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kreko-Pierce et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Locatelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mugnaini and Floris, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mugnaini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rossi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Dorp and De Zeeuw, 2014</xref>). MFs excite UBCs that express metabotropic glutamate receptor type I (mGluR1), suppress firing in UBCs where mGluR2 is prominent, and evoke more complex responses in other UBCs that express both mGluR1 and mGluR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borges-Merjane and Trussell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kinney et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knoflach and Kemp, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rossi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Russo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Dorp and De Zeeuw, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zampini et al., 2016</xref>). UBCs are often disregarded in descriptions of the circuitry of the cerebellar cortex. However, UBCs are present in all areas and are exceptionally dense in some regions, notably those involved in vestibular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diño et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takács et al., 1999</xref>). UBCs are more prevalent and widely distributed in larger mammals including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diño et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Munoz, 1990</xref>), suggesting a special role in the complex cerebellar computations relating to higher cognition.</p><p>PC feedback via collaterals that are restricted to parasagittal planes is another noteworthy regional specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Witter et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to sending an axon to the deep cerebellar nuclei, each PC axon has a collateral that inhibits PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernard and Axelrad, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernard et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bornschein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Solages et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Orduz and Llano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Witter et al., 2016</xref>) and several types of inhibitory interneurons in the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crook et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirono et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Witter et al., 2016</xref>). In some regions, PCs make extensive contacts within the granular layer and inhibit GrCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2016</xref>). This feedback is mediated primarily by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) and has a prominent slow component that suggests the involvement of the extrasynaptic high-affinity GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. These PC to GrC synapses allow the output of the cerebellar cortex to provide slow negative feedback to inhibit the input layer. Like UBCs, these synapses are also most prominent in regions involved in vestibular function.</p><p>The regional overlap of high densities of UBCs and granular layer PC synapses raises the possibility that PCs might inhibit UBCs and thereby allow PC feedback to refine temporal processing. Here, we examine whether PCs inhibit UBCs. We find that PCs phasically inhibit a subset of UBCs by activating GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, and that UBCs with prominent mGluR1 signaling are preferentially targeted. PCs also provide long-lasting inhibition to most mGluR1-expressing UBCs by activating GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs). In these ways, PC inhibition of mGluR1-expressing UBCs provides direct feedback from the output layer to input layer to influence the first stage of cerebellar processing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Regional distribution of PC collaterals and mGluR1<sup>+</sup> UBCs</title><p>High-power confocal imaging of vermal and floccular slices was used to assess the regional density of PC collateral synapses and UBCs, and to detect putative synaptic connections between PCs and UBCs.

Much lower densities were observed in the anterior cerebellar cortex (lobules I–V and VIa; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>) and lobule VIII. In lobule X, there was a particularly high density of PC collateral synapses and UBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). High-power images of lobule X suggest that PC synapses directly terminate on the brushes and the cell bodies of many UBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PC collaterals provide GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated inhibition to mGluR1<sup>+</sup> UBCs</title><p>To determine whether PCs directly inhibit UBCs, we optically stimulated PC axons in Pcp2-Cre×ChR2 mice while recording from UBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We performed these experiments in lobule X of acute slices in the presence of AMPA, NMDA, glycine, and GABA<sub>B</sub>R blockers and a high chloride internal solution. UBCs exhibit diverse responses to MF activation, ranging from excitation mediated by AMPARs and mGluR1, to inhibition mediated by mGluR2, with intermediate cells having more diverse responses mediated by a combination of mGluR1 and mGluR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2021</xref>). Electrophysiological studies have shown that fast inhibition in UBCs is mediated by a combination of glycine and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dugué et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rousseau et al., 2012</xref>), but that mGluR1-lacking UBCs lack GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rousseau et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with these observations, molecular profiling of UBCs using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kozareva et al., 2021</xref>) indicate that α1, β2, β3, and γ2 subunits of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs have a gradient of expression levels and are selectively enriched in mGluR1-positive UBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), but that glycine receptors are broadly expressed by UBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This opens the possibility that the molecular identity of UBCs could determine whether they receive PC feedback. We therefore characterized UBC responses to brief puffs of glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref> left) prior to measuring optically evoked synaptic responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref> right). Glutamate (1mM, 50ms) evoked a continuous range of metabotropic responses across UBCs with variable degrees of excitation versus inhibition, as is apparent in the sorted heatmap of glutamate-evoked response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Optical stimulation evoked currents in a subpopulation of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> asterisk marks, 17/41 cells) but not in others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right, 24/41 cells). GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist gabazine eliminated these light-evoked synaptic currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We compared the average responses to a glutamate puff for UBCs that had light-evoked GABA<sub>A</sub> currents with those that did not. Cumulative histograms for glutamate-evoked charge transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), and the average glutamate-evoked current for UBCs with or without PC feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), show that PC GABA<sub>A</sub> feedback preferentially targets UBCs that are excited by glutamatergic inputs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>PC collaterals preferentially inhibit mGluR1<sup>+</sup> UBCs via fast GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated feedback.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing a mossy fiber (MF) and a PC collateral innervating a UBC.

Nonetheless, these findings are consistent with mGluR1<sup>+</sup> UBCs preferentially expressing GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs, and we therefore restricted our recordings to cells that responded to DHPG. We found that in whole-cell recordings the currents evoked by GABA<sub>B</sub>R agonists washed out within minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, gray). This washout was accompanied by an increase in the leak current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

The GABA<sub>B</sub>R antagonist CGP eliminated these light-evoked responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>).

In spontaneously firing UBCs, small depolarizing current steps evoked firing that declined to a somewhat reduced steady-state response that was proportional to the current injected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B and C</xref>, gray left). A 5-pA tonic hyperpolarizing current, drastically altered these responses, with current steps evoking a much larger transient response and reduced steady-state firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B and C</xref>, black right).

Optical stimulation of PC terminals evoked GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated responses in 29% (30/101) of UBCs. Light-evoked PC GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated inhibition was much more common in cells in which glutamate evoked a large excitatory current but was also observed in three cases where glutamate evoked inhibitory currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This may reflect the graded nature of metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling in UBCs in which outward mGluR1-mediated currents and inward mGluR2-mediated currents can be present in the same cell, and a large mGluR2 component could obscure a small mGluR1 component in some cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kozareva et al., 2021</xref>). When we used DHPG to identify mGluR1<sup>+</sup> cells, we found that PCs did not inhibit any mGluR1<sup>−</sup> UBCs (0/15), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). This is in keeping with the observations that mGluR1<sup>−</sup> UBCs do not respond to either GABA<sub>A</sub>R or GABA<sub>B</sub>R agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rousseau et al., 2012</xref>), that they do not express GABA<sub>A</sub>R or GABA<sub>B</sub>R subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rousseau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and that PCs do not release glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tanaka and Ezure, 2004</xref>). In contrast to PCs that only inhibit a subset of UBCs, glycinergic GoCs can inhibit all UBCs, because ionotropic glycine receptors and glycinergic IPSCs are present in all UBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dugué et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rousseau et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our findings provide new insights into the previous immunohistochemical characterization of the inhibitory synapses onto UBCs that suggested approximately 50% co-release GABA and glycine and the rest only release GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dugué et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rousseau et al., 2012</xref>). Previously it was thought that these exclusively GABAergic synapses were made by non-glycinergic GoCs.

This difference in prevalence likely reflects differential sensitivities of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs and GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs. Activation of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs on UBCs requires high GABA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Möhler, 2006</xref>), and thus requires a direct PC synapse for effective activation. GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs are activated by much lower levels of GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Galvez et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaupmann et al., 1998</xref>). Consequently, a direct PC input is not required and GABA released from PC synapses onto neighboring cells can pool and spillover to activate GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs. This also suggests that the combined activity of many PCs could efficiently activate GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs on UBCs and control spontaneous activity.</p><p>It is important to note that we have focused on PC feedback to UBCs in lobule X. Both UBCs and PC collaterals are also present throughout the cerebellar cortex, albeit at a lower density.

The failure rate and potency of the fast component of inhibition are similar for PC synapses onto UBCs and GrCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that the overall effect of fast and stochastic GABA<sub>A</sub>R PC inhibition of UBCs and GrCs is to lower the gain of the input layer. The slow GABA<sub>B</sub> feedback to UBCs occurs in concert with a slow inhibition of GrCs that is mediated by a very different mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2016</xref>). PCs slowly inhibit GrCs primarily by activating special high-affinity α6 and δ subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs that are specialized to respond to low levels of extracellular GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brickley et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaneda et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wall and Usowicz, 1997</xref>). It appears that α6/δ containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in GrCs and GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs in UBCs can both respond to the low GABA levels that reflect the population-averaged PC firing rates, and in both cases, the kinetics of the responses are slow (312 ms in GrCs vs. 580 ms in UBCs). The major differences between slow PC inhibition of UBCs and GrCs are the state change that can occur in UBCs, and the target dependence of the UBC inhibition, neither of which have been described for PC inhibition of GrCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Potential functional consequences of slow PC to UBC inhibition</title><p>Slow PC-UBC inhibition represents the average synaptic contribution from multiple PCs, and when the firing rates of these PCs are elevated UBCs are hyperpolarized. Increases in PC firing lead to slow increases in inhibition, and following decreases in PC firing rate this inhibition gradually decreases. Importantly, this can alter the state of the UBC. As has been shown previously, hyperpolarization can relieve the inactivation of T-type calcium channels and make neurons burst upon depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perez-Reyes, 2003</xref>). Concordantly, we observed rebound effects in some UBCs when PC firing returned to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, last row and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>) as well as steeper initial input/output relationship for depolarizing current steps with PC inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). It is likely that this component also allows PCs to constitutively regulate the properties of UBCs (although we have not addressed this possibility in our brain slice experiments where many PC axons and connections to UBCs are not intact). We conclude that PC firing may be able to alter UBC-mediated transformations in the input layer of the cerebellum. Slow inhibition could also allow PCs to dynamically regulate the excitability of mGluR1<sup>+</sup> UBCs. MF inputs to the cerebellum can modulate the firing of PCs, and these firing rate changes will feedback to mGluR1<sup>+</sup> UBCs to alter their firing. This could be particularly important for UBCs that fire for more than 10 s in response to a brief MF activation in the absence of inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al.,

Laboratory, 012570) P40 mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine mixture at 100, 10, and 3 mg/kg, and transcardially perfused with 4% PFA in phosphate-buffered saline solution. The brain was removed from the skull and post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA. The cerebellar vermis and flocculus were dissected out and embedded in 6% low melting agarose before slicing. Sagittal vermal slices and coronal floccular slices at 50 μm were obtained from two animals using Leica VT1000S vibratome (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Groves, IL). For immunolabeling of inhibitory synapses and the UBCs, slices were permeabilized (0.4% Triton X-100 and phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) for 30 min and blocked for 1 hr at room temperature (0.4% Triton X-100, 4% normal goat serum) and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies (Guinea pig anti-VGAT, Synaptic Systems 131004, 1 μg/mL, 1:200 and mouse anti-mGluR1, BD Pharmingen, 0.5 mg/mL, 1:800 in 0.2% Triton X-100%, and 2% normal goat serum). The following day, the slices were washed three times for 10 min in PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies overnight at 4°C (Goat anti-Guinea pig-Alexa Fluor 488, Abcam ab150185, 1:500 and Goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647, Invitrogen A32728, 1:500). Slices were mounted with a #1.5 coverslip using ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant without DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).</p><p>Z-stack images of entire vermal and floccular slices were obtained on the Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope using the Multi-Area Time-Lapse Software module. A 60× oil immersion objective with 1.42 NA was used and the x, y, z resolutions were 0.212, 0.212, and 0.906 μm, respectively. Each z-step was 1 μm and the entire stack was 20 μm in thickness.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Image analysis</title><p>PC synapses were detected using a modified deep neural network that is based on the U-Net (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ronneberger et al., 2015</xref>). A total of two brains were analyzed. The network was fed in all three imaging channels including the mGluR1 labeling. The rationale being that while colocalization of synaptophysin and VGAT was sufficient for synapse detection, mGluR1 provided additional contextual information for annotation in the molecular layer as it densely labeled PC dendrites. The network was trained using soft-dice loss on 100 annotated images (a single slice in z, 50×50 μm<sup>2</sup> in width and height) and validated with an 80/20 train-test-split. Our human annotator criteria were that the inhibitory PC synapses should be synaptophysin-TdTomato and VGAT positive puncta with clear morphological features that are present across at least two to three consecutive z-slices. After training the network, we verified that it works consistently across different cerebellar layers and regions using out-of-sample validation. We found that using an ensemble of 10 independently trained networks qualitatively improved the annotation by reducing the amount of variability in synapse identification. The true positive rate of synapse detection was at 95.5% and the false-positive rate was 10.1%. We note however that the false positive rate was likely inflated as the human annotator sometimes missed difficult-to-spot synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>, yellow arrows). For illustrating the UBCs, the mGluR1 signals in the molecular layer were manually cropped in the final composite image. The neural network approach was necessary to generate high-quality overviews of synaptic density maps over large regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Slice preparation for electrophysiology</title><p>Adult (P30–P40) C57BL/6 or Pcp2-Cre×ChR2-EYFP (Ai32, Jackson Laboratory, 024109) mice were first anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine mixture at 100, 10, and 3 mg/kg, and transcardially perfused with an ice-cold choline slicing solution consisting (in mM): 110 choline Cl, 7 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 11.6 Na-ascorbate, 2.4 Na-pyruvate, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 25 glucose equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The cerebellum was dissected, mounted against an agar block, and submerged in the choline solution during slicing. Sagittal slices of the vermis were obtained using a Leica VT1200S vibratome and allowed to recover for 30 min at 33°C in the artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF) consisting of (in mM): 125 NaCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 25 glucose (pH 7.4, osmolarity 315) equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The incubation chamber was then removed from the warm water bath and kept at room temperature for recording for up to 6 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Recordings were performed at 34–36°C in ASCF containing 5 μM NBQX, 2 μM R-CPP, and 1 μM strychnine set to a flow rate of 2 mL/min. Visually guided recording of UBCs was obtained under a 60× objective with differential interference contrast imaging on an Olympus BX51WI microscope. Identity of the UBCs was also verified with fluorescent dye after recording (Alexa Fluor 594, 100 μM). Borosilicate patch pipette (3–5 MΩ) containing either a KCl internal (in mM: 140 KCl, 4 NaCl, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 4 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, 5 EGTA, and 2 QX-314, pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH) or a K-methanesulfonate internal (in mM: 122 K-methanesulfonate, 9 NaCl, 9 HEPES, 0.036 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.62 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 MgATP, 0.3 Tris-GTP, 14 Tris-creatine phosphate, and 0.18 EGTA, pH7.4) was used for whole-cell recordings of GABA<sub>A</sub>R- or GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated current, respectively. A junction potential of −8 mV was corrected for the K-Methansulfonate internal during recording. For cell-attached UBC recordings, ACSF was used as the internal solution. For perforated-patch recording, an internal containing (in mM) was used: 100 K-methanesulfonate, 13 NaCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 EGTA, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 0.1 Lucifer Yellow, and 0.25 amphotericin B, pH 7.2 with KOH. A junction potential of +7 mV was corrected online. For recordings of the GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated current, 10 μM SR95531/gabazine was included in the bath to isolate the metabotropic inhibition. For paired PC-UBC recordings, a whole-cell UBC recording with KCl was obtained first. Then 10–20 PCs in lobule X were screened with cell-attached recordings using a large pipette (1–2 MΩ) containing ACSF.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Pharmacology</title><p>For identification of UBC subtypes in either whole-cell or perforated recordings, ACSF containing glutamate (1 mM, 50 ms) or DHPG (100 µM, 20 ms) was pressure-applied at 5 psi through a borosilicate pipette with a Picospritzer III (Parker Hannifin, Hollis, NH). For the sequential mGluR1 and GABA<sub>B</sub>R activation experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–J</xref>), concentrations and durations of pressure applications are 100 µM, 50 ms for DHPG, and 250 µM, 100 ms for baclofen. The same baclofen concentration and duration were used for testing the stability of GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). For wash-in experiments, solution exchange was controlled via ValveLink8.2 Controller (AutoMate Scientific, Berkeley, CA). Gabazine (SR95531, 5 μM) was used for blocking GABA<sub>A</sub>R and CGP (1 μM) was used for blocking GABA<sub>B</sub>R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Optogenetics</title><p>Slices from Pcp2-Cre×ChR2-EYFP were kept in the dark before recording. A laser source (MBL-III-473-50 mW, Optoengine) was fiber coupled to the excitation path of the microscope. For over bouton stimulation, brief (0.5 ms) high intensity (160 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) light pulses were delivered under the 60× objective and focused down to a 50-μm spot. For the optical modulation of PC spontaneous firing, much lower intensities (10 or 25 μW/mm<sup>2</sup>) of light were delivered through the 10× objective over the entire lobule X (~1 mm spot) for 2 s. To ensure the quality of the slice, we recorded many PCs before the experiment to check for spontaneous activity and to ensure that these low-intensity stimulations did not result in PCs bursting. Only healthy slices were used for subsequent UBC recordings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data acquisition and analysis</title><p>Electrophysiology experiments were performed with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Device) and controlled by mafPC (Matthew Xu-Friedman, SUNY Buffalo) in Igor Pro 7 (WaveMetrics). Data were filtered at 4 kHz in MultiClamp and digitized at 50 kHz by InstruTECH ITC-18 (Heka Instrument Inc). Analysis of DHPG evoked spiking in UBC was done via peak detection in MATLAB. sIPSC timing was determined by time of 5% to peak threshold crossing. The timing of the PC spike for determining the latency of synaptic transmission was determined by the first derivative of the action potential. The time constant for the slow GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated current was obtained using a single exponential fit. Data are reported as mean ± SEM.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Imaging was performed in the Vision Core and NINDS P30 Core Center (NS072030) to the Neurobiology Imaging Center at Harvard Medical School with the help of M El-Rifai (performed RNA scope) and M Ocana.

microarchitecture, and, in particular, the level of recurrence in this circuit. A combination of electrophysiological, pharmacological and optogenetic approaches demonstrate a new inhibitory feedback connection from Purkinje cells onto a subset of unipolar brush cells. This is an important discovery for the cerebellar field, and should also be of interest to readers studying feedback in neural circuits.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Purkinje cell outputs selectively inhibit a subset of unipolar brush cells in the input layer of the cerebellar cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jennifer L Raymond as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Philippe Isope (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The finding that PCs inhibit mGluR1 positive UBCs is important in its own right and well established by the evidence in Figure 2 and 4.</p><p>1) The finding of feedback from the PCs to the UBCs opens up exciting new research directions. The reviewers appreciated the authors' efforts to gain insight about the signal processing function of this new feedback connection, however, they agreed that the specific claims about the function of the fast and slow inhibitory feedback were not well supported by the evidence provided, and hence should be clearly identified as highly speculative and the conclusions significantly tempered. Additional evidence to support the claims about the specific signal processing functions of the fast and slow feedback would be highly desirable, but is not essential. See specific suggestions below.</p><p>2) Some clarifications are needed regarding the histology:</p><p>– What is the reader supposed to take away from the convolutional neural network analysis of Purkinje cell synapses onto UBCs? It seems that two brains were annotated by a human expert, and then the network was trained on those two brains and could reproduce similar results on held-out data, as shown in Figure 1-Supp 1. What criteria did the human annotator use in marking synapses? Was the neural network approach used for anything beyond what the human annotator did?</p><p>– Is it absolutely certain that there is no mGluR1 expression in Lugaro cells and Golgi cells? (See Knöpfel and Grandes, 2002 and Grandes et al. 1994.) The high magnification images in Figure 1K do show the characteristic morphology of UBCs, but there is a possibility that low mag. images of distribution in lobules could include these other cell types in spite of the difference in size, in case they express mGluR1. This possibility could change the interpretation of these results, so please clarify.</p><p>– There seem to be PC synapses on the cell body of UBCs as well as on the brush (Figure 1K), although the synapses on the brush are highlighted for mention. Please clarify.</p><p>Specific, non-essential suggestions for the authors to consider, should they decide to strengthen the evidence about the function of the fast and slow feedback.</p><p>– There is the implicit assumption that regular PC firing hardly affects mGluR1 positive UBC discharge, but it would be interesting to address or at least discuss constitutive PC inhibition. For example, this could be assessed in UBCs that don't express mGluR2, by applying an mGluR2 agonist to inhibit Golgi cell discharge, then GABA<sub>A</sub>+GABA<sub>B</sub> blockers in the bath.</p><p>– Tonic UBC hyperpolarization by steady PC excitation in figure 5D-F was not fully quantified. For example, is there different behaviors at different light intensities as in Figure 4? In figure 5D-F, a bigger burst at the beginning of the depolarization step was observed, but the steady state current seems unchanged. This is an important point, as rebound discharge is an important physiological feature of UBCs (Diana MA et al., J Neurosci. 2007) which may modify the current knowledge about ON and OFF UBC computation. Noticeably, there is a clear rebound discharge in Figure 4I but not quantified. The interplay between T-type channel and GABA<sub>B</sub> hyperpolarization may be addressed or discussed more.</p><p>– Is there any combined effect of GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> signaling during trains of stimulation? Probability of release at the PC-UBC connection appeared low, but we expect a buildup of GABA<sub>A</sub> mediated current during trains and a synergistic effect with GABA<sub>B</sub> signaling on UBC firing rate. However, in the current form, experiments were performed either with GABA<sub>A</sub> or GABA<sub>B</sub> antagonist in the bath. Experiments with neither GABA<sub>A</sub> nor GABA<sub>B</sub> blockers would likely be informative.</p><p>– Can you draw any conclusions on the number of PC inputs to a UBC from the paired recordings? How many PCs are required to inhibit UBCs via GABA<sub>A</sub> or GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors? This question is important as groups of PCs can be synchronized or PCs can fire in burst at high frequencies, suggesting that the low probability of release of GABA may act as a high pass filter for GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling. While paired recordings (Figure 3) are challenging, loose-cell attached recordings on PCs (Barbour and Isope, J Neurosci. Methods, 2000) or focalized light illumination in ChR2 expressing PCs maybe used instead of cell-attached.</p><p>– The study focused on mGluR1 positive cells, but showed that Gabbr1 is also expressed in other UBCs. Therefore, GABA<sub>B</sub> inhibition could be relevant for mGluR1 negative UBCs as well. If the authors have these data, it would be an interesting extension.</p><p>– A discussion on the physiological consequences of a selective inhibition of mGluR1 positive vs mGluR2 UBCs would strengthen the study. Can we extrapolate that &quot;ON&quot; UBCs are inhibited by PCs while &quot;OFF&quot; cells are not?</p><p>– Quantification of the GABA<sub>A</sub> current recorded in figure 2 would be informative as it relates to glutamate induced current or DHPG induced increase in firing rate.</p><p>– It has been thought that UBCs serve to prolong GrC firing after brief mossy fiber inputs. The negative feedback described here would serve the opposite purpose. Thus, it is important to understand the time course of the negative feedback relative to mossy fiber input.</p><p>– The major conclusions of this paper relate to feedback regulation of the input layer. But the data presented here don't directly show a feedback loop, i.e., that the GrCs that feedforward mossy fiber information to the Purkinje cells are the ones that are regulated by the UBCs that these PCs project to. Given the observation of slow GABA<sub>B</sub>-dependent feedback, the role of direct feedback vs. feedback onto UBCs without a direct connection is important.</p><p>– In relation to the previous question, it remains unclear how modulating UBC input would affect Purkinje cells.</p><p>– The authors previously showed that PC-GrC feedback is also heterogeneously distributed, and will serve to inhibit the input layer. Since PCs directly provide both fast and slow feedback to GrCs in these regions, the PC-UBC connection demonstrated here suggests additional negative feedback via UBCs to GrCs. Therefore, the effectiveness of second level of negative feedback regulation of PCs to the input layer remains unclear.</p><p>– Until the current finding of PC-UBC feedback, inhibitory inputs to UBCs were thought to be limited to those from Golgi cells. The relative time course of Golgi cell vs. PC feedback inhibition in controlling UBCs is worth consideration.</p><p>– It would be important to know whether PC feedback to UBCs is in the same parasagittal plane.</p><p>– As an additional example that relates to the same overall question about how this feedback loop will actually affect neural signals via mossy fibers, the authors also show that the faster inhibitory mGluR2/3-mediated current comes first, and the mGluR1-mediated excitation comes later (Guo et al., Biorxiv, 2020). When would PC feedback come, in relation to this sequence?</p><p>– There is known to be a heterogeneous distribution of UBCs, as shown in this study too. Is there also preferential localization of mGluR1-positive UBCs? Figure 1 shows only mGluR1-positive UBCs. Since the presence of mGluR1 and the response to glutamate are related to PC feedback, it is important to know whether the proportion of UBCs that do not get PC feedback even in these UBC-rich regions is different from elsewhere, or not. This would have important implications for circuit processing in vestibular-input-related vs. other regions</p><p>– A significant minority of DHPG-responsive cells don't have PC feedback (although the absence of an optogenetically-induced response is not definitive proof of lack of PC inputs). Notwithstanding this caveat, I think this significant minority should also be discussed.</p><p>– In the PC-UBC paired recordings, were there UBC responses that were not timed to PC spikes?</p><p>– The entire study is motivated by describing specialization of different regions of the cerebellum, but the physiology was only performed in lobule X of vermis. Although there are fewer UBCs in other parts of the cerebellum, do the same patterns of feedback from the Purkinje cells apply?</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The major strength of this study is the straightforward and convincing demonstration of a previously unknown synaptic connection from Purkinje cells (PCs) to mGluR1-positive unipolar brush cells (UBCs) in lobule X of the cerebellum. UBCs are interneurons of the cerebellar input layer, which preferentially distributed in some lobules of the cerebellum; especially those involved in vestibular function. The authors utilize a combination of electrophysiological recordings from UBCs in the acute rodent cerebellar slice, optogenetic activation of PCs, and pharmacological manipulations to establish that PCs inhibit UBCs in cerebellar lobule X through both fast synaptic transmission through GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, as well as long-lasting inhibition via GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. Since PCs constitute the output stage of the cerebellar cortex, the inhibitory signaling described in this study identifies a new feedback control pathway to the input layer, which constitutes a computational specialization of lobule X.</p><p>Another strength of this study is the determination of how molecular heterogeneity corresponds to circuit connectivity and variable responses to synaptic input. There is heterogeneity in the molecular profiles of UBCs, and expression of mGluR1 is a key marker for a sub-population of UBCs. The authors demonstrate that mGluR1-expressing UBCs are preferentially targeted by PC feedback. – It is noteworthy that GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated PC feedback affects a majority of, but not all, mGluR1-containing UBCs, but GAABB-mediated PC feedback affected all UBCs tested. This finding suggests tonic control of the UBC by PCs even without a direct PC connection.</p><p>The results raise the interesting question of the signal processing and computational function of this newly identified inhibitory feedback pathway, which should inspire future research.

The reviewers appreciated the authors' efforts to gain insight about the signal processing function of this new feedback connection, however, they agreed that the specific claims about the function of the fast and slow inhibitory feedback were not well supported by the evidence provided, and hence should be clearly identified as highly speculative and the conclusions significantly tempered. Additional evidence to support the claims about the specific signal processing functions of the fast and slow feedback would be highly desirable, but is not essential. See specific suggestions below.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the specific issues raised below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Some clarifications are needed regarding the histology:</p><p>– What is the reader supposed to take away from the convolutional neural network analysis of Purkinje cell synapses onto UBCs? It seems that two brains were annotated by a human expert, and then the network was trained on those two brains and could reproduce similar results on held-out data, as shown in Figure 1-Supp 1. What criteria did the human annotator use in marking synapses? Was the neural network approach used for anything beyond what the human annotator did?</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the explanation in both the results and methods section. We emphasize that we did not manually annotate two brains. The expert annotator only worked on 100 images, each a single 2D slice of 50x50 micron. This is less than 0.001% of the parasagittal vermis volume in Figure 1C for reference. Our human annotator criteria were that the inhibitory PC synapses should be synaptophysin-TdTomato and VGAT positive puncta with clear morphological features that are present across at least two to three consecutive z-slices. After training the network, we verified that it works consistently across different cerebellar layers and regions using out of sample validation. The neural network approach was necessary to generate high-quality overviews of synaptic density maps over large regions. (pages 12-13).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is it absolutely certain that there is no mGluR1 expression in Lugaro cells and Golgi cells? (See Knöpfel and Grandes, 2002 and Grandes et al. 1994.) The high magnification images in Figure 1K do show the characteristic morphology of UBCs, but there is a possibility that low mag. images of distribution in lobules could include these other cell types in spite of the difference in size, in case they express mGluR1. This possibility could change the interpretation of these results, so please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>The brush expresses extremely high level of mGluR1 and dominates the signals in both the high and low magnification image of UBCs. mGluR1 labeling is used in many previous papers to identify UBCs (i.e. Borges-Merjane and Trussell, 2015, Nuzi et al., 2002, McDonough et al., 2020). Please note that the entire image was obtained at high resolution, which allows us to inspect the morphology of the labelled structures. The distinctive, intense mGluR1 immunofluorescence pattern we observe is characteristic of UBC brush labelling, and is not consistent with Golgi cell or Lugaro cell labelling. (page 4)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– There seem to be PC synapses on the cell body of UBCs as well as on the brush (Figure 1K), although the synapses on the brush are highlighted for mention. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that synapses are near both the brush and the cell body in these images, and we have modified the legend and text (page 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific, non-essential suggestions for the authors to consider, should they decide to strengthen the evidence about the function of the fast and slow feedback.</p><p>– There is the implicit assumption that regular PC firing hardly affects mGluR1 positive UBC discharge, but it would be interesting to address or at least discuss constitutive PC inhibition. For example, this could be assessed in UBCs that don't express mGluR2, by applying an mGluR2 agonist to inhibit Golgi cell discharge, then GABA<sub>A</sub>+GABA<sub>B</sub> blockers in the bath.</p></disp-quote><p>Constitutive PC inhibition of UBCs is an interesting possibility, and we have added to the discussion to deal with this issue. UBCs can receive GABAR-mediated inhibition from GoCs and PCs. However, it is easy to sever the extensive PC collaterals that extend across lobule X, and GoCs often die in adult slices. In addition, a large percentage of UBCs express mGluR2/3Rs, so the application of an agonist is difficult to interpret. These technical challenges make it difficult to determine the magnitude and fractional contributions of constitutive PC and GoC inhibition onto UBCs.(page 10)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Tonic UBC hyperpolarization by steady PC excitation in figure 5D-F was not fully quantified. For example, is there different behaviors at different light intensities as in Figure 4? In figure 5D-F, a bigger burst at the beginning of the depolarization step was observed, but the steady state current seems unchanged. This is an important point, as rebound discharge is an important physiological feature of UBCs (Diana MA et al., J Neurosci. 2007) which may modify the current knowledge about ON and OFF UBC computation. Noticeably, there is a clear rebound discharge in Figure 4I but not quantified. The interplay between T-type channel and GABAB hyperpolarization may be addressed or discussed more.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes an important point. We now point out the rebound discharge in Figure 4 and discuss in the context of T-type calcium channels and the study of Diana et al. (2007). We discuss how pauses in PC firing could potentially generate rebound firing in UBCs. (page 10)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is there any combined effect of GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> signaling during trains of stimulation? Probability of release at the PC-UBC connection appeared low, but we expect a buildup of GABA<sub>A</sub> mediated current during trains and a synergistic effect with GABA<sub>B</sub> signaling on UBC firing rate. However, in the current form, experiments were performed either with GABA<sub>A</sub> or GABA<sub>B</sub> antagonist in the bath. Experiments with neither GABA<sub>A</sub> nor GABA<sub>B</sub> blockers would likely be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We had also considered the possibility of performing experiments in the absence of any GABA receptor antagonists. Ultimately, we felt that it was more informative to explore the contributions of GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in isolation, and that performing experiments in the absence of GABAR antagonists did not provide a sufficient additional advance to justify the considerable time and effort required.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Can you draw any conclusions on the number of PC inputs to a UBC from the paired recordings? How many PCs are required to inhibit UBCs via GABA<sub>A</sub> or GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors? This question is important as groups of PCs can be synchronized or PCs can fire in burst at high frequencies, suggesting that the low probability of release of GABA may act as a high pass filter for GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling. While paired recordings (Figure 3) are challenging, loose-cell attached recordings on PCs (Barbour and Isope, J Neurosci. Methods, 2000) or focalized light illumination in ChR2 expressing PCs maybe used instead of cell-attached.</p></disp-quote><p>We share the reviewer’s desire to determine the number of PCs that can influence each UBC. However, we do not think that electrophysiological studies will provide a reliable estimate of the number of PCs that inhibit a UBC. This is essentially two questions, because it is likely that direct contacts are required for GABA<sub>A</sub> responses, GABA<sub>B</sub> responses do not require direct contacts and can be activated by spillover. In order to estimate input numbers, it is necessary to determine the average size of an individual input and determine the size of the response to all inputs activated simultaneously. We used loose-cell attached recordings to record from PCs, but these experiments were very challenging and the n’s were small (Figure 3). We are less confident about our ability to reliably activate all PC inputs to a UBC. There is the challenge that over bouton stimulation and the use of ChR2 can artificially elevate the initial probability of release. We also think it likely that many PC axons and their associated synapses may be damaged, which would cause us to underestimate the number of inputs.</p><p>For these reasons, in future studies (within the next 2 or 3 years) we hope to determine the total number of PC inputs onto a single UBC using serial EM reconstruction, which we feel will provide much more reliable estimates. Estimating the number of PCs that can contribute to the GABA<sub>B</sub> response is much more challenging because in addition to the challenges outlines for direct GABA<sub>A</sub> synapses, it is extremely difficult to determine the magnitude of a single PC to UBC GABA<sub>B</sub> component. It is also highly likely that responses from different inputs will not sum linearly and that there will be a strong frequency dependence to the magnitude. For these reasons we prefer to be cautious and not draw conclusions that go beyond our data regarding the numbers of inputs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The study focused on mGluR1 positive cells, but showed that Gabbr1 is also expressed in other UBCs. Therefore, GABA<sub>B</sub> inhibition could be relevant for mGluR1 negative UBCs as well. If the authors have these data, it would be an interesting extension.</p></disp-quote><p>It is generally thought that GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are heterodimers consisting of GABA<sub>B1</sub> and GABA<sub>B2</sub> receptors (Frangaj and Fan 2018). It is therefore of considerable interest that <italic>Gabbr2</italic> shows such a pronounced gradient and such low expression levels in mGluR1- cells, but Gabbr1 expression does not exhibit such a gradient. We now comment on this in the text (page 6)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– A discussion on the physiological consequences of a selective inhibition of mGluR1 positive vs mGluR2 UBCs would strengthen the study. Can we extrapolate that &quot;ON&quot; UBCs are inhibited by PCs while &quot;OFF&quot; cells are not?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional discussion in the possible physiological consequences of PCs selectively inhibiting a subset of UBCs. In this discussion we strive to avoid the convenient “ON: and “OFF” terms that we feel are insufficiently precise. We have demonstrated in a recent manuscript (Guo et al. 2021, Nat Comm in press, and bioRxiv 2021) that the population of UBCs have graded responses, and mGluR1 excitation is prominent in some cells, mGluR2/3 inhibition is prominent in others, but for most mGluR1 and mGluR2/3 are both present. We find that PCs preferentially inhibit UBCs with high mGluR1 expression, and predominantly excitatory MF responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Quantification of the GABA<sub>A</sub> current recorded in figure 2 would be informative as it relates to glutamate induced current or DHPG induced increase in firing rate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided an additional scatter plot (Figure 2N) to address this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It has been thought that UBCs serve to prolong GrC firing after brief mossy fiber inputs. The negative feedback described here would serve the opposite purpose. Thus, it is important to understand the time course of the negative feedback relative to mossy fiber input.</p></disp-quote><p>This is not a simple issue. In general, elevated PC inhibition will rapidly suppress firing in UBCs if there is a GABA<sub>A</sub> component, and will slowly inhibit UBCs if there is a GABA<sub>B</sub> component. MFs can excite many UBCs for a few hundred milliseconds to tens of seconds, and MFs inhibit many UBCs for hundreds of milliseconds by activating mGluR2/3 receptors. However, it is not clear whether MF evoked population activity in UBCs will increase or decrease PC firing, because UBCs excite granule cells that both directly excite PCs and disynaptically inhibit PCs by activating MLIs. We therefore do not know if the UBCgRCPCUBC loop leads to positive or negative feedback. Hopefully, future in vivo studies will address this issue, but they will be challenging. We feel that it is reasonable and appropriate to restrict this study and the discussion to a basic description of the PC to UBC synapse, and that many of the interesting issues raised by the reviewer are perfect topics for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The major conclusions of this paper relate to feedback regulation of the input layer. But the data presented here don't directly show a feedback loop, i.e., that the GrCs that feedforward mossy fiber information to the Purkinje cells are the ones that are regulated by the UBCs that these PCs project to. Given the observation of slow GABAB-dependent feedback, the role of direct feedback vs. feedback onto UBCs without a direct connection is important.</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that it is appropriate to indicate that PCs are providing feedback from the output layer to UBCs in the input layer. Also note that each UBC excites many granule cells, and each granule cell excites about half of the local PCs. While it seems extremely likely that many GrCs activated by a UBC will directly excite the PCs that inhibit that UBC, we have not explicitly shown that this is the case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In relation to the previous question, it remains unclear how modulating UBC input would affect Purkinje cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We echo the sentiment of the reviewer. Indeed, in general the manner in which UBCs influence PC firing is complex and poorly understood, as is the case for extrinsic MFs. UBCs and MFs activate granule cells that in turn excite PCs directly and inhibit PCs through disynaptic inhibition, so the net effect is difficult to predict. We have therefore focused additional discussion on the fact that PC-UBC feedback allows the output of the cerebellar cortex to shape the temporal representation of the input layer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors previously showed that PC-GrC feedback is also heterogeneously distributed, and will serve to inhibit the input layer. Since PCs directly provide both fast and slow feedback to GrCs in these regions, the PC-UBC connection demonstrated here suggests additional negative feedback via UBCs to GrCs. Therefore, the effectiveness of second level of negative feedback regulation of PCs to the input layer remains unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>On page 9 we point out: The major differences in slow inhibition of UBCs and GrCs are the state change of UBCs and the target dependence of the UBC inhibition, neither of which have been described for PC inhibition of GrCs (Guo et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Until the current finding of PC-UBC feedback, inhibitory inputs to UBCs were thought to be limited to those from Golgi cells. The relative time course of Golgi cell vs. PC feedback inhibition in controlling UBCs is worth consideration.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting issue that is part of the larger question of the distinctive functional roles of PC and GC inhibition of UBCs. However, the relative times courses of GC and PC inhibition would begin with determining the activity patterns of these two cell types during behaviors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be important to know whether PC feedback to UBCs is in the same parasagittal plane.</p></disp-quote><p>We reconstructed PC collaterals in a previous paper across various cerebellar regions. The PC feedback appears to be confined in the parasagittal plane (Witter et al., 2016) as we now point out. This will potentially allow the PC-UBC feedback to operate within functional macrozones. (page 2)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– As an additional example that relates to the same overall question about how this feedback loop will actually affect neural signals via mossy fibers, the authors also show that the faster inhibitory mGluR2/3-mediated current comes first, and the mGluR1-mediated excitation comes later (Guo et al., Biorxiv, 2020). When would PC feedback come, in relation to this sequence?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting question regarding the relative timing of mGluR2 inhibition and PC inhibition. The timing of mGluR2/3 current is diverse across UBCs, ranging from about one hundred milliseconds to a few seconds. There are so many factors contributing to relative time courses of PC inhibition and mGluR2-mediated inhibition (including stimulus, MF activity pattern, continuous UBC temporal variability, the magnitudes of the GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> components, etc.) that we feel it would be premature to discuss this issue (regardless of how interesting it is).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– There is known to be a heterogeneous distribution of UBCs, as shown in this study too. Is there also preferential localization of mGluR1-positive UBCs? Figure 1 shows only mGluR1-positive UBCs. Since the presence of mGluR1 and the response to glutamate are related to PC feedback, it is important to know whether the proportion of UBCs that do not get PC feedback even in these UBC-rich regions is different from elsewhere, or not. This would have important implications for circuit processing in vestibular-input-related vs. other regions</p></disp-quote><p>We are interested in investigating the properties of PC to UBC inhibition in other regions of the cerebellar cortex. However, it would be necessary to essentially repeat our study in each region we wish to evaluate this issue functionally. We feel that this is beyond the scope of the current study. We deal with this issue on page 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– A significant minority of DHPG-responsive cells don't have PC feedback (although the absence of an optogenetically-induced response is not definitive proof of lack of PC inputs). Notwithstanding this caveat, I think this significant minority should also be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer rightly points out the very important caveat that “the absence of an optogenetically-induced response is not definitive proof of lack of PC inputs”. We have added a sentence dealing with this issue (page 6)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the PC-UBC paired recordings, were there UBC responses that were not timed to PC spikes?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, there were IPSCs not time locked to PC spikes. This could come from either other PCs or GoCs. We did not use mGluR2 agonist to suppress GoC input in these recordings because many UBCs express mGluR2 receptors (including many mGluR1+ UBCs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The entire study is motivated by describing specialization of different regions of the cerebellum, but the physiology was only performed in lobule X of vermis. Although there are fewer UBCs in other parts of the cerebellum, do the same patterns of feedback from the Purkinje cells apply?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question that we are unable to answer definitively. Images of other regions such as lobule IX, the paraflocculus and the flocculus (Figure 1) suggest that collateral synapses may target UBCs in these regions as well. We are, however, reluctant to draw conclusions based solely on these light level images. It would require a great deal of effort to address the issue of PC inhibition of UBCs in other regions. We would need to repeat our experiments of Figures 2 and 4 for each of the other regions under consideration. We now briefly discuss this issue (page 9).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The two main conclusions from the original review still apply in their entirety:</p><p>1) The finding that PCs inhibit mGluR1 positive UBCs is important in its own right and well established by the evidence provided.</p><p>2) The specific claims about the function of the fast and slow inhibitory feedback were not well supported, in particular the following two claims, which are made in the last two lines of the abstract &quot;GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated feedback is fast, unreliable, noisy, and may help linearize input-output curves and decrease gain.
