differentiate into enterocytes. Integrating enteroblasts must generate a new apical domain and break through the septate junctions between neighbouring enterocytes, while maintaining barrier function. We observe that enteroblasts form an apical membrane initiation site (AMIS) when they reach the septate junction between the enterocytes. Cadherin clears from the apical surface and an apical space appears between above the enteroblast. New septate junctions then form laterally with the enterocytes and the AMIS develops into an apical domain below the enterocyte septate junction. The enteroblast therefore forms a pre-assembled apical compartment before it has a free apical surface in contact with the gut lumen. Finally, the enterocyte septate junction disassembles and the enteroblast/pre-enterocyte reaches the gut lumen with a fully formed brush border. The process of enteroblast integration resembles lumen formation in mammalian epithelial cysts, highlighting the similarities between the fly midgut and mammalian epithelia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epithelial cells</kwd><kwd>midgut</kwd><kwd>apical-basal polarity</kwd><kwd>septate junction</kwd><kwd>brush border</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome Principal Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name><name><surname>St Johnston</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRUK Core funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name><name><surname>St Johnston</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A24843</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name><name><surname>St Johnston</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>207496</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name><name><surname>St Johnston</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome Core funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name><name><surname>St Johnston</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>203144</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name><name><surname>St Johnston</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

The adult midgut consists of a single layer of polarised epithelial cells, with their apical sides facing the gut lumen and basal sides contacting the extracellular matrix (ECM) and muscle layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shanbhag and Tripathi, 2009</xref>). The epithelium is predominantly composed of enterocytes (90%) and also contains entero-endocrine cells (ee) and their progenitors. The intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and their progeny, the enteroblasts reside on the basal side of the epithelium beneath the enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goulas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>). Quiescent enteroblasts are morphologically indistinguishable from ISCs until they are activated to differentiate in response to damage or nutrient-dependent signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nászai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O’Brien et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rojas Villa et al., 2019</xref>). Over the past 15 years, multiple signaling pathways have been found to control ISC proliferation and differentiation, but much less is known about how differentiating enteroblasts insert into the midgut epithelium and polarize to form an apical domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang and Edgar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sasaki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang and Hou, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The adult midgut epithelium differs from all other <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelia in several key respects. Firstly, it is a secondary epithelium that is derived from the endoderm, in contrast to most <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelia which are directly descend from the cellular blastoderm epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pitsidianaki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tepass and Hartenstein, 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yarnitzky and Volk, 1995</xref>). Secondly, the apical-basal polarity of the epithelium does not require the conserved epithelial polarity factors that polarize all ectodermal and mesodermal epithelia, although most of these factors are expressed in the midgut. Instead, the polarity of the midgut enterocytes depends on the interaction between the integrin adhesion complex and the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Thirdly, the midgut cells polarise in a basal to apical direction as enteroblasts differentiate into enterocytes as they integrate from the basal side. By contrast, the other well-characterised <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelia, such as the cellular blastoderm and the follicular epithelium form in an apical to basal direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franz and Riechmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Müller, 2018</xref>). Finally, the midgut epithelium has an inverted arrangement of lateral junctions to other <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelia. The occluding, smooth septate junctions, form at the top of the lateral domain above typical adherens junctions, containing E-cadherin (Ecad), α-catenin and Armadillo (β-catenin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lane and Skaer, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tepass and Hartenstein, 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tepass and Hartenstein, 1994b</xref>).</p><p>The smooth septate junctions are composed of the transmembrane proteins Mesh, Snakeskin (Ssk), Tsp2a and Hoka and the scaffolding protein, Coracle (Cora), and provide the barrier to paracellular diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Furuse and Izumi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izumi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Izumi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Izumi et al., 2012</xref>). The ISCs and early enteroblasts lie below the septate junctions between the enterocytes and only form adherens junctions with neighbouring cells, while mature enterocytes form both adherens junctions and septate junctions, as well as specialised tri-cellular junctions at the vertex between three cells. As an enteroblast differentiates, it therefore needs to develop new septate junctions with the neighbouring enterocytes as it inserts into the epithelium. This also means that the existing septate junctions between neighbouring enterocytes must be broken to allow the new cell to integrate. Furthermore, the barrier function of the epithelium must be maintained during this process to prevent the contents of the gut lumen, such as digestive enzymes and potential pathogens, from leaking into the body.</p><p>As the enteroblasts integrate into the epithelium and become enterocytes, they form a new apical domain with its characteristic brush border. The formation of an apical domain de novo has previously been studied in two other contexts. In the <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryonic epidermis and <italic>Drosophila</italic> renal tubules, progenitor cells and Stellate cells integrate into the outer layer through a process of a fast radial intercalation, in which they form the apical junction and apical domain at the same time. The apical domain is then specified after the cells have reached the lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sedzinski et al., 2016</xref>). A different process occurs during apical lumen formation in MDCK cell cysts in 3D culture. After the first division, the new membrane between the two daughter cells forms a structure called the AMIS (apical membrane initiation site), where apical proteins and fluids are secreted to create the lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryant et al., 2010</xref>). In most cells, AMIS formation depends on components of the midbody that forms during cytokinesis and on the development of tight junctions at the lateral margins of the cell contact region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blasky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mangan et al., 2016</xref>). The site of apical domain formation in inserting enteroblasts cannot be induced by the midbody, however, since the ISCs divide beneath the epithelial cell layer and the enteroblasts are post-mitotic when they integrate.</p><p>Here we characterize the process of enteroblasts integration into the midgut epithelium. Our analysis reveals that integrating enteroblasts generate an ‘apical’ domain with a brush border before they reach the gut lumen and have a free apical surface. This pre-assembled apical compartment (PAC) forms below the septate junction between the neighbouring enterocytes and contains all apical markers tested. Differentiating enteroblasts also form new septate junctions with the neighbouring enterocytes below the existing septate junction between these enterocytes. The new septate junctions then move apically as the cell breaks through the existing septate junctions to emerge on the apical surface with a fully formed apical brush border. By contrast, most enteroblasts lacking septate junction components fail to integrate and either form no apical domain or form an internal apical domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ISCs/early enteroblasts are polarised and reside under tri-cellular junctions</title><p>To analyse the steps in enteroblast integration, we first characterized the polarity and arrangement of junctions in quiescent enteroblasts and ISCs, which lie on the basal side of the epithelium. At steady state, ISCs, quiescent enteroblasts and entero-endocrine cells are diploid (2 c/4 c)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rojas Villa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xiang et al., 2017</xref>). ISCs and early enteroblasts can therefore be identified by their low nuclear volume and lack of expression of Prospero, which specifically labels entero-endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>). Both cell-types are already polarised, as they localise the apical polarity factor Par-6 in a crescent at the apex of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Par-6 is not required for enterocyte polarity, but nonetheless provides a useful marker for the early polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). The actin cytoskeleton is not polarised at this stage, however, and adherens junctions with the neighbouring enterocytes localize uniformly around the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ISCs/early enteroblasts are polarised and reside underneath tri-cellular junctions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Par-6 localises apically in ISCs and early enteroblasts.

Canoe localises to the most apical tip of the septate junctions in differentiated enterocytes, forming a thin belt separating the apical brush border (BB) from the lateral junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). This location is equivalent to the marginal zone in other fly epithelia and the vertebrate marginal zone (VMZ) in mammalian epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tepass, 2012</xref>). Like Par-6, Canoe also localises apically in ISCs and early enteroblasts, which have no septate junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). The apical localisation of Canoe and Par6 in ISC/early enteroblasts indicates that they have some apical-basal polarity.</p><p>The basal ISCs are found as single cells or as pairs of cells, which can either be two ISCs or an ISC and an enteroblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Navascués et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhai et al., 2017</xref>). Imaging ECad-GFP flies from the basal side reveals that the ISC/early enteroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) usually lie underneath the tri-cellular junctions (TCJ) between enterocytes rather than bi-cellular junctions (BCJ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In a side view of the epithelial layer, the ISCs/early enteroblasts sit immediately beneath the TCJs, marked by Anakonda-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This means that enteroblasts need to break through three mature enterocyte-enterocyte septate junctions to integrate into the epithelial layer and gain access to the gut lumen. More importantly, this integration process needs to be tightly regulated to ensure that gut barrier function is maintained.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Integrating enteroblasts generate a pre-assembled apical compartment (PAC)</title><p>Early enteroblasts express the Notch signalling reporter, Su(H)GBE-Gal4 &gt;mCD8 GFP, but this is turned off as they differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rojas Villa et al., 2019</xref>). Enteroblasts that have just started to differentiate can therefore be identified as cells with larger nuclei, in which some GFP signal still perdures. The frequency of such early differentiating enteroblasts is very low under homeostatic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reiff et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore exposed the flies to a 2 hr heat shock at 37 °C to induce minor damage and dissected them 1 day later, which increases the number of dividing ISCs and differentiating Su(H)GBE &gt;mCD8 GFP positive enteroblasts with larger nuclear volumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). This treatment causes a small increase in Tor kinase activity at the very anterior and posterior ends of the midgut as shown by phospho-4E-BP1 staining, but does not increase pERK staining, an indicator of EGFR/MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). Thus, the heat shock induces sufficient stress to trigger ISC divisions and enteroblast activation/differentiation but does not activate a regeneration process.</p><p>A proportion of the Su(H)GBE &gt;GFP positive, differentiating enteroblasts and the older GFP-negative enteroblasts form a “bubble” like structure inside the epithelial layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This structure is surrounded by membranes, as shown by the localisation of the membrane associated protein, α-Spectrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The actin marker sqh::Utrophin actin binding domain-GFP (sqh::Utr-ABD-GFP), which labels the brush border of mature enterocytes, also localises to the lower portion of the “bubble” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, the actin-rich portion of the ‘bubble’ is labeled by all other apical domain markers that we have examined, including Par-6, Myosin IA, Myosin 7a, the actin cross-linking proteins, Fimbrin and Cheerio (Lcp1/Pls3 and Filamin in mammals), Rab11, a marker for the apical recycling endosome and Picot, a transmembrane protein with homology to anion co-transporter proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and G</xref>). This strongly suggests that the lower portion of the ‘bubble’ corresponds to a nascent apical domain. In support of this view, EM images reveal that this region forms a brush border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Thus, the lower part of the ‘bubble’ structure has all the features of a pre-assembled apical domain, although it is not at the apical side of the epithelium.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Integrating enteroblasts form an apical domain before reaching the gut lumen.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A transverse section of a <italic>Su(H)GBE &gt;mCD8</italic> GFP midgut imaged 1 day after heat shock.

In most cases, the internal apical domain lay beneath the septate junction connecting the overlying enterocytes, indicating that the lumen lies within the epithelium and does not connect to the gut lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>).

Thus, the enteroblasts first form an apical domain and lumen within the epithelium. The septate junction between the neighbouring enterocytes then disappears, allowing the internal lumen to fuse with the gut lumen and the apical domain to reach the apical surface. Since these results indicate that the apical domain forms internally, we refer to this structure as a ‘pre-assembled Apical Compartment (PAC)’ and refer to the cells with a PAC as pre-enterocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). In the ‘closed’ PAC stage, when the PAC is not exposed to the gut lumen, a new set of septate junctions form beneath the septate junction between the neighbouring enterocytes. This means that the pre-enterocyte has septate junctions with its neighbours and a fully-developed apical brush border before it emerges on the apical surface, thereby maintaining the gut barrier during enteroblast integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Integrating enteroblasts initiate PAC formation by forming an apical AMIS</title><p>Imaging heat shocked flies expressing <italic>sqh::UtrABD-GFP</italic> or <italic>Fim-GFP</italic> and stained for Canoe and Cora revealed three distinct stages of PAC formation. Based on cell size and marker protein localisation, we infer the following sequence of steps. In the first stage, actin is diffusely distributed around the cell cortex, as it is in quiescent enteroblasts, but Canoe and Cora enriched apically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and C</xref>).

This co-localisation of actin and junctional proteins is reminiscent of the apical membrane initiation site (AMIS) in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryant et al., 2010</xref>). Coincident with the apical enrichment of actin, a slight separation appears between the apical membrane of the enteroblast and the overlying enterocyte membranes, suggesting that fluid is being secreted into this space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The actin staining then becomes concentrated in the centre of the apical domain, while Canoe and Cora are depleted from this region, creating a central actin-rich zone that lacks junctional proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This small actin region then expands, bends inwards and becomes the PAC, whereas Cora localises to the newly-forming septate junctions on either side, with Canoe slightly more apical in the nascent marginal zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E-F</xref>).

After an additional 24 hr, the number of cells with a PAC fell to 1%, whereas 50% were ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). Assuming that it takes 12–17 hr to induce high levels of Sox21a expression, these results suggest that most activated EBs take about 24 hr to develop into a pre-EC with a PAC and a further 24 hr to differentiate into a mature EC, although some cells differentiate faster. This time frame is in agreement with a previous study using similar approaches to accelerate differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rojas Villa et al., 2019</xref>) and a recent live imaging study tracing the enteroblast to enterocyte transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tang et al., 2021</xref>). This experiment also indicates that down-regulation of Sox21a is not essential for enteroblast to pre-enterocyte differentiation, since enteroblasts overexpressing Sox21a still from a PAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Combining all our analyses, we propose the following steps in enteroblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). When an enteroblast is activated by high Sox21a expression, it starts to grow in size but loses its apical-basal polarity, with adherens junctions all over its contacting surface and uniform cortical actin. Once the enteroblast reaches the septate junction between the neighbouring enterocytes, Canoe and Cora become localised apically. Shortly afterwards, the apical membrane initiation site forms, with the apical localisation of F-actin and the removal of DE-cadherin from this region. This coincides with the down-regulation of Sox21a and the opening of a space between the plasma membranes of the enteroblast and the overlying enterocytes, suggesting that the apical membrane is secreting fluid between the cells. As the cell differentiates into a pre-enterocyte, F-actin segregates from Canoe and Coracle into the centre of the AMIS to form the nascent PAC. The PAC then expands and new septate junctions marked by Cora, Mesh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>) and Tsp2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) form between the enteroblast and the adjacent enterocytes, sealing the fluid-filled lumen above the PAC. This coincides with the localisation of Canoe to the marginal zone above the new septate junctions and in the enterocyte membrane covering the PAC. By this stage, the pre-enterocyte no longer expresses Sox21a and has activated Pdm1. Finally, the septate junctions above the internal lumen disassemble, allowing the membranes of the overlying enterocytes to separate, so that the lumen becomes continuous with the gut lumen. At this point the PAC becomes the apical domain of the newly-integrated enterocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). The mechanisms that drive the disassembly of the overlying septate junctions are not known, but it is worth bearing in mind that most EBs integrate beneath a tricellular junction. This tricellular junction must therefore also be disassembled to allow the new enterocyte to emerge on the apical surface, and three new tricellular junctions must eventually form where the new enterocyte meets two of the adjacent enterocytes. Indeed, the disassembly of the overlying tricellular junction may be the first event that triggers the emergence of the new enterocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Diagram of the steps in enteroblast integration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram shows the side view of the steps in enteroblast integration. ‘Unpolarised’ in the second panel of this figure indicates that the enteroblast has not formed a distinct apical domain.

During AMIS and PAC formation, we noticed that Canoe also localises to the enterocyte membranes that separate from the apical membrane of the enteroblast and cover the internal lumen (orange arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, yellow arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Since Canoe normally localises to the marginal zone above the septate junctions in enterocytes, this suggests that enterocytes respond to the presence of an invaginating enteroblast/pre-enterocyte by re-localising Canoe. To confirm that this is the case and to test whether Canoe plays a functional role in enteroblast integration, we generated positively marked clones homozygous for the null allele <italic>canoe</italic><sup>R10</sup> using the MARCM system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee and Luo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sawyer et al., 2009</xref>).

By contrast, more than 80% of the cells in control <italic>FRT82B</italic> MARCM clones develop a mature apical domain, while the remaining ~10% lack apical actin and are presumably ISCs or early enteroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>). Mutants in each septate junction protein disrupt the localisation of the other septate junction components, as previously reported for the embryonic and larval gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izumi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Izumi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Izumi et al., 2012</xref>). The differences between the spectrums of phenotypes observed in <italic>mesh</italic>, <italic>Tsp2a</italic> and <italic>ssk</italic> mutants therefore cannot be explained by their distinct effects on septate junction formation and may reflect differences in perdurance or other functions of these proteins, such as the regulation of the Yki pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Izumi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The majority of cells mutant for septate junction components fail to polarise or form an AMIS, although they form normal lateral and basal domains, as shown by the normal localisation of the basal integrin signalling component, Talin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1N</xref>).

The mutant clones also have similar sizes to the control empty FRT82B clones, indicating that they have no effect on stem cell behaviour or division rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1O</xref>). Thus, the septate junction proteins are not involved in the initial polarisation of ISCs and quiescent enteroblasts, but they are required for the apical-basal polarisation that gives rise to the AMIS in most cells. This is distinct from the role of integrin adhesion complex, which is required for apical-basal polarity in ISCs, quiescent enteroblasts and activated enteroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2F-H</xref>).</p><p>Some mutant enteroblasts still polarise to form an AMIS-like structure in the absence of septate junction proteins, since 5–20% of mutant cells still localise actin, Par-6 and Rab11 apically (Arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–H</xref>), lose their apical Adherens junctions from this region and detach their apical membrane from the overlying wild-type enterocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and F</xref>). In the case of <italic>mesh</italic> and <italic>Tsp2A,</italic> this AMIS-like structure never gives rise to a PAC. The low frequency of AMIS formation in these mutants may be due to partial rescue of the phenotype by the perdurance of the wild-type proteins after clone induction. Alternatively, the formation of the AMIS may not absolutely require the septate junction proteins, but only occur very inefficiently in their absence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Enteroblasts perform an essential role in gut homeostasis by providing a pool of quiescent precursor cells that can rapidly integrate into the epithelium in response to damage or growth signals to replace or increase the number of enterocytes. In order to do this, the enteroblasts need to insert themselves between existing enterocytes, while maintaining the barrier function provided by the smooth septate junctions. Our results reveal that they do this by an unexpected mechanism, in which they form an apical domain inside the epithelial layer, immediately beneath the septate junction between the overlying enterocytes. At the same time, the enteroblast/pre-enterocytes form new septate junctions with their neighbours. This therefore provides an elegant solution to the problem of integrating into the epithelium without disrupting the barrier, by forming junctions between the enteroblast/pre-enterocyte and its neighbours before the septate junctions above the integrating cell are removed. This also means that the pre-enterocyte already has a fully differentiated apical domain with a brush border when it reaches the gut lumen, so that it can immediately assume its function in nutrient absorption. This sequence of events has been inferred from ordering images of many fixed samples based on cell size and the localisation of various proteins, but it will be important to corroborate this sequence by imaging enteroblast integration in living midguts. Nevertheless, our results are entirely consistent with another recent study of enteroblast integration in the adult midgut, which reached very similar conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moreno-Roman et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Quiescent enteroblasts are induced to differentiate in response to damage or growth signals from the visceral muscle, trachea, enterocytes and ISCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang and Edgar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miguel-Aliaga et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nászai et al., 2015</xref>). This leads to the down-regulation of <italic>esg</italic> and the Dronc caspase, which maintain enteroblasts in the undifferentiated state, and the up-regulation of factors that drive differentiation, such as Zfh2, Sox100b, Sox21a and Pdm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amcheslavsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jasper, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meng and Biteau, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rojas Villa et al., 2019</xref>). These changes induce the enteroblasts to increase in size under the control of the Insulin, TOR and EGFR signalling pathways and to endo-replicate and become polyploid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xiang et al., 2017</xref>). Activated enteroblasts have also been found to develop basal, actin-rich protrusions and to migrate occasionally to other regions of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rojas Villa et al., 2019</xref>). Unlike these earlier studies, which imaged the midgut from the basal side, we have analysed the apical-basal axis of the enteroblasts as they are activated. This reveals that growing enteroblasts go through a phase where they lack a distinct apical domain, in contrast to ISCs and quiescent enteroblasts, which are polarised and localise Canoe and Par-6 apically. These unpolarised enteroblasts are likely to correspond to the protrusive, migratory state of activated enteroblasts reported by Antonella et al., indicating that growing enteroblasts go through a mesenchymal stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonello et al., 2015</xref>). Enteroblasts then re-polarise once they reach the septate junctions between the overlying enterocytes. Thus, the adult enteroblasts transiently lose polarity and become migratory before developing epithelial polarity, much like the embryonic midgut precursors, which undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition when they delaminate from the primary epithelium and become migratory, before re-polarising in contact with the visceral mesoderm to form the embryonic midgut epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pitsidianaki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tepass and Hartenstein, 1994a</xref>).</p><p>The re-polarisation of growing enteroblasts upon reaching the enterocyte-enterocyte septate junction occurs in two steps, with Canoe and septate junction proteins appearing at the apical membrane first, followed by F-actin. The apical localisation of actin coincides with the clearance of adherens junctions from the apical membrane and is followed by the appearance of a space between the apical membrane of the enteroblast and the overlying enterocytes. This suggests that the enteroblast is secreting fluid into the extracellular space between it and the enterocytes to separate the cell membranes, which are no longer held together via the E-cadherin adhesion. This may be driven by apical exocytosis of vesicles or the activity of water and ion channels. Actin and apical membrane markers such as Par-6, Picot, and Rab11 then start to concentrate in the centre of the AMIS, while septate junction proteins are excluded from this region and start to form new junctions with the neighbouring enterocytes laterally, thereby creating a seal on either side of the forming lumen. The central actin-rich region then expands to form the pre-apical compartment and often invaginates inwards, perhaps due to the fluid pressure of the lumen above.</p><p>The steps in the formation of the pre-assembled apical compartment bear several similarities with cyst formation in mammalian epithelial cultures in 3D, which also involves the development of an internal lumen at sites of cell-cell contact. In MDCK cysts, for example, the first sign of lumen development is the formation of an apical membrane initiation site, which is marked by the co-localisation of tight junction proteins, such as Cingulin and Occludin with the apical marker, Podocalyxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryant et al., 2010</xref>). The AMIS then develops into a pre-apical patch as Cingulin and Occludin segregate away from the apical factors to form lateral tight junctions that seal the lumen, mirroring the behaviour of septate junction proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> enteroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blasky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mangan et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, the formation of an internal lumen in MDCK cysts is preceded by the loss of Cadherin from the contacting cell-cell surfaces, as it is in <italic>Drosophila</italic> enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferrari et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, junctional proteins are required to define the site of apical secretion in both systems, as knockdown of Cingulin blocks the formation of a single lumen in MDCK cysts and loss of Mesh or Tsp2a prevents the development of an external lumen in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mangan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Despite these similarities, the spatial cues that determine where the AMIS forms appear to be different. In most mammalian epithelial cysts, the site of the AMIS is defined by the position of the midbody formed during the last cell division, whereas enteroblasts are postmitotic and are derived from intestinal stem cell divisions that may have occurred several days earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mangan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rojas Villa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tang et al., 2021</xref>). The most likely cue for the repolarisation that creates the AMIS in <italic>Drosophila</italic> enteroblasts is the septate junction between the overlying enterocytes, as enteroblasts do not polarise until they reach this junction. 80–90% of enteroblasts mutant for septate junction components fail to polarise at this stage, suggesting that septate junction proteins play a role in sensing when the integrating enteroblast contacts the enterocyte-enterocyte septate junction. However, this cannot be by forming three-way septate junctions with the existing septate junctions, because the enteroblast only forms septate junctions later and in a more lateral position.</p><p>Another important difference between the two systems is that mammalian epithelial cysts are symmetric, with the cells on both sides of the lumen forming apical domains, whereas only the integrating enteroblast/pre-enterocyte forms an apical domain in the fly midgut. The overlying enterocytes do not form a normal lateral domain over the lumen, however, as β<sub>H</sub>-Spectrin and Canoe localise to the enterocyte cortex in this region, which is quite different to their localisations in mature enterocytes to the apical domain and the marginal zone above the septate junctions, respectively. This highlights the fact that the enterocytes above an integrating enteroblast are not passive bystanders but respond to the presence of the enteroblast and perhaps even also facilitate its integration. For example, the enterocytes must disassemble the septate junction above a pre-enterocyte for the latter to reach the gut lumen. This suggests that the enterocytes receive cues from the invaginating enteroblast that produce specific responses at each stage of the process, although the nature of these signals is not known.</p><p>The development of an enterocyte from an ISC involves first the loss of the apical-basal polarity shown by ISCs and quiescent enteroblasts and then the re-establishment of polarity as the AMIS forms. Mutants in components of the integrin adhesion complex, such as Talin and Kindlin, disrupt both the initial polarity seen in ISCs and quiescent enteroblasts and the repolarisation during AMIS formation. However, the formation of the AMIS and PAC also requires septate junction proteins. Thus, differentiating enteroblasts only require a basal cue to establish their initial apical-basal polarity, whereas the formation of the pre-assembled apical compartment also requires a junctional cue. The septate junctions are not necessary for apical domain formation per se, however, as some <italic>mesh</italic> mutant enteroblasts form a full-developed apical domain with a brush border inside the cell. This suggests that septate junctions define the site of apical domain formation by delimiting the region where apical membrane proteins are secreted to assemble the brush border, but do not control the process of apical domain formation directly. The internal apical domains in <italic>mesh</italic> mutant cells resemble the apicosomes observed in single human pluripotent stem cells in culture, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to form an extracellular lumen after cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taniguchi et al., 2017</xref>). The apicosome is thought to form by the intracellular fusion of exocytic vesicles, and a similar mechanism may give rise to the internal apical domains in <italic>mesh</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taniguchi et al., 2017</xref>). If this is the case, it suggests that the apical domain can self-assemble and the polarity system merely functions to position where this domain forms. We cannot rule out the alternative possibility, however, that the internal apical domains in <italic>mesh</italic> mutants form by endocytosis of the AMIS region, as has been proposed for the intracellular vesicles with brush borders observed in multi-villus inclusion disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engevik et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engevik et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The polarisation of the midgut epithelium does not require any of the canonical epithelial polarity factors that polarise all <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelia derived from the ectoderm and mesoderm, and instead depends on basal cues from adhesion to the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Our observations suggest that a possible reason for this difference is that integrating enteroblasts polarise in a basal to apical direction and form an apical membrane without having a free apical surface. This means that they cannot use the apical polarity cues that trigger the polarisation of all other <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelia. Thus, the unusual polarity system in the midgut may be a consequence of the way the tissue is built and maintained by basal stem cells, and it will be interesting to determine if this is also the case for other epithelia with similar cellular arrangements.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> stocks</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Fluorescently tagged protein lines</title><p>sqh::UtrABD-GFP (gift from Thomas Lecuit, The Developmental Biology Institute of Marseille (IBDM), France), Par-6-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wirtz-Peitz et al., 2008</xref>), MyoIA-YFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lowe et al., 2014</xref>) (Kyoto DGRC #115611), Canoe-YFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lowe et al., 2014</xref>) (Kyoto DGRC#115111), Fimbrin-GFP (Bloomington #51562), Cheerio-YFP (Kyoto DGRC#115514), Picot-GFP (Bloomington #50822), DECad-GFP (gift from Yang Hong, University of Pittsburgh, USA), Anakonda-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byri et al., 2015</xref>) (gift from Stefan Luschnig, University of Münster, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Mutant stocks</title><p>FRT19A <italic>Tsp2A</italic><sup>1-2</sup>, <italic>Tsp2A</italic><sup>3-3</sup>, <italic>Tsp2A</italic><sup>2-9</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Izumi et al., 2016</xref>) (gifts from Mikio Furuse, National Institute for Physiological Sciences, Okazaki, Japan), FRT82B <italic>mesh</italic><sup>R2</sup> (this paper), FRT82B <italic>mesh</italic><sup>f04955</sup> (Kyoto DGRC #114660), FRT80B <italic>ssk</italic><sup>1</sup> and <italic>ssk</italic><sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2020</xref>) (gifts from Tony Ip, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worchester, MA, USA), FRT82B <italic>canoe</italic><sup>R10</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sawyer et al., 2009</xref>) (gift from Mark Peifer, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA), FRT82B <italic>canoe</italic><sup>JC1</sup> (this study), FRT2A <italic>Sox21a</italic><sup>6</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhai et al., 2015</xref>) (Bloomington #68389), FRT2A <italic>Fit1</italic><sup>18</sup><italic>Fit2</italic><sup>83</sup>, <italic>rhea</italic><sup>79a</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klapholz et al., 2015</xref>) (gifts from B Klapholz and N Brown, Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, UK),</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>UAS responder lines: UAS-Sox21a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhai et al., 2015</xref>) (Bloomington #35748),</p></list-item><list-item><p>Su(H)GBE &gt;GFP: Su(H)GBE-Gal4, UAS-mCD8GFP</p></list-item><list-item><p>esg<sup>ts</sup>: esg-Gal4, UAS-mCD8GFP, tub &gt;Gal80<sup>ts</sup></p></list-item><list-item><p>Delta<sup>ts</sup>: Delta-Gal4, UAS-mCD8GFP, tub &gt;Gal80<sup>ts</sup></p></list-item></list><p>The following stocks were used to generate (positively labelled) MARCM clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee and Luo, 2001</xref>):</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>MARCM FRT82B: y w, UAS-mCD8::GFP, Act5C-GAL4, hsFLP[1];; FRT82B tubP-GAL80.</p></list-item><list-item><p>MARCM FRT19A: w, hsFLP, tubP-GAL80, FRT19A;; tubP-GAL4, UAS-mCD8::GFP/TM3, Sb.</p></list-item><list-item><p>MARCM FRT2A: hsFLP[1]; tubP-GAL4, UAS-mCD8::GFP/CyO, GFP; FRT2A tubP-GAL80 (gift from B.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Bruce A Edgar (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The final step in the process, &quot;fusion&quot; of the pre-apical compartment (PAC) with the gut lumen is still somewhat mysterious, and there is little comment about it or data showing the final step. For instance, what happens to the membranes apical to the PAC? Do they dissolve or retract? If they retract, which cells get them? What is happening in Figure 8A,C,E, S7D? Is that a detachment phenotype or an integration phenotype? Are the majority of cells unpolarized due to loss of integrin attachment rather than failure to form an AMIS/PAC?</p><p>Is the model in Figure 6 supported by EM data – can you see a region where there is brush border and separation of cells? Supplementing Figure 3 with corresponding EM images would greatly aid the reader in interpreting the data and strengthen the model.</p><p>2. Role for the septate junction proteins/septate junction: The role of the septate junction proteins Mesh and Coracle, which are used interchangeably, should be clarified. Do they colocalize? Is their localization interdependent (as demonstrated for Mesh, Tsp2a and Ssk in Figure 7)? What is the phenotype of enteroblasts mutant for cora? If Cora is to be used as a readout for the localization of septate junction components, then staining for Cora/Mesh and/or Cora/SSk or Tsp2a should be shown. Does the localization of septate junction protein really correlate with the presence of septate junctions? What is the status of the septate junction itself, e.g. in the cells shown in Figure 2F?</p><p>3. The description of the phenotype resulting from lack of individual septate junction proteins stays somewhat vague. When exactly do things go wrong? It is hard to know what to conclude from this data about the role of the septate junction components in PAC formation. To help the reader evaluate this data, the authors should include information on the age of these MARCM clones and the numbers of cells per clone.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The data show the distribution and the role of septate junction proteins in this process. This led the authors to conclude that septate junctions play an important role. But does the localisation of septate junction protein really correlate with the presence of septate junctions? What is the status of the septate junction itself, e.g. in the cells shown in Figure 2F? And in an earlier stage?</p><p>2. In most of the cartoons it is not indicated whether a membrane belongs to the enteroblast or to an enterocyte, and in most cases this is not a problem. However, to better understand the processes going on at the apical pole, it would have been helpful to know which membrane belongs to which cell.</p><p>3. The description of the phenotype resulting from lack of individual septate junction proteins stays somewhat vague. When exactly do things go wrong? The authors conclude (page 25) that &quot;… lack of septate junctions are not absolutely required for apical-basal polarity in integrating enteroblasts, ….&quot;. Can the authors exclude perdurance of the proteins in some cells?</p><p>4. I find it confusing that the authors used the term &quot;AMIS&quot;, which, as they write, is clearly defined by Bryant et al., 2010, in MDCK cells and includes a midbody. This is clearly not the case in the system used here. Why not use a different term, e.g. incipient apical membrane?</p><p>5. The authors talk about the &quot;AMIS&quot; and the &quot;PAC&quot;. When exactly does the AMIS turn into the PAC? And if the PAC is a membrane compartment: why can it be closed or open (Figure 2I)? In my understanding, the space/lumen above the PAC can be closed or open.</p><p>6. Discussion, page 27: The text reads: &quot;… indicating that enteroblasts go through a mesenchymal stage.&quot; This suggests that they have been epithelial cells before, which I think is not the case (though they are polarised). In contrast, as pointed out, the embryonic midgut precursors undergo a clear EMT.</p><p>7. Discussion, page 28: It reads: &quot;In mammalian epithelial cysts, the site of AMIS is defined by the position of the midbody…&quot; I think this is only true for MDCK cells, and may be different in other systems, e.g. in cysts derived from stem cells.</p><p>8. Last sentence of the discussion: In fact, there is a similar system, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Malpighian tubules, where individual cells, the Stellate cells, integrate from the basal side into an existing epithelium (Campbell et al. 2010). A comparison with this system would be nice to mention.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, I thought this paper was exceptionally well done. It is packed with novel observations and the many conclusions are well supported by the data. A large number of markers are tracked and some are functionally tested. It was also easy to follow and the summary diagrams are clear and helpful. The novelty and significance are high. It does not require much revision. I have these comments for the authors:</p><p>1. The analysis is based on the ordering of different samples in developmental time by morphology and differentiation markers. Although this is a standard approach, and technically necessary, the authors should note cases where their analysis was ambiguous. Sufficient sample numbers are provided to support many conclusions about the order of events, but nevertheless inferences about progression needed to be made. The assumptions these inferences were based on need to be clearly stated. Please review the manuscript for this issue and amend the text as needed.</p><p>2. Although the order of steps is inferred, the authors do not comment on how long the process of EB/EC integration into the epithelium actually takes, and under what conditions (for instance with or without heat shock). Comments on the timing of events would add to the value of the manuscript.</p><p>3. The final step in the process, &quot;fusion&quot; of the pre-apical compartment (PAC) with the gut lumen is still somewhat mysterious, and there is little comment about it or data showing the final step. For instance, what happens to the membranes apical to the PAC? Do they dissolve or retract? If they retract, which cells get them? Please comment on this.</p><p>4. Although I don't doubt the general conclusions, the smooth septate junction mutant phenotypes are quite messy. To help the reader evaluate this data, the authors should include information on the age of these MARCM clones and the numbers of cells per clone.</p><p>5. A parallel study with similar conclusions but fewer descriptions of protein localizations has appeared on BioRxiv and is likely to be published soon (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.19.457819). So as to not confuse the field, the authors should try to use similar terms and acronyms in their two studies, and discussion of discrepant points and cross citations would be helpful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76366.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

This allows the membranes of the two ECs to separate, so that the internal lumen above the PAC becomes continuous with the gut lumen and the PAC becomes the apical domain of the newly-integrated enterocyte. Most EBs integrate beneath tricellular junctions and this TCJ must also be disassembled to allow the new enterocyte to emerge. Thus, we propose that the septate and tricellular junctions above the pre-enterocyte dissolve and the enterocyte membranes retract.</p><p>We have now added the following text to the results:</p><p>&quot;Finally, the septate junctions above the internal lumen disassemble, allowing the membranes of the overlying enterocytes to separate, so that the lumen becomes continuous with the gut lumen. At this point the PAC becomes the apical domain of the newly-integrated enterocyte (Figure 6). The mechanisms that drive the disassembly of the overlying septate junctions are not known, but it is worth bearing in mind that most EBs integrate beneath a tricellular junction. This tricellular junction must therefore also be disassembled to allow the new enterocyte to emerge on the apical surface, and three new tricellular junctions must eventually form where the new enterocyte meets two of the adjacent enterocytes.

Role for the septate junction proteins/septate junction: The role of the septate junction proteins Mesh and Coracle, which are used interchangeably, should be clarified. Do they colocalize? Is their localization interdependent (as demonstrated for Mesh, Tsp2a and Ssk in Figure 7)? What is the phenotype of enteroblasts mutant for cora? If Cora is to be used as a readout for the localization of septate junction components, then staining for Cora/Mesh and/or Cora/SSk or Tsp2a should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason we used mainly Coracle as a marker for the septate junctions is that Mesh and Tsp2A localise to the basal labyrinth as well as to the septate junctions which is not aesthetically pleasing.

Cora antibody staining provides a clearer marker for the septate junctions than Mesh or Tsp2a antibody staining, because the latter also label the basal labyrinth (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E&amp;F).

I find it confusing that the authors used the term &quot;AMIS&quot;, which, as they write, is clearly defined by Bryant et al., 2010, in MDCK cells and includes a midbody. This is clearly not the case in the system used here. Why not use a different term, e.g. incipient apical membrane?</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out in this reviewer's question 7, the midbody may position the AMIS in some contexts, e.g. MDCK cysts in 3D culture, but does not define the AMIS (Apical Membrane Initiation Site). In other systems, such as the zebrafish neural tube, the midbody is not required for apical domain formation, since it still forms when cell division is blocked (Symonds et al., 2020). Thus, we want to keep the term “AMIS” in our paper to highlight the similarity between apical domain formation in the fly midgut epithelium and vertebrate epithelia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors talk about the &quot;AMIS&quot; and the &quot;PAC&quot;. When exactly does the AMIS turn into the PAC? And if the PAC is a membrane compartment: why can it be closed or open (Figure 2I)? In my understanding, the space/lumen above the PAC can be closed or open.</p></disp-quote><p>We propose that the AMIS turns into a PAC when the new septate junctions form laterally and the apical membrane starts to develop.

Discussion, page 27: The text reads: &quot;… indicating that enteroblasts go through a mesenchymal stage.&quot; This suggests that they have been epithelial cells before, which I think is not the case (though they are polarised).

We have therefore re-written this section to make clear that we are only referring to the reversible loss of polarity (not specifically epithelial polarity):</p><p>&quot;This reveals that growing enteroblasts go through a phase where they lack a distinct apical domain, in contrast to ISCs and quiescent enteroblasts, which are polarised and localise Canoe and Par-6 apically. These unpolarised enteroblasts are likely to correspond to the protrusive, migratory state of activated enteroblasts reported by Antonella et al., indicating that growing enteroblasts go through a mesenchymal stage (Antonello et al., 2015). Enteroblasts then re-polarise once they reach the septate junctions between the overlying enterocytes. Thus, the adult enteroblasts transiently lose polarity and become migratory before developing epithelial polarity, much like the embryonic midgut precursors, which undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition when they delaminate from the primary epithelium and become migratory, before re-polarising in contact with the visceral mesoderm to form the embryonic midgut epithelium (Campbell et al., 2011; Pitsidianaki et al., 2021; Tepass and Hartenstein, 1994).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

The analysis is based on the ordering of different samples in developmental time by morphology and differentiation markers. Although this is a standard approach, and technically necessary, the authors should note cases where their analysis was ambiguous. Sufficient sample numbers are provided to support many conclusions about the order of events, but nevertheless inferences about progression needed to be made. The assumptions these inferences were based on need to be clearly stated. Please review the manuscript for this issue and amend the text as needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a sentence when describing the steps in the main-text as “Imaging heat shocked flies expressing <italic>sqh::UtrABD-GFP</italic> or <italic>Fim-GFP</italic> and stained for Canoe and Cora revealed three distinct stages of PAC formation. Based on cell size and marker protein localisation, we infer the follow sequence of steps.” We have also added one sentence to the discussion:</p><p>&quot;This sequence of events has been inferred from ordering images of many fixed samples based on cell size and the localisation of various proteins, but it will be important to corroborate this sequence by imaging enteroblast integration in living midguts.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Although the order of steps is inferred, the authors do not comment on how long the process of EB/EC integration into the epithelium actually takes, and under what conditions (for instance with or without heat shock). Comments on the timing of events would add to the value of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed a new experiment in which we over-express Sox21a using esg[ts]&gt;GFP to induce enteroblast differentiation, and then count the number of GFP<sup>+ve</sup> cells without a PAC, with a PAC and with full apical domain at different time points. This gives us a rough estimate of 1 day as the average time it takes for an activated EB to become a pre-enterocyte with a PAC and for a pre-enterocyte to reach the gut lumen and become an enterocyte.</p><p>We have summarised these results in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C.</p><p>We have also added the following to the main text:</p><p>&quot;To estimate the time taken for enteroblasts to progress to pre-enterocytes with a PAC, and for pre-enterocytes become to enterocytes, we induced enterocyte differentiation by over-expressing <italic>UAS-Sox21a</italic> under the control of <italic>esg[ts]-Gal4</italic> and counted the number of GFP<sup>+ve</sup> cells without a PAC or apical domain, with a PAC and with a full apical domain at different time points after induction (Chen et al., 2016; Meng and Biteau, 2015; Zhai et al., 2017). 17 hours after shifting the flies to 25ºC to inactivate Gal80<sup>ts</sup>, almost no GFP<sup>+ve</sup> cells had progressed to pre-EC with a PAC (0.1%) or EC (1%), and these few cells probably started to differentiate before Sox 21a induction. 24 hours later, 10% of the GFP<sup>+ve</sup> cells had developed into pre-ECs with a PAC and 20% had become ECs (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B&amp;C). After an additional 24 hours, the number of cells with a PAC fell to 1%, whereas 50% were ECs. Assuming that it takes 12-17 hours to induce high levels of Sox21a expression, these results suggest that most activated EBs take about 24 hours to develop into a pre-EC with a PAC and a further 24 hours to differentiate into a mature EC, although some cells differentiate faster. This time frame is in agreement with a previous study using similar approaches to accelerate differentiation (Rojas Villa et al., 2019)and a recent live imaging study tracing the enteroblast to enterocyte transition (Tang et al., 2021). This experiment also indicates that down-regulation of Sox21a is not essential for enteroblast to pre-enterocyte differentiation, since enteroblasts overexpressing Sox21a still from a PAC (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The final step in the process, &quot;fusion&quot; of the pre-apical compartment (PAC) with the gut lumen is still somewhat mysterious, and there is little comment about it or data showing the final step.

Please comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>We propose that the EC-EC septate junctions above the internal lumen are disassembled. This allows the membranes of the two ECs to separate, so that the internal lumen above the PAC becomes continuous with the gut lumen and the PAC becomes the apical domain of the newly-integrated enterocyte. Most EBs integrate beneath tricellular junctions and this TCJ must also be disassembled to allow the new enterocyte to emerge. Thus, we propose that the septate and tricellular junctions above the pre-enterocyte dissolve and the enterocyte membranes retract.</p><p>We have now added the following text to the results:</p><p>“Finally, the septate junctions above the internal lumen disassemble, allowing the membranes of the overlying enterocytes to separate, so that the lumen becomes continuous with the gut lumen. At this point the PAC becomes the apical domain of the newly-integrated enterocyte (Figure 6). The mechanisms that drive the disassembly of the overlying septate junctions are not known, but it is worth bearing in mind that most EBs integrate beneath a tricellular junction. This tricellular junction must therefore also be disassembled to allow the new enterocyte to emerge on the apical surface, and three new tricellular junctions must eventually form where the new enterocyte meets two of the adjacent enterocytes. Indeed, the disassembly of the overlying tricellular junction may be the first event that triggers the emergence of the new enterocyte.”</p><p>We have also added a new top view model as Figure 6B, showing the proposed final step of the fusion of the separate lumen with the gut lumen, dissolved tri-cellular junction (TCJ) and SJs in the neighbouring ECs and the newly formed TCJs and SJs between the integrated EC and neighbouring ECs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.
