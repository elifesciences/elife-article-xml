and gene expression within single cells using oligo-conjugated antibodies offers high-resolution snapshots of complex cell populations. Signal from oligo-conjugated antibodies is quantified by high-throughput sequencing and is highly scalable and sensitive. We investigated the response of oligo-conjugated antibodies towards four variables: concentration, staining volume, cell number at staining, and tissue. We find that staining with recommended antibody concentrations causes unnecessarily high background and amount of antibody used can be drastically reduced without loss of biological information. Reducing staining volume only affects antibodies targeting abundant epitopes used at low concentrations and is counteracted by reducing cell numbers. Adjusting concentrations increases signal, lowers background, and reduces costs. Background signal can account for a major fraction of total sequencing and is primarily derived from antibodies used at high concentrations. This study provides new insight into titration response and background of oligo-conjugated antibodies and offers concrete guidelines to improve such panels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CITE-seq</kwd><kwd>ECCITE-seq</kwd><kwd>scRNA-seq</kwd><kwd>cytometry</kwd><kwd>oligo-conjugated antibodies</kwd><kwd>Background signal</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL-125816</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koralov</surname><given-names>Sergei B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008271</institution-id><institution>LEO Pharma Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LF-OC-20-000351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Odum</surname><given-names>Niels</given-names></name><name><surname>Koralov</surname><given-names>Sergei B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005481</institution-id><institution>NYU School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA016087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koralov</surname><given-names>Sergei B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Judith and Stewart Colton Center for Autoimmunity Pilot Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koralov</surname><given-names>Sergei B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Drs.

Unlike flow- and mass cytometry, CITE-seq is not limited by spectral overlap or availability of distinguishable isotopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gullaksen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hulspas et al., 2009</xref>). This is due to the practically unlimited number of distinct oligo barcodes and discrete sequence counting, allowing high numbers of antibodies to be included in individual experiments.</p><p>While signal acquisition in CITE-seq is different, the reagents and staining procedure are highly analogous to staining for flow cytometry. Traditional titration for flow or mass cytometry aims to identify the conjugated antibody concentration, allowing the best discrimination between the signal from positive and negative cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gullaksen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hulspas, 2010</xref>). Multiple factors may affect antibody binding and subsequent signal including antibody concentration, total amount of antibody, as well as the level of target expression (epitope amount). Epitope amount is governed by the number of cells and the per-cell expression of the target epitope. These factors are in turn influenced by the cellular composition of the sample as well as their activation and differentiation state. Nonspecific binding is expected to increase as the total amount of antibody molecules greatly exceeds the epitopes present in a sample. As such, nonspecific binding is dependent on the total number of antibody molecules, rather than the antibody concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hulspas et al., 2009</xref>). This makes staining volume, cell composition, and cell number important parameters for optimal staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hulspas, 2010</xref>). Consequently, flow and mass cytometric optimization aims to use antibody concentrations that reach the highest signal-to-noise ratio (often reached at the âsaturation plateauâ) in a minimal volume (and thus minimal number of antibody molecules)Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gullaksen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">van Vreden, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Oligo-conjugated antibody signal has been shown to be highly analogous to fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies of the same clone in flow cytometry in regards to the concentration needed to reach the âsaturation plateauâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Stoeckius et al., 2018</xref>). However, unlike flow cytometry, where antibody (fluorescence) signal intensity has no influence on analysis cost, oligo-conjugated antibody signal is analyzed by counting sequencing reads, making costs strictly dependent on signal intensity (by requiring increased sequencing depth). This is particularly important for methods sequencing vast numbers of cells stained with a high number of antibodies such as single-cell combinatorial indexed cytometry by sequencing (SCITO-seq), where shallow sequencing is paramount for the economic feasibility of such methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hwang, 2020</xref>). Thus, while an optimal antibody concentration in flow cytometry aims to get the highest signal-to-noise ratio, oligo-conjugated antibody staining conditions should be titrated to get sufficient signal-to-noise at the lowest possible signal intensity. In practice, this means that concentrations of most antibodies in an optimized CITE-seq panel are not intended to reach their âsaturation plateauâ, but should be within their linear concentration range (where doubling the antibody concentration leads to twice the signal). Such concentrations are much more sensitive to the number of available epitopes (i.e., cell number and cell composition) than an optimized flow cytometry panel. Unlike flow and mass cytometry, where the major source of background is autofluorescence, spillover between neighboring channels, and nonspecific binding of the antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hulspas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Au-Yeung et al., 2019</xref>), a major source of background signal for oligo-conjugated antibodies appears to be free-floating antibodies in the cell suspension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">MulÃ¨ et al., 2020</xref>). In droplet-based single-cell sequencing methods, these free-floating antibodies will be distributed between cell-containing and empty droplets. As signal from empty droplets can only be distinguished from signal from cell-containing droplets after sequencing and due to the much higher number of empty than cell-containing droplets, background signal can make up a considerable fraction of the sequenced reads, and thus sequencing costs.</p><p>In this study, we present a limited but practically applicable titration of four variables in a 5â²-CITE-seq panel of 52 antibodies: (1) antibody concentration (fourfold dilution response), (2) staining volume (50 ÂµL vs. 25 ÂµL), (3) cell count (1 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> vs. 0.2 Ã 10<sup>6</sup>), and (4) tissue of origin: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donor vs. immune cell compartment from a lung tumor sample. We find that oligo-conjugated antibodies show high background and limitedÂ response to titration when used above 2.5 Âµg/mL and that most antibodies appear to reach their saturation plateau at concentrations between 0.62 and 2.5 Âµg/mL. Many antibodies can be further diluted, despite being at their linear concentration range, without affecting the identification of epitope-positive cells. Reducing staining volume has a minor effect on signal and only impacts signal from antibodies used at low concentrations targeting highly expressed epitopes; this effect is counteracted by reducing the number of cells present during staining. We compare samples stained with pre-titration and adjusted concentrations of the same antibody panel and find that adjusting concentrations increases signal, lowers background, and reduces both sequencing and antibody costs. Finally, we find that background signal in empty droplets can constitute a major fraction of the total sequencing reads and is skewed towards antibodies used at high concentrations targeting epitopes present in low amounts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fourfold antibody dilution in PBMC and lung tumor immune cells</title><p>A panel of 52 oligo-conjugated antibodies was allocated into several groups of starting concentrations based on previous experience with each antibody, epitope abundance orÂ following vendor recommendations (concentrationÂ rangeÂ between 0.05 and 10 Âµg/mL; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We stained two samples of either 10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs or 5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> lung tumor leukocytes in 50 ÂµL of antibody mixture with various starting concentrations, hereafter referred to as âdilution factor (DF) 1â.

To allow direct comparison of UMI counts from the different conditions, we reduced the number of cells included in analysis from each condition to contain the same number of cells from each cell type.

However, the reduction in UMI counts from DF1 to DF4 by 38% (761,350 to 474,404) and 51% (1,121,940 to 548,393) in PBMC and lung, respectively, was markedly less than the fourfold difference (75% reduction) in antibody concentrations used in staining. It is worth noting that 4/52 antibodies used at the highest concentration (10 Âµg/mL) accounted for more than 20% of the total UMI counts irrespective of tissues and dilution factors and without showing any clearly positive populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,Â E</xref>; gating thresholds shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Indeed, we found that the majority of antibodies used in concentrations at or above 2.5 Âµg/mL showed minimal response to fourfold titration, both in terms of total UMI counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) as well as UMI counts at the 90th quantile of the cell type with the highest overall expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; expressing cell types identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), reflecting the response within the positive population where such could be identified. In contrast, antibodies used in concentrations at or below 0.62 Âµg/mL all showed close to linear response to fourfold dilution (shown as a reduction around two âlogsâ on a log2 scale; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,Â G</xref>). This indicates that the signal for many antibodies reach their saturation plateau in the range between 0.62 and 2.5 Âµg/mL, and that higher concentrations are likely to only increase the background signal.</p><p>In the present antibodyÂ panel, the response to fourfold dilution can be divided into five categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>) that warrant different considerations in the choice of whether to reduce concentration or not. For category A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), reducing concentration is always the right choice. For the other categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BâE</xref>), the choice of whether to reduce concentration or not depends on the balance between the need for signal and the economic cost of signal (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Fourfold antibody dilution response is dependent on epitope abundance.</title><p>Titration plots (unique molecular identifierÂ [UMI] count vs. cell rank) showing response to reduction in antibody concentration from dilution factor 1 (DF1) to DF4 within peripheral blood mononuclear cells (left) and lung (right).

While some markers should be further reduced (such as CD4, CD45RA, CD62L, CD107a, and TCRab) and some adjustments were too extreme (such as CD14, CD19, and HLA-ABC), the adjusted sample exhibited close to a twofold increase in the median UMIs per positive cell and a 57% increase in the median positive signal (from 7 to 11 UMIs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Importantly, all the markers with the lowest positive signal as well as number of UMIs per positive cell were all increased, reflecting a more balanced sequencing library.</p><p>Importantly, while exhibiting approximately the same relative background signal as assayed by proportion of reads within empty droplets (35â45%; data not shown), the adjusted sample generally showed much lower percentage of UMIs being assigned to background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This was particularly remarkable for CD86, which went from 76.5% to 12.6% and thus yielded similar positive signal while using 4.8-fold fewer UMIs (from 23,971 to 4998; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). In fact, the exception to this was primarily found within category E antibodies for which concentrations were increased due to having very low UMI counts in the DF1 sample (CD56, CD127, and CD196; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">5</xref> for data on all markers). In these cases, the increased concentration yielded better definition of expected positive populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). To balance the sequencing requirements of the panel, we reduced concentrations of most category B antibodies. Except CD19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), all reduced category B antibodies showed no change in resolution of positive vs. negative populations despite a marked reduction in their UMI usage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,Â D</xref>) and concomitant reduction inÂ their positive signal. For instance, when reducing anti-CD5 from 0.62 to 0.16 Âµg/mL, it showed largely identical distribution despite using 65% less UMIs (from 22,068 to 7740; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Category C and E antibodies showed consistently increased positive signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and consequently allowed better identification of populations known to express these markers, such as naive T cells and monocytes for CD45RA and CD45RO, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K,Â L</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Background signal from oligo-conjugated antibodies is dependent on antibody concentration and abundances of epitopes</title><p>Free-floating antibodies in the solution have been shown to be one of the major contributors to background signal for ADTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">MulÃ¨ et al., 2020</xref>). Similar to cell-free RNA, background ADT signal can be assayed from empty droplets. To determine the background signal of the different antibodies in our panel, we split the captured barcodes into cell-containing and empty droplets based on the inflection point of the barcode-rank plot for the gene expression UMI counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Despite being a âsuper-loadedâ 10X Chromium run targeting 20,000 cells, the number of empty droplets vastly outnumbered the cell-containing droplets. Consequently, several antibodies exhibited more cumulated UMIs within empty droplets than within cell-containing droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This was particularly prevalent within antibodies used at concentration of or above 2.5 Âµg/mL, thus drastically skewing the frequency of these antibodies within the empty droplets as compared with cell-containing droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,Â B</xref>). Conversely, antibodies targeting highly abundant epitopes were enriched within cell-containing droplets, irrespective of their staining concentration (such as CD44 and CD107a, HLA-ABC, HLA-DR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This was consistent with publicly available datasets where ADTs from antibodies targeting abundant epitopes (such as CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD45RA) wereÂ enrichedÂ within the cell-containing droplets using two different capture approaches (3â²- and 5â² capture; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

We show that for a representative panel of 52 antibodies, most antibodies used in concentrations at or above 2.5 Âµg/mL show high background signal and we observedÂ minimal loss in sensitivity upon a fourfold reduction in concentration of these antibodies. Antibodies used at concentrations between 0.625 and 2.5 Âµg/mL show limited (nonlinear) response, whereas most antibodies used at concentrations below 0.625 Âµg/mL show linear or close to linear response. It should be noted that these estimates may be inherently biased given that the starting concentrations were based on our prior experience with the individual antibody clones and our assumptions regarding abundance of targeted epitopes. This has favored using higher concentrations for antibodies known to have low performance and for antibodies with unknown performance. Nonetheless, for antibodies with unknown performance, our results highlight the benefits of conducting titration experiments or initially using the antibodies at concentrations in the 0.625â2.5 Âµg/mL range, rather than the 5â10 Âµg/mL range recommended by published antibody staining protocols and by commercial vendors. This is particularly important when adding new antibodies to existing panels, where antibodies added in a high concentration may account for a disproportionate usage of the total sequencing reads without providing any biological information (as seen for CD86, CD152, CD183, CD197, and TCRÎ³Î´ in the DF1 panel). Our results also show that concentrations of antibodies targeting highly expressed epitopes can be further reduced without affecting resolution of positive and negative cells, even when these antibodies are already used within their linear concentration range (such as CD5, CD8, and CD19). By reducing the concentration of these antibodies, the allocation of reads to each antibody becomes more balanced between epitopes present at disparate abundance, allowing the overall sequencing depth to be reduced and maximizing the yield of a sequencing run.</p><p>By using varying starting concentrations based on prior experience and titrating the full panel together, our study does not necessarily identify optimal concentrations of individual antibodies. This could have been achieved by using saturating starting concentrations and additional serial dilutions, as has been previously done for a few markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Stoeckius et al., 2018</xref>). However, due to the cost of signal in these cytometry-by-sequencing methods, using all antibodies at their highest signal-to-noise ratios would require much deeper sequencing as highly expressed markers would use the vast majority of the total sequencing reads. Instead, we aimed to get sufficient signal-to-noise, while keeping the sequencing allocated to each marker balanced. A further complication for titration experiments that start with saturating amounts of antibody is the observation that background signal can be largely attributed to free-floating antibodies in the solution. Thus, using high concentrations for all markers in one or more sampleÂ would increase the background in all samplesÂ if these were multiplexed into the same droplet segregation. This would likely obscure the positive signals and possibly titration response at lower concentrations (similar to what we see for category A antibodies). To avoid this, each condition would have to be run in its own droplet segregation, making traditional titration experiments prohibitively costly.</p><p>In this study, we used commercially available antibody clones that have been extensively used for other applications such as flow and mass cytometry, and we do see high concordance between ADT signals and the expected antigens within each cell type. Our approach did not allow us to formally test whether each antibody is specific to its intended antigen as we inferredÂ specificity based on our understanding of the included cell types and looked for concordance with gene expression signature of the cells. However, it should be noted, that when using antibody clones that are unfamiliar or have not undergone extensive testing, it is important to assure their specificity.</p><p>Reducing staining volume for 10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs from 50 ÂµL to 25 ÂµL only showedÂ a minor effect on signal, and this minimal impact was primarily observed for antibodies used at very low concentrations (0.0125â0.025 Âµg/mL) targeting highly expressed epitopes (such as CD31, CD44, and CD45). This effect was readily counteracted by concomitantly reducing the number of cells at staining to 0.2 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs in 25 ÂµL. In flow cytometry, while the binding of antibody is strictly dependent on its concentration, background signal is dependent on the ratio between the total amounts of antibody and epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hulspas, 2010</xref>). Consequently, background can be reduced by increasing the number of cells (increasing the amount of epitope) or decreasing staining volume (effectively reducing the amount of antibody without changing its concentration). For antibodies optimized to reach their âsaturation plateauâ (common in flow cytometry), both of these approaches can be applied without changing the true signal. In contrast, for oligo-conjugated antibodies used in sequencing-based single-cell approaches, operating in the linear range, signal from highly abundant epitopes stained with low concentration of antibody will be affected. In such cases, the cells can be stained in multiple steps adjusting the staining volume while keeping the concentration the same â thatÂ is, staining in a smaller volume for antibodies with high background and subsequently staining antibodies at low concentration in a higher volume. In this regard, when multiplexing samples, pre-staining each sample with hashtags and pooling prior to staining with additional CITE-seq antibodies may provide multiple advantages: (1) all samples are stained at the same time with the exact same antibody mixture â making cross-sample comparison more accurate, (2) by having more cells in a smaller total volume, less total antibody is used in the presence of more epitopes conceivably reducing the background signalÂ and (3) samples where cell number at staining is a limiting factor, such as small tissue biopsies, will be exposed to the same local concentrations of antibody as more abundant samples (such as PBMCs) removing potential differences between samples by antibodies being âspongedâ by differences in overall epitope abundance. However, this approach is only available when all samples are similarly affected by the staining procedure and can tolerate the additional washes needed (after both hashing and CITE-seq staining).</p><p>We compared ADT signal from PBMCs stained with the same antibody panel at the starting concentration with a sample stained at concentrations adjusted following the titration experiment. While some markers could benefit from further adjustments, the sample stained with the adjusted panel was more balanced in its distribution of sequencing reads among markers, having twice the median UMIs per positive cell. Despite intentionally reducing signal in category B antibodies, we found an overall 57% increase in the median positive signal. Concomitantly, the adjusted panel exhibited 43% lower background signal (median of 26.3% to 14.9% UMIs assigned to background) despite increasing the concentrations of many category C and E antibodies. Consequently, the adjusted concentrations greatly improved the overall performance of the panel. We took precautions to make the samples as comparable as possible by down-sampling the sequencing depth to the same level and comparing similar numbers of analogouscells (at the mRNA level). Nonetheless, as these samples were from different preparations and different donors, we cannot exclude that some of the observed differences can be attributed to these factors. For instance, we found that the monocytes in the adjusted sample exhibited higher nonspecific binding (as seen from the isotype controls) than in the DF1 sample, despite being treated with the same concentrations of Fc-blocking reagents (which should minimize such biding; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Due to the 10-Â toÂ 1000-fold higher numbers of individualÂ proteins as compared to mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Marguerat et al., 2012</xref>), ADT libraries have high library complexity (unique UMI content) and are rarely sequenced near saturation. Thus, either sequencing deeper or squandering less reads on a few antibodies increases signal from all (other) included antibodies. We found that by simply reducing the concentration of the five antibodies used at 10 Âµg/mL, we gained 17% more reads for the remaining antibodies. Consequently, assuming we are satisfied with the magnitude of signal we got from all other antibodies using the starting concentration, this directly translates to a 17% reduction in sequencing costs. Due to different antibodies being adjusted in different directions for different reasons (according to their assigned categories), it is difficult to convert the overall improved utilization of sequencing reads into exact savings calculation. However, assuming signal is improved or unchanged, the savings on sequencing for each marker can be estimated by how many UMIs are needed to acquire a given signal. In the case of CD86, we found that the signal was dramatically improved by reducing concentration from 10 to 0.667 Âµg/mL while also using 79% fewer UMIs and consequently a much lower number of sequencing reads.</p><p>Empty droplets have been shown to be useful for determining the background signal of CITE-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">MulÃ¨ et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests that the major source of background signal for ADT libraries can be attributed to free-floating antibodies (or oligos) in the solution rather than nonspecific antibody binding to cell surfaces. In the present study, the samples were multiplexed by hashing antibodies, pooled after oligo-conjugated antibody staining, and then run in the same 10X Chromium lane. This obscures the contribution of each sample to the total amount of free-floating antibodies in the final cell suspension, which is conceivably skewed towards the samples stained in high volume with the highest concentration of antibodies. Consequently, as free-floating antibodies are the major source of background, this would explain why we do not observe reduced background in the cells stained at the lowest concentrations (i.e., DF4). As such, for markers with no specific signal due to high background (such as CD183, CD197, and TCRgd), the titration responses may be underestimated due to specific signal being lost within the high background. This also means, that for markers with high background signal our proposed reductions in concentrations are conservative as we would expect to see decreased background in samples stained with reduced amount of antibodies (as seen in the comparison with the adjusted concentrations). In droplet-based single-cell analyses, background signal is not only diminishing the sensitivity and resolution of true signals, but is also a major contributor to sequencing cost of ADT libraries. Due to empty droplets vastly outnumbering cell-containing droplets, we found that ADT signal from empty droplets can easily account for 20â50% of the total sequencing reads and consequently 20â50% of the sequencing cost. The number of antibodies used in CITE-seq-related platforms is only expected to expand. Additionally, the numberÂ of cells included in each experiment is continuously being increased (as seen for methods such as SCITO-seq; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hwang, 2020</xref>). As such, reducing background signal from oligo-conjugated antibodies should be a priority. The source of the free-floating antibodies is not completely understood. Observations from this study suggest that antibodies used at high concentration targeting absent or sparse epitopes are highly enriched within the empty droplets, as compared toÂ the cell-containing droplets. This indicates that residual unbound antibody from the staining step is a major contributor despite several washing steps. Practically, this suggests that additional washing after cell staining would be beneficial when the number and type of cells in the samples allow it. Optimal washing is achieved by repeated washing steps while assuring that maximal residual supernatant is removed after each centrifugation and followed by gentle but complete resuspension in a large buffer volume.</p><p>More and more advanced CITE-seq-related cytometry-by-sequencing platforms are rapidly being developed. However, while these platforms utilize different methods to assure single-cell resolution and use different approaches to label the cells, they all use high-throughput sequencing to count signal from a variety of oligo-conjugated probes (such as antibodies with both surface and intracellular targets, MHC-peptide multimers, andÂ B-cell receptor antigens) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Stoeckius et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Peterson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hwang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Setliff et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">O'Huallachain et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Overall et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Gaublomme et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Katzenelenbogen et al., 2020</xref>).

Due to the shallow sequencing of the mRNA library (~4000 reads/cell), expression ofÂ at least 60 genes and a percent mitochondrial reads below 15% were used to remove barcodes from non-viable cells or debris (2499 or 15% of cells removed). Intra-sample doublets were removed using the âscDblFinderâ (v1.1.8) R package (392 cells removed). UMI counts from ADTs were normalized using default configuration of the DSB (v0.1.0) R package with ADT signal from HTO-negative droplets used as empty drop matrix and using included isotype controls. Gene expression was preprocessed using the default Seurat v3 pipeline, and fine-grained clusters were identified using the âFindClustersâ function with a resolution of 1.2. Clusters were annotated by lineages and cell types using their distinct expression of markers within the mRNA or ADT modality and aided by cell-by-cell annotation from the SingleR R package (v1.4.0) using the âMonaco referenceâ from the celldex R package (v1.0.0) made from bulk RNA-seq samples of sorted immune cell populations from GSE107011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Monaco et al., 2019</xref>). Top five differentially expressed marker genes for each cluster can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>. To allow direct comparison of UMI counts across conditions, each condition was down-sampled by tissue of origin to include the same number of cells within each fine-grained cell-type cluster (resulting in 1777 cells from each PBMC sample and 1681 cells from each lung tumor sample).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Integration and sub-sampling for pre- and post-titration comparison</title><p>The post-titration (adjusted) sample was pre-processed as described above. Together with the DF1 sample, the adjusted sample was normalized and integrated based on their mRNA expression using the SCTransform and IntegrateData functions from the Seurat package as described in the Seurat integration vignette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>). After mRNA-based clustering using FindClusters at resolution 1.2, similar number of comparable cells was selected by taking the nearest neighbors in PCA-space for each cell in the sample with the fewest cells within the given cluster. This sampling assured that similar number of comparable cells (at the mRNA level) were selected for comparison, thus minimizing the effect of the sample differences. To allow direct comparison of UMI counts and eliminate differences in sequencing depth as a factor, we down-sampled the FASTQ files from the ADT modality of the adjusted sample to achieve similar totals of UMIs within the DF1 (522,469) and adjusted (521,331) samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Comparing ADT signal from cell-containing and empty droplets</title><p>For comparison of UMI counts within cell-containing and non-cell-containing (empty) droplets for the present dataset and the 10X Genomics datasets, we divided the unfiltered count matrices by the inflection point in their ranked per cell UMI sum from the mRNA library. Barcodes above the inflection point were then used to extract UMI counts within cell-containing droplets from each antibody oligo modality. All UMIs that were not included in cell-containing droplets were considered from empty droplets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data and code availability</title><p>All codes and commands used to process the data and generate all plots and figures are available at GitHub: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Terkild/CITE-seq_optimization">https://github.com/Terkild/CITE-seq_optimizationÂ </ext-link>Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buus, 2021</xref>; copyÂ archived atÂ <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:2f09a1f62c7ff5747082d3df35ba084de2c74118;origin=https://github.com/Terkild/CITE-seq_optimization;visit=swh:1:snp:0ee750838031765e942353cfad04eb17b54b142d;anchor=swh:1:rev:1c7fcabb18a1971dc4d6e29bc3ed4f6f36b2361f/">swh:1:rev:1c7fcabb18a1971dc4d6e29bc3ed4f6f36b2361f</ext-link>).</p><p>UMI count matrices from the optimization experiment have been deposited at FigShare with DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5018987">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5018987</ext-link>.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Eisen as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: JosÃ© Ordovas-Montanes (Reviewer #1); Johan Duchene (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the study by Buus et al., the authors set out to address an important need to understand how oligo-conjugated antibodies should be optimally utilized in droplet-based scRNA-seq studies. These techniques, often referred to as CITE-seq, complement techniques such as flow cytometry and mass cytometry yet also further extend them by the ability to jointly measure intra-cellular RNA-based cell states together with antibody-based measurements. As is the case with flow cytometry, manufacturers provide staining recommendations, yet encourage users to titrate antibodies on their specific samples in order to derive a final staining panel. Based on the ability to stain with hundreds of antibodies jointly, few studies to date have assessed how the antibodies present in these pre-made staining panels respond to a standard titration curve. In order to address this point, this study tests two dilution factors, staining volume, cell count, and tissue of origin to understand the relationships between signal and background for a commercially available antibody panel. They arrive at the general recommendation that these panels could be improved, grouping various antibodies into distinct categories.</p><p>This study is of general interest to the scRNA-seq and CITE-seq communities as it draws attention to this important aspect of CITE-seq panel design. However, given the title is &quot;improving oligo-conjugated antibody in multi-modal single cell analysis&quot;, the manuscript would be substantially improved by not only providing suggestions but also testing at least one, if not more, of their suggestions from Supplementary Table 2, and preferably performing experiments using more technical replicates or biological replicates. As it stands now, the study is largely based on one PBMC and one lung sample, that were stained once with each manipulation as far as can be gathered from the Methods.</p><p>Recombinant antibodies are the most common and powerful reagents in life science research to identify and study proteins. Yet, every single antibody should always be validated and carefully tested for its relevant application, to ensure constructive and reproductive scientific endeavor. I was thus extremely pleased to review the manuscript of Terkild Buus et al., as it provides a careful assessment of oligo-conjugated antibody signal in CITE-seq. The authors tested four variables (antibody concentration, staining volume, cell numbers and tissue origin) and clearly showed that antibody titration is a crucial step to optimize CITE-seq panel. The authors found that, as a general rule, concentration in the 0.625 and 2.5 Âµg/mL range provides the best results while recommended concentrations by vendors, 5 to 10 Âµg/mL range, increase background signal.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The starting concentration used for each antibody was based on historical experience and assumptions about the abundance of the epitopes. This approach may not be ideal, and the optimal concentration may have been missed. Do the authors think that a proper titration would be an advantage? Maybe this could be discussed in the text.As a means of testing, we suggest a full titration curve of selected antibodies, perhaps one from each of the categories, but if cost is a concern at least two or three antibodies, to identify how titration impacts antibodies, and especially those in categories labeled as in need of improvement. Relatedly, if the idea is that if antibodies (such as gD-TCR) do not have a cognate receptor leading to general background spread, does spiking in a cell that is a known positive in increasing ratios remedy this issue by acting as a target for the antibodies? Does adding extra washes help to remedy these issues of background?</p><p>2. Another way of improving these panels is through reducing the costs spent on both staining but perhaps more importantly the sequencing-based readouts. Several times in the manuscript (at line 77 for example or line 277) it is alluded to that the background signal of antibodies can make up a substantial cost of sequencing these libraries. However, no formal data on cost is presented, which would be important to formalize the author's points. It would be important to provide cost calculations and recommendations on sequencing depth of ADT libraries based on variation of staining concentration. Relatedly, in the methods, sequencing platform and read depth for ADT libraries was not discussed, nor is the RNA-seq quality control metrics provided other than a mention of ~5,000 reads/cell targeted. This is important to report in all transcriptomic studies, and especially a methods development study.</p><p>3. One of the powerful elements of joint multi-modal profiling, as mentioned in the title, is to be able to measure protein and RNA from a single cell. This study does not formally look at correlation of protein and RNA levels, and whether a decrease in concentration of antibody either improves or diminishes this correlation. This would be important to test with in this study to ensure that decreasing antibody levels does not then adversely affect the power of correlating protein with RNA, and whether it may even improve it.</p><p>Relatedly, the authors showed by testing four variables (see above) that they could define the optimal conditions to reduce background signal and increase sensitivity of antibodies and thus this way improves CITE-seq outcome. Nevertheless, the authors rely on the fact that all antibodies used in their panel are specific for their targeted antigens. It is not necessary to experimentally test the specificity of every single antibody used in the study as this would be a colossal amount of work. But I feel that this aspect should be discussed in the manuscript, especially when an &quot;uncommon&quot; antibody is intended to be used in the CITE-seq panel; the specificity of this antibody should be indeed tested prior to its use.</p><p>4. How was the lack of antibody binding determined for Category E? CD56 is frequently detected on NK cells in peripheral blood, CD117 should be detected on mast cells in lung, and CD127 should be found on T cells, particularly CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. From inspecting Figure 1E, it appears as if all three of these markers are detected on small but consistent cell subsets. As the clusters are only numbered and no supplementary table is provided to help to reader in their interpretation, it is difficult to determine if these represent rare but specific binding, or have not bound with any specificity.</p><p>5.

We agree that using starting concentrations based on historical experience etc. may not be ideal for a completely objective assessment of how oligo-conjugated antibodies respond to the four-variables test. However, we firmly believe that using informed starting concentrations greatly increases the potential improvement of a panel while keeping costs to a minimum (which has to be a consideration for these expensive methods). With that said, we agree that this approach may not reach <italic>the</italic> optimal concentration (a definition that is a bit complex in this setting). Full titration curves have previously been published showing that oligo-conjugated antibodies respond to titration, and in that regard behave similar to fluorophore-conjugated antibodies assayed by flow cytometry (see Stoeckius et al. 2018. Genome Biology; Figure 3A-D). Our study does not aim to identify the optimal concentration of individual antibodies in isolation but strives to provide the optimal signal-to-noise ratio for each antibody in a cocktail while taking sequencing requirements into account â this is why we donât focus on full titration curves and saturation kinetics for each antibody/epitope. If we use all antibodies at their highest signal-to-noise ratios, this would drastically increase sequencing requirements of the library as highly expressed markers would use the vast majority of the total sequencing reads. As such, we aimed to get âsufficientâ signal-to-noise while keeping the sequencing allocated to each marker balanced. We have elaborated on this in the discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Furthermore, as our results show, background signal can be largely attributed to free-floating antibodies in the solution, using high concentrations for all markers in one or more condition would increase the background in all conditions if these were multiplexed into the same droplet segregation. This phenomenon would likely obscure the positive signals and possibly titration response at lower concentrations (similar to what we see for category A antibodies). To avoid this, if full titration curves should be meaningful, each condition should be run in its own droplet segregation making such titration efforts prohibitively costly. We have elaborated on this in the discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><p>We agree that it would greatly improve the study to include results from our panel with adjusted concentrations. In the revised manuscript, we have made efforts to address this by making a comparison between the sample stained with the pre-titration (DF1) concentrations and a sample stained with concentrations that have adjusted based on their assigned categories (from Table 1). We believe that this new data convincingly demonstrates improvements both of the individual antibody signals and at the level of the increased sequencing balance (see new Figure 5). While the adjusted concentrations could still benefit from further improvements, we show that at similar sequencing depths, the adjusted concentrations provide a more balanced sequencing output and exhibit a 57 % increase in the median positive signal and a 43 % reduction in the median background signal for the 52 antibodies in our panel. The benefit of the adjusted concentration was particularly remarkable for CD86 which went from having 76.5 % to 12.6 % of UMIs assigned to background signal and thus yielded comparable positive signal while using 4.8 fold less UMIs (new Figure 5G).</p><p>Spiking in cells that express the cognate antigen is an interesting idea. However, as the spiked in cells would be included in all the downstream processes including sequencing of mRNA and other modalities, it would be quite costly to spike-in cells that are not of biological interest â only to decrease background of one or a few antibodies.</p><p>While the results presented in the manuscript do not address this directly, our data strongly suggest that adding extra washing would help reduce free-floating antibodies in the solution captured in the gel-bead emulsions responsible for some of the observed background signal (as can be assayed by the non-cell-containing droplets). For such a test to make sense, the staining conditions should be identical for two samples that are differentially washed (including the exact same cell composition) and would require fully separate droplet segregations (i.e. utilization of separate 10x lanes) which would make it a very costly experiment solely to test the washing effect. However, we have done preliminary tests using short (150bp) cDNA amplicon spiked into different tubes or plates containing ~750x10<sup>3</sup> PBMCs to determine washing efficiency by qPCR. Here we assayed how increasing the washing volume from 200Âµl (96-well) to 1.5mL or 50mL for two washes reduced the detection of the spiked-in amplicon in the supernatant as compared to an unwashed sample. While short cDNA amplicons may not behave identical to oligo-conjugated antibodies, they simulate background signal stemming from free-floating antibodies and thus can be used to evaluate different washing conditions for a given set-up. As expected, using higher washing volumes does indeed greatly reduce the amount of amplicon (simulating free-floating âbackgroundâ antibodies) detected in the resulting suspension.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61973-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Another way of improving these panels is through reducing the costs spent on both staining but perhaps more importantly the sequencing-based readouts. Several times in the manuscript (at line 77 for example or line 277) it is alluded to that the background signal of antibodies can make up a substantial cost of sequencing these libraries. However, no formal data on cost is presented, which would be important to formalize the author's points. It would be important to provide cost calculations and recommendations on sequencing depth of ADT libraries based on variation of staining concentration. Relatedly, in the methods, sequencing platform and read depth for ADT libraries was not discussed, nor is the RNA-seq quality control metrics provided other than a mention of ~5,000 reads/cell targeted. This is important to report in all transcriptomic studies, and especially a methods development study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the very sparse description of choice of sequencing method and RNA-seq quality controls. We have included additional metrics in the Materials and methods and included a new Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 showing number of detected genes as well as UMI counts within the mRNA and ADT modalities in the revised manuscript. We agree that reducing sequencing cost (without reducing biological information) is a major reason for optimizing staining with oligo-conjugated antibodies. We have now added a section in which we elaborate on the potential cost saving, and other benefits of titration of antibody panels and provide some examples from our datasets. Actual savings of optimization of these panels will be very dependent on a given setup, starting concentrations and the depth of sequencing that the particular research questions (and budget) warrant.</p><p>Due to the 10-1000 fold higher numbers of proteins as compared to coding mRNA [16], ADT libraries have high library complexity (unique UMI content) and are rarely sequenced near saturation. Thus, either sequencing deeper or squandering fewer reads on a handful of antibodies, will result in an increased signal from other antibodies in the panel. We found that by simply reducing the concentration of the five antibodies used at 10 Âµg/mL, we gained 17 % more reads for the remaining antibodies. Consequently, assuming we are satisfied with the magnitude of signal we got from all other antibodies using the starting concentration, this directly translates to a 17 % reduction in sequencing costs.</p><p>In terms of sequencing depth, we are not comfortable giving very broad recommendations. This is due to the fact that sequencing requirements will be very different depending on the composition of the antibody panel as well as the cell type distribution (epitope abundance) (as has been previously noted in Mair et al. 2020 Cell Rep.). If the antibody panel contains only antibodies targeting epitopes that are largely present on a small subset of cells (such as CD56 or CD8 for PBMCs) it would require fewer reads per marker per total cell count than markers that are broadly expressed (such as HLA-ABC or CD45 for PBMCs). However, in a different sample composition (for instance a tissue with few leukocytes) these same antibodies would require fewer reads per cell whereas other epitopes may be more abundant.</p><p>We want to also stress, that aside from cost savings, an optimized balanced panel with low background will yield improved resolution compared to a non-optimized panel. Fortunately, CITE-seq and related methods are very flexible in this regard as you can start by shallow sequencing and then âtop-upâ the sequencing depth to an optimal level based on the actual data in subsequent sequencing runs (for instance together with the next batch of samples).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. One of the powerful elements of joint multi-modal profiling, as mentioned in the title, is to be able to measure protein and RNA from a single cell. This study does not formally look at correlation of protein and RNA levels, and whether a decrease in concentration of antibody either improves or diminishes this correlation. This would be important to test with in this study to ensure that decreasing antibody levels does not then adversely affect the power of correlating protein with RNA, and whether it may even improve it.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs suggestion â this is a great idea. Unfortunately, such correlations are notoriously hard to do for scRNA-seq data due to the sparsity of the RNA measurements (which contains high frequency of 0 UMI counts). This is, in part, due to low reverse transcriptase efficiency, and also due to the fact that most proteins have 10-1000 fold more copies than the mRNA transcripts that encode them (Marguerat et al. 2012 Cell). This is exacerbated in our study by the fact that we only shallowly sequenced RNA modality (~4000 reads/cell). Consequently, we see a very high number of cells that despite clustering together within distinct lineage clusters (based on their full transcriptome) and expressing the expected lineage marker surface proteins, do not have readily detectable transcript for the same marker(s). For instance, for all cells that are positive for CD8 at the RNA level, there are at least as many that are negative for CD8 RNA while being positive for CD8 ADT. Importantly, these additional CD8<sup>+</sup> cells are still located within clusters consistent with a CD8<sup>+</sup> phenotype (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61973-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>As such, due to the sparsity of RNA counts, if ADT signal is diluted too much leading to truly positive cells being called as negative, it may actually increase individual cell correlation between RNA and ADT but mean higher levels of âfalse negativeâ cells. Direct correlation between RNA and antibody measurements within each individual cells is further complicated by the presence of non-specific/background signal in protein data that is rarely found in RNA data. This can also be seen in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> by the fact that positive cells are defined at a cut-off â7â at the ADT level, and not â0â as is the case for RNA. Thus, while having only a few UMI counts for a given transcript is sufficient to call expression, having a few UMIs from an ADT can easily be attributed to background (particularly in an unoptimized panel).Due to these technical limitations, we find it more suitable to correlate âpositivityâ called by either ADT (gated positive as shown in Figure 1âfigure supplement 2) or mRNA expression (i.e. &gt; 0 UMI counts). While this comparison is less quantitative (does not distinguish âhighâ from âlowâ expression) it enables us to show whether reducing antibody concentrations affects ADT signal ability to distinguish positive from negative cells (as compared to GEX), which is at the core of the reviewerâs suggestion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>, demonstrates that four-fold titration reduces the fraction of positive cells by some markers (reduction in the blue+red bars by dilution) whereas other markers are largely unaffected both of which is consistent with the analysis in the manuscript:</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61973-resp-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In terms of assuring specificity, we have also modified the âtitration plotsâ to show more detailed cell type distribution at each rank (by the âbarcode plotâ to the right of the ârank plotâ) as well as the distribution of UMIs among cell types (by the bar plot above the âbarcode plotâ) at each condition. Finally, to make these âtitration plotsâ more accessible, we have now included a guide to the different components of the âtitration plotsâ in Figure 2 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Relatedly, the authors showed by testing four variables (see above) that they could define the optimal conditions to reduce background signal and increase sensitivity of antibodies and thus this way improves CITE-seq outcome. Nevertheless, the authors rely on the fact that all antibodies used in their panel are specific for their targeted antigens. It is not necessary to experimentally test the specificity of every single antibody used in the study as this would be a colossal amount of work. But I feel that this aspect should be discussed in the manuscript, especially when an &quot;uncommon&quot; antibody is intended to be used in the CITE-seq panel; the specificity of this antibody should be indeed tested prior to its use.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. This is indeed an aspect of antibody optimization that we have not touched upon. By using commercially available oligo-conjugated antibody clones that are broadly used, the extensive testing of many of these clones by multiple labs within immunology community (for flow/mass cytometry applications) and based on our personal experience with majority of the clones for flow cytometry applications, we expected that the antibodies in our panel should be specific for their antigen. This is supported by the labelling matching what we would expect to find in PBMCs and lung leukocytes, as well as the correlation between expression of the gene encoding the targeted epitope and antibody binding (see our response to reviewer 1, point 3). We have added a paragraph to the revised manuscript discussing that, particularly when using antibodies for the first time or using clones that are unfamiliar, it is important to assure specificity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. How was the lack of antibody binding determined for Category E? CD56 is frequently detected on NK cells in peripheral blood, CD117 should be detected on mast cells in lung, and CD127 should be found on T cells, particularly CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. From inspecting Figure 1E, it appears as if all three of these markers are detected on small but consistent cell subsets. As the clusters are only numbered and no supplementary table is provided to help to reader in their interpretation, it is difficult to determine if these represent rare but specific binding, or have not bound with any specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you pointing this out. In light of this comment, it is obvious that we need to annotate the cell types of the clusters. We have annotated all the fine-grained clusters by cell types and re-worked all relevant panels in Figures 1, 2 and 3 (and all their related figure supplements) to show more detailed and consistent cell type annotation. We have also added Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C and D to show marker genes for each of the annotated cell types, which together with the re-worked Figure 1E, give the reader a clear description of the cluster identity. We do indeed see some signal for Category E antibodies such as CD56, CD117 and CD127 within the expected clusters. This indicates that the antibodies do work to some extent. However, we also find that the signal for these markers is modest, at best, and not present in some populations where we would have expected them (CD127 should be more pronounced in T cells and we are finding an unexpectedly high frequency of CD56-negative NK cells).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. References: At 14 references, the paper overall could benefit from a more comprehensive citation of related literature including flow cytometry and/or CyTOF best practices for antibody staining and dealing with background, and joint RNA and protein measurement from single cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the reference list of the original manuscript was sparse and may have missed important relevant studies. We have done our best to include additional studies relevant for the optimization and titration of mass cytometry panels and flow cytometry staining and added references to a few newly published joint RNA and protein measurement studies.
