In aquatic organisms such as zebrafish, osmotic shock following injury is believed to be an early and potent activator of a wound response. We find that, in addition to sensing osmolarity, basal skin cells in zebrafish larvae are also sensitive to changes in the particular ionic composition of their surroundings after wounding, specifically the concentration of sodium chloride in the immediate vicinity of the wound. This sodium chloride-specific wound detection mechanism is independent of cell swelling, and instead is suggestive of a mechanism by which cells sense changes in the transepithelial electrical potential generated by the transport of sodium and chloride ions across the skin. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that electric fields directly applied within the skin are sufficient to initiate actin polarization and migration of basal cells in their native epithelial context in vivo, even overriding endogenous wound signaling. This suggests that, in order to mount a robust wound response, skin cells respond to both osmotic and electrical perturbations arising from tissue injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>wound healing</kwd><kwd>electric field</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>epidermis</kwd><kwd>transepithelial potential</kwd><kwd>cell polarization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Theriot</surname><given-names>Julie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001906</institution-id><institution>Washington Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Theriot</surname><given-names>Julie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM008294</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kennard</surname><given-names>Andrew S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Skin cells in zebrafish use sodium chloride-dependent electrical gradients to sense tissue injury and guide migration in the appropriate direction to close the wound.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epithelial tissues separate organisms from the outside world and bear an ever-present risk of injury, and so epithelial wound healing is a critical homeostatic process. The initial wound response in many tissues consists of rearrangements of the actomyosin cytoskeleton to form a contractile purse string that closes the wound in concert with protrusive actin structures that promote cell migration toward the injury and help cover the damaged area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abreu-Blanco et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eming et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rothenberg and Fernandez-Gonzalez, 2019</xref>). In order to mount a wound response, cells must detect both the presence of a wound and the direction in which the wound is located; this information must be ultimately derived from changes in the cell’s environment caused by injury. Much progress has been made in understanding how cells coordinate a wound response locally using mechanical cues, such as the presence of free space adjacent to a cell, or forces exerted by neighboring cells via cell–cell junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Begnaud et al., 2016</xref>). Yet many internal signaling events—including waves of calcium influx, hydrogen peroxide release, and purinergic signaling—occur in cells hundreds of microns away from a wound less than a minute after injury, suggesting that there must be other mechanisms by which cells sense injury on a tissue-wide scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Niethammer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Razzell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xu and Chisholm, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yoo et al., 2012</xref>). This large-scale coordination could arise from rapid changes in the external environment around each cell, which is altered by the breach of the epithelial barrier and intermixing between formerly separated compartments. Such environmental changes have been challenging to characterize.</p><p>Non-keratinized epithelia exposed to aqueous environments—such as the mucosal surfaces of the human body or the skin of aquatic organisms—devote considerable energy to regulate ion transport between the environment and internal body fluids. This ion transport maintains the distinct composition and osmolarity of interstitial fluid relative to the surrounding environment: for example, interstitial fluid in saltwater fishes is hyposmotic relative to the environment, while in freshwater fishes it is hyperosmotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boisen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Potts, 1984</xref>). The driving force for ion transport derives from electrically active energy-requiring pumps such as the sodium–potassium ATPase and the V-ATPase proton pump, which establish electrochemical gradients that are coupled to the transport of other ionic species through passive ion channels and transporters. Differential transport of ions can lead to a net electric charge on one side of the epithelium relative to the other, which creates a voltage gradient between the two sides of the epithelial layer known as the transepithelial potential (TEP). This TEP is related to but distinct from the transmembrane potential between the inside and outside of each cell, and it is sensitive to the composition of the solutions on either side of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dietz et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ussing and Zerahn, 1951</xref>). Ion substitution and pharmacological inhibition of ion channels suggests that transport of sodium and chloride ions is essential for maintaining the TEP in different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dietz et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McCaig and Robinson, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reid et al., 2005</xref>). If the tissue is damaged, fluid intermixing disrupts the normal ion gradients and leads to a variety of osmotic and electrical changes in the environment of the epithelium, including osmotic shock and short-circuiting of the TEP.</p><p>Both osmotic and electrical changes could act as early cues of injury acting at a tissue-wide scale. In <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (clawed frog) and <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (zebrafish) larvae, the wound response is inhibited when the composition of the external medium resembles that of interstitial fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fuchigami et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gault et al., 2014</xref>), but this observation alone cannot distinguish between osmotic and electrical mechanisms. Crucially, the osmotic and electrical mechanisms for sensing tissue damage are physically intertwined, and it is unclear how each signal distinctly contributes to the wound response in aqueous environments.</p><p>Regarding osmotic cues, in zebrafish epidermal cells, cell swelling due to osmotic shock following injury has been shown to provide a physical, cell-autonomous cue of tissue damage, and this cue is amplified and relayed to other cells with subsequent extracellular ATP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gault et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to promoting signaling at the tissue level, osmotic swelling could also mechanically promote migration at the cellular level: hypotonic shock can promote formation of lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2019</xref>) and can intrinsically stabilize a polarized actin cytoskeleton by increasing mechanical feedback through membrane tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Houk et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>A major focus of previous investigations into electrical activity in vivo is the consequence of small electric currents that emanate from tissue for hours and days during development and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferreira et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rajnicek et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robinson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tseng et al., 2010</xref>). Less is known about the possible role of electric fields in guiding cell migration in the early phase of wound healing, within the first few minutes or hours after injury. Electric currents have been directly measured emanating from wounds in many animal tissues in this early phase, including adult zebrafish skin, rat cornea and skin, tails of newt and <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpoles, bronchial epithelia of rhesus macaques, and even human skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferreira et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nawata, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reid et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reid et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reid et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). The currents measured emanating from these wounds are ~10–100 times stronger than regeneration or developmental currents in the same model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferreira et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reid et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robinson, 1983</xref>). In rat cornea, pharmacological perturbations that increase or decrease the magnitude of the wound current also correspondingly increase or decrease the rate of wound closure, suggesting that electrical currents may aid in healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reid et al., 2005</xref>). However, the effect of electrical currents on wound healing in vivo has only been measured at a coarse-grained scale, and it is unclear how electrical fields in vivo affect subcellular dynamics of individual epithelial cells. Furthermore, only a few attempts have been made to apply exogenous electric fields through tissues in living animals to determine directly how electric fields alter cell behavior in vivo, and only on time scales longer than an hour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borgens et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiang et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hotary and Robinson, 1994</xref>).</p><p>The response of cultured cells to applied electric fields has been better studied than responses in vivo, and it has been observed that a wide variety of cell types migrate directionally in the presence of an electric field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Riding and Pullar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, most cells appear to be responsive not to the magnitude of the electric field per se (in V/cm), but rather to the current density in their surroundings (in mA/cm<sup>2</sup>), which is directly proportional to the electric field, scaled by the conductivity of the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2013</xref>). The signaling networks that allow cells to respond to electric fields are still being unraveled, but a prevailing model is that electric fields drag charged membrane proteins to one side of the cell by electrophoresis, with the resulting asymmetric protein distribution leading to cytoskeletal polarization, mediated by key signal transduction factors including phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sarkar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>). The response of cells to electric fields is highly reproducible, allowing precise control of cell movement in culture using only electrical cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zajdel et al., 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, cells respond almost immediately (within seconds or minutes) to electric fields applied in culture, raising the possibility that they could also be responsive to the electric fields generated immediately after wounding in vivo. However, a tractable system in which to observe the rapid response of cells to electric fields in vivo has been lacking.</p><p>Due to their optical transparency and ease of experimental manipulation, zebrafish larvae have been an important model system for understanding the rapid sequence of events following tissue damage, in particular the response of epidermal cells to injury in the tailfin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gault et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mateus et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yoo et al., 2012</xref>). The zebrafish larval epidermis is bilayered, with a superficial cell layer originating from the enveloping layer in early embryogenesis, and a basal cell layer that resides on a collagenous basal lamina and is specified by the <italic>∆Np63</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bakkers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Le Guellec et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rasmussen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sonawane et al., 2005</xref>). Because zebrafish are freshwater organisms, the osmotic gradient across the zebrafish epidermis is large: external culture medium has an osmolarity of about 10 mOsmol/l while the osmolarity of interstitial fluid inside the fish is estimated to be about 270–300 mOsmol/l (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boisen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gault et al., 2014</xref>). This gradient is maintained by a variety of specialized ion-transporting cells known as ionocytes that span across the two epidermal cell layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guh et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previous work in zebrafish has shown that, within seconds after injury, the basal cell layer reacts to tissue damage primarily by active cell migration while the superficial layer reacts by purse string contraction around the wound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gault et al., 2014</xref>). The speed of the wound response in this tissue implies that equally rapid environmental changes must initiate this process. Although osmotic changes have been identified as one wound response cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gault et al., 2014</xref>), osmotic changes alone lack directional information and can only signal to a cell that a wound has occurred, and possibly the distance between that cell and the wound; osmotic cues must be combined with other cues to determine the <italic>direction</italic> of the wound in relation to any individual cell. Electrical perturbations accompanying a drop in external osmotic pressure would in principle provide a natural directional cue to guide cell polarization and migration in the wound response, but the role of electric fields in guiding migration in vivo in the first few minutes after injury has not been explored.</p><p>Here, we focus on the cues that specifically initiate the cell migration behaviors associated with the early wound response in the zebrafish epidermis. Through live imaging of the actin cytoskeleton in basal cells immediately following injury, we observe a range of differences in the initial wound response under different environmental conditions. We report that, in addition to the ‘osmotic surveillance’ mechanism for wound detection previously identified, zebrafish epidermal cells are also sensitive to ion-specific cues following tissue damage, independent of osmolarity and cell swelling. These ion-specific cues are consistent with expected changes in electrical activity at wounds, and in support of this mechanism, we show that electric fields are capable of guiding cells and overriding endogenous wound cues, suggesting that disruption of the electrical properties of tissues may be an important injury signal in the zebrafish epidermis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tissue laceration induces a rapid and coordinated wound response</title><p>A variety of wounding techniques have been used to observe the injury response in the zebrafish tailfin, including tail transection with a scalpel, laser wounding, and burn wounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gault et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miskolci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yoo et al., 2012</xref>). We were specifically interested in the migratory response immediately following tissue damage, and so we developed a wounding technique—which we refer to as tissue laceration—which led to a strong and reproducible early migratory response to injury. In our laceration approach, a glass rod is pulled to a fine point, and the tissue is impaled with this needle at locations dorsal and ventral to the terminus of the notochord.

A direct comparison with tail transection revealed similar spatial patterns of tissue rearrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In timelapse videos of wounds from both techniques, laceration wounds induce a more pronounced migratory response within the first few minutes after wounding, suggesting that laceration wounds may be ideal for studying the early stages of the wound response (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). To determine whether this tissue reorganization was mediated at least in part by actin-based migration of cells in the basal layer, we investigated actin organization during wound closure using a basal cell-specific Gal4 driver fish crossed to a fish expressing LifeAct-EGFP from the UAS promoter.</p><p>Inspection of wound closure at high magnification revealed dynamic cytoskeletal rearrangements accompanying basal cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video3">3</xref>). Prior to wounding, the basal cell F-actin distribution was enriched uniformly around the cell at cell–cell junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, first image). Within two minutes of injury, actin polarized with significant accumulation of LifeAct-labeled filamentous structures on the wound-facing edges of the cell, and the formerly static cell boundary began to rapidly protrude and retract on a sub-minute timescale, reminiscent of actin ruffling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). For cells close to the wound, these dynamic actin-rich ruffles stabilized into lamellipodial sheets that protruded rapidly, causing the cells to elongate and translocate parallel to their long axis. This differs from the behavior of these cells when isolated in culture, where they have been studied extensively for their rapid and persistent migration and are often referred to as keratocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lou et al., 2015</xref>). Isolated migratory basal epidermal cells typically adopt a wider, ‘canoe-shaped’ morphology and move perpendicular to their long axis with protrusions that maintain a persistent shape during migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keren et al., 2008</xref>). In vivo, the polarized actin ruffling response and cell elongation toward the direction of the wound was apparent for basal cells up to several hundred micrometers away, although these distant cells typically did not physically translocate (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video3">Figure 1—video 3</xref>). Following this initial rapidly dynamic wound response, the basal cells retracted their protrusive actin structures and their shapes gradually returned to resemble those of cells in an unwounded larva, though for roughly 30 min post wounding the cell–cell junctions continued to protrude and retract on a small scale. The migratory phase of the wound response process was rapid, with cells polarizing, migrating, and stopping within about 15–20 min after injury.</p><p>To better compare complex migratory behavior among many larvae and across distinct experimental conditions, we measured the local speed of cells in the basal cell monolayer over time. To do this, we developed a velocimetry analysis pipeline based on tracking the movement of many computationally detected feature points (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <italic>Methods</italic>). The speed of these feature points was locally averaged in space and time to reveal the coordinated wave-like propagation of cell speed originating at the wound and traveling away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), consistent with studies of other wound types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gault et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, laceration prompted a stronger cell migration response within the first 5 min of injury compared with tail transection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>)—perhaps due to mechanical differences between the two methods, such as the increased tissue stretch applied with the laceration wound—and the profile of cell speed in space and time was reproducible across larvae despite the variation in the shapes of the laceration-induced wound margins as compared to other wounding protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, line graphs).</p><p>We wondered if laceration might induce transient increases in cytoplasmic calcium concentration, which have been observed with other wounding techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antunes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Enyedi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Razzell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xu and Chisholm, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yoo et al., 2012</xref>). To test this we injected embryos carrying the basal cell Gal4 driver with a <italic>UAS:GCaMP6f-P2A-nls-dTomato</italic> plasmid to express the calcium indicator GCaMP6f and a nuclear-localized dTomato fluorescent protein mosaically in basal cells. Consistent with observations from other model systems and wounding methods, we found intense and rapid propagation of increased calcium levels throughout the tailfin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video4">Figure 1—video 4</xref>). This calcium wave propagated about five times faster than the cell migration wave (200 µm/min vs. 40 µm/min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), implying that there is no uniform time delay between the calcium transient in a cell and the onset of migration. The same trend is observed when directly comparing the average changes in cell migratory speed and in GCaMP6f fluorescence intensity over time, normalized to comparable dimensionless quantities, where the change in GCaMP6f intensity is much faster than the change in cell speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This suggests that cell movement is not directly triggered or regulated by the increase in calcium, though calcium may indirectly promote wound-induced migration by functioning as a permissive cue.</p><p>Taken together, our observations of cell migration following laceration injury demonstrate a stronger migratory response in the first few minutes compared to tail transection, with overall tissue reorganization and calcium dynamics comparable to those induced by other wounding techniques. With the laceration method, we observed prominent actin-rich lamellipodia and waves of calcium and cell migration that propagated outward from the wound site at dramatically different rates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The wound response is sensitive to external sodium chloride, independent of osmolarity</title><p>Next, we sought to determine how different physical cues might initiate the wound response in our laceration injury model. Previous work had shown that the wound response in zebrafish epidermis was inhibited by isosmotic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gault et al., 2014</xref>).

To test this prediction, we compared isosmotic sodium chloride treatment with isosmotic treatments of choline chloride, sodium gluconate, potassium chloride, or sorbitol. We found that, although all isosmotic treatments did reduce average cell speed, sodium chloride had a uniquely strong inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, compare red with other traces; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). In contrast, the degree to which all other osmolytes inhibited a wound response was remarkably consistent with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, compare all other traces).</p><p>To further quantify the multifaceted differences in average migratory cell displacement over time across conditions, we treated each time profile, with 30 samples over 15 min, as a data point in a 30-dimensional space (each timepoint a separate dimension), and used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the major modes of variation among these profiles. We found that over 80% of all variation could be collapsed into two principal components, which roughly corresponded to the overall amplitude of the migratory response (72% of variation) and the timing of the peak of cell movement (9% of variation), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). When the coefficients of each profile in these first two PCA modes were plotted, profiles from unwounded larvae and larvae wounded in hyposmotic medium were situated at extreme ends of the PCA space, profiles from sodium chloride clustered near the profiles from unwounded fish, and profiles from the other isosmotic treatments fell along the continuum between the sodium chloride and the hyposmotic profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The difference in magnitudes of the first principal component between sodium chloride treatment and all other treatments was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001, one-way fixed-effects Welch’s ANOVA F(6, 19)=130.9, with Games-Powell post-hoc tests), while the differences among the other isosmotic treatments were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This quantification emphasized that the unique effect of isosmotic sodium chloride treatment on wound-induced cell migration depended on ionic chemical identity and was distinct from its osmotic effect.</p><p>Looking more closely at the dynamics of the cytoskeleton in the basal cell layer, we noticed that—with the exception of the immediate vicinity around the wound—there was a striking lack of cytoskeletal reorganization in response to wounding in isosmotic sodium chloride (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). In contrast, in all other isosmotic treatment conditions we observed transient polarization of the actin cytoskeleton in cells from the basal layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We quantified this observation by measuring the relative LifeAct intensity change throughout the tailfin. Because cells moved and deformed to different extents during wound closure, we warped images to computationally decouple changes in cell shape from changes in actin intensity, overlaid the cell intensity distributions at each timepoint (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>, and Methods), and measured the relative changes in LifeAct-GFP fluorescence intensity pixel-by-pixel across the whole tailfin over time. We excluded the area approximately one cell diameter away from the wound, which was directly damaged by the laceration and would thus respond differently than cells further away. This analysis revealed that LifeAct intensity increased (often due to formation of lamellipodia) in all isosmotic treatments except sodium chloride, which did not induce any measurable cytoskeletal response at equivalent positions relative to the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This indicates that sodium chloride’s non-osmotic effect on the wound response is associated with inhibiting cytoskeletal polarization.</p><p>It is important to note that all of these experiments were done in the presence of the fish and amphibian anesthetic Tricaine, which is a voltage-gated sodium channel inhibitor and has been shown to inhibit tail regeneration in <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferreira et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tseng et al., 2010</xref>). To rule out a potential effect of Tricaine on the wound response in isosmotic sodium chloride, larvae were immobilized by injection at the one-cell stage with mRNA encoding alpha-bungarotoxin, a component of the venom of the many-banded krait snake <italic>Bungarus multicinctus</italic>, which immobilizes by inhibiting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Swinburne et al., 2015</xref>). Larvae treated with this alternative inhibitor were not fully immobilized, presumably due to mRNA degradation at 3 dpf, but even so the wound response in larvae immobilized by alpha-bungarotoxin in isosmotic sodium chloride was nearly identical to the response of larvae treated with Tricaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), suggesting the specific inhibitory effect of sodium chloride on the wound response is independent of the anesthetic used in the experiments.</p><p>Our findings are also robust to small variations in osmolarity: when solutions were deliberately prepared deviating from each other in osmolarity by 10% we found qualitatively similar responses in terms of migration and actin polarization (data not shown). This suggests that the unique effect of sodium chloride on the wound response is not due to small differences in osmotic strength between solutions with different ionic composition, but rather due to the actual chemical identities of the ions in solution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Wound response is determined by local wound environment</title><p>We next wished to determine whether the salt-specific role of sodium chloride in regulating actin reorganization during the wound response was due to local changes in sodium chloride in the wound vicinity or to global disruption of sodium chloride transport across the epidermis. Given the complex, ionocyte-mediated regulation of sodium chloride transport throughout the larval epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guh et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that immersion of the entire fish in an isosmotic sodium chloride solution globally perturbs extracellular ionic composition throughout the larva. This pre-condition could lead to a general inhibition of a wound response, unrelated to location-specific cues that occur at the broken tissue barrier.</p><p>To distinguish between this global inhibition model and a model of local sodium chloride inhibition, we developed a two-chamber larval incubation device in which the tailfin was immersed in one medium and the rest of the larva in another, with the distinct media compositions maintained by peristaltic flow (see <italic>Methods</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Control experiments using media with different sodium chloride concentrations and a sodium-sensitive fluorescent dye as a reporter of sodium concentration confirmed that a ~tenfold difference in sodium concentration could be maintained between the two chambers for many minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). When the same media was present in both chambers of the device, cell movement in response to a wound was similar to the uniform incubation conditions. When isosmotic sodium chloride media was present on only the tailfin, the wound response was identical to when the entire larva was immersed in that media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, compare red and pink traces). Moreover, when hyposmotic media was present only on the tailfin, the wound response was similar to that observed with uniformly applied hyposmotic media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, compare black and gray traces), suggesting that only the local ionic environment regulates the wound response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Isosmotic solutions cause comparably low cell swelling regardless of composition</title><p>What is it about the chemical composition of these media that cause them to differentially induce actin polarization and cell movement?

For isosmotic media containing sodium chloride or choline chloride, the cellular volume change over this time frame was not statistically significant, nor was the magnitude of volume change in these media statistically distinguishable from that for cells on unwounded fish (p&lt;0.05, two-sided t-tests on the paired average volume difference from each larva). While the increase in volume in both hyposmotic medium and sodium gluconate was statistically significant, the effect size in sodium gluconate was small: the mean paired volume increase between pre- and post-wounding for clusters in sodium gluconate was 0.07 picoliters (pl), while the mean paired volume increase for clusters in hyposmotic media was about 0.40 pl (95% C.I. 0.29–0.59 pl).</p><p>To test whether such slight swelling in isosmotic media other than sodium chloride was sufficient to explain the dramatic increase in actin polarization and migration in those media, we induced a limited degree of swelling in an orthogonal manner, by wounding larvae in intermediate concentrations of sodium chloride, and measured the degree of cell swelling and migration. As the concentration of sodium chloride decreased from isosmotic, we observed more cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), but also more swelling immediately after wounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

To apply an electric field in the skin, we used glass microelectrodes with a combined resistance of 18.5 ± 1.0 MΩ (n = 3, s.e.m.) when filled and immersed in a solution of 135 mM NaCl (chosen to approximate the composition of interstitial fluid). Silver chloride wires inserted into the microelectrodes provided the connection to electrical equipment.</p><p>Keeping in mind that many cells appear to respond to current density rather than electric fields per se (the two are proportional in a medium of a given ionic composition), we aimed to match the current density we applied to the lowest current density that induces a maximal directional response in cultured fish basal epidermal cells—approximately 500 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2013</xref>). A difficulty in comparing our measurements to the applied currents in cell culture experiments is that the cross-sectional area through which the electric field propagates in the larva is not known. An upper bound on this area is the cross-section of the entire larva, which we estimate as approximately 10<sup>−4</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, if current is only flowing through narrow interstitial spaces between epidermal cells, the cross-sectional area could be several orders of magnitude smaller than this, which would yield a larger current density for the same applied current.</p><p>Applying 1 µA of current, and assuming current passes through the total larval cross-section, we obtain a lower bound for the current density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, within the range of the reported measurements of cell sensitivity in cell culture. If the current was restricted to flow through a 0.5 µm-thick region around the edge of the tissue, such as through interstitial spaces within the epidermis, the effective cross-sectional area would decrease by a factor of 50, and the estimated current density would instead be 500 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, still within the range of sensitivity observed in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, we believe that a target current of 1 µA is within a physiological range for cell sensitivity.</p><p>We immersed larvae in hyposmotic medium and then impaled them with two glass microelectrodes connected in series to a variable DC power supply (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). After waiting 10 min for the minor wound response from impalement to subside, we stimulated the larvae with a DC electric field, manually maintaining a current of approximately 1 µA (see <italic>Methods</italic>). We observed that cells situated between the two electrodes rapidly polarized their actin cytoskeletons and migrated in the direction of the cathode, changing direction when the polarity of the electric field was reversed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). The directed movement of cells toward the cathode persisted regardless of whether the cathode was initially at the anterior or posterior electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This suggests that, within the native tissue context, electric fields are sufficient to induce and guide cell migration.</p><p>We next tested whether cues from exogenous electric fields could dominate over endogenous wound cues in vivo. We impaled anesthetized larvae with a single electrode, with the second electrode placed in the media posterior to the tailfin. Immediately after lacerating the tailfin, we turned on the electric field, with the cathode at the anterior electrode, so that the resulting electric field was the opposite polarity as compared to the field expected to be induced by injury. In all larvae tested, cells were dramatically slower in the presence of the exogenous electric field, and some cells even moved away from the wound toward the inserted cathode, which was never observed in unstimulated larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This demonstrates that, in addition to guiding cells in the absence of wound stimuli, exogenous electric fields are sufficient to override the wound response of skin cells in a living animal.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results suggest that there are at least two distinct ways in which epidermal cells detect tissue injury through changes in their external ionic environment. First, mixing of interstitial fluid with dilute external media causes cells to swell, which prompts a migratory response, as has been previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Enyedi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gault et al., 2014</xref>). Second, this fluid mixing specifically reduces the concentration of sodium and chloride ions around cells, which we demonstrated is sufficient to prompt actin polarization in basal epidermal cells near wounds, independent of cell swelling or any change in environmental osmolarity.</p><p>One mechanism for cells to detect wounds that would be consistent with this osmolarity-independent effect of sodium chloride is through direct detection of electric fields arising from ion transport across the epidermis. Epithelial ion transport is critical for aquatic species, which typically live in aqueous solutions of vastly different ion concentrations than their internal interstitial fluid. Sodium and chloride are the predominant ions in both the interstitial fluids and external environments of freshwater fishes, and these ions must be actively and continually absorbed from the environment to counteract leakage through tight junctions and urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirschner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Potts, 1984</xref>). While transport mechanisms for these ions vary across species and environmental conditions, a consistent theme is that transport of sodium and chloride ions may be partially interdependent but are ultimately distinct: for example, the sodium-potassium ATPase can pump sodium ions against their concentration gradients, while chloride ions can be exchanged for bicarbonate ions, the concentration of which is regulated by the actions of carbonic anhydrase and V-ATPase proton pumps that expel excess protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirschner, 2004</xref>). The activity of these various pumps and transporters can lead to charge separation across the epithelium, which manifests as the TEP.</p><p>TEPs have been measured in a variety of freshwater fish species, including trout, goldfish, and killifish, as well as in freshwater invertebrates like crayfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eddy, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kerstetter et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McWilliams and Potts, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wood and Grosell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zare and Greenaway, 1998</xref>). Sodium and chloride transport will be influenced by both concentration gradients and the TEP, and because these are the predominant ionic species, their transport will in turn affect the steady-state value of the TEP. For example, it has been proposed that differential permeability of fish skin to sodium versus chloride would lead to differing transport rates of these ions across the skin, resulting in a so-called ‘diffusion potential,’ which could alter the TEP depending on the concentration of sodium and chloride in the external medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eddy, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McWilliams and Potts, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Potts, 1984</xref>). Such a mechanism suggests that sodium and chloride transport would have a particularly strong influence on the TEP. And as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, when the skin is breached, the established TEP will be short-circuited, leading to electrical potential gradients within the skin, which generate electric fields whose orientation will depend on the relative position of the wound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reid and Zhao, 2014</xref>). Supporting this theoretical rationale for the specific relationship between sodium and chloride transport and the TEP in fish epidermis, the transport of these two ions has been empirically shown to be essential for TEP maintenance other tissues, including rat cornea and amphibian epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dietz et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCaig et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reid et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In light of this plausible connection between electrical signaling and sodium chloride ion transport in fish skin, we have shown that an electric field is sufficient to direct cell movement in vivo in the absence of other wound cues, and can even override endogenous wound cues at the same timescale as the normal wound response. Complementary to our electrical perturbation experiments in vivo, electric currents have been directly measured in the external environment just outside of a wound in several model systems, including ex vivo wounded rat cornea, newt and tadpole tail amputation, and even wounds in human skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferreira et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nawata, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reid et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reid et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reid et al., 2005</xref>). These measurements have all been conducted within a few hours of wounding, which yields much larger current measurements than the small (but measurable) currents that emanate from a wound during regeneration in hours and days following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferreira et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rajnicek et al., 1988</xref>). Paradoxically, these early wound currents fall in the range of 5–500 µA/cm<sup>2</sup>, three orders of magnitude lower than the applied currents that cultured cells can respond to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun et al., 2011</xref>. We believe that the most parsimonious explanation for this discrepancy is that the physiological currents to which cells respond in vivo are restricted to small intercellular spaces, so the effective cross-sectional area through which current passes is small, and the current density within those spaces is large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robinson and Messerli, 2003</xref>). When these currents leave the tissue, they spread over a much larger area, and so the current density measured just outside of a wound will be much smaller than the current density inside the tissue, which cells are actually sensing.</p><p>How might an endogenous electric field be generated in the zebrafish skin? The complexity of ion transport in freshwater fish species—which have evolved elaborate ways to absorb ions from extremely dilute surroundings—poses a challenge to unraveling the molecular mechanism underlying the electrical activity of the zebrafish epidermis. At least five types of ionocytes are responsible for maintaining ion homeostasis in zebrafish, each with a distinct complement of ion pumps, channels, and transporters, coupled by distinct electrochemical gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guh et al., 2015</xref>). The contributions of each of these cell types to electrical activity of the skin has not been explored. Furthermore, traditional pharmacological approaches to dissecting ion transport mechanisms have had mixed success in zebrafish; for example, teleosts do not have a homolog to the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel implicated in establishing the TEP in frog skin, and the channel responsible for sodium uptake from the external environment remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Venkatesh et al., 2007</xref>). Given the genetic tools available in zebrafish, we believe these problems are surmountable, and deserving of further study given our results suggesting a connection between wound healing and epithelial electrophysiology.</p><p>At the cellular level, how might epidermal cells sense electric fields? Our results argue against a model in which this is accomplished primarily through changes in transmembrane potential: treatment of larvae with isotonic KCl elicited a similar wound response to other non-NaCl osmolytes, despite the strong effect KCl generally has on transmembrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In culture, basal epidermal skin cells from fish respond to electric fields through an electrophoretic mechanism, in which an unidentified membrane-bound protein (or proteins) is dragged by electrophoresis to one side of the cell, promoting cytoskeletal polarization and initiation or redirection of motility through a primary PI3K-dependent pathway and secondary myosin II-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). We suspect a similar mechanism is at work for the same cell type in zebrafish in vivo, and the electrophoretic mechanism is compatible with a model in which electric fields flow around cells within the epidermis immediately after wounding. Alternative and additional mechanisms for electric field sensing have been proposed in other cell types, including electrically stimulated calcium influx. Although calcium dynamics are not required for sensing electric fields in cultured fish basal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2009</xref>), it is possible this signaling mechanism may be more relevant within intact tissue in vivo, where large calcium transients are observed immediately following injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>Electric fields are an attractive physical cue for wound detection because they are intrinsically directional, providing a mechanism to rapidly coordinate cell migration toward a wound at the spatial scales of tissue. In contrast, changes in osmolarity and cell swelling do not encode directional information; these cues can initiate a wound response but must be coupled with an additional spatial cue in order to orient cell movement appropriately. Electric currents have been measured emanating from wounds in human skin, and human skin and nasal epithelium both maintain a TEP, suggesting that electric fields may be relevant for wound healing in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Foulds and Barker, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knowles et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reid et al., 2007</xref>). Electric stimulation has been explored numerous times in clinical treatments for wounds and ulcers, but the lack of a detailed understanding of the mechanism by which electric fields influence cell behavior has limited progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gentzkow et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>).

The combined series resistance of both electrodes when immersed in the same solution was ~18.5 ± 1 MΩ (n = 3 independent electrode pairs, s.e.m.). Microelectrodes were connected into an electrical circuit using chlorided silver wires, with a variable DC power supply (PiezoDrive PD-200). Current was measured at 1 Hz sampling rate according to Ohm’s Law, by recording the voltage drop across a 100 kΩ resistor in series with the larva using a multimeter (Fluke 287).</p><p>3 dpf larvae were mounted on 25 mm #1.5 coverslips in an open bath chamber (Warner RC-40LP) and immobilized in E3 + Tricaine containing 1.2% low-melt agarose (Invitrogen). Agarose was removed from above the larvae with a #11 scalpel, leaving a thin layer of agarose surrounding and immobilizing the larva. Electrodes were maneuvered into the larval trunk with micromanipulators (Narishige MN-153). After allowing the skin to recover from impalement for 10 min with the circuit thus connected through the larva, the power supply was turned on.</p><p>Voltage was manually varied to maintain a current of approximately 1 µA; to understand the magnitude of voltage required, we need to understand the three idealized sources of electrical resistance in the setup: the electrodes themselves (R<sub>electrodes</sub>), the resistance of the larval tissue (R<sub>larva</sub>), and the resistance of current that leaks out of the larva and flows through the medium instead, a so-called shunt pathway (R<sub>shunt</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The shunt resistance is difficult to measure, but will increase with decreasing medium conductivity (i.e. a more dilute solution would lead to a higher shunt resistance and more current flowing through the larva). In the following analysis, we assume that the shunt resistance is infinitely large; if instead the shunt resistance were finite, the magnitude of current passing through the larva would be lower than 1 µA.</p><p>The measurement of electrode resistance above (18.5 MΩ) is a lower bound on R<sub>electrodes</sub>, since the conductivity of the 135 mM NaCl solution used for the measurement is high and no resistance arises due to liquid junction potentials, which emerge when electrode and bath solutions have different composition. Once the electrodes were inserted into the larva, the total resistance of the entire circuit was 30.9 ± 8 MΩ (n = 4, s.e.m.). Since the electrodes are being inserted into the interstitial space, in which the dominant ionic species is NaCl, we assume that this is a comparable setup to the reference measurement described above, and therefore infer that the R<sub>larva</sub> is approximately 11 MΩ, smaller than but the same order of magnitude as R<sub>electrodes</sub>. The key upshot of this estimate is that a significant fraction of the applied voltage is actually dropping across the electrodes, and only about 35% of the applied voltage actually drops across the larva itself. In order to maintain a current of 1 µA, we applied voltages of 15–55V in our experiments, which translates to a potential of ~5–20V applied to the skin. The voltage increased over the course of the experiment, as resistance slowly but steadily increased.</p><p>For experiments combining electrical stimulation and wounding, one electrode was inserted into the larva and the other electrode was placed just outside and posterior to the larva. Tissue was lacerated as described above and the circuit was immediately turned on, with current manually maintained at approximately 1.5 µA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Microscopy and image acquisition</title><p>Images were acquired with one of two microscope setups.

A Chroma 535/50 m emission filter was also used for volume measurements and electrical stimulation measurements, where only the green channel of emission light was collected.

The myosin light chain-mApple was ubiquitously expressed, and we observed that only the skin cells migrated in response to wounding. We therefore considered myosin light chain fluorescence originating from tissues <italic>other</italic> than the skin to be stationary, and corrected any drift using this signal as follows. Prior to maximum-intensity projection, the LifeAct intensity was thresholded and used as a mask to set corresponding regions of the myosin z-stack to 0 using custom MATLAB code; following maximum-intensity z-projection, regions in the myosin channel that did not overlap with basal cells were emphasized. These modified z-projections of the myosin channel were manually cropped to select a 512 × 512 pixel region for registration &gt;300 µm away from the wound. These subimages were registered in time with custom Python code by detecting KAZE features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lazebnik et al., 2012</xref>), matching these features between adjacent timepoints, and fitting a Euclidean transform (rotation + translation) to the feature displacement vectors using RANSAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fischler and Bolles, 1981</xref>). The calculated transformations were then converted to the coordinates of the LifeAct image and used to register those z-projections.

Motion was tracked by detecting Shi-Tomasi corner points in each image (typically several thousand points per image) and tracking them from frame to frame using the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lucas and Kanade, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shi and Tomasi, 1994</xref>). These points correspond to areas of strong texture or curvature in the image, which make them straightforward to track. Due to high contrast and detail in the image, a majority of points could be tracked for the entire duration of a timelapse. Velocities could be calculated from the trajectories of these points.</p><p>The observation that most movement in the tailfin was in one primary direction (toward the wound) facilitated summarization of the data obtained from thousands of point tracks. To capture the most relevant tissue movement toward or away from the wound, the wounded region was manually traced, and the line between the centroid of all detected points and the centroid of the wound was computed. The positions of points (either the position in the first frame or the position in each frame) was projected onto this line to obtain a one-dimensional distance from the wound. Points were binned by their 1D coordinate along this line in 10 µm increments, and the average speed (in two dimensions) in each bin was calculated for each time point, providing a measure of velocity in one spatial dimension and time.</p><p>For the two-chamber device experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), drift of the tailfin due to peristaltic flow was not completely removed by the registration algorithm described above.

Subimages of individual cell clusters were manually cropped and deconvolved using the Richardson-Lucy algorithm with 20 iterations in DeconvolutionLab2, a plugin for ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sage et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). A maximum-intensity z-projection of a cell cluster was thresholded to obtain an x-y mask of the cell cluster. To obtain the height of the cell cluster at every other pixel in the x-y mask, the 3D image stack of a cell cluster was smoothed with a 3D gaussian filter and then edges were enhanced with a 3D Sobel filter. Then for a given pixel in the mask, the height was computed by first identifying two peaks in the linescan of fluorescence intensity along the z direction, and then computing the distance between the two peaks. For sub-pixel accuracy in z, the linescans were fitted to gaussians in the vicinity of the peaks. To save on computation time, height was computed at every other pixel. Cell cluster height was spatially smoothed with a 2D median filter and then interpolated to generate a ‘height map', the height of the cell cluster as a function of every pixel in the mask of the cluster. The volume of the cell cluster was obtained by numerically integrating this height map using the function integral2 in MATLAB.</p><p>The volume of each cell cluster over time was manually inspected for large discontinuities, and cell clusters for which the height maps had been obviously miscalculated—apparent by large frame-to-frame variations in cell volume over time, as well as visually obvious discontinuities in the height of the cell—were not included for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical details</title><p>Each zebrafish larva was considered an independent biological replicate; there were no technical replicates in this work.

While electrical fields had been previously noted in vitro, whether they played a role in early wound detection by epithelial cells has been unclear. The authors tracked the ability of epithelial cells to sense direction by imaging actin dynamics in zebrafish epidermis. From these studies, they find that directional sensing depends on the local concentration of specific electrolytes. Additionally, external electric fields can independently stimulate directional migration.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers enjoyed the paper and found that this was an interesting system to analyze the role of electrical fields on wound healing and epithelial cell migration in general. They found the findings well supported and only felt cosmetic changes to the text were needed and a few extra bits of data included. These points were the main points that they wanted to see in the revision, however, I include all their comments for you below this:</p><p>– A more inclusive Introduction stating what was and was not known about electrical fields in wound healing previously.</p><p>– A discussion that touched on possible mechanisms for integrating electrical fields into directional migration. They realize that this is a big ask to address in experiments but it would be useful for further study to set up the narrative.</p><p>– Also, in the Discussion, it would be nice to discuss the magnitude of current and its relevance to physiological occurrence.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Kennard and Theriot reports that electrical cues guide skin cells directional migration in response to injury. The authors bring molecular tools and analysis to study environmental cues, like osmolarity and electric fields in vivo. The effects of electrical cues are most studied in vitro. The in vivo model, the vivo approaches with molecular and imaging techniques bring bioelectricity research closer to mainstream techniques. Demonstrating of direct effect of electrical effects independent of osmolarity represent a significant step in this field. The results demonstrating the effects of NaCl, but not quite a few osmolarity control are impressive. I therefore believe the manuscript will be very interesting to <italic>eLife's</italic> readership.</p><p>I have the following questions and suggestions, which I do not expect the authors to address with new experiments, because as other pioneering research, this manuscript suggests more research questions/directions on the basis that it answers some very important questions. I believe perhaps the authors already have some results to some of those questions.</p><p>1) Good reason for choosing laceration over transection is given. I am a bit puzzled if the EFs and osmolarity are the mechanisms, why there were such difference? The endogenous EFs and osmolarity would be expected to be the same in both the laceration and transection models. Could the laceration stretch the tissue during injury procedure, so the marked increased migration was present in the laceration model? The stretch could activate stretch activated channels, stimulate cells, and realign matrix.</p><p>2) It is not clear what relationship can be established between GCaMP6f response and migration speed (Figure 1E, G, H). inhibition of the calcium response may help to test the relationship.</p><p>3) The local concentration of NaCl showed remarkable inhibitory effects on cell migration, and cell volume. As we know injury may activate channels and pumps, which then facilitate the ionic fluxes, thus generate persistent ionic currents. Channel and pump inhibition experiments could quickly point to some molecular basis of the involvement of NaCl.</p><p>4) I consider using Iso KCl is very interesting, because high K<sup>+</sup> would significantly modulate cell membrane potential, however the effect on cell migration is very similar to those of Iso Choline Cl, iso NaGlunate, Iso Sorbitol. This would provide another side evidence for the role of wound electric fields in cell migration.</p><p>5) 200V DC is much higher than endogenous EFs expected in such a model. Caution should be given when interpreting the results.

Previous work had indicated the presence of electric fields in wounded tissues. But whether these phenomena play a role in early wound detection by epithelial cells has been unclear. The authors use live imaging in zebrafish to track the behaviour of epithelial cells in response to wounds. Imaging of actin dynamics was used as a readout for directional sensing in these cells. The authors show that directional sensing depends on the local concentration of specific electrolytes and that application of external electric fields can stimulate directional migration. These major conclusions are interesting and well supported. Although this is not the first time that electric fields are suggested to play a role, the study offers valuable direct evidence in vivo evidence, and introduces a new system in which the mechanisms can be studied further.</p><p>The study is focused on establishing whether electric fields play a role in wound sensing and does not touch on how these effects are mediated. The experiments were designed to distinguish osmotic from electric effects, establish whether the effects are global or local and assess the direct effects of electric fields on epithelial cell motion. These are significant and do not appear trivial. Nevertheless, some insight, even in the form of discussion, into how these effects might be sensed by epithelial cells seemed to be lacking. At the minimum, the authors could provide ideas based on the literature. Ideally, the study would include an analysis of cytoskeletal rearrangements and calcium dynamics in response to electric fields or alterations of electrolytes for completion. The authors introduce these key readouts of epithelial signalling, but they did not make full use of these in their functional assays. Depending on whether electric fields influence the calcium wave, different mechanistic hypotheses can be made for future studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62386.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers enjoyed the paper and found that this was an interesting system to analyze the role of electrical fields on wound healing and epithelial cell migration in general. They found the findings well supported and only felt cosmetic changes to the text were needed and a few extra bits of data included. These points were the main points that they wanted to see in the revision, however, I include all their comments for you below this:</p><p>– A more inclusive Introduction stating what was and was not known about electrical fields in wound healing previously.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for inviting a more comprehensive treatment of this very interesting literature. We have substantially expanded the section of the Introduction regarding previous work on electric fields, focusing on the most relevant work and highlighting open problems in the field. Upon reflection we believe that this addition substantially improves the clarity of the presentation for most readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– A discussion that touched on possible mechanisms for integrating electrical fields into directional migration. They realize that this is a big ask to address in experiments but it would be useful for further study to set up the narrative.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new text in the Discussion speculating on the molecular mechanisms establishing electric fields in vivo (including some current challenges to experimentally identifying these mechanisms) as well as the mechanisms by which individual cells sense electric fields.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Also, in the Discussion, it would be nice to discuss the magnitude of current and its relevance to physiological occurrence.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded our discussion of the magnitude of electric fields employed in this study in three parts of the manuscript: in the Results pertaining to Figure 4, in which we have included more details on our electrical setup and the choice of field strength, supported by a newly added figure supplement to Figure 4; in the Discussion, where we compare the magnitude of the applied fields in this work to the magnitude of endogenous wound currents reported in the literature; and in the Materials and methods, where we include some more technical analysis of the sources of resistance in our electrical setup.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] I have the following questions and suggestions, which I do not expect the authors to address with new experiments, because as other pioneering research, this manuscript suggests more research questions/directions on the basis that it answers some very important questions. I believe perhaps the authors already have some results to some of those questions.</p><p>1) Good reason for choosing laceration over transection is given. I am a bit puzzled if the EFs and osmolarity are the mechanisms, why there were such difference? The endogenous EFs and osmolarity would be expected to be the same in both the laceration and transection models. Could the laceration stretch the tissue during injury procedure, so the marked increased migration was present in the laceration model? The stretch could activate stretch activated channels, stimulate cells, and realign matrix.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point, and the additional possibilities the reviewer raises are indeed worth mentioning. We have added text to the appropriate section of the Results mentioning these possibilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not clear what relationship can be established between GCaMP6f response and migration speed (Figure 1E, G, H). inhibition of the calcium response may help to test the relationship.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an interesting experiment. An analogous experiment with nls-GCaMP6s expressed in all cells in 3 dpf zebrafish larvae has been performed in isotonic sodium chloride (Enyedi et al., 2016), showing that this particular ionic environment inhibited the calcium flickers occurring &gt;1 min after wounding, but not the initial calcium burst propagating through the tissue. It is not known how a different osmolyte might affect these results.</p><p>While perturbing the calcium response would be useful for clarifying the role of calcium transients and cell migration, the primary focus of the calcium imaging in this work was to compare the laceration technique to other previously established work (e.g. Enyedi et al., 2016; Yoo et al., 2012). As such, we believe the inhibition of the calcium response would be quite interesting but beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The local concentration of NaCl showed remarkable inhibitory effects on cell migration, and cell volume. As we know injury may activate channels and pumps, which then facilitate the ionic fluxes, thus generate persistent ionic currents. Channel and pump inhibition experiments could quickly point to some molecular basis of the involvement of NaCl.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer bringing up this issue. We have tried several of the obvious candidates—the sodium-potassium pump inhibitor ouabain, the V-ATPase pump inhibitor Bafilomycin A, and the sodium ionophore monensin—but our efforts were inconclusive. Teleosts do not have a homolog to the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (Venkatesh et al., 2007), so this other obvious candidate inhibitor was a dead-end. For completeness we did try the amiloride analog benzamil, but did not observe any effect.</p><p>We were most interested in determining if we could inhibit wound healing in hypotonic solutions or relieve the inhibition of the wound response in Iso NaCl, but we observed neither effect with these drug treatments. Without a direct measurement of the transepithelial potential in untreated and drug-treated larvae, we believe it is difficult to rationalize any effect—or lack thereof—in the context of our model. We think this makes measuring the transepithelial potential the most critical next step in this research area (see our response to point 6 below). Another complicating factor is that the physiology of ion transport in freshwater fish skin and gills is complex and incompletely understood (see for example Guh et al., 2015). There are at least 5 different types of ion-transporting cells in the epidermis, each with their own repertoire of ion channels and pumps. We do not know how each of these cell types contributes to the TEP, how the activity of any of these cells might be altered by tissue injury, or if ion-transport by non-professional ion transporting cells may become relevant during wound healing. This complexity makes it non-trivial to design a targeted screen for drugs that might affect TEP in zebrafish, while an exhaustive screen was beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I consider using Iso KCl is very interesting, because high K<sup>+</sup> would significantly modulate cell membrane potential, however the effect on cell migration is very similar to those of Iso Choline Cl, iso NaGlunate, Iso Sorbitol. This would provide another side evidence for the role of wound electric fields in cell migration.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the interest in this experiment and we have emphasized the possible effect of KCl on membrane potential in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) 200V DC is much higher than endogenous EFs expected in such a model. Caution should be given when interpreting the results. I also wonder whether the authors attempted experiments (Figure 4B, C) using wounded animals, perhaps the tissues after injury are not technically plausible (too fragmented) for such experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our lack of clarity on this point. The illustration in Figure 4 showed the maximum possible voltage of our power supply (200V), not the maximum voltage applied in any experiment—the latter is much more relevant. We have amended the figure to include the maximum voltage we used, which was 55V. However, we believe the most relevant metric for this cell type is not the electric field per se (in V/cm) but rather the current density experienced by cells within the tissue. We have added text in the Results and Materials and methods section in which we explicitly compare our measurements to the electrical sensitivities of stimulated cells in culture as well as new text to the Discussion comparing to the measurements of electrical currents emanating from wounds in vivo. In that text we argue for the physiological relevance of our electric perturbations.</p><p>We have indeed tried the experiment of applying electric fields to wounded animals, and by placing the cathode opposite the direction of the wound we could cause cells to slow their migration to the wound or even reverse direction. The results are in Figure 4F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) One assumption in the paper is the TEP and wound EFs in vivo. Glass microelectrodes may be able to verify those in space and time. If this works (the TEP and wound EFs can be mapped), the effects of various treatments can be tested and exclude other possibilities.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fantastic idea. Inspired by work in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (Ferreira et al., 2016), we attempted to conduct similar measurements in the zebrafish epidermis, but were ultimately unsuccessful. Although we verified we could successfully place electrodes within the epidermis, we were unable to achieve consistent TEP readings from day to day.</p><p>One difficulty with these measurements compared to prior work is that zebrafish larvae are about half the size of <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpoles at a similar stage (~3mm vs. 7mm in their longest dimension, and other dimensions are also proportionally smaller). Histology also suggests that there is very little space between the epidermis and other structures in zebrafish, while SEM of <italic>Xenopus</italic> larvae indicates an appreciable interstitial space below the epidermis into which an electrode may be reliably inserted without measuring other potentials (Hotary and Robinson, 1994). Another challenge is that ideally these experiments should be conducted in a hypotonic medium, to measure the TEP in as close to unperturbed conditions as possible, and determine how the TEP depends on the external ionic conditions. However, this presents unavoidable difficulties related to making electrophysiological measurements in dilute solutions. Notably, the liquid junction potential that arises from changing the local environment around the electrode tip from dilute freshwater to salty interstitial fluid is hard to correct for and can substantially bias the results, especially if the true TEP is a similar order of magnitude to the junction potential. We hope that our work inspires professional electrophysiologists to attempt these measurements in the future!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I enjoyed the manuscript.

We have substantially revised the Introduction and Discussion to compare this work to other work in the field and how our work adds to the work that has already been done. We are encouraged that the reviewer agrees that establishing zebrafish as a promising model organism for bioelectric study is itself an important contribution, and we further argue that it is especially useful for probing a gap in the literature concerning the cytoskeletal response to electric fields in vivo, due to the relative ease of directly imaging changes in actin organization inside of epidermal cells at very high spatial resolution in these living animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] The study is focused on establishing whether electric fields play a role in wound sensing and does not touch on how these effects are mediated.

We do demonstrate actin polarization in the presence of an electric field (Figure 4C), but our current data (taken at 10X magnification) is not of sufficient resolution to conduct a similar analysis of actin reorganization to that shown in Figure 2E. We hope that further data collected at higher magnification should be able to address this point.</p><p>The interplay between calcium and electric fields is also an interesting possibility. Calcium dynamics are not required for the response of fish basal epidermal cells to electric fields in culture, suggesting that the temporal coincidence between these two events in vivo may not be significant (Allen et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2009). We have included this information in the Discussion for further context.</p></body></sub-article></article>
