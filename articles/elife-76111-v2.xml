reward-predicting cues and both neuromodulators are thought to regulate each other. While this co-regulation has been studied using stimulation studies, the existence of this mutual regulation in vivo during natural behavior is still largely unexplored. One long-standing controversy has been whether striatal DA is responsible for the induction of the cholinergic pause or whether DA D2 receptors (D2Rs) modulate a pause that is induced by other mechanisms. Here, we used genetically encoded sensors in combination with pharmacological and genetic inactivation of D2Rs from cholinergic interneurons (CINs) to simultaneously measure ACh and DA levels after CIN D2R inactivation in mice. We found that CIN D2Rs are not necessary for the initiation of cue-induced decrease in ACh levels. Rather, they prolong the duration of the decrease and inhibit ACh rebound levels. Notably, the change in cue-evoked ACh levels is not associated with altered cue-evoked DA release. Moreover, D2R inactivation strongly decreased the temporal correlation between DA and ACh signals not only at cue presentation but also during the intertrial interval pointing to a general mechanism by which D2Rs coordinate both signals. At the behavioral level D2R antagonism increased the latency to lever press, which was not observed in CIN-selective D2R knock out mice. Press latency correlated with the cue-evoked decrease in ACh levels and artificial inhibition of CINs revealed that longer inhibition shortens the latency to press compared to shorter inhibition. This supports a role of the ACh signal and it’s regulation by D2Rs in the motivation to initiate actions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuromodulation</kwd><kwd>circuit</kwd><kwd>motivation</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>acetylcholine</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F99/K00 D-SPAN NS120642</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martyniuk</surname><given-names>Kelly M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH124858</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kellendonk</surname><given-names>Christoph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH093672</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kellendonk</surname><given-names>Christoph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Individual Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Torres-Herraez</surname><given-names>Arturo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pharmacological and genetic studies in the mouse reveal how dopamine D2 receptors on cholinergic interneurons regulate cue-evoked changes in the levels of striatal acetylcholine and dopamine during behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dopamine (DA) plays a key role in learning, serving as a teaching signal that reflects reward prediction error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Day et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nasser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>). This teaching function is encoded in the phasic bursting of DA neurons, which induces a rapid but transient increase of extracellular DA. DA is initially released in response to an unpredicted reward, but with learning the response shifts away from the reward outcome toward reward-predicting cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schultz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Like DA neurons, cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in rodents and their presumed counterparts, ‘tonically active neurons’ (TANs), in primates modulate their activity in response to reward-predicting cues and salient outcomes. CINs represent about 1–2% of the neurons in the striatum and regulate mental processes including reinforcement learning, action selection, associative learning, and cognitive flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bradfield et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joshua et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matamales et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maurice et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okada et al., 2014</xref>). Pharmacogenetic inhibition of CINs in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) also increases the influence of appetitive cues on instrumental actions pointing to a role of striatal acetylcholine (ACh) in motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Collins et al., 2019</xref>). CINs are tonically active and show a multiphasic response to salient and conditioned stimuli that can include a short excitation followed by a prominent pause and rebound excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aosaki et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aosaki et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Apicella, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Apicella et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Apicella et al., 2011</xref>). This multiphasic response in CIN firing coincides with phasic activation of midbrain DA neurons that terminate in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joshua et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schultz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>). Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that DA and ACh regulate each other within the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cachope and Cheer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cachope et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chuhma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cragg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Helseth et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kharkwal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Straub et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sulzer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yan and Surmeier, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Here, we will focus on the DA regulation of the multiphasic ACh response. One long-standing discussion in this regard has been whether the cholinergic pause is dependent on DA via DA D2R receptor (D2R) mediated inhibition of CINs. Early evidence that the CIN pause is DA-dependent originate from studies in non-human primates (NHPs). In vivo electrophysiological recordings from TANs have revealed a pronounced pause in firing to a reward-predicting stimulus. This pause was entirely abolished by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine lesions of DA neurons and local administration of a D2R antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aosaki et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watanabe and Kimura, 1998</xref>). Consistent with this, more recent slice physiology studies in rodents have shown that pauses in CIN activity can be induced by local application of DA or DA terminal stimulation, in which both are eliminated by pharmacological blockade of D2Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Augustin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chuhma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Straub et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wieland et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, optogenetic stimulation of NAc DA terminals results in a pause in CIN firing and this pause is prolonged when D2Rs are selectively overexpressed in CINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gallo et al., 2022</xref>). Lastly, pauses generated by DA or local stimulation of the striatum are eliminated in a selective CIN D2 knockout mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Augustin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kharkwal et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, the slice physiology experiments provide evidence that the CIN pause can be induced by DA activation in a CIN D2R-dependent manner while the NHP studies show the necessity for DA and D2Rs for the generation of the pause.</p><p>However, more recent evidence suggests that the CIN pause is not induced by DA but by cortical, thalamic, or long-range GABAergic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cover et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">English et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matsumoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this, stimulation of cortical and thalamic inputs to the striatum in slices or in vivo induces a triphasic cholinergic pause. One model suggests that the cholinergic pause is generated by intrinsic properties of CINs. When CINs come out of the early glutamatergic excitation, voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv7.2/7.3) open and induce an after-hyperpolarization that induces the pause. In this model DA plays a role in augmenting the intrinsically induced pause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this, thalamo-striatal stimulation induced a pause that was shortened but not fully abolished by a D2R antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cover et al., 2019</xref>). However, in earlier influential slice physiology experiments, the pause induced by thalamic stimulation was fully blocked by D2R antagonism suggesting that activation of DA release from intrastriatal DA terminals was responsible for pause generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ding et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>One limitation of the mechanistic studies in rodents has been that they relied on stimulation experiments rather than on DA evoked by natural stimuli. While the early NHP studies suggested necessity for DA in inducing the pause during behavior, these studies lacked the cellular specificity for excluding the possibility that the effects of pharmacological D2R blockage were due to inhibiting D2Rs on CINs vs other neuronal populations.</p><p>Here, we used genetically encoded biosensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Labouesse and Patriarchi, 2021</xref>) to simultaneously monitor DA and ACh in the dorsal striatum during behavior in mice with pharmacological blockade and/or selective ablation of D2Rs from CINs. Using this approach, we addressed the question of whether the natural stimulus-induced pause is fully dependent on DA or not. We first determined whether changes in DA and ACh levels occur simultaneously to reward-predicting stimuli in mice as has been shown in NHPs via electrophysiological recordings of DA and TAN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morris et al., 2004</xref>). In vivo imaging of ACh and DA levels revealed cue-induced decreases in striatal ACh and increases in DA levels, confirming the ability to measure concomitant ACh dips and DA peaks with functional imaging. Using a Pavlovian learning task, we confirmed that both signals co-occur and develop in parallel during the training of the task. Using a simpler reinforcement task that enables better quantification of the neuromodulator signals, we quantified cue-induced changes in DA and ACh changes after manipulating D2R function. We found that selective ablation of D2Rs from CIN or blocking D2Rs in control mice with the selective D2R antagonist eticlopride did not abolish the stimulus-induced decrease in ACh levels. Rather it shortened the duration of the decrease and enhanced ACh rebound levels in a dose-dependent manner. This indicates that DA is necessary for controlling the overall shape of the ACh signal. During simultaneous recordings experiments, the relationship between DA and ACh was strongest in response to reward-predicting cues but still present during the intertrial interval (ITI) supporting a general mechanism by which DA coordinates ACh levels. At the behavioral level, D2R antagonism increased latency to lever press to a reward-paired lever, but this relationship was abolished when we inactivated CIN D2Rs. Moreover, cue-evoked changes in ACh levels correlated with the latency to press, and short artificial inhibition of CINs at lever extension regulated the latency to press. Altogether this supports a role of the cue-induced ACh signal in the motivation to initiate actions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GACh3.0 allows for measuring fast decreases in task-evoked ACh levels</title><p>First, we validated our experimental approach that uses fiber photometry and genetically encoded fluorescent indicators to simultaneously measure DA and ACh levels.

To confirm that the fluorescent indicator, GACh3.0, is measuring changes in ACh levels (and not movement artifacts or electrical noise), we measured the GACh3.0 signal in the presence of 15 mg/kg scopolamine, a muscarinic antagonist, which targets the GACh3.0 parent receptor (M3R). We found that the competitive antagonist scopolamine abolished the early increase and the subsequent decrease in the fluorescent signal, indicating that GACh3.0 indeed quantifies ACh binding and thus surrounding ACh levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>GACh3.0 reliably measures fast decreases in acetylcholine (ACh) during an instrumental task.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the surgery setup.

This has been described at the neuronal level when recording from individual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apicella et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kimura et al., 1984</xref>) but here it is observed at the level of ACh levels released by a population of neurons. While the origin of the between animal variability is unclear, we believe that it is related to the location of recording. Generally, more lateral/dorsal recording location showed an initial peak in ACh levels while more medial/ventral location did not show the initial peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

On day 1 of training, we observed an increase in DA (red) and a decrease in ACh (blue) during unexpected reward following the offset of the CS+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Over training, we saw these changes in both DA and ACh shift to the onset of the CS+ tone, while decreasing to the now expected reward. We did not observe these changes during CS− trials. We then related the changes in DA and ACh to changes in anticipatory head entries during the CS+ as a measure of learning. We found that both DA and ACh signals correlated well with anticipatory head entries in one animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, other mice did not show any anticipatory responding as this task is non-contingent and head poking is not required to obtain the reward during CS+ trials.

Understanding this mechanism is important because both neuromodulators coincidentally signal salient cues or outcomes during learning and motivated behavior and thus DA may regulate behavior via regulating ACh levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apicella et al., 1992</xref>). Moreover, it addresses the long-standing question of whether the ACh decrease is fully dependent on striatal DA.</p><p>By simultaneously recording task-evoked DA and ACh levels in mice we made several observations: first, we observed that changes in striatal DA and ACh levels are induced by reward-predicting stimuli and the time locked signals develop in parallel with learning. Second, we found that pharmacological and genetic inactivation of D2Rs does not completely abolish the stimulus-induced decrease in ACh, but it does shorten the decrease and enhances rebound levels. Third, using correlational analysis, we found a relationship between DA and ACh that was strongest in response to lever extension as a reward-predicting cue but still present during the ITI. This relationship was disrupted by D2R inactivation. Fourth, we found that D2R antagonism increased the latency to lever press during behavior, but this was abolished when we inactivated CIN D2Rs. The size of the cue-evoked decrease in ACh levels correlated with lever press latency. and artificial CIN-inhibition at cue presentation influenced press latency, with longer inhibition leading to shorter press latencies. Altogether, these findings indicate that DA and cholinergic D2Rs are necessary for controlling the shape of the ACh signal and the coordinated activity between DA and ACh. Moreover, the cue-induced changes in ACh levels may have motivational significance by regulating behavioral responding.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cue-induced changes in striatal DA and ACh levels are time locked and develop in parallel with learning</title><p>The changes in DA and ACh levels that we recorded in the Pavlovian conditioning task are consistent with DA neurons and CINs encoding unexpected rewards and reward-predicting cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aosaki et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joshua et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watanabe and Kimura, 1998</xref>). Like these previous studies, that assayed neuronal activity, we see a robust increase in DA levels and a decrease in ACh levels to unexpected reward that diminish as the reward becomes expected. These data show that the neurotransmitter levels of both, DA and ACh, follow neuronal activity of their respective neurons with a sub-second kinetics. The fast induction of the ACh decrease is particularly striking as it suggests fast degradation or diffusion of ACh.</p><p>In addition, we observed similar changes in DA and ACh levels to the conditioned stimulus and not the unconditioned stimulus, which occur in parallel over learning. This is consistent with previous studies showing that DA neurons and CINs respond to salient and conditioned stimuli. Moreover, we found that these changes in DA and ACh levels correlate with behavioral responding. However, this correlation was not observed in all tested mice due to the nature of the Pavlovian task. In the Pavlovian task, animals have the possibility to learn an association between the CS+ and reward. Consequently, some animals may show anticipatory responding during the CS+ (head entries into the reward port). However, because anticipatory behavior is not required to obtain a reward, some of the tested mice did not exhibit anticipatory head poking. Strikingly, the development of a DA and ACh signal over time indicate that these animals are nevertheless learning the stimulus-reward association. In conclusion, these data show that co-incident task-evoked changes in ACh and DA levels in mice follow what has been described at the level of neuronal activity level in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joshua et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>D2R inactivation in CINs shortens but does not abolish the cue- induced decrease in ACh levels</title><p>Salient and conditioned stimuli are known to induce pauses in CIN and TAN firing in rodents and primates; however, the dependence on DA and CIN D2Rs for pause induction is widely debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aosaki et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watanabe and Kimura, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang and Cragg, 2017</xref>). Thus, to determine the role D2Rs play in modulating the stimulus induced ACh decrease, we pharmacologically blocked D2Rs or selectively ablated Drd2 from CINs and measured ACh and DA levels in the CRF task. We found that D2R blockade or ablation shortened the decrease in ACh levels, which we quantified by calculating the dip duration. Moreover, in our control mice, D2R blockade also decreased the negative and increased total and rebound AUCs in a dose-dependent manner while the dip amplitude was unaffected. In contrast, D2R blockade had no effect on the stimulus-induced ACh signal in ChATDrd2KO mice. These data reveal that the initiation of the decrease in ACh levels is not dependent on CIN D2Rs. Instead, cholinergic D2Rs are important for modulating the duration of the stimulus-induced ACh decrease. Our data provide clarity on the controversial role that DA plays in the regulation of the ACh decrease and suggest that the stimulus-induced ACh decrease in vivo is not entirely DA or D2R-dependent as studies in primates and slice physiology studies have suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aosaki et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watanabe and Kimura, 1998</xref>). Our data further indicates that slice physiology studies in rodents where optogenetic stimulation of DA terminals or caged DA induced CIN pauses are abolished by D2R antagonists or CIN-selective ChATDrd2KO mice are not fully capturing the physiology underlying the natural pause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Augustin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chuhma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kharkwal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Straub et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wieland et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>DA levels are unaffected in ChATDrd2KO mice</title><p>Slice and in vivo stimulation studies have shown that stimulation of ACh release induces DA release via activation of nicotinic receptors on DA terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cachope and Cheer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cachope et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sulzer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, it is surprising that despite a change in cue-induced ACh signal the cue-induced DA signal is largely unchanged in ChATDrd2KO mice. Especially, we hypothesized that the rebound in ACh levels observed in the ChATDrd2KO mice may enhance or prolong the DA peak, but this was not observed. Moreover, although eticlopride enhanced DA release, this enhancement was measured in wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and ChATDrd2KO mice (data not shown). Since ChATDrd2KO mice do not show the eticlopride-induced rebound in DA levels, we believe that the enhanced initial peak in the eticlopride condition is due to antagonism of D2 auto-receptors on DA terminals. It is unclear why there is no additional effect on DA release as a consequence of the ACh rebound but it could be that under the behavioral conditions of the CRF task nicotinic receptors on DA neurons are desensitized.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>DA and ACh correlation during task-dependent behaviors</title><p>Our approach to simultaneously image both DA and ACh in the same animal allowed us to examine the relationship between these two neuromodulators within trials.

We also found a weaker positive correlation with DA leading ACh that is enhanced by D2R antagonism. We believe that this positive correlation reveals the rebound in ACh activity following the decrease that is blunted by D2R activation at baseline. These data suggest, as discussed above, that CIN D2Rs not only modulate the ACh pause but also the rebound activity.</p><p>Electrical stimulation in brain slices revealed on/off kinetics for dLight1.2 of 9.5 and 90 ms, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Labouesse and Patriarchi, 2021</xref>).

Here, we measured a decrease in striatal ACh levels in vivo with an onset of 206 ms after optogenetic inhibition of CINs. This is significantly shorter than the reported on/off kinetics for the ACh3.0 sensor in brain slices and may be due to a faster clerance of ACh levels in vivo. Nevertheless, it is possible that the lag of the cue-induced decrease in ACh in relationship to the peak in DA is due to differences in the on/off kinetics of the two sensors and not a natural reflection of when both events occur.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Implications for behavior</title><p>In addition to the effects on ACh decrease duration, we found that CIN D2Rs also regulate the magnitude of ACh rebound levels, acting as a mechanism to constrain ACh rebounds after the decrease. Currently, it is unknown which role the rebound in ACh plays during behavior. Generally, CINs are thought to inhibit spiny projections neurons (SPNs) via nicotinic activation of local interneurons or via muscarinic M<sub>2</sub>/M<sub>4</sub>-mediated inhibition of corticostriatal inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">English et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Faust et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pakhotin and Bracci, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Witten et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, a larger decrease may lead to disinhibition and higher rebound to a stronger inhibition of SPNs. The D2R antagonism decreases the first and enhances the second which may inhibit movement initiation leading to the longer latency in lever pressing. Consistent with this, we observed that the size of the cue-induced ACh decrease correlates with press latency (the larger the decrease the shorter the latency). Surprisingly, this relationship also holds true for lever presses that were performed long after the cue-induced ACh signal reverted to normal. To address whether the duration of cue-induced decrease in ACh levels alter press latencies, we used optogenetic tools to artificially induce shorter and longer decreases in ACh at cue presentation. We found that short inhibition of CINs increased press latency compared to long inhibition of CINs. However, the longer inhibition also led to a larger rebound and both changes may be responsible for the change in press latency. Nevertheless, this suggests that the cue-evoked change in ACh levels regulate the motivation to initiate the lever press. This finding is consistent with recent inhibition studies in which CIN inhibition in the NAc during Pavlovian to instrumental transfer enhanced the ability of the Pavlovian cue to invigorate behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Collins et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>What does an altered ACh signal mean for learning? CIN-selective D2R knock out mice learn the Pavlovian task presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> as well as control littermates (data not shown). This suggests that even with an altered ACh signal mice still can learn cue-reward associations. Similarly, we recently described that enhancing the cue-induced decrease in ACh levels by selective overexpression of D2Rs in CINs of the NAc (D2R-OE<sub>NAcChAT</sub> mice) did not affect Pavlovian learning but was associated with a deficit in Go/NoGo learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gallo et al., 2022</xref>). This is consistent with prior studies reporting that striatal ACh is not necessary for initial learning but is important for behavioral performance when task contingencies change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bradfield et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Favier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okada et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Okada et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ragozzino et al., 2009</xref>). Alternatively, the changes in the ACh signal observed in D2R overexpressing mice are responsible for suppressing the inhibitory learning that is required for the acquisition of the NoGo behavior.</p><p>Surprisingly, we did not measure an increase in press latencies in D2R KO mice, despite the shortened dip duration. This discrepancy may be due to compensation in the regulation of press latencies via other mechanisms that have developed during development or as the consequence of the chronic change in D2R levels. Such compensatory mechanisms may not have the time to develop in response to the acute action of the antagonist. Alternatively, the correlation between cue-induced dip duration and press latency could be an epiphenomenon. For example, D2R antagonism may change both, tonic ACh levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ikarashi et al., 1997</xref>) and cue-induced changes in ACh, but it is only the first one that regulates press latencies. The optogenetic inhibition experiment argues otherwise as the short inhibition of CINs increased press latency in comparison to long inhibition of CINs, suggesting that differences in phasic ACh levels are sufficient to regulate motivated behavior. Further investigation is needed to determine whether compensatory mechanisms overcome changes in cue-induced changes in ACh levels in D2R KO mice to normalize motivated behavior.</p><p>In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the stimulus-induced ACh signal is multiphasic, encompassing a DA-dependent and a non-DA-dependent component. Striatal DA is responsible for confining the temporal boundaries of the ACh signal and preventing rebound excitation via CIN D2R. Notably, we also find a positive correlation between the size of the stimulus-induced decrease in ACh levels and behavioral responding, which implicates a role for the cue-induced ACh signal in the motivation to initiate actions. Further dissection of ACh DA co-regulation in the striatum will be essential for a better understanding of how both signals regulate behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">JAX</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. #: 000664</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>ChAT-</italic>IRES-Cre</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rossi et al., 2011</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">JAX stock Cat. #: 031661</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Drd2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bello et al., 2011</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (adeno-associated virus)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AA5-hSYN-dLight1.2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. #: 111,068</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (adeno-associated virus)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AA5-hSYN-ACh3.0</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. #: 121,922</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (adeno-associated virus)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV5-EF1α-DIO- eNpHR3.0</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">UNC Vector Core</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. #: 129,381</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Eticlopride</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tocris</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. #: 1847</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.1, 0.25, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 mg/kg</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Scopolamine</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tocris</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. #: 1414</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">15 mg/kg</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Analysis</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Synapse</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tucker-Davis<break/>Technologies</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Analysis</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MATLAB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MathWorks</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DIO Link (Pavlovian):<break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19586026">10.6084</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19586026">/m9</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19586026">.figshare.19586026</ext-link><break/>DIO Link (CRF):<break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19586032">0.6084</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19586032">/m9</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19586032">.figshare.19586032</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Analysis</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Prism 9</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GraphPad</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult male and female C57BL/6J (JAX stock #000664) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>) were bred in house.

For the optogenetic inhibition experiment, mice were co-injected unilaterally with AA5-hSYN-ACh3.0 and AAV5-EF1α-DIO-eNpHR3.0 (UNC Vector Core) into the DMS. Following virus injection, 400 µm fiber optic cannulas (Doric, Quebec, Canada) were carefully lowered to a depth of –3.0 mm and fixed in place to the skull with dental cement anchored to machine mini-screws. Groups of mice used for experiments were housed in a counterbalanced fashion that accounted for sex, age, and home cage origin. Cannula-implanted mice began behavioral training 4 weeks after surgery. At the end of experiments, animals were perfused, and brains were processed post hoc to validate virus expression and optic fiber location as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gallo et al., 2022</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In vivo fiber photometry and optogenetics</title><p>Fiber photometry equipment was set up using two 4-channel LED driver (Doric) connected to two sets of a 405 and a 465 nm LEDs (Doric, cLED_405, and cLED_465). The 405 nm LEDs were passed through 405–410 nm bandpass filters, while the 465 nm LEDs were passed through a 460–490 nm GFP excitation filters using two 6-port Doric minicubes. A 405 and 465 LEDs were then coupled to a dichroic mirror to split excitation and emission lights. Two low-autofluorescence patch cords (400 µm/0.48 NA, Doric) arising from the two minicubes were attached to the cannulas on the mouse’s head and used to collect fluorescence emissions. These signals were filtered through 500–540 nm GFP emission filters via the same minicubes coupled to photodetectors (Doric, gain set to DC low). Signals were sinusoidally modulated, using Synapse software and RZ5P Multi I/O Processors (Tucker-Davis Technologies), at 210 and 330 Hz (405 and 465 nm, respectively) to allow for low-pass filtering at 3 Hz via a lock-in amplification detector. 405 and 465 nm power at the patch cord were set to 30 µW or below. For acute optogenetic inhibition via eNpHR3.0, amber light (595 nm LED, Doric) was applied through the same optic fiber using a short and long optogenetic protocol: (i) 500 ms square pulses at 1 mW + 1 s ramp down and (ii) 500 ms + 3 s ramp down. The 595 nm light was passed through a 580–680 F2 port (photodetector removed) of the same 6-port minicube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pisansky et al., 2019</xref>). Optogenetic inhibition was performed in the home cage or during lever extension in a subset of trials in the CRF task.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Photometry data processing</title><p>All photometry and behavioral data utilized custom in-house MATLAB analysis scripts. Photometry signals were analyzed as time-locked events aligned to the lever extension (CRF) or tone onset (Pavlovian) of each trial. The 405 nm channel was used to control for potential noise/movement artifacts and the 465 nm channel was used to detect the conformational modulation of either the GACh3.0 sensor by ACh or the dLight1.2 sensor by DA. Both demodulated signals were extracted as a 15 s window surrounding the event, which was denoted as time = 0. Both the signals were down sampled by a factor of 10 using a moving window mean. The change in fluorescence, ∆F/F (%), was defined as (F-F0)/F0 × 100, where F represents the fluorescent signal (465 nm) at each time point. F0 was calculated by applying a least-squares linear fit to the 405 nm signal to align with the 465 nm signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Calipari et al., 2016</xref>). To normalize signals across animals and sessions, we calculated a local baseline fluorescence value for each trial using the average of the 5 s period preceding the event and subtracted that from the signal. The daily average GACh3.0 and dLight1.2 traces were calculated using session average traces from individual mice. ACh dip and DA peak amplitudes were calculated as the maximal change of the signal that was at least 1 or 2 STD below or above the local baseline, respectively. ACh dip duration was calculated using the last and the first zero crossings preceding and following the decrease in ACh levels. Total AUC was calculated as the area of all the three components of the ACh signal (initial peak, decrease, and rebound). Negative AUC was calculated as the area for only the negative component. Rebound AUC was calculated as the area of the positive component immediately following the decrease in ACh levels. The AUC analysis was restricted to a 5 s time window following the task event. Individual CRF trial (∆F/F [%]) traces were used for correlation analysis for CRF trials. For the ITI correlation, we examined any interaction between dLight1.2 and GACh3.0 regardless of event size during the variable 40 s of the ITI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Operant apparatus</title><p>Four operant chambers (model Env-307w; Med-Associates, St. Albans, VT) equipped with liquid dippers were used. Each chamber was in a light- and sound-attenuating cabinet equipped with an exhaust fan, which provided 72 dB background white noise in the chamber. The dimensions of the experimental chamber interior were 22 × 18  ×  13 cm, with flooring consisting of metal rods placed 0.87 cm apart. A feeder trough was centered on one wall of the chamber. An infrared photocell detector was used to record head entries into the trough. Raising of the dipper inside the trough delivered a drop of evaporated milk reward. A retractable lever was mounted on the same wall as the feeder trough, 5 cm away. A house light located on the wall opposite to trough illuminated the chamber throughout all sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Dipper training</title><p>Four weeks after surgery, mice underwent operant training. Mice were weighed daily and food restricted to 85–90% of baseline weight; water was available ad libitum. In the first training session, 20 dipper presentations were separated by a variable ITI and ended after 20 rewards were earned or after 30 min had elapsed, whichever occurred first. Criterion consisted of the mouse making head entries during 20 dipper presentations in one session. In the second training session, criterion was achieved when mice made head entries during 30 of 30 dipper presentations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Pavlovian conditioning</title><p>Mice were trained for 16 consecutive days in a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm, which consisted of 12 conditioned stimulus-positive (CS+) trials and 12 unconditioned stimulus-negative (CS−) trials occurring in a pseudorandom order. Each trial consisted of an 80 dB auditory cue presentation for 10 s of an 8 kHz tone or white noise (counterbalanced between mice) and after cue offset a milk reward was delivered only in CS+ trials, whereas no reward was delivered in CS− trials. There was a 100 s variable ITI, drawn from an exponential distribution of times. Head entries in the food port were recorded throughout the session, and anticipatory head entries during the presentation of the cue were considered the conditioned response. Anticipatory responding was calculated as the difference in nose poking during the CS+ quintile with the maximum response (Q4 or 5) and the first quintile.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>CRF schedule</title><p>For lever press training, lever presses were reinforced on a CRF schedule.

Sessions were repeated daily until mice achieved 60 reinforcements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data analysis</title><p>To determine the sample size for detecting whether D2R antagonism alters the cue-evoked change in ACh levels we performed a power analysis on the first cohort of wild-type mice using total AUC from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> as the outcome measure. The analysis was performed in Gpower using the repeated measures, within factors ANOVA power analysis. In the first step, we calculated a partial eta square using F*df_effect/(F*df_effect + df_error) which then was used to calculate the effects size f. A non-sphericity correction epsilon was calculated in Prism GraphPad to quantify how variances differ between different repeated measures. A correlation matrix between repeated measures was used to determine the average correlation between repeated measures. Based on this we calculated for AUC (eta square: 0.681, effect size f: 1.46, alpha: 0.05, power: 0.8, repeated measures: 6, corr among repeated measures: –0.068, and non-sphericity correction: 0.3193) a sample size of n=5. A similar analysis for press latency (input: eta square: 0.620, effect size f: 1.28, alpha: 0.05, power: 0.8, repeated measures: 6, corr among repeated measures: 0.1294, and non-sphericity correction: 0.278) revealed a sample size of n=5. Expecting similar effect sizes in follow up experiments we aimed for a sample size of 5 mice per group when analyzing the CIN-selective D2R KO mice and their littermate controls. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad), MATLAB (MathWorks). Data are generally expressed as mean ± SEM. Paired and unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-tests were used to compare 2-group data, as appropriate. Multiple comparisons were evaluated by one- or two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni’s post hoc test, when appropriate. In rare cases of values missing in repeated measures samples, the data were analyzed by fitting a mixed effects model, as implemented by Prism 9. Photometry correlation analyses were performed using Pearson’s correlation coefficients. We used a variance explained statistical analysis (R<sup>2</sup>) to determine the % of variance in our correlation analyses (e.g. a correlation of 0.5 means 0.5<sup>2</sup> × 100 = 25% of the variance in Y is ‘explained’ or predicted by the X variable). When comparing correlation values, Fisher’s transformation was used to convert Pearson correlation coefficients to z-scores. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Both male and female mice were analyzed; however, the sample sizes were not powered for analyzing sex differences. Investigators were blinded to the genotype of mice during behavioral assays as well as throughout the data analysis.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Margaret Rice (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. In your response to review please address each of the following essential points as well as the points raised by the reviewers in both their public and 'for authors' comments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please use the word &quot;decrease&quot; instead of &quot;dip&quot; throughout the manuscript. A &quot;dip&quot; reflects a decrease in ACh release and consequently detected ACh concentration. It is not the phenomenon that causes a change in behavior per se, as stated (e.g., li. 151).</p><p>2) Please provide the relative response times of sensors used for ACh and DA (and how this was assessed), as identical response (kinetic) parameters are essential for the temporal conclusions made, especially since the measurements were obtained in different locations.</p><p>3) It is unclear why there is a decrease in ACh in panel 1D but not 1C? Both responses are said to have been recorded at the time of level extension.</p><p>4) The use of scopolamine blocks detection of whatever the sensor is detecting; it does not alter ambient ACh levels, please modify the text accordingly (li. 320-325).</p><p>5) Local increases in ACh release regulate local DA release – rather than the apparent assumption of the authors that the increase in DA signal comes solely from increased activity of distal DA neurons. In support of this, some of the records (e.g., Figure 1D) show an increase in ACh levels before the larger decrease seen, although this is not seen in all instances (Figure 1C). Also, there was no change in dopamine release following CIN-D2 KO (Figure S3), despite a change in ACh release. Please explain why changes in ACh release did not affect dopamine release? This converse interaction (ACh promoting DA release) is not discussed, but addressing it would contribute to the on-going debate about local release processes vs. DA neurons firing rate in governing striatal DA release during behavior and strengthen the report.</p><p>6) It appears from figure 10 that ChATDrd2KO mice exhibit no change in press latency compared to controls. If no clear behavioral change occurs following CIN-D2 KO, the relevance of changes in ACh release are limited and may be more of an epiphenomenon. Please clarify.</p><p>7) Much of the analysis focuses on trials with press latencies &gt; 2s. However, these results may be confounded by a change in trial number due to the pharmacological action of D2 receptor manipulation. This needs to be addressed with appropriate controls, which the authors should have.</p><p>8) The authors observe differences in Pearson's r between groups (Figures8 and 10 for example), but this difference is never statistically compared. Notably, the statistical analysis should use Fisher's r to z transformation because correlation coefficients are not an appropriate distribution for ANOVAs.</p><p>9)Please include a key resource table if you have not already done so.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This report addresses a long-standing question, which is the extent to which the cholinergic &quot;pause&quot; is due to D2 dopamine (DA) receptor activation on cholinergic interneurons (ChIs). Most of the studies, including pharmacological blockade of D2 receptors, and, more importantly, selective deletion of D2 receptors in ChIs. The paper convincingly shows that D2 receptors regulate the duration of the reward- or cue-associated decrease in ACh levels monitored with a genetically encoded sensor, and that this regulation contributes to the latency to press a level for reward. This is a strong contribution to the literature. But the paper then goes on to examine correlations between DA and ACh levels during various aspects of the behavior. The clarity of this section could be improved. More importantly, there is no consideration of whether ACh might promote DA release at any phase of the behaviors examined. This seems an oversight, that may reflect the authors' perspective that striatal DA release is governed by midbrain DA neuron firing only. Although examining DA and ACh in separate hemispheres may preclude addressing this, evidence may be found in some of the many correlations reported.</p><p>1) Abstract. The word &quot;decrease&quot; would be better than &quot;dip&quot; here (and in my opinion, throughout the paper); if used, dip &quot;length&quot; would be better as dip &quot;duration&quot;. Elsewhere, dip is more nearly defined and is OK to use, although it comes across as jargon. A &quot;dip&quot; reflects a decrease in ACh release and consequently detected ACh concentration. It is not the thing that causes a change in behavior per se, as stated (e.g., li. 151).</p><p>2) The relative response times of sensors used for ACh and DA need to be well-described (including how this was assessed), as identical response parameters are essential for the temporal conclusions made, especially since the measurements were in different locations.</p><p>3) Figure 1. Why is there a peak for ACh in 1D but not 1C? Both responses are said to have been recorded at the time of level extension. What was the relative percent of time each pattern was observed in there studies?</p><p>4) Use of scopolamine blocks detection of whatever the sensor is detect; it does not abolish changes in ACh levels (li. 320-325).</p><p>5) Figure 1E. The figure implies that the duration of the observed decrease in ACh levels with level extension lengthens progressively with trial number. However, the legend says that the responses were from a number of trials in a number of mice, and were sorted based on &quot;length of ACh decrease&quot; for 300 trials. In this light, what the panel is supposed to show is not clear.</p><p>6) The figures in which a D2 antagonist is administered should have the drug name included in the x-axis of the related figures, not just the concentration.</p><p>7) 334-335. Certainly, ACh release is regulated by CIN activity, but it seems unlikely that this also controls degradation or diffusion of ACh after release. This needs to be reworded to be accurate.</p><p>8) 589-590. Demonstration of neuronal responses to reward has been reported, so saying that the present data confirm this is overstated. Better would be to say that the results are in keeping with previous studies.</p><p>9) A general omission in the paper is examination of the possibility that local increases in ACh release might regulate local DA release – rather than the apparent assumption of the authors that the increase in DA signal comes only from increased activity of distant DA neurons. In support of this, some of the records (e.g., Figure 1D) show an increase in ACh levels before the larger decrease seen, although this is not seen in all (Figure 1C). This converse interaction (ACh promoting DA release) is not discussed, but addressing it would contribute to the on-going debate about local release processes vs. DA neurons firing rate in governing striatal DA release and strengthen the report.</p><p>10) 688-680. The authors say that a &quot;positive correlation between the size of the stimulus induced ACh dip and behavioral responding, which implicates a role for ACh in motivated behaviors.&quot; However, they show a role for DA acting at D2 receptors in the &quot;dip&quot;, so that it seems equally likely that this observation reflects increased dopamine release and its effects on behavioral responding.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The behavioral relevance of CIN-D2 receptor control of ACh release is not clear.</p><p>a. How did eticlopride or CIN-D2 KO alter press latency, head entry latency, total number of trials completed, etc? It appears from figure 10 that ChATDrd2KO mice exhibit no change in press latency compared to controls. If no clear behavioral change occurs following CIN-D2 KO, the relevance of changes in ACh release are extremely limited and may be nothing more than an epiphenomenon.</p><p>b. Importantly, did these manipulations alter the proportion of trials with press latencies &gt; 2s? Because much of the analysis focuses on trials with press latencies &gt; 2s, results may be confounded by a change in trial number due to D2 receptor manipulation. Please clarify.</p><p>2. Extensive work demonstrates that striatal CINs locally modulate terminal dopamine release. However, there does not appear to be any change in dopamine release following CIN-D2 KO (Figure S3), despite a change in ACh release. Please explain why changes in ACh release did not affect dopamine release?</p><p>3. The authors interpret several comparisons between groups without directly comparing them. For example, in Figure 8, the authors compare the eticlopride effects in Drd2fl/fl and ChATDrd2KO mice and note that the effect is absent in ChATDrd2KO mice. A somewhat similar statistical error arises for the data presented in Figure 10. The authors observe differences in Pearson's r between groups, but this difference is never statistically compared. Notable, the statistical analysis should use Fisher's r to z transformation because correlation coefficients are not an appropriate distribution for ANOVAs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Compare the press latency between control and ChAT-Drd2KO mice.</p><p>2. Please show if there is any correlation between ACh AUC and other behavior indexes such as press speed or the time between press and reward licking.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Dopamine D2Rs Coordinate Cue-Evoked Changes in Striatal Acetylcholine Levels&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

In contrast, the kinetics for the ACh3.0 sensor after electrical stimulation were slower with on/off kinetics of 90-105 ms and 0.9-3.7 s, respectively (Jing et al., 2020). Here, we measured a decrease in striatal ACh levels in vivo with an onset of 206 ms after optogenetic inhibition of CINs. While this is significantly shorter than the reported on/off kinetics for the ACh3.0 sensor, it is possible that the lag of the cue induced decrease in ACh in relationship to the peak in DA is due to differences in the on/off kinetics of the two sensors and not a natural reflection of when both events occur.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is unclear why there is a decrease in ACh in panel 1D but not 1C? Both responses are said to have been recorded at the time of level extension.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the reviewer is asking why there is an initial peak in ACh levels in 1D but not 1C. This is a great question, and we don’t really know why this is the case but believe that this could be due to differences in the fiber location. We have observed the peak in some, but not other mice. We found that C57BL/6J had a smaller initial ACh peak compared to Drd2<sup>fl/fl</sup> control and ChATDrd2KO mice, We added a figure to the supplementary figures (Figure 1-S1) showing the optical fiber locations and example traces for individual mice. We found that the optical fibers in C57BL/6J mice were more ventral and medial (Figure 1-S1A), while in the Drd2<sup>fl/fl</sup> (Figure 1-S1B) and ChATDrd2KO (Figure 1-S1C) they were slightly more dorsal and lateral. Therefore, the ACh initial peak may be due to location of where we were recording ACh levels.</p><p>We added the following paragraph to the result section (line 184):</p><p>“Variability between animals:</p><p>While analyzing the ACh signals we found that some mice showed an initial peak in ACh levels while other did not. This has been described at the level of neuronal when recording from individual neurons (Apicella et al., 1997; Kimura et al., 1984) but here it is observed at the level of ACh levels released by a population of neurons. While the origin of the between animal variability is unclear, we believe that it is related to the location of recording. Generally, more lateral/dorsal recording location showed an initial peak in ACh levels while more medial/ventral location did not show the initial peak (Figure 1-S1). The origin for this variability should be addressed in a more systemic way in the future.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The use of scopolamine blocks detection of whatever the sensor is detecting; it does not alter ambient ACh levels, please modify the text accordingly (li. 320-325).</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the text to reflect that scopolamine is blocking what the sensor is detecting (Line 168).</p><p>“We found that the competitive antagonist scopolamine abolished the early increase and the subsequent decrease in the fluorescent signal, indicating that GACh3.0 indeed quantifies ACh binding and thus surrounding ACh levels (Figure 1D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Local increases in ACh release regulate local DA release – rather than the apparent assumption of the authors that the increase in DA signal comes solely from increased activity of distal DA neurons. In support of this, some of the records (e.g., Figure 1D) show an increase in ACh levels before the larger decrease seen, although this is not seen in all instances (Figure 1C). Also, there was no change in dopamine release following CIN-D2 KO (Figure S3), despite a change in ACh release. Please explain why changes in ACh release did not affect dopamine release? This converse interaction (ACh promoting DA release) is not discussed, but addressing it would contribute to the on-going debate about local release processes vs. DA neurons firing rate in governing striatal DA release during behavior and strengthen the report.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point, and we added a paragraph in the discussion addressing this point (Line 469):</p><p>“Slice and in vivo stimulation studies have shown that stimulation of ACh release induces DA release via activation of nicotinic receptors on DA terminals (Cachope and Cheer, 2014; Cachope et al., 2012; Sulzer et al., 2016; Threlfell et al., 2012). Thus, it is surprising that despite a change in cue induced ACh signal the cue-induced DA signal is largely unchanged. Especially, we hypothesized that the rebound in ACh levels observed in the eticlopride conditions may enhance or prolong the DA peak. Although the early induction of the DA peak is indeed enhanced in the eticlopride condition this is also observed in CIN-selective D2R KO mice. We believe that the enhanced initial peak in the eticlopride condition is due to antagonism of D2 auto receptors on DA terminals. It is unclear why there is no additional effect on DA release as a consequence of the ACh rebound but it could be that under the behavioral conditions of the CRF task nicotinic receptors on DA neurons are desensitized.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It appears from figure 10 that ChATDrd2KO mice exhibit no change in press latency compared to controls. If no clear behavioral change occurs following CIN-D2 KO, the relevance of changes in ACh release are limited and may be more of an epiphenomenon. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the importance of cue-induced changes in ACh in the regulation of press latencies we inhibited CIN-neurons at the time of lever extension. We found that a long inhibition of CINs resulted in a decreased press latency when compared to a short inhibition CINs. We added this data to the Results section (Figure 11). We added the following paragraph to the Results section (Line 373):</p><p>“ACh decrease duration regulates motivated behavior</p><p>To determine whether ACh decrease duration controls motivated behavior, we expressed GACh3.0 and Cre-dependent eNpHR3.0 in the DMS of ChAT-IRES-Cre mice and trained these mice on the CRF task. After mice achieved criterion performance, we recorded GACh3.0 signals during the CRF task as above. On a subset of trials in each session, we inhibited CINs at lever extension for a short (0.5 s + 1 s ramp down) or long (0.5 s + 3 s ramp down) duration to produce short and long duration decreases in ACh levels (Figure 11A). Consistent with the correlation we observed between ACh decrease size and lever press latency, we found lever press latency was longer during short inhibition trials compared to long inhibition trials (Figure 11B). These data are consistent with the change in cue-induced ACh levels regulating motivated behavior.”</p><p>We added the following paragraph to the discussion (line 517 and 540)</p><p>“To address whether the duration of cue induced decrease in ACh levels alter press latencies, we used optogenetic tools to artificially induce shorter and longer decreases in ACh at cue presentation. We found that short inhibition of CINs increased press latency compared to long inhibition of CINs. However, the longer inhibition also led to a larger rebound and both changes may be responsible for the change in press latency. Nevertheless, this suggests that the cue-evoked change in ACh levels regulate the motivation to initiate the lever press.”</p><p>“Surprisingly, we did not measure an increase in press latencies in D2R KO mice, despite the shortened dip duration. This discrepancy may be due to compensation in the regulation of press latencies via other mechanisms that have developed during development or as the consequence of the chronic change in D2R levels. Such compensatory mechanisms may not have the time to develop in response to the acute action of the antagonist. Alternatively, the correlation between cue induced dip-duration and press latency could be an epiphenomenon. For example, D2R antagonism may change both, tonic ACh levels (Ikarashi et al., 1997) and cue induced changes in ACh, but it is only the first one that regulates press latencies. The optogenetic inhibition experiment argues otherwise as the short inhibition of CINs increased press latency in comparison to long inhibition of CINs, suggesting that differences in phasic ACh levels are sufficient to regulate motivated behavior. Further investigation is needed to determine whether compensatory mechanisms overcome changes in cue induced changes in ACh levels in D2R KO mice to normalize motivated behavior.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Much of the analysis focuses on trials with press latencies &gt; 2s.

Most of the studies, including pharmacological blockade of D2 receptors, and, more importantly, selective deletion of D2 receptors in ChIs. The paper convincingly shows that D2 receptors regulate the duration of the reward- or cue-associated decrease in ACh levels monitored with a genetically encoded sensor, and that this regulation contributes to the latency to press a level for reward. This is a strong contribution to the literature. But the paper then goes on to examine correlations between DA and ACh levels during various aspects of the behavior. The clarity of this section could be improved. More importantly, there is no consideration of whether ACh might promote DA release at any phase of the behaviors examined. This seems an oversight, that may reflect the authors' perspective that striatal DA release is governed by midbrain DA neuron firing only. Although examining DA and ACh in separate hemispheres may preclude addressing this, evidence may be found in some of the many correlations reported.</p><p>1) Abstract. The word &quot;decrease&quot; would be better than &quot;dip&quot; here (and in my opinion, throughout the paper); if used, dip &quot;length&quot; would be better as dip &quot;duration&quot;. Elsewhere, dip is more nearly defined and is OK to use, although it comes across as jargon. A &quot;dip&quot; reflects a decrease in ACh release and consequently detected ACh concentration. It is not the thing that causes a change in behavior per se, as stated (e.g., li. 151).</p></disp-quote><p>We changed “dip” to “decrease” where necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The relative response times of sensors used for ACh and DA need to be well-described (including how this was assessed), as identical response parameters are essential for the temporal conclusions made, especially since the measurements were in different locations.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to public comment number 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1.

In support of this, some of the records (e.g., Figure 1D) show an increase in ACh levels before the larger decrease seen, although this is not seen in all (Figure 1C). This converse interaction (ACh promoting DA release) is not discussed, but addressing it would contribute to the on-going debate about local release processes vs. DA neurons firing rate in governing striatal DA release and strengthen the report.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to public comment number 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) 688-680. The authors say that a &quot;positive correlation between the size of the stimulus induced ACh dip and behavioral responding, which implicates a role for ACh in motivated behaviors.&quot; However, they show a role for DA acting at D2 receptors in the &quot;dip&quot;, so that it seems equally likely that this observation reflects increased dopamine release and its effects on behavioral responding.</p></disp-quote><p>We quantified DA signal (max peak and AUC) and behavioral responding.
