described in the neocortex, hippocampus, and basolateral amygdala (BLA). AACs selectively innervate glutamatergic projection neurons (PNs) at their axon initial segment (AIS), thus may exert decisive control over PN spiking and regulate PN functional ensembles. However, the brain-wide distribution, synaptic connectivity, and circuit function of AACs remain poorly understood, largely due to the lack of specific and reliable experimental tools. Here, we have established an intersectional genetic strategy that achieves specific and comprehensive targeting of AACs throughout the mouse brain based on their lineage (<italic>Nkx2.1</italic>) and molecular (<italic>Unc5b</italic>, <italic>Pthlh</italic>) markers. We discovered that AACs are deployed across essentially all the pallium-derived brain structures, including not only the dorsal pallium-derived neocortex and medial pallium-derived hippocampal formation, but also the lateral pallium-derived claustrum–insular complex, and the ventral pallium-derived extended amygdaloid complex and olfactory centers. AACs are also abundant in anterior olfactory nucleus, taenia tecta, and lateral septum. AACs show characteristic variations in density across neocortical areas and layers and across subregions of the hippocampal formation. Neocortical AACs comprise multiple laminar subtypes with distinct dendritic and axonal arborization patterns. Retrograde monosynaptic tracing from AACs across neocortical, hippocampal, and BLA regions reveal shared as well as distinct patterns of synaptic input. Specific and comprehensive targeting of AACs facilitates the study of their developmental genetic program and circuit function across brain structures, providing a ground truth platform for understanding the conservation and variation of a bona fide cell type across brain regions and species.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Whether we are memorising facts or reacting to a loud noise, nerve cells in different brain areas must be able to communicate with one another through precise, meaningful signals. Specialized nerve cells known as interneurons act as “traffic lights” to precisely regulate when and where this information flows in neural circuits.</p><p>Axo-axonic cells are a rare type of inhibitory interneuron that are thought to be particularly important for controlling the passage of information between different groups of excitatory neurons. This is because they only connect to one key part of their target cell – the axon-initial segment – where the electrical signals needed for brain communication (known as action potentials) are initiated. Since axo-axonic cells are inhibitory interneurons, this connection effectively allows them to ‘veto’ the generation of these signals at their source.</p><p>Although axo-axonic cells have been identified in three brain regions using traditional anatomical methods, there were no ‘tags’ readily available that can reliably identify them. Therefore, much about these cells remained unknown, including how widespread they are in the mammalian brain. To solve this problem, Raudales et al. investigated which genes are switched on in axo-axonic cells but not in other cells, identifying a unique molecular signature that could be used to mark, record, and manipulate these cells.</p><p>Microscopy imaging of brain tissue from mice in which axo-axonic cells had been identified revealed that they are present in many more brain areas than previously thought, including nearly all regions of the broadly defined cerebral cortex and even the hypothalamus, which controls many innate behaviors. Axo-axonic cells were also ‘wired up’ differently, depending on where they were located; for example, those in brain areas associated with memory and emotions had wider-ranging input connections than other areas.</p><p>The finding of Raudales et al. provide, for the first time, a method to directly track and manipulate axo-axonic cells in the brain. Since dysfunction in axo-axonic cells is also associated with neurological disorders like epilepsy and schizophrenia, gaining an insight into their distribution and connectivity could help to develop better treatments for these conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axo-axonic cell</kwd><kwd>chandelier cell</kwd><kwd>GABAergic interneuron</kwd><kwd>monosynaptic input tracing</kwd><kwd>transgenic animals</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01MH094705-10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Z Josh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01MH109665-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Z Josh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5DP1MH129954-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Z Josh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01MH101214-08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2R01MH108924-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CSHL Robertson</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Z Josh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5F31MH114529-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raudales</surname><given-names>Ricardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009670</institution-id><institution>National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post-doctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paul</surname><given-names>Anirban</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A lineage-based intersectional genetic approach reveals brain-wide distribution and input connectivity of axo-axonic interneuron cells and establishes experimental access to study the circuit function of a ground truth cell type.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The precision of inhibitory control is crucial for regulating information processing and routing in brain circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roux and Buzsáki, 2015</xref>). In the cerebral cortex, inhibitory signaling is mediated by a large array of GABAergic interneurons (INs), which regulate the input and output of glutamatergic projection neurons (PNs), together forming dynamic ensembles of information processing and relay. Cortical INs comprise highly diverse subpopulations distinguished by their anatomical and physiological properties and gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fishell and Kepecs, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang and Paul, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). Recent single-cell RNAseq and computational analyses have delineated the hierarchical tree-like organization of cortical GABAergic neurons from subclasses and supertypes down to transcriptomic subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Callaway et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>). Among these, the axo-axonic cells (AACs), or chandelier cells (ChCs), represent the most distinctive and a bona fide type, as they exclusively innervate the axon initial segments (AIS) of pyramidal neurons (PNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Somogyi, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Somogyi et al., 1982</xref>). Because AIS are the site of action potential initiation and individual AACs innervate hundreds of PNs in their vicinity, AACs are thought to exert decisive control over spike generation in ensembles of PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crick et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Howard et al., 2005</xref>), thereby regulating network operations and information relay. Thus, a more complete understanding of AACs will not only provide key insights into the functional organization of cortical circuits but also facilitate an integrated multi-modal definition of ground truth neuron types, shedding light on the granularity of hierarchical cell-type organization. However, current knowledge on AAC distribution, connectivity, and function remain incomplete, largely due to the lack of reliable experimental tools.</p><p>An ideal genetic tool for studying AACs, or any other bona fide neuron type, would have two important features: specificity (targeting only AACs but no other cells) and comprehensiveness or even completeness (capturing most if not all AACs). Genetic labeling of AACs was first achieved through fate mapping neural progenitors of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) at late embryonic stages using the <italic>Nkx2.1</italic><sup>CreER</sup> mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Taniguchi et al., 2013</xref>). This approach has facilitated analyses of neocortical AAC subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), transcriptome profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paul et al., 2017</xref>), connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2017</xref>), synapse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ishino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tai et al., 2019</xref>), and activity-dependent pruning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; it also enabled a comprehensive fate mapping of AACs across MGE neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>). However, late embryonic induction in <italic>Nkx2.1</italic><sup>CreER</sup> mice is not only cumbersome but also not entirely specific to AACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>), and does not capture all AACs. With the identification of several putative AAC (pACC) molecular markers from scRNAseq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>), several gene-knockin driver lines have been generated, which have facilitated studying AACs. Yet, none of these driver lines have been shown to be specific and comprehensive. For example, the <italic>Vipr2</italic><sup>-Cre</sup> driver captures a subset of neocortical and basolateral amygdala (BLA) AACs, but is not entirely specific in these areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daigle et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakashima et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, our <italic>Unc5b</italic><sup>CreER</sup> line enabled adeno-associated virus (AAV) targeting of hippocampal AACs, but also labels endothelial cells when combined with a reporter line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dudok et al., 2021</xref>). Despite extensive effort to date, no singularly unique molecular marker for AACs has been identified. Indeed, the same is true for most if not all neuronal subtypes of the mammalian brain. Therefore, specific and comprehensive genetic access to ground truth neuron types remains a broad and major challenge in neural circuit studies.</p><p>Here, we leverage lineage origin and molecular markers to establish an intersectional strategy, achieving highly specific and comprehensive targeting of AACs across the mouse brain. We discovered that much beyond the neocortex, hippocampus, and BLA as previously described, AACs are in fact widely distributed across all pallium-derived brain structures and beyond. These include not only the dorsal pallium (dPAL)-derived neocortex and medial pallium (mPAL)-derived hippocampal formation, but also the lateral pallium (lPAL)-derived claustrum–insular complex, the ventral pallium (vPAL)-derived extended amygdaloid complex, and olfactory centers such as piriform cortex. In addition, pAACs are also abundant in anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), taenia tecta (TT) and are also found in the lateral septum and the diencephalic or third-ventricle-derived hypothalamus. The comprehensive labeling of cortical AACs allowed us to quantify their areal, laminar, and axon terminal distribution as well as to describe multiple anatomic subtypes. We further extend our strategy to AAV-based targeting and map synaptic input sources to AACs in sensorimotor cortical areas, hippocampal CA1, and BLA, demonstrating feasibility for functional manipulations. Together, these results provide a brain-wide overview of AACs and their subtype variations and input sources in the cerebral cortex. Precise and comprehensive genetic access to AACs sets the stage for understanding many aspects of their role in circuit development and function across the extended brain regions. This establishes a powerful model system to study the conservation and divergence of a ground truth neuron type across different brain regions toward understanding the principles of cell-type organization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lineage and marker-based intersectional targeting captures AACs across brain regions</title><p>The embryonic subpallium generates GABAergic neurons of the telencephalon, with the MGE giving rise to AACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Taniguchi et al., 2013</xref>) while other progenitor domains, such as the caudal ganglionic eminence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miyoshi et al., 2015</xref>) or preoptic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gelman et al., 2011</xref>) do not. Within the MGE <italic>Nkx2.1</italic> lineage, AACs are generated in two consecutive waves during both early and late neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>), extending our initial report of their birth pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Taniguchi et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, late embryonic induction in the <italic>Nkx2.1</italic><sup>CreER</sup> line only enriches a subset of neocortical AACs and also labels at least two other IN types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>; this strategy also misses AACs in the hippocampus, BLA, and potentially other brain areas that are born earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kelly et al., 2019</xref>).

However, neither by itself is fully specific to AACs: the former also labels endothelial cells and sparse cortical pyramidal neurons (data not shown), and the latter labels a subset of CGE-derived INs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3m–p</xref>).

Indeed, postnatal high-dose TM induction generated dense and highly characteristic AAC labeling patterns throughout the neocortex, hippocampus, and BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–g</xref>). The characteristic chandelier axon arbor morphology with strings of synaptic boutons (cartridges) along the AIS of pyramidal neurons unequivocally indicated their AAC identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>), consistent with our previous high-resolution single-cell AAC imaging and reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, cell labeling extended much beyond these three previously reported structures that contain AACs. As the AAC identity of labeled cell is validated in most but not all these structures, we tentatively call some of these pAACs. Extensive analysis of these brain regions revealed an overarching pattern: AACs and pAACs are abundantly present in essentially all pallium-derived structures and several additional structures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The dPAL-derived structures include the entire neocortex and entorhinal/ectorhinal cortices. The mPAL-derived structures include the entire hippocampal formation. Beyond these previously known structures, pAACs are abundant in lPAL-derived claustrum, insular, and endopiriform dorsal. In addition, the vPAL-derived structures include most of the amygdaloid complex (cortical amygdala, basolateral and basomedial amygdala, and medial amygdala) and extended amygdala (bed nucleus of stria terminalis). Most surprisingly, AACs are highly abundant in a set of olfactory centers including piriform cortex, AON, and TT. Among these, the piriform derives from the vPAL while AON and tenia tecta dorsal (TTd) derive from septum neuroepithelium. Finally, pAACs are found in lateral septum also derived from septum neuroepithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Magno et al., 2022</xref>) and parts of the hypothalamus (derived largely from neuroepithelium of the third ventricle).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Brain-wide distribution pattern of putative axo-axonic cells (AACs).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Developmental origin</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Brain structure</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Evolutionary term</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Validation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dorsal pallium</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Neocortex all cortical areas<break/>entorhinal, perirhinal</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Isocortex</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Yes</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Medial pallium</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hippocampal formation<break/>dentate, CA1, CA2, CA3<break/>subiculum</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Archicortex</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Yes</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lateral pallium</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Claustrum insular endopirifom dorsal</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Not yet</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ventral pallium</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Amygdaloid complex<break/><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>BLA</p></list-item><list-item><p>CoA</p></list-item><list-item><p>MEA</p></list-item><list-item><p>BMA</p></list-item></list>extended amygdala<break/><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>CeA (no AACs found)</p></list-item><list-item><p>BNST (putative cases only)</p></list-item></list>olfactory cortex<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Piriform</p></list-item><list-item><p>Endopiriform ventral [no]</p></list-item></list></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Paleocortex</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Yes</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Septal neuroepithelium</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Lateral and medial septum</p></list-item><list-item><p>Tania tecta</p></list-item><list-item><p>AON</p></list-item></list></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Yes</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hypothalamo-telencephalic prosomere h1/h2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hypothalamus<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Arcuate nucleus</p></list-item><list-item><p>Periventricular hypothalamic nucleus</p></list-item></list></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Not yet</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-93481-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Whole-brain serial two-photon (STP) imaging and reconstruction of <italic>Unc5b</italic><sup>CreER</sup>; <italic>Nkx2.1</italic><sup>Flp</sup>; Ai65.</title><p>Serially reconstructed coronal images of representative dense-labeled <italic>Unc5b</italic><sup>CreER</sup>; <italic>Nkx2.1</italic><sup>Flp</sup>; Ai65 brain imaged by STP microscopy at 50 µm intervals.

Overall AAC density in CA2 was 3- to 4-fold greater than CA1/CA3 and 13-fold greater than dentate gyrus (DG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). As the density of PNs across hippocampal areas is overall similar, this result suggests substantially different AAC–PN innervation ratio and that AACs may exert much denser and likely stronger control of CA2 PNs than CA1/CA3 PNs or DG granule cells.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Distribution and validation of axo-axonic cells (AACs) in hippocampus.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Population labeling of AACs throughout hippocampal compartments by <italic>Unc5b; Nkx2.1</italic> intersection.

Furthermore, the CeM extends rostrally and medially, thereby including the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BST) to form the extended amygdala. Based on developmental origin, connectivity, and gene expression, these groups can be assigned into two large categories: pallium-derived cortex-like structures and subpallium-derived basal ganglia-like structures. The former includes BLA, CoA, BMA, and MeA, while the latter includes CeA and BST. Within the amygdala nuclei, PNs are exclusively glutamatergic in BLA, CoA, BMA, exclusively GABAergic in CeA, and predominantly GABAergic in MeA and BST. In rodents, there is also a population of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons (GLU PNs, derived from third ventricle neuroepithelium) that populates the BST, MeA, and hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">García-Moreno et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huilgol and Tole, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this context, we found AACs or pAACs in all the amygdala nuclei containing GLU PNs, that is except CeA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i–h</xref>).

Here, leveraging an intersectional strategy that integrates lineage and molecular markers, we have achieved near-perfect specificity and near-complete comprehensiveness in targeting a bona fide IN type. This strategy will facilitate studying the connectivity, function, and development of AACs across brain regions, thereby providing a robust experimental platform for integrating multi-modal analysis of a ground truth cell type across brain circuits. Both <italic>Pthlh</italic><sup>Flp</sup>- and <italic>Unc5b</italic><sup>CreER</sup>-mediated intersectional approaches are also useful for studying the development of AACs. We recognize that it is currently not possible to fully assess the ‘completeness’ of AAC targeting; this may require a comparison with complete labeling by anatomical ground truth, such as dense EM reconstruction of all AACs across the brain volume. Another practical drawback of our approach is the requirement of combining three engineered genetic alleles. In this context, the <italic>Unc5b</italic><sup>CreER</sup> line by itself is already useful for AAV-mediated targeting of AACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dudok et al., 2021</xref>). Because most AAVs are neurotrophic, Cre-activated AAVs would bypass endothelial cells to target only AACs in the <italic>Unc5b</italic><sup>CreER</sup> line, even though this approach is not suited to quantify brain-wide AAC patterns. Beyond relying on germline engineering, the recently invented CellREADR technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qian et al., 2022</xref>) will further simplify AAC targeting by identifying an RNA sensor of <italic>Unc5b</italic> mRNA and deliver it with an AAV vector. As <italic>Unc5b</italic> is a conserved AAC marker from rodents to primates including humans, the CellREADR approach may enable genetic access to AACs across mammalian species.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implications of brain-wide AAC distribution pattern</title><p>The initial discovery of neocortical AACs was based on their striking chandelier-like morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Szentágothai, 1975</xref>), reflecting the spatial arrangement of their exclusive synaptic targets – the AIS of cortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Somogyi, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Somogyi et al., 1982</xref>). This defining feature of synapse specificity led to subsequent discoveries of AACs in the hippocampus and BLA. These findings have relied on meticulous efforts of skilled neuroanatomists to correctly identify AACs, mostly post hoc, by synapse specificity at AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bienvenu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Veres et al., 2014</xref>). Since then, it has been widely assumed that AACs are restricted to these brain structures, and likely to the mammalian species. Here, based on developmental lineage and key molecular markers that likely include all AACs, our results reveal a vastly expanded and likely complete brain distribution pattern of AACs. Most importantly, we found that pAACs are deployed to the entire pallium-derived brain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Puelles, 2017</xref>), including not only the dPAL-derived neocortex and mPAL-derived hippocampal formation, but also the lPAL-derived claustrum–insular complex, the vPAL-derived extended amygdaloid complex, piriform cortex, and other olfactory centers such as AON and TT. In addition, subregions of the lateral septum and hypothalamus also contain pAACs. In this context, it is notable that the pallium may have its evolutionary origin in an anterior region of the vertebrate hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Puelles and Rubenstein, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Among the pallium-derived structures, the density of AACs vary substantially within and across regions. For example, within the neocortex, ChCs are highest in perirhinal and lowest in retrosplenial cortex. Across cortical layers, AACs are highly concentrated in L2, enriched in L5/6, and significantly less abundant in middle layers. Consistent with these results, the number and density of GABAergic synapses at AIS also vary substantially among different PyNs within and across cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeFelipe et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fish et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2021</xref>). Similar variations are seen across the hippocampal formation, where CA2 exhibit the highest and DG the lowest density. It is also possible that these regional differences might reflect the distinction of PN types and/or their inherent physiological and connectivity properties that might require different levels and ratio of AAC control.</p><p>In particular, the finding of a striking abundance of AACs in olfactory centers across piriform cortex, AON, and TT suggests strong inhibitory regulation of PNs at AIS in these regions. Although the functional significance is not yet clear, the simpler circuit architecture and strong link to innate rodent behaviors of these olfactory centers may facilitate uncovering the logic of AAC function. Furthermore, as these olfactory circuits are evolutionarily preserved across vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zeppilli et al., 2023</xref>), our finding raises the possibility that AACs might be present in the CNS of other vertebrates, beyond the mammalian brain.</p><p>Notably, although the MeA and BST comprise mostly GABAergic neurons that are primarily generated from the subpallium, they contain subsets of glutamatergic PN that migrate from pallium origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beyeler and Dabrowska, 2020</xref>) or from the third ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">García-Moreno et al., 2010</xref>). The true AAC identity in these regions, and in several other regions such as the hypothalamus, remains to be validated by synapse innervation at AIS of GLU PNs. Nevertheless, based on current results, our overarching hypothesis is that AACs are deployed across all pallium-derived structures to control the AIS of GLU PNs, including those in MeA and BST. Our results also indicate that AACs are absent from the rest of the CNS. This finding suggests a major distinction between the physiology and functional organization of pallium-derived GLU PNs versus those in other CNS regions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>AACs as a model for understanding neuronal cell-type organization across regions and species</title><p>The rapid scaling of single-cell RNA sequencing enables the generation of massive transcriptome datasets across brain regions and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakken et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hain et al., 2022</xref>). These datasets provide unprecedented opportunities to discover the organization and relationship of cell types within and across brain regions, which reflect their gene regulatory programs and developmental origin. Cross species analyses promise to further reveal the evolutionary conservation and divergence of brain cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakken et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tosches, 2021</xref>). However, transcriptomic cell homologies between brain regions and species, especially more distantly related regions and species, are often discernible only at a relatively coarse level and do not fully capture the biological complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tosches, 2021</xref>). A major challenge is to evaluate statistically defined transcriptomic similarity against biological ground truth, such as anatomic connectivity and developmental relationship. In this context, the most appealing attribute of AACs is their singularly defining synapse specificity at AIS of GLU PNs, which can be readily measured and validated. Under this overarching connectivity-based definition, all other molecular and phenotypic variations can be assessed and organized accordingly regardless of brain regions and species. Therefore, genetic access to AACs across brain regions provides a rare and compelling ground truth platform that can unambiguously identify this cell type across regions and species. This will further facilitate transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to discover the gene regulatory program of AACs and contribute to understanding the principles of cell-type organization by linking developmental genetic program, circuit connectivity and function, and evolutionary trajectory.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Samples post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehye (PFA) at 4°C were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution in RNAse-free diethyl pyrocarbonate-PBS (DEPC-PBS) at 4°C for 48 hr, frozen in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (Sakura), and stored at −80°C until sectioning. 50 µm thick coronal floating sections were collected into a sterile 24-well plate in DEPC-PBS, fixed again briefly for 5 min in 4% PFA, then placed in 70% EtOH in DEPC-PBS overnight. Sections were rinsed in DEPC-PBS, incubated for 45 min in 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in DEPC-PBS, rinsed and incubated in 2× sodium chloride-sodium citrate buffer (SSCT), pre-incubated in HCR hybridization buffer at 37°C, and then placed in HCR hybridization buffer containing RNA probes overnight at 37°C. The next day, sections were rinsed 4 × 15 min at 37°C in HCR probe wash buffer, rinsed with 2× SSCT, pre-incubated with HCR amplification buffer, then incubated in HCR amplification buffer containing HCR amplifiers at room temperature for ~24 hr. On the final day, sections were rinsed in 2× SSCT, rinsed again with 2× SSCT, then mounted on slides and coverslipped with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Microcopy and image analysis</title><p>Confocal imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM 780 (CSHL St. Giles Advanced Microscopy Center) using ×10, ×20, or ×63 objectives.

For AAVDJ-TRE3g-eGFP only eGFP was cloned. AAVs serotype DJ were packaged by a commercial vector core facility (Vigene). Genomic titers of AAVDJ-TRE3g-TVA-oG-eGFP and AAVDJ-TRE3g-eGFP were 9.24 × 10<sup>12</sup> and 5.0×10<sup>12</sup> gc/ml, respectively. TVA, oG, and eGFP were subcloned from AAV-hSyn-FLEX-TVA-P2A-EGFP-2A-oG (Addgene, Cat# 85225). AAVs were diluted 1:5 in 1× PBS immediately prior to use.

Analgesics ketoprofen (5  mg/kg) and dexamethasone (0.5  mg/kg) were administered subcutaneously just prior to sugery, while lidocaine (2–4 mg/kg) was applied intra-inciscionally. Mice were mounted on a stereotaxic headframe (Kopf Instruments, 940 series or Leica Biosystems, Angle Two) and stereotactic coordinates identified as follows: (MOs): 2.25 mm anterior to bregma, 1.2 mm lateral, 0.3 mm in depth; (MOp): 0.5 mm anterior to bregma, 1.6 mm lateral, 0.3 mm in depth; (SSp): 1.12 mm posterior to bregma, 3.25 mm lateral, 0.3 mm in depth; (CA1): 1.94 mm posterior to bregma, 1.4 mm lateral, 1.4 mm in depth; (BLA): 1.9 mm posterior to bregma, 3.38 mm lateral, 4.76 mm in depth. An incision was made over the scalp, a small burr hole drilled in the skull and brain surface exposed. A pulled glass pipette with a tip of 20–30  µm containing virus was lowered into the brain. Virus was delivered at a rate of 30 nl/min using a Picospritzer (General Valve Corp) for a total volume of 100–150 nl for starter AAV and 300–400 nl for rabies virus. The pipette remained in place for 10 min prior to retraction to prevent backflow, after which the incision was closed with 5/0 nylon suture thread (Ethilon Nylon Suture Ethicon) or Tissueglue (3M Vetbond). Mice were kept warm on a heating pad until complete recovery.

Perfused and post-fixed brains were embedded in 4% oxidized-agarose in 0.05 M phosphate buffer (PB), cross-linked in 0.2% sodium borohydrate solution (in 0.05 M sodium borate buffer, pH 9.0–9.5). The entire brain was imaged coronally with a 20×Olympus XLUMPLFLN20XW lens (NA 1.0) on a TissueCyte 1000 (Tissuevision) with a Chameleon Ultrafast-2 Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent). EGFP/EYFP or tdTomato/dsRedXpress signals were excited at 910 or 920  nm, respectively. Whole-brain image sets were acquired as series of 12 (<italic>x</italic>) × 16 (<italic>y</italic>) tiles with 1 µm × 1 µm sampling for 230–270 z sections with a 50-µm z-step size. Images were collected by two PMTs (PMT, Hamamatsu, R3896), for signal and autofluorescent background, using a 560-nm dichroic mirror (Chroma, T560LPXR) and band-pass filters (Semrock FF01-680/SP-25). The image tiles were corrected to remove illumination artifacts along the edges and stitched as a grid sequence. Image processing was completed using ImageJ/FIJI and Adobe/Photoshop software with linear level and nonlinear curve adjustments applied only to entire images. Registration of brain-wide datasets to the Allen reference Common Coordinate Framework version 3 (CCFv3) was performed by 3D affine registration followed by a 3D B-spline registration using Elastix software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klein et al., 2010</xref>), according to established parameters. Prior to STP analysis, datasets were screened for standard quality control according to pre-established criteria. Somata labeled by Ai65-tdtomato or rabies-dsRedXpress and catridges labeled by synaptotagmin-EGFP were automatically detected by a convolutional network trained as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ragan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matho et al., 2021</xref>). For AAC laminar depth, somata and cartridge coordinates were overlaid on a mask for relative cortical depth, as described. For area cell density and cortical depth analysis, we registered each dataset, reporting cells detected in each brain structure without warping the imaging channel. For rabies input tracing experiments, only inputs originating outside the ARAv3 area injected were plotted (i.e. only long-range inputs).

The investigators have been successful in providing the most complete description of the regional distribution of putative (pAACs) throughout the brain to date. The supporting evidence is convincing, and the findings should serve as a guide for more detailed studies of AACs within each brain region and lead to new insights into their connectivity and functional organization of this important group of GABAergic interneurons.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study has numerous strengths. A major strength is the development of a unique intersectional genetic strategy that uses cell lineage (Nkx2.1) and molecular (Unc5b or Pthlh) markers to identify AACs specifically and, apparently, nearly completely throughout the mouse brain. While AACs have been described previously in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and amygdala, there has been no specific genetic marker that selectively identifies all AACs in these regions.</p><p>Importantly, the current genetic strategy labels pAACs in additional brain regions, including the claustrum-insular complex, extended amygdala, and several olfactory centers in which AACs have not been previously recognized. In general, the findings provide support for the specificity of the methods for targeting AACs and include several examples of labeling near markers of axon initial segments, providing validation of their AAC identity.</p><p>The descriptions and numerous low magnification images of the brain provide a roadmap for subsequent, detailed studies of AACs in numerous brain regions. The overview and summaries of the findings in the Abstract, Introduction and Discussion are particularly clear and helpful in placing the extensive regional descriptions of AACs in context.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Considering the unique and striking characteristics of AACs, it would have been ideal to include a clear, high resolution confocal image of an AAC from the Unc5b;Nkx2.1 mouse that would display the beauty of these cells with their numerous cartridges of axon terminals, emanating from a single AAC. While several cells are illustrated, the processes are often obscured by other labeling or the background created by the blue Dapi labeling. A high-resolution image of an isolated cell would not only support the identity of the cells as AACs but also demonstrate the potential advantages of their labeling for more detailed anatomical and neurophysiological studies. High magnification views of the axon terminals adjacent to AnkG-labeled axon initial segments are included and provide strong support for the identity of the cells. However, they cannot convey the extensiveness and patterns of the axonal arborizations of these cells.</p><p>The intersectional genetic methods included use of the lineage marker Nkx2.1 with either Unc5b or Pthlh as the molecular marker. As described, the mice with intersectional targeting of Nkx2.1 and Unc5b appear to show the most specific brain-wide labeling for AACs, and the majority of the descriptions are from these mice. The targeting with Nkx2.1 and Pthlh is less convincing and there appears to be a disconnect between the descriptions and the images. While the descriptions emphasize that the labeling is very similar in the two types of mice, the images suggest distinct differences, including labeling of non AACs in striatum and layer 4 of the cortex in the Pthlh;Nkx2.1 mouse, as described in the manuscript. In addition, the Pthlh;Nkx2.1 mouse has higher cell targeting in some regions and fewer labeled cells in others. Perhaps it would be more accurate to present the Pthlh;Nkx2.1 mouse as differing from the Unc5b;Nkx2.1 mouse, but useful for AAC labeling in select regions and under some conditions, such as following tamoxifen administration at specific ages. As currently presented, the inclusion of the Pthlh;Nkx2.1 detracts from the otherwise convincing argument that the Unc5b;Nkx2.1 mouse provides a specific and comprehensive way to identify AACs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93481.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Raudales et al. aimed at providing an insight into the brain-wide distribution and synaptic connectivity of bona fide GABAergic inhibitory interneuron subtypes focusing on the axo-axonic cell (AAC), one of the most distinctive interneuron subtypes, which innervates the axon initial segments of glutamatergic projection neurons.

These AACs possess unique morphological and connectivity features, making them an ideal subject for studying various aspects of cell types across different experimental methods. To achieve both specificity and comprehensiveness in AAC labeling, the authors employ an intersectional strategy that combines lineage origin and molecular markers. This approach successfully targets AACs across the mouse brain and reveals their widespread distribution in various brain structures beyond the previously known regions. Additionally, the authors utilize rabies transneuronal labeling to provide a comprehensive overview of AACs, their variations, and input sources throughout the brain. This experimental approach offers a powerful model system for investigating the role of AACs in circuit development and function across diverse brain regions.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Genetic Tools and Specificity: The authors' genetic tools show qualitative evidence of specificity for AACs, opening new avenues for targeted research on these cells. The use of intersectional strategies enhances the precision of AAC labeling.</p><p>Widespread Distribution: The study significantly broadens our understanding of AAC distribution, revealing their presence in brain regions beyond what was previously documented. This expanded knowledge is a valuable contribution to the field.</p><p>Transneuronal Labeling: The inclusion of rabies transneuronal labeling provides a comprehensive view of AACs, their variations, and input sources, allowing for a more holistic understanding of their role in neural circuits.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Quantitative Analysis: While the claim of specificity appears qualitatively convincing, the manuscript could be improved with more quantitative analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad that the reviewers appreciated our multimodal and brain-wide characterizations of the AAC population. We include many qualitative AAC examples and would like to highlight the quantitative nature of our whole brain cell body and cartridge analyses, made possible by transgenic targeting and our serial two-photon tomography imaging platform (STP). In addition to providing this brain wide AAC atlas, we also propose AACs as perhaps one of the best case examples for a bona fide cell type, which may inspire further in-depth anatomical and functional studies of AACs, and efforts to capture other ground truth cell types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comprehensiveness Claim: The assertion of comprehensiveness, implying labeling &quot;almost all&quot; AACs in all brain regions, is challenging to substantiate conclusively. Acknowledging the limitations of proving complete comprehensiveness and discussing them in the discussion section would be more appropriate than asserting it in the results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have revised the results and discussion sections accordingly. The issue of how to access comprehensiveness in AAC labeling is a fair and important point, as dense brain-wide AAC labeling has not been achieved and assessed before. Previous studies had used less efficient and specific methods for capturing AACs, primarily in select areas of cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. These AAC populations are recapitulated by our genetic strategies with higher density and specificity. It does not seem that we have missed any previously-reported AAC populations; in fact, we discovered multiple previously unreported populations. Another evidence supporting our “comprehensive” labeling of AACs is that two independent <italic>Unc5b</italic> and <italic>Pthlh</italic> transgenic strategies showed very similar AAC distribution patterns (Fig. 1 Suppl. 3). However, we recognize that probably the only way to fully assess “completeness” of labeling may be to compare with anatomical ground truth, such as by dense EM reconstruction of all AACs across the brain volume. This is currently not technically possible but may become feasible in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Local Inputs: While the manuscript focuses on inter-areal inputs to AACs, it would benefit from exploring local inputs as well. Identifying the local neurons that target AACs and analyzing their patterns could provide valuable insights into AAC function within specific brain regions.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion. However, our serial two-photon tomography imaging platform does not have the capability for reliably preserving tissue sections for immunohistochemical processing afterward. Additionally, though our starter AAV injections were limited to 100-150nL, there were far too many input cells labelled at the injection side to resolve individual input cells and correlate with their synaptic partners (e.g. a rabies-labelled pyramidal cell within the injection site may still project to starter cell few hundred microns away). Thus, our rabies input mapping was best suited for characterizing long-range inputs and was the focus here. For studying local inputs to AACs, future studies could combine very dilute starter AAV injections with multi-marker characterization of cell types by immunohistochemistry or FISH.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion Focus: The discussion section should delve deeper into the biological implications of the findings, moving beyond technical significance. Exploring similarities and differences in input patterns between AACs and other cell types, and linking them to the locations of starter cells or specific connectivity patterns in the brain, would enrich the discussion. For instance, investigating whether input patterns can be predicted based on the locations of starter cells or connectivity specificity could provide valuable insights.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have expanded the discussion to include more on the relevance and implications of our input mapping results to different starter populations of AACs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The goals of this study were to develop a genetic approach that would specifically and comprehensively target axo-axonic cells (AACs) throughout the brain and then to describe the patterns and characteristics of the targeted AACs in multiple, selected brain regions. The investigators have been successful in providing the most complete description of the regional distribution of putative (pAACs) throughout the brain to date. The supporting evidence is convincing, even though incomplete in some brain regions. The findings should serve as a guide for more detailed studies of AACs within each brain region and lead to new insights into the connectivity and functional organization of this important group of GABAergic interneurons.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study has numerous strengths. A major strength is the development of a unique intersectional genetic strategy that uses cell lineage (Nkx2.1) and molecular (Unc5b or Pthlh) markers to identify axo-axonic AACs specifically and, apparently, nearly completely throughout the mouse brain. While AACs have been described previously in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, there has been no specific genetic marker that selectively identifies all AACs in these regions.</p><p>The current genetic strategy has labeled pAACs in a large number of additional brain regions, including the claustrum-insular complex, extended amygdala, and several olfactory centers. In general, the findings provide support for the specificity of the methods for targeting AACs, and include some examples of labeling near markers of axon initial segments. However, the Investigators are careful to refer to labeled neurons as &quot;putative AACs&quot; as they have not been fully characterized and their identity verified.</p><p>The descriptions and numerous low-magnification images of the brain provide a roadmap for subsequent, detailed studies of AACs in numerous brain regions. The overview and summaries of the findings in the Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion are particularly clear and helpful in placing the extensive regional descriptions of AACs in context.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>One weakness of the study is the lack of an illustration of the high-resolution cell labeling that can be achieved with the methods, including labeling of numerous rows of axon terminals in contact with axon initial segments. The initial images of the brain-wide distribution of putative AACs are necessarily presented at low magnification. Although the authors indicate that the cells have &quot;highly characteristic AAC labeling patterns throughout the neocortex, hippocampus and BLA&quot;, these morphological details cannot be visualized by the reader at the current magnification, even when the images are enlarged on the computer screen. Some of the details become evident in later Figures, but an initial illustration of single cell labeling with confocal microscopy, or tracing of their characteristic axonal arbors, would support the specificity of the labeling in the low magnification images.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have now added high-resolution images showing the colocalization of AAC axon boutons (cartridges) along AnkG positive postsynaptic axon initial segments in Fig. 2 Suppl. 1, Figure 1 panels a, d, e, and Fig. 4 panels b, c. These images unequivocally demonstrate AAC identity and specificity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Table 1 indicates that the AAC identity of the cells has been validated in many brain regions but not in all. The methods used for validation have not been described and should be included for completeness. The authors are careful to acknowledge that labeled cells in some regions have not been validated and refer to such cells as pAACs.</p></disp-quote><p>Validation was defined by colocalization of RFP-labelled AAC cartridges and AnkryinG or Phospho-IκBα-labelled axon initial segments, imaged by confocal microscopy. We provide high-magnification examples throughout figures 2-6 and supplements. We have also tried to clarify this better in the methods section entitled “Immunohistochemistry.” Putative AAC (pAACs) refers to populations in which relatively few single cell examples of AACs exhibiting co-localized cartridges were found, largely due to the sparsity of the low tamoxifen dosage used (see response above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The intersectional genetic methods included the use of the lineage marker Nkx2.1 with either Unc5b or Pthlh as the molecular marker. As described, the mice with intersectional targeting of Nkx2.1 and Unc5b appear to show the most specific brain-wide labeling for AACs, and the majority of the descriptions are from these mice. The targeting with Nkx2.1 and Pthlh is less convincing. The title for Figure 1 Supplemental Figure 3 suggests a similar AAC distribution in the Pthlh;Nkx2.1 mouse compared to the Unc5b;Nkx2.1 mouse. However, the descriptions of the individual panels suggest a number of inconsistencies and non-AAC labeling. The heavy labeling in the caudate and cells in layer 4 is particularly problematic. Based on the data presented, it appears that heavy labeling achieved in these mice could not be relied on for specific labeling of all AACs, although specific labeling could be achieved under some conditions, such as following tamoxifen administration at select ages.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct about <italic>Pthlh</italic> being less specific for AACs than <italic>Unc5b</italic> when crossed to a constitutive <italic>Nkx2.1</italic> recombinase driver line. <italic>Pthlh</italic>/<italic>Nkx2.1</italic> intersection labeled a set of layer 4 cells in somatosensory cortex and dense cells in striatum, which are clearly not AACs. But these are the only main difference compared to <italic>Unc5b</italic>/<italic>Nkx2.1</italic> intersection. As the reviewer points out, it is only when <italic>Pthlh</italic> is crossed to an inducible <italic>Nkx2.1-CreER</italic> line and induced embryonically with tamoxifen that there is more specific AAC labeling (at least in cortex). We included this data as well as the intersection with <italic>VIP-Cre</italic> in case either of these are useful to researchers studying fate-mapping of AACs or bipolar cell interneurons. We have also revised the title of Fig. 1 Suppl. 3 to better convey this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The methods described for dense labeling and single-cell labeling are described briefly in the methods. Some discussion of the development of the methods would be useful, including how it was determined that methods for heavy labeling identified AACs specifically and completely.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a description on the development of these to the methods section entitled “Animals.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Raudales et al. aimed at providing an insight into the brain-wide distribution and synaptic connectivity of bona fide GABAergic inhibitory interneuron subtypes focusing on the axo-axonic cell (AAC), one of the most distinctive interneuron subtypes, which innervates the axon initial segments of glutamatergic projection neurons. They establish intersectional genetic strategies that enable them to specifically and comprehensively capture AACs based on their lineage (Nkx2.1) and marker expression (Unc5b, Pthlh). They find that AACs are deployed across essentially all the pallium-derived brain structures as well as the anterior olfactory nucleus, taenia tecta, and lateral septum.

Their novel AAC-targeting strategies will facilitate the study of their development and function in different brain regions. The conclusions in this paper are well supported by the data. However, there are a few comments to strengthen this study.</p><p>(1) The definition of putative AAC (pAAC) is unclear and Table 1 may not be accurate. Although the authors find synaptic cartridges of RFP-labeled cells in the claustro-insular complex and the dorsal endopiriform nuclei, they still consider these cells as pAACs (not validated). The authors claim that without examining the presence of synaptic cartridges, RFP-labeled cells in the hypothalamus and the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (BNST) are pAACs while those in the L4 of the somatosensory cortex in Pthlh;Nkx2.1;Ai65 mice are non-AACs. In Table 1, the BNST is supposed to contain AACs (validated), but in the text, the authors claim that RFP-labeled cells in the BNST are pAACs. Could the authors clarify how AACs, pAACs, and non-AACs are defined?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their interest and comments on our work. Please see our response to reviewer 2 for clarification on putative pAACs. Additionally, we have clarified in the methods under “Immunohistochemistry” how we defined AACs, pAAC, and non-AACs. For BNST we did not positively identify more than a few exhibiting overlap with AnkryinG/IκBα, so we currently leave them as pAACs—Table 1 has been corrected to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The intersectional strategies presented in this study could also specifically capture developing AACs. If so, how early are AACs labeled in the brain? It would also be nice if the authors could add a simple schematic like Fig. 1a showing the time course of Pthlh expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting the application of our method in studying AAC development. As the onset of <italic>Unc5b</italic> is in early postnatal time, tamoxifen induction of <italic>Unc5b-CreER</italic> in early postnatal days can enable studies of AAC neurite and synapse development, maturation, and plasticity. Similarly, <italic>Pthlh</italic> expression in the brain is relatively low/absent at P4 and present at P14 and later timepoints. <italic>Pthlh-Flp;Nkx2.1-Cre</italic> intersection can be used to study postnatal AAC development and plasticity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>While the claim of specificity appears qualitatively convincing, additional quantitative analysis would make the authors' claim much stronger. For example in Figure 4 (f-h), where the authors show an overlap of AAC axons with AnkG labeling, there also appears to be a region of AAC axon lacking adjacent AnkG labeling. The author could quantify the fraction of cartridges that overlap with AnkG labeling in different brain regions, potentially stringing their claim that pAACs are AACs as well as providing important documentation of the diversity or homogeneity of compartment targeting across the brain.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned previously, we only performed AnkG co-labeling analysis on low-dose tamoxifen/sparsely labelled samples in which we could readily differentiate individual cells. This was performed on samples with the Ai65 cytoplasmic reporter—for validation purposes we could positively identify co-labelled cartridges, but it would be more difficult to accurately identify any cartridges not co-labeled (since the entire axon was labelled with RFP). For precisely identifying and mapping AAC cartridge locations we found the intersectional synaptophysin-EGFP reporter (Fig. 2k-n) to be a more precise method for specifically labeling the “cartridge” segment of AAC axons. However, we did not try AnkG staining on samples from this reporter line, as they were set aside for STP imaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the claim of comprehensiveness, labeling &quot;almost all&quot; AACs in all brain regions is a high standard and challenging to demonstrate conclusively. The study already significantly expands our understanding of AAC distribution, and the authors might consider discussing the limitations of proving complete comprehensiveness in the discussion rather than claiming it in the results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We again thank the reviewer for this critique. As mentioned above, we have revised the results and discussion sections to better convey this point across.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the manuscript connectivity section primarily focuses on inter-areal inputs to AACs, but it could benefit from exploring local inputs as well. By identifying the local neurons that target AACs, the authors could ask if there is any general property or rule of the local projections to AACs across the brain, or at least within the cortex. Moreover, a clear indication of the injection site would be helpful, particularly in Figure 7, where there seems to be some discrepancy between the histograms and fluorescent images regarding local projections. The histograms of Figure 7, seem to indicate that the local projection to AACs is a small fraction of all the presynaptic neurons, however, the fluorescent image for the SSp seems to suggest otherwise with many fluorescent cells in the injected area.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. Regarding the local inputs in the rabies tracing datasets, it is a limitation (as mentioned above) of our STP platform’s inability to preserve tissue for immunohistochemistry labeling as well as our relatively dense starter cell labeling. Instead, our focus here was on long-range inputs (i.e. outside the ipsilateral ARA area of injection), which was simply not known for these AAC populations. We have revised the Figure 7 legend and added a description in the methods section to more clearly indicate that we only included long-range input projections in the Figure 7 histograms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion, the authors should delve more into the biological implications of their findings rather than solely emphasizing the technical significance. They could explore the similarities and differences in input patterns between AACs and other cell types, potentially linking them to the locations of their starter cells or specific connectivity patterns in the brain. For example, the authors could check if the input patterns could be predicted from the projections to the layers where their starter cells are located (either from an Atlas like the Allen Connectivity Atlas, or from retrograde rabies injections in the same locations). Can the differences between the input patterns to PVC and AAC be predicted for their location versus some specificity of connections?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the extensive comment. We address this point above, and have revised our discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The Figure legends vary in completeness and quality.</p><p>(1) The legend for Figure 1 is very informative, and section e-g serves as a useful guide, as the legend includes the names of the brain regions related to the abbreviations and also indicates the specific panels that show the identified structures. Because of the large number of structures and the number of panels in each Figure, it would be ideal to follow the same pattern in the remaining figures.</p><p>(2) Several edits are needed in the legend for Figure 1 Supplement Figure 1. The descriptions of a-f could be improved by providing general terms to describe the brain regions associated with the latter list of abbreviations (as has been done with the identification of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory centers and their related panels). One suggestion would be to write out insula, claustrum, and endopiriform prior to listing the abbreviations (AI, CLA, EP) (b-c) and adding amygdaloid complex and extended amygdala before the abbreviations (COA, BLA, MeA) (d-f) and (BST) (d).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer, as the suggestion of further expanding the abbreviations is a good one. As such, we have revised/reorganized the anatomical abbreviations in the figure legends for Figure 1 Supplement Figures 1, 2, and 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Descriptions for Panels g-j require editing to link the appropriate panels and the descriptions. Panels for BSTpr appear to be g-h (rather than f-g) and i,j rather than h-i.</p></disp-quote><p>We have fixed this typo in the legend for Figure 1 Supplement Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Descriptions for Panels k-n could be edited to include abbreviations for the identified brain regions. For example, include the abbreviation ARHP after arcuate nuclei and indicate panels m-n (rather than j-l); include PVP after paraventricular and indicate panel n (rather than m); include DMPH after dorsomedial nuclei and indicate k-m (rather than j-l).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion.
