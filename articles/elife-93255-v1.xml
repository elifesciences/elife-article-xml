Rec-Seq isolates key early steps in translation initiation in the absence of all other cellular components and processes. Using this approach, we show that the DEAD-box ATPase Ded1 promotes 48S PIC formation on the start codons of &gt;1000 native mRNAs, most of which have long, structured 5′-untranslated regions (5′UTRs). Remarkably, initiation measured in Rec-Seq was enhanced by Ded1 for most mRNAs previously shown to be highly Ded1-dependent by ribosome profiling of <italic>ded1</italic> mutants in vivo, demonstrating that the core translation functions of the factor are recapitulated in the purified system. Our data do not support a model in which Ded1acts by reducing initiation at alternative start codons in 5′UTRs and instead indicate it functions by directly promoting mRNA recruitment to the 43S PIC and scanning to locate the main start codon. We also provide evidence that eIF4A, another essential DEAD-box initiation factor, is required for efficient PIC assembly on almost all mRNAs, regardless of their structural complexity, in contrast to the preferential stimulation by Ded1 of initiation on mRNAs with long, structured 5′UTRs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>protein synthesis</kwd><kwd>initiation</kwd><kwd>ribosome profiling</kwd><kwd>yeast</kwd><kwd>in vitro</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIAHD008940</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bocetti</surname><given-names>Julie M</given-names></name><name><surname>Lorsch</surname><given-names>Jon R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIAHD001004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hinnebusch</surname><given-names>Alan G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new in vitro approach allows measurement of the efficiency of the early steps of translation initiation on every messenger RNA in yeast simultaneously.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Translation initiation in eukaryotes begins with the assembly of the 43S preinitiation complex (PIC), containing the small (40S) ribosomal subunit bound to the eIF2∙GTP∙Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> ternary complex and several initiation factors (eIFs), including eIF1, eIF1A, eIF5, eIF4B, and eIF3. The 43S PIC binds the 5′ end of m<sup>7</sup>G-capped mRNAs with the assistance of the cap-binding protein complex eIF4F, comprised of cap-binding subunit eIF4E, scaffolding and mRNA-binding subunit eIF4G, and DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A. The resulting 43S∙mRNA complex, or 48S PIC, scans the 5′-untranslated region (5′UTR) for a suitable start codon, whose selection triggers release of most of the initiation factors. Subsequent joining of the large (60S) ribosomal subunit to the 40S∙Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> complex, with the aid of eIF1A and the GTPase factor eIF5B, forms the 80S initiation complex, poised to begin the elongation phase of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The efficiency of translation initiation on specific mRNAs is strongly influenced by the secondary structures in the 5′UTR and the length of the 5′UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niederer et al., 2022</xref>). It is believed that the inhibitory structures in mRNA 5′UTRs are resolved by DEAD/H-box RNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>). However, we and others have demonstrated that eIF4A is required for the efficient recruitment of a variety of mRNAs tested in vitro regardless of their degrees of structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yourik et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this, profiling of translating 80S ribosomes in vivo (Ribo-Seq analysis) in an eIF4A temperature-sensitive yeast mutant (<italic>tif1-ts</italic>) revealed that eIF4A inactivation reduced the relative translation efficiencies of less than 40 mRNAs, despite a strong reduction in bulk polysome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sen et al., 2015</xref>), thus suggesting that the majority of mRNAs have similarly strong requirements for eIF4A in yeast cells. Mammalian eIF4A has been suggested to remodel the 40S subunit to enhance PIC attachment to mRNAs and function beyond its role in RNA unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sokabe and Fraser, 2017</xref>) and might facilitate the threading of the 5′ end of mRNA into the 40S entry channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to eIF4A, inactivation of yeast DEAD-box helicase Ded1 in a cold-sensitive mutant (<italic>ded1-cs</italic>) was found to reduce the relative TEs of more than 1100 mRNAs in Ribo-Seq experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sen et al., 2019</xref>). These Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs displayed a marked tendency for long and structured 5′UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sen et al., 2015</xref>). Profiling of small (40S) ribosomal subunits in the <italic>ded1-cs</italic> mutant provided evidence that Ded1 stimulates the translation of Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs by promoting attachment of 43S PICs to the mRNA 5′ ends or subsequent scanning to the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sen et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, in a purified yeast translation initiation system several mRNAs identified as being hyperdependent on Ded1 in vivo also displayed greater stimulation by Ded1 of 48S PIC assembly than observed for either Ded1-hypodependent mRNAs or variants of the hyperdependent mRNAs lacking their 5′UTR secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that Ded1 is important particularly for stimulating translation of mRNAs that have long, structured 5′UTRs. Several lines of evidence indicate that Ded1 activity on such mRNAs is enhanced by interaction of its N-terminal domain with eIF4A and eIF4E, and of its C-terminal domain with eIF4G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gulay et al., 2020</xref>), indicating functional coupling between eIF4F and Ded1 in 48S PIC assembly. Other evidence suggests that Ded1 broadly promotes scanning through 5′UTRs by blocking initiation at alternative start codons positioned just upstream of secondary structures that are unwound by Ded1 in vivo, thus allowing the scanning PIC to continue downstream to the main start codon of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guenther et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>It appears that Ded1 can regulate translation of mRNAs in vivo in ways ostensibly distinct from its functions in promoting PIC attachment or scanning on structured mRNAs. Ded1 and its mammalian ortholog DDX3 have been implicated in facilitating the joining of the large ribosomal subunit to the 48S PIC after start codon recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geissler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). There is also evidence that Ded1 can repress translation by segregating mRNAs into phase-separated RNA–protein granules, processing bodies (PBs), or stress granules (SGs), during cell stresses. Granule formation in glucose-starved cells is reduced by depletion of Ded1 and is enhanced by Ded1 overexpression or impairment of its ATPase activity in non-starved cells in a manner regulated by regions in the Ded1 NTD and CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beckham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hilliker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hondele et al., 2019</xref>). It was suggested that Ded1 initially forms an inactive complex with eIF4F and mRNA that is stalled at a step upstream of 43S PIC joining and subsequently utilizes ATP hydrolysis to allow progression into the initiation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beckham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hilliker et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Heat-shock also evokes Ded1 sequestration in SGs in a manner antagonized at low temperatures by a polar intrinsically disordered region (IDR) in the Ded1 NTD. Purified Ded1 displayed heat-induced phase separation in vitro that was enhanced by mRNA and the Ded1 CTD but suppressed by the N-terminal IDR. Interestingly, heat-shock preferentially reduced the TEs of mRNAs with structured 5′UTRs and increased their condensation, in a manner modulated by the N-terminal IDR, leading to the model that condensation of Ded1 and associated mRNAs preferentially reduces the translation of Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs with structured 5′UTRs during heat-shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iserman et al., 2020</xref>). Other findings indicate that glucose starvation or heat-shock leads to widespread dissociation of Ded1, eIF4A, and eIF4B from the 5′UTRs of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bresson et al., 2020</xref>), which could underlie reduced translation of Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs that remain soluble in stressed cells. Examining the TE changes conferred by glucose starvation or heat-shock by ribosome profiling suggested that Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs vary greatly in their translational suppression during stress, which might involve a combinatorial effect of impairing eIF4A, eIF4B, and Ded1 function on the most affected subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sen et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that Ded1 has additional functions in the nucleus as it appears to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm and interacts both physically and functionally with the nuclear cap-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Senissar et al., 2014</xref>). Ded1 was also found to co-purify with pre-90S and pre-40S immature ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schäfer et al., 2003</xref>), and thus might function in ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>A difficulty with interpreting the previous ribosome profiling experiments with <italic>ded1</italic> mutations is that the inactivated mutant protein could have had dominant effects rather than simply producing a loss of Ded1 function. For example, in view of evidence that inhibition of Ded1 ATPase activity can lead to the formation of translationally inert mRNP granules, it is possible that the <italic>ded1</italic> mutations in the catalytic domain analyzed by ribosome profiling led to impaired translation of many Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs in non-stressed cells owing to their sequestration with the mutant <italic>ded1</italic> proteins in condensates inaccessible to the initiation machinery. It was also possible that the inactivated mutant proteins bound to mRNAs, the ribosome, or other initiation factors in a manner that inhibited translation. The <italic>ded1</italic> mutations could also indirectly impair translation of Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs by reducing their export from the nucleus, reducing expression of another protein with a role in production or function of the translation initiation machinery, activating stress responses that alter the functions of initiation factors, or eliciting quality control responses that alter the rate of translation elongation. Even wild-type Ded1 could influence translation indirectly by modulating the association of various RNA-binding proteins with mRNAs, a function ascribed to other DEAD-box proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Linder and Jankowsky, 2011</xref>). As noted above, we demonstrated that several mRNAs that were found to be Ded1-hyperdependent in vivo displayed a greater stimulation of 48S PIC assembly by Ded1 compared to several in vivo hypodependent mRNAs in a fully purified system, confirming a direct role of Ded1 in stimulating initiation on these few mRNAs in the soluble phase in the absence of any other cellular proteins besides ribosomes and canonical initiation factors. However, it was possible that many other mRNAs found to be hyperdependent on Ded1 in vivo are not stimulated directly by Ded1’s ability to resolve secondary structures in 5′UTRs and promote PIC recruitment or scanning to the start codon.</p><p>We have developed an elaboration of the reconstituted yeast translation initiation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acker et al., 2007</xref>) that enables examination of 48S PIC assembly on all native yeast mRNAs simultaneously. This approach, dubbed Recruitment-Sequencing (Rec-Seq), allowed us to measure direct effects of Ded1 on PIC attachment to mRNA and scanning to the start codon in reactions containing only 40S ribosomal subunits, methionyl-initiator tRNA (Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>), GDPNP and ATP, and the core initiation factors. In previous work using the reconstituted yeast initiation system, we found that stable 48S PIC formation on mRNA start codons was strongly dependent on the 5′-cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitchell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yourik et al., 2017</xref>). The cap also prevented off-pathway events and enforced a requirement for the full set of initiation factors to efficiently assemble a 48S PIC. These results indicate that in the reconstituted system 43S PICs are loaded onto the 5′ ends of mRNAs in a cap-dependent manner and that they scan from 5′ to 3′ to locate the start codon.</p><p>Rec-Seq allowed us to isolate the crucial and highly regulated series of events leading up to 48S PIC assembly from all later steps of initiation and elongation. Processes such as mRNA localization and decay and RNA and protein compartmentalization, which can complicate in vivo analyses, likewise do not contribute to the outcome of Rec-Seq experiments. Because we could vary Ded1 concentration in reactions or leave it out entirely, Rec-Seq allowed us to directly interrogate the factor’s role instead of relying on inferences from the effects of <italic>ded1</italic> mutations. Moreover, we could evaluate whether preventing initiation at alternative start codons in 5′UTRs is an important aspect of Ded1 enhancement of PIC assembly at the canonical start codons on Ded1-stimulated transcripts in vitro.</p><p>Our studies indicate that in the Rec-Seq system Ded1 stimulates 48S PIC assembly on ~1000 mRNAs. These Ded1-dependent mRNAs include ~90% of the mRNAs previously found to be hyperdependent on Ded1 in vivo by ribosome profiling of the <italic>ded1-cs</italic> mutant. The fact that addition of Ded1 stimulates 48S PIC assembly on these mRNAs in the reconstituted Rec-Seq system argues against the involvement of other cellular processes or proteins beyond the core initiation machinery in Ded1 function, and the possibility that the in vivo ribosome profiling results were influenced by dominant negative effects of the <italic>ded1-cs</italic> mutation or by altered expression or activity of the translational machinery in the mutant cells. The mRNAs that are strongly dependent on Ded1 in the Rec-Seq system exhibit a high propensity for long and structured 5′UTRs, providing compelling evidence that Ded1 acts directly to stimulate 48S PIC formation by unwinding 5′UTR structures to facilitate mRNA binding to the PIC and scanning to find the start codon. Our results also indicate that alternative initiation at upstream start codons is too infrequent, and the suppression of these events by addition of Ded1 too small, to account for the stimulatory effects of Ded1 on 48S PIC assembly in the reconstituted system. Finally, we show that eIF4A strongly stimulates the formation of 48S PICs on the vast majority of yeast mRNAs, regardless of their 5′UTR length or degree of secondary structure, in contrast to the specificity we observe for Ded1 in stimulating recruitment of mRNAs with long, structured 5′UTRs. These data are consistent with the model that eIF4A plays a general role in facilitating binding of all mRNAs to the 43S PIC, whereas Ded1 unwinds inhibitory secondary structures to promote PIC binding and scanning on mRNAs with structured 5′UTRs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rec-Seq: An in vitro approach to measure 48S PIC formation transcriptome-wide</title><p>We previously developed a fully reconstituted yeast translation initiation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acker et al., 2007</xref>) that allows measurement of stable recruitment of mRNAs to 43S PICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitchell et al., 2010</xref>) to form 48S PICs using defined concentrations of purified components for individual mRNAs. In addition to purified small (40S) ribosomal subunits, reactions include initiation factors eIF1, eIF1A, eIF5, the eIF2∙GTP∙Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> ternary complex (TC, assembled using non-hydrolyzable GDPNP), eIF3, the mRNA-recruitment factors eIF4G∙eIF4E complex, eIF4A and eIF4B, and ATP. In the initial version of this system, we monitored recruitment of a single-capped, radiolabeled, in vitro transcribed mRNA in each reaction. Formation of a stable 48S PIC with the anticodon of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> base paired to the AUG start codon in the mRNA was resolved from free mRNA by native gel electrophoresis and quantified by phosphorimaging of the mRNA. Among other things, this assay has been used to elucidate the molecular roles of eIFs essential for 48S PIC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>); provide evidence that eIF4A is essential for recruitment of various mRNAs to the 43S PIC regardless of the amount of secondary structure in their 5′UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yourik et al., 2017</xref>); and reconstitute the ability of Ded1 to overcome 5′UTR secondary structures found in several Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>). An important limitation of the assay, however, was that only a single mRNA could be examined at a time, and the effects of competition among the many different mRNAs that exist in a cell could not be assessed. In addition, the use of an electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA) limits the analysis to very short native transcripts, for example, <italic>RPL41A</italic> mRNA, or the use of synthetic constructs truncated at their 3′ ends in place of longer, full-length native mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>). Such constructs might not recapitulate functionally important interactions between the 5′UTR and other parts of the mRNA.</p><p>To circumvent these limitations, we modified the system to allow 48S PIC formation on all native mRNAs in the standard yeast transcriptome to be monitored simultaneously using an approach we call Rec-Seq for ‘Recruitment-Sequencing’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In place of a single, radiolabeled mRNA, we used oligo(dT) affinity-purified total mRNA from wild-type yeast cells grown in nutrient-replete conditions. This total polyA(+) mRNA was incubated for various times with pre-assembled 43S PICs, eIF3, eIF4 factors, ATP, and other components (depending on the experiment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The reactions were then treated with RNase I to digest mRNA regions not protected by the ribosomal complex.

The reactions were initiated by adding total polyA(+) mRNA to the preformed 43S complexes and other factors, and then quenched rapidly after 15 min by depleting ATP with addition of a ‘Stop buffer’ containing hexokinase and glucose. We chose 15 min because recruitment has reached its observed endpoint for nearly all mRNAs at this time. The RPFs thus measured give the final distribution of competitive recruitment efficiencies under these experimental conditions, in which there is a twofold excess of total mRNA over 43S PICs.

Groups of ~1000 transcripts among the 3052 for which Rec-Seq data were obtained showed more than twofold increased mRPFs in the presence of 100 or 500 nM Ded1 compared to no added Ded1, whereas only ~100 transcripts showed higher mRPFs at 500 nM versus 100 nM Ded1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, red dots). Substantially smaller numbers of mRNAs displayed decreased mRPFs as Ded1 concentration was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, dark blue dots; 71, 182, and 51 mRNAs, respectively). Importantly, 87% of mRNAs showing significant increases in mRPFs at 100 nM Ded1 were also increased at 500 nM Ded1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and 68% of the mRNAs with significantly diminished mRPFs at 100 nM Ded1 were also decreased at 500 nM Ded1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>)—both highly significant overlaps. These data indicate consistency in the effects of Ded1 observed in different experiments.

We examined changes in RE between experiments containing different concentrations of Ded1 by ordering mRNAs according to the change in RE between 0 and 100 nM Ded1 and then using this ordering to generate a heat map depiction of ∆RE values for all 3052 transcripts observed by Rec-Seq between 0 and 100 nM Ded1, 0 and 500 nM Ded1, and 100 and 500 nM Ded1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>, the results indicate that most mRNAs with increased REs on addition of 100 nM Ded1 also have increased RE at 500 nM Ded1 (compare red lines in cols. 1–2), which for certain mRNAs is of greater magnitude at 500 nM (relatively darker red bars in col. 2). The decrease in RE observed for a smaller number of mRNAs upon Ded1 addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, blue lines) generally appears to be greater at 500 nM versus 100 nM Ded1 (cf. blue lines in cols. 1–2), which is also consistent with the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>.</p><p>Examining the distributions of all mRNAs across 10 bins of increasing RE values at each concentration of Ded1 revealed an obvious shift of mRNAs from bins of lowest RE to bins of higher RE when Ded1 was included in the Rec-Seq reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, cf. orange versus blue and magenta bars, particularly in the first three bins on the left). The similar distributions observed for the 100 and 500 nM Ded1 data are consistent with results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>, indicating that stimulation by Ded1 is nearly saturated at 100 nM. These data suggest that Ded1 confers relatively greater stimulation for mRNAs that are recruited by 43S PICs poorly in the absence of Ded1. Supporting this conclusion, the increase in RE between reactions with 500 nM versus no Ded1 was the greatest for the subset of mRNAs of lowest RE and the least for the mRNAs with highest RE in reactions without Ded1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). This finding recapitulates and extends previous results on several individual mRNAs wherein Ded1 strongly stimulated 43S PIC recruitment of Ded1 hyperdependent transcripts exhibiting poor recruitment in reactions lacking Ded1, while more weakly stimulating Ded1 hypodependent mRNAs that could be recruited efficiently without Ded1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the Rec-Seq results are highly consistent among biological replicates and reproducibly identify a subset of ~1000 of the 3052 mRNAs detected in the analysis for which assembly of 48S PICs is strongly stimulated by Ded1, with a marked tendency for greater stimulation for mRNAs that recruit PICs poorly in Ded1’s absence. These data support previous conclusions from in vivo ribosome profiling analysis of a <italic>ded1-cs</italic> mutant that a significant number (~600 to ~1100) of yeast mRNAs exhibit heightened dependence on Ded1 relative to the average mRNA (Ded1-hyperdependent transcripts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sen et al., 2019</xref>). The previous ribosome profiling studies also identified transcripts exhibiting increased relative TEs in <italic>ded1</italic> mutant cells deficient in Ded1 activity (Ded1-hypodependent transcripts), consistent with translational repression by wild-type Ded1. It was unclear, however, whether the translational efficiencies of these last mRNAs were truly elevated in <italic>ded1</italic> cells or merely reduced by a smaller amount than the average transcript to yield an increase in relative TE. Owing to the spike-in normalization employed here, it is clear that the absolute occupancies of 48S PICs at mAUGs on mRNAs showing reduced REs on Ded1 addition are indeed diminished by Ded1, although it remains unclear whether the repression is direct or results indirectly from increased competition for limiting PICs conferred by enhanced PIC recruitment on the Ded1-stimulated mRNAs. We examine this question further below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Transcripts showing strong Ded1 stimulation of 48S PIC assembly in Rec-Seq have long and structured 5′UTRs</title><p>The mRNAs judged to be hyperdependent on Ded1 from Ribo-Seq experiments on <italic>ded1</italic> mutants are enriched for transcripts with longer than average 5′UTRs with a heightened propensity for forming secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sen et al., 2015</xref>).

In this analysis, a higher PARS score denotes a higher probability of double-stranded conformation. We calculated various cumulative PARS scores for 5′UTRs, including the sum of scores for (i) all 5′UTR nucleotides (total PARS); (ii) the 30 nt surrounding the start codon (Start30 PARS; for mRNAs with a 5′UTR ≥ 15 nt); and (iii) the highest cumulative score in any 30 nt window (Max30 PARS). For each sequence interval, the 1874 transcripts observed in Rec-Seq with available PARS data were divided into six bins of increasing PARS scores and examined for RE changes conferred by Ded1 in Rec-Seq.</p><p>The average REs of mRNAs binned according to the 5′UTR Max30 PARS scores decline steadily with increasing PARS scores in Rec-Seq reactions lacking Ded1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, orange). Importantly, the negative effect of increasing Max30 PARS scores was essentially eliminated by addition of 100 or 500 nM Ded1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, purple and cyan). Consistent with this, addition of 100 or 500 nM Ded1 confers significant increases in median RE that get progressively larger with increasing Max30 PARS scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Increasing Ded1 from 100 to 500 nM modestly increased the median RE for mRNAs in the two highest Max30 PARS score bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Similar effects on average RE values were observed for 5′UTR total PARS and Start30 PARS scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>), with relatively greater Ded1 stimulation for the mRNAs with larger scores for both parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). CDS length also correlated with diminished average RE values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), and this effect was reversed by Ded1 for the mRNAs with longest CDS lengths in the last two or three bins at both 100 and 500 nM Ded1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–L</xref>). We do not know why the average RE versus CDS length curves are U-shaped in the presence of Ded1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, green and purple lines). The correlation between Ded1 stimulation of RE and CDS length could be indirect because CDS length also correlates with 5′UTR length such that mRNAs with longer CDSs also tend to have longer 5′UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). Importantly, correlations between Ded1 stimulation and 5′UTR lengths are evident for all three groups of mRNAs containing distinct ranges of CDS lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). In contrast, a marked correlation between Ded1 stimulation and CDS length was detected only for the group of mRNAs with longest 5′UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>), and only the latter group showed a clear correlation between 5′UTR length and CDS length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G–I</xref>). Thus, the correlation between Ded1 stimulation and CDS length appears to be indirect, driven by the tendency for the mRNAs with the longest 5′UTRs to also have correspondingly longer CDSs. Overall, the Rec-Seq results suggest that Ded1 efficiently overcomes the impediment to 48S PIC assembly posed by structures within 5′UTRs, which are cumulative in longer 5′UTRs. This agrees with the conclusion reached from Ribo-Seq analysis of <italic>ded1</italic> mutants in which Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs were found to have significantly higher median PARS scores for all 5′UTR intervals tested as well as longer than average 5′UTR lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the dependence of Ded1 enhancement of 48S PIC assembly on the sequences surrounding the start codon. The context scores of AUGs, AUG<sub>CAI</sub>, quantify the similarity between the –6 to +3 positions surrounding a given AUG to the start codons of the 2% most highly translated yeast mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zur and Tuller, 2013</xref>). These context scores range from ∼0.16 (poorest) to ∼0.97 (best) among all yeast mAUG codons. Binning mRNAs by context score reveals a steady increase in RE with increasing context scores in Rec-Seq reactions lacking Ded1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>, orange), indicating that good sequence context around the AUG codon promotes 48S PIC formation. However, inclusion of 100 or 500 nM Ded1 increases the average and median RE values similarly for all bins of context scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>, cyan and purple; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>). We conclude that the stimulatory effects of Ded1 on 48S PIC formation are independent of the sequence context surrounding the AUG codon. Thus, Ded1 preferentially stimulates recruitment of mRNAs burdened with structured 5′UTRs but not with poor AUG sequence context.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Transcripts showing Ded1 stimulation of 48S PIC assembly in Rec-Seq include the majority of Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs identified by Ribo-Seq analysis of a <italic>ded1</italic> mutant</title><p>We next asked whether mRNAs exhibiting stimulation of 48S PIC assembly by Ded1 in Rec-Seq include those judged to be hyperdependent on Ded1 in vivo by Ribo-Seq analysis of the <italic>ded1-cs</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sen et al., 2015</xref>).

A total of 3035 mRNAs were detected in common across all these experiments. Thus, a marked correlation exists between the amounts of translation on each mRNA observed in vivo (80S RPFs) measured in Ribo-Seq experiments and 48S PIC formation measured in our in vitro Rec-Seq experiments, and this holds at different levels of Ded1 activity.</p><p>We also observed significant correlations between ΔRE values measured in Rec-Seq for reactions containing no Ded1 versus 100 or 500 nM Ded1 and changes in translational efficiencies (∆TE values) measured in Ribo-Seq for <italic>ded1-cs</italic> versus WT <italic>DED1</italic> cells at the non-permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>).

Strikingly, 80–90% of the mRNAs showing significantly decreased TEs conferred by <italic>ded1-cs</italic> in Ribo-Seq displayed significantly increased REs on addition of 100 or 500 nM Ded1 in Rec-Seq reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L and M</xref>).</p><p>Despite the significant correlations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–H</xref>, it should be noted that 11% of the Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs showing TE reductions in <italic>ded1-cs</italic> cells in Ribo-Seq did not exhibit significant stimulation of 48S PIC assembly by Ded1 in our Rec-Seq experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>, set of 39 mRNAs). Such mRNAs might be stimulated by Ded1 at a step following 48S PIC assembly that is not monitored by Rec-Seq or they might require additional factors for Ded1 stimulation of 48S PIC assembly that are lacking in our Rec-Seq experiments. It is also evident that the majority of mRNAs stimulated by 500 nM Ded1 in our Rec-Seq experiments were not judged to be Ded1-hyperdependent in Ribo-Seq analysis of the <italic>ded1-cs</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>, set of 683 mRNAs; ‘Group Y’). This could be explained by the fact that TEs in the Ribo-Seq analysis of the <italic>ded1-cs</italic> mutant were measured relative to the average transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sen et al., 2015</xref>) and thus both Ded1 hyper- and hypodependent transcripts could have decreased absolute translational efficiencies in the Ded1-deficient mutant at the non-permissive temperature relative to WT cells, but with the former decreased more than the average transcript and the latter decreased similar to or less than the average. Consistent with this interpretation, bulk polysome assembly is dramatically reduced only minutes after shifting the <italic>ded1-cs</italic> mutant to the non-permissive temperature, indicating a reduction in translation initiation on a large fraction of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sen et al., 2015</xref>). Because the Rec-Seq method employs an internal standard, the measured REs are absolute rather than relative and thus lead to a larger set of mRNAs with increased RE upon Ded1 addition than that for the relative TE reductions in the <italic>ded1-cs</italic> mutant at the non-permissive temperature in the Ribo-Seq experiments. Consistent with this explanation, the 683 Group Y mRNAs that were significantly stimulated in Rec-Seq by 500 nM Ded1 but not classified as Ded1-hyperdependent in Ribo-Seq displayed a smaller, albeit still significant, median increase in RE upon addition of 500 nM Ded1 than did the 319 mRNAs (‘Group X’) that were classified as Ded1 hyperdependent in the Ribo-Seq experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>). Moreover, the Group Y mRNAs had an approximately threefold smaller median decrease in relative TE between the <italic>ded1-cs</italic> mutant and WT cells than did the Ded1 hyperdependent Group X mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O</xref>). The median TE change of Group Y mRNAs was less than twofold and thus would not have met the criteria used for significance in the Ribo-Seq experiments. Thus, normalization of TE changes to the average mRNA in Ribo-Seq undoubtedly obscured the Ded1-dependent in vivo of many of the mRNAs stimulated by Ded1 in Rec-Seq reactions.</p><p>Together, our findings suggest that despite the much greater complexity of the system in vivo in terms of both components and processes, the effects of Ded1 on the translation of many mRNAs in cells are similar to what we see in the reconstituted Rec-Seq system that contains only a core set of translation components and is not influenced by processes such as mRNA transport, decay, and compartmentalization/phase separation. This seems a remarkable result given the number of in vivo roles that have been ascribed to Ded1 beyond simply promoting mRNA recruitment and scanning. The significant correlation between the effects of adding Ded1 to Rec-Seq experiments in vitro and of inactivating Ded1 in Ribo-Seq in vivo leads to the important insight that 48S PIC formation is frequently the rate-limiting step for translation initiation that is stimulated by Ded1 in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Evidence that Ded1 can promote leaky scanning of canonical AUG start codons</title><p>In Rec-Seq reactions lacking Ded1, RPFs at internal AUG start codons (iAUGs) located within CDSs (iRPFs) occur at 3.0% of all RPFs found anywhere in the CDS (at either the main or internal start sites, cdsRPFs), but this proportion increases to 4.2 and 7.8% on addition of 100 or 500 nM Ded1 to the reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Many of the remaining 56% could arise from increased competition for 43S PICs caused by Ded1 stimulation of PIC formation on other mRNAs with long, structured 5′UTRs, which are poorly recruited in the absence of Ded1 but begin competing for PICs when Ded1 is added to the system.</p><p>Considering that Ded1 inhibits 48S PIC assembly at the mAUG codons of so few mRNAs (only 182 out of 3052 tested), and that translation initiation continues on at least 46% of these transcripts and merely shifts to iAUGs, our data do not support a model in which a high concentration of Ded1 leads to widespread translational repression by causing mRNAs to undergo phase-transitions into translationally silenced states. If this is a significant repressive function of Ded1 in vivo, it likely requires even higher concentrations of Ded1, modification of Ded1, or additional factors not present in the Rec-Seq system.</p><p>Among the 1586 transcripts showing significantly increased initiation at iAUGs at 500 nM Ded1, roughly approximately one-third (508) exhibit increased rather than decreased mRPFs on Ded1 addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>, red/blue intersection). In fact, this trend is evident for the entire group of 1006 mRNAs showing increased PIC assembly at the mAUGs at 500 nM Ded1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>), although the median increase in iRPFs conferred by 500 nM Ded1 (23.2 iRPFs) is smaller for this group than that observed for the mRNAs described above where PIC assembly at the mAUG is repressed by Ded1 (86 iRPFs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). One possibility is that a high concentration of Ded1 increases readthrough of mAUGs on a large fraction of mRNAs but that in most cases this low-level leaky scanning is offset by larger increases in PIC attachment to mRNAs to yield a net increase in mRPFs despite enhanced mAUG readthrough. Consistent with this proposal, boxplots of RE values show that the mRNAs with mRPFs increased by Ded1 are initiated inefficiently in the absence of Ded1, whereas the mRNAs that display decreased mRPFs in the presence of Ded1 tend to be initiated very efficiently in Ded1’s absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Presumably, because the latter mRNAs do not exhibit significantly increased recruitment of 43S PICs when Ded1 is added, the increased leaky scanning of their mAUGs induced by Ded1 is not offset by increased overall recruitment of PICs, resulting in a net decrease in PIC assembly at the mAUGs.</p><p>To assess whether the sequence context around the mAUG influences its susceptibility to Ded1-induced leaky scanning, we examined the average fraction of all coding sequence RPFs (cdsRPF) that are iRPFs, a ratio we refer to as relative ribosome occupancy (RRO<sub>iRPF/cdsRPF</sub>), as a function of the context score for the bases surrounding the mAUG. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>, with both 0 and 500 nM Ded1 the average RRO<sub>iRPF/cdsRPF</sub> decreases as the context scores around the mAUGs increase (cyan and purple lines), consistent with the idea that the better the context the more stably the PIC is bound and the less likely is leaky scanning through the mAUG. Plotting the ratio of RRO values at 500 nM to 0 nM Ded1 yields a flat line with log<sub>2</sub>∆RRO values of ~0.75 for all bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>, orange line). These last results suggest that addition of 500 nM Ded1 increases the frequency of leaky scanning by ~1.7-fold regardless of mAUG context. This in turn implies that Ded1 does not inspect the context sequence but rather promotes scanning to reduce the dwell time of the PIC at the AUG similarly for both weak and strong contexts.</p><p>Rather than invoking leaky scanning, it could be proposed that the RPFs formed at iAUGs originate from a small fraction of mRNA isoforms with transcription initiation sites within the CDSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arribere and Gilbert, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu and Lin, 2019</xref>) that contain the internal initiation sites as the first AUGs encountered on scanning from the cap. Alternatively, the iRPFs could be formed on uncapped mRNAs cleaved at the 5′ end in cells or in vitro, which would require cap-independent initiation. In either case, Ded1 could stimulate PIC assembly at the iAUGs by the same mechanism identified above for canonical mAUGs. Several lines of evidence argue against this possibility and instead favor the Ded1-induced leaky scanning model proposed above. First, the level of iAUG initiation relative to mAUG initiation (RRO) depends strongly on the sequence context surrounding the mAUG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>), as expected for the leaky scanning model but inconsistent with a model in which iAUG occupancy arises from 5′-truncated mRNA isoforms or fragments. In addition, mRNAs that have a high level of iAUG occupancy relative to mAUG occupancy (RRO ≥ 0.5) tend to have less secondary structure in the 5′ ends of their coding sequences than do mRNAs with less iAUG occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5P</xref>, cols. 3–8, compare blue and orange boxes), consistent with a model in which secondary structures just downstream of the mAUG inhibit further scanning and diminish mAUG readthrough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kozak, 1990</xref>). This result is not predicted by the truncated mRNA isoform/fragment model. Finally, it is difficult to account for the reciprocal effects of Ded1 in repressing mRPFs while inducing iRPFs by comparable amounts for the same genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>) if the events occur independently on different transcript isoforms.</p><p>Overall, these data suggest that a high Ded1 concentration increases leaky scanning of the mAUG for approximately half (1586/3052; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>) of the mRNAs in the yeast translatome that were observed in this study. In some cases, this leads to a decrease in mRPFs and may account for nearly 50% of the mRNAs for which Ded1 suppresses 48S PIC assembly at the mAUG, while in others the overall enhancement of PIC loading on the mRNA induced by Ded1 likely offsets the increased leaky scanning for a net stimulation of 48S PIC assembly at the mAUG. The inhibitory effect of Ded1 on proper initiation at mAUGs for the subsets of mRNAs described above for which mRPFs are significantly decreased by 500 nM Ded1 in the Rec-Seq experiments also appears to be operative in vivo as the median TEs of these sets of mRNAs are increased in <italic>ded1-cs</italic> cells at the non-permissive temperature relative to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), signifying Ded1-hypodependence. These data are consistent with Ded1 activity diminishing the relative translation levels of these mRNAs in WT cells, in alignment with our observations in the Rec-Seq experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Ded1 does not generally increase initiation at canonical AUG codons in Rec-Seq by suppressing alternative initiation events in 5′UTRs</title><p>It has been proposed that a key function of Ded1 is to increase the fidelity of start codon selection by promoting readthrough of upstream AUG (uAUG) and near-cognate codons to boost the fraction of scanning PICs that initiate at the mAUG codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guenther et al., 2018</xref>). To determine whether this mechanism operates in the reconstituted system, we analyzed the effect of Ded1 in Rec-Seq reactions on the total RPFs mapping to the 5′-UTRs of mRNAs (uRPFs). We observed that 40–60% of all uRPFs detected when Ded1 is present in the reaction mapped to the <italic>GCN4</italic> 5′UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), and we therefore excluded <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNA in calculating the [total uRPF]/[total mRPF] ratio in order to measure effects on the overall translatome. In the absence of Ded1, the ratio of total uRPFs to mRPFs was 0.0021 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, col. 1). Addition of 100 nM Ded1 decreased the ratio to 0.0017 and increasing the concentration to 500 nM decreased it further only slightly, to 0.0016 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, cols. 2–3).

A decreased uRPF/mRPF ratio on addition of Ded1 is expected if Ded1 suppresses PIC assembly at upstream start codons as proposed in the aforementioned model. However, even in the absence of Ded1, uRPFs represent a very small fraction of all RPFs and this fraction is decreased by only ~30% upon addition of Ded1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Ded1 modestly promotes readthrough of start codons in 5′UTRs of mRNAs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The ratios of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) in 5′UTRs to RPFs on main start codons (uRPF/mRPF ratios) for each of the three replicates with 0 (blue), 100 (magenta), or 500 (green) nM Ded1.

Going from 0 to 100 nM Ded1 led to a significant reduction (ΔRPFs &lt; 0.5, FDR &lt; 0.05) in uRPFs for only nine mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, dark blue dots).

In contrast, uRPFs for 14 mRNAs were significantly increased (ΔRPFs &gt; 2, FDR &lt; 0.05), presumably due to enhanced PIC attachment to these mRNAs caused by addition of Ded1. Similar results were obtained in going from 0 to 500 nM Ded1, which resulted in only 25 mRNAs with significantly decreased uRPFs, and only two showing reductions &gt;50% of the magnitude of the observed increase in mRPFs for the mRNA (<italic>MSC7</italic> and <italic>UIP5</italic>), whereas 30 mRNAs showed significant increases in uRPFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In addition, there are at least as many cases in which upstream initiation is increased rather than decreased, most likely due to overall enhancement of PIC attachment to these mRNAs by Ded1. These data indicate that under the conditions of the Rec-seq experiments, Ded1 directly increases PIC attachment to mRNAs and scanning to the main start codons rather than primarily functioning by diminishing inhibitory initiation in 5′UTRs.</p><p>Additional evidence supporting our conclusion came from comparing the magnitude of changes in uRPFs versus mRPFs conferred by Ded1 for a group of 257 mRNAs containing RPFs in both 5′UTRs and at mAUG codons exceeding a minimum threshold read abundance. Overall, the mRPFs are an order of magnitude higher than uRPFs in the absence or presence of Ded1 at either concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, see median values below each column). Addition of 100 nM Ded1 decreases the median uRPFs by 2, from 10 to 8, but increases mRPFs by 80, from 65 to 145. Likewise, with 500 nM Ded1 relative to no Ded1, uRPFs decrease by 4, whereas mRPFs increase by 109. Thus, the magnitude of the RPF decreases in 5′UTRs are much too small to account for the increases in RPFs at mAUG codons elicited by addition of Ded1. Taken together, our data indicate that, at least in the reconstituted in vitro system, Ded1 functions by directly increasing PIC attachment to mRNAs and scanning to the main start codons rather than by diminishing inhibitory initiation in 5′UTRs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>eIF4A plays a distinct role from Ded1 and stimulates recruitment of most mRNAs regardless of their 5′UTR lengths or structures</title><p>Previous work in vitro and in vivo has indicated that eIF4A and Ded1 play distinct roles in promoting translation initiation. In the reconstituted system, no assembly of 48S PICs was observed for a variety of individual mRNAs in the absence of eIF4A but presence of Ded1, indicating that Ded1 cannot take the place of eIF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, 48S PIC formation occurred efficiently on many mRNAs in vitro in the presence of eIF4A but absence of Ded1, and all mRNAs studied required eIF4A for PIC assembly, regardless of their degree of secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yourik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>). In vivo ribosome profiling studies also led to the conclusion that eIF4A is universally required for translation of most mRNAs, whereas Ded1 preferentially stimulates translation of mRNAs with long, structured 5′UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our results here strongly support the previous conclusions that Ded1 functions by alleviating structural impediments to PIC loading and scanning in the 5′UTRs of particular mRNAs burdened by these features. To probe further functional differences between Ded1 and eIF4A, we performed Rec-Seq reactions in the absence of Ded1 and presence of either 5000 nM (1×) or 500 nM (0.1×) eIF4A. It was not possible to do the experiment in the absence of eIF4A because the factor is essential for 48S PIC formation on most, if not all, mRNAs. A scatterplot of mRPFs at 5000 versus 500 nM eIF4A shows that PIC assembly at the mAUGs of most mRNAs increases when the concentration of eIF4A is raised tenfold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, light blue density above the diagonal). Of the 2809 mRNAs observed in these experiments, 782 reached the level of significance in DEseq2 analysis of ≥2-fold change in mRPFs and FDR &lt; 0.05. Only one mRNA (<italic>SCW10</italic>) met the criteria for significantly decreased mRPFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, dark blue dot). Consistent with these results, increasing the eIF4A concentration from 500 to 5000 nM increased the REs of almost all mRNAs, with a median change of ~5.7-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, col. 1). By comparison, addition of either 100 or 500 nM Ded1 in a background of 5000 nM eIF4A increased the median RE by only 1.3-fold, with RE for many mRNAs not changing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, cols. 2–3). Rather, a large number of outliers are increased dramatically more than the median ΔRE value when Ded1 is added to the reactions, consistent with the preferential stimulation of 48S PIC assembly by Ded1 for mRNAs with long, structured 5′UTRs shown above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Overall, these results are consistent with previous conclusions that eIF4A stimulates recruitment of all mRNAs, regardless of their degree of secondary structure, whereas Ded1 specifically acts on mRNAs with long, structured 5′UTRs. Our data are also in line with previous work indicating that Ded1 has much stronger helicase activity than eIF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rogers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rajagopal et al., 2012</xref>) and thus the former is likely to play a role in unwinding stable secondary structures whereas the latter mediates engagement of mRNAs with the 43S PIC by resolving ensembles of weaker interactions within mRNAs or by modulating the structure of the mRNA channel of the 40S ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sokabe and Fraser, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yourik et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have developed a deep sequencing-based approach, ‘Rec-Seq’, for measuring the efficiency with which 48S PICs form on each mRNA in the yeast transcriptome in a reconstituted in vitro system. Using this approach, we have provided evidence that the DEAD-box translation initiation factor Ded1 specifically stimulates 48S PIC formation on mRNAs with long, structured 5′UTRs, which supports the model that the factor generally acts by unwinding secondary structures in 5′UTRs to promote 43S PIC binding and scanning to locate the start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berthelot et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guenther et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sen et al., 2021</xref>). We showed that 48S PIC formation on a set of ~1000 mRNAs is significantly less efficient in the absence of Ded1 than in its presence, demonstrating a positive function for the factor on these mRNAs. It is striking that the Ded1-stimulated mRNAs identified in our in vitro system include the great majority of mRNAs identified as being hyperdependent on Ded1 in vivo by ribosome profiling of a <italic>ded1-cs</italic> mutant. This concordance argues that the mRNAs showing the strongest dependence on Ded1 for efficient translation in vivo are stimulated by the factor at the stage of 48S PIC assembly. It further argues against the possibility that the TE reductions observed for Ded1 hyperdependent mRNAs in <italic>ded1-cs</italic> cells frequently result from dominant inhibitory properties of the mutant <italic>ded1</italic> proteins. Ded1 also stimulated 48S PIC assembly in Rec-Seq for many mRNAs not classified as Ded1-hyperdependent by Ribo-Seq. However, as explained above, translation of these mRNAs was likely impaired by the <italic>ded1-cs</italic> mutation but to a degree that was less than the twofold cutoff required for statistical significance or that was less than the effect on the average mRNA and thus yielded a positive change in the relative TE values determined in the Ribo-Seq analysis.</p><p>Previous studies have indicated that yeast Ded1 and its mammalian ortholog DDX3 can stimulate the subunit joining step of translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Senissar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Although our Rec-Seq system only monitored steps up to 48S PIC formation and was not able to probe effects on 60S subunit joining, it should be noted that nearly 90% of the Ded1-hyperdependent mRNAs identified by Ribo-seq analysis of the <italic>ded1-cs</italic> mutant were also identified in our in vitro Rec-Seq experiments monitoring only 48S PIC assembly. This result argues strongly that Ded1 affects 48S PIC assembly both in vitro and in vivo, although it does not rule out an additional effect of the factor on subunit joining.</p><p>Compared to the sizeable group of &gt;1000 mRNAs for which 500 nM Ded1 stimulated 48S PIC assembly, we identified a much smaller set of only 182 mRNAs for which 48S PIC assembly was significantly repressed by Ded1 in Rec-Seq experiments. We obtained evidence that at least 84 of these transcripts were repressed owing to Ded1-stimulated leaky scanning of the mAUG codon rather than by Ded1 blocking PIC attachment or scanning. As a group, the mRNAs exhibiting Ded1 repression in Rec-Seq show increased relative TE in Ribo-Seq analysis of the <italic>ded1-cs</italic> mutant, regardless of whether they display evidence of Ded1-enhanced leaky scanning of the mAUG codons in Rec-Seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This behavior is consistent with loss of Ded1 repression or with smaller than average reductions in TE in <italic>ded1-cs</italic> versus WT cells. The latter possibility is consistent with our finding that the 182 mRNAs inhibited by 500 nM Ded1 in Rec-Seq assemble 48S PICs very efficiently without Ded1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Being relatively independent of Ded1 for PIC assembly, these mRNAs should experience a smaller than average reduction in translation in <italic>ded1-cs</italic> cells owing to reduced competition for limiting 43S PICs with the Ded1-dependent mRNAs that should be strongly impaired for PIC assembly. We argued above that a similar mechanism can also explain the repression of RE by Ded1 in Rec-Seq experiments for the subset of 98 mRNAs without evidence of appreciable leaky scanning of the mAUG codon, owing to increased competition for 43S PICs with the Ded1-stimulated transcripts. It remains to be seen whether Ded1 acts directly to repress 48S PIC assembly on any individual mRNAs in yeast. It is possible that at higher concentrations of Ded1 than were achievable in these in vitro experiments or in the presence of additional factors that modify Ded1’s ATPase or RNA binding activities the factor could directly inhibit a subset of mRNAs by acting as an mRNA clamp that impedes scanning by the PIC or by sequestering the mRNAs in insoluble condensates. It might be interesting in the future to test candidate factors in Rec-Seq to determine if they switch Ded1 from being a stimulatory helicase to an inhibitory mRNA clamp that removes transcripts from the soluble phase.</p><p>We found that the presence of 500 nM Ded1 in Rec-Seq reactions increased 48S PIC assembly at internal AUG codons on ~50% of all detected transcripts. In approximately one-third of these 1586 transcripts, there is a parallel increase in RPFs at the mAUG codons, suggesting that Ded1 stimulates 43S PIC attachment at the 5′ ends of these transcripts to increase initiation proportionately at all AUGs in the mRNA. As mentioned, in ~5% of the mRNAs (84/1586), the increased internal initiation may result from leaky scanning of the mAUG codons, as we found a comparable reduction in initiation at the mAUG. In this view, Ded1 might resolve secondary structures positioned just downstream of the mAUG codon that increase the dwell time of the PIC and increase the probability of PIC assembly versus continued scanning downstream that leads to initiation on iAUG codons, in the manner first described for mammals by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kozak, 1990</xref>. Interestingly, Ded1 enhanced this apparent mAUG readthrough to similar extents regardless of the mAUG context, which would imply that Ded1 promotes scanning of the PIC past the mAUG without inspecting the context nucleotides surrounding it.</p><p>Ded1 also significantly reduced RPFs at upstream AUG and near-cognate start codons in the 5′UTRs of a small number of transcripts (25 mRNAs at 500 nM Ded1), possibly by the same mechanism mentioned above involving unwinding of downstream secondary structures. However, this reduction was associated with a comparable increase in RPFs at the mAUG for only two of these mRNAs. Our findings that PIC assembly at uAUGs in the absence of Ded1 is rare, and that suppression of these rare occurrences by Ded1 cannot explain the much larger increases in initiation at the mAUGs conferred by Ded1, argue that, at least in this in vitro system, Ded1 functions primarily by directly promoting 43S PIC attachment to mRNAs and scanning to the main start codons rather than by diminishing inhibitory initiation in 5′UTRs.</p><p>Finally, our data show that Ded1 and eIF4A, another essential DEAD-box translation initiation factor, have distinct functions. Unlike Ded1, which has pronounced specificity for activating initiation on mRNAs with long, structured 5′UTRs, eIF4A strongly promotes initiation on nearly all mRNAs, regardless of the length or degree of structure of their 5′ leaders. Because our system employs internal ‘spike-in’ standards, we were able to measure the absolute enhancement provided by eIF4A for mRNA recruitment upon increasing its concentration from 500 to 5000 nM, a 5.7-fold increase in median RE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In contrast, addition of Ded1 to the system produced a much smaller change in median RE, of only 1.3-fold, while conferring much larger effects, &gt;10-fold, on many mRNAs with long, structured 5′UTRs. These findings support our previous conclusions from Ribo-Seq analysis of Ded1 and eIF4A mutants that Ded1 preferentially stimulates translation of mRNAs burdened with structured 5′UTRs while eIF4A enhances the translation of nearly all mRNAs equally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our data provide information on the intrinsic efficiency of 48S PIC formation on cellular mRNAs in the yeast translatome. In the presence of 500 nM Ded1, RE values follow a roughly normal distribution spanning a 1000-fold range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), indicating that even in the presence of Ded1, there are still large differences in the intrinsic efficiencies with which mRNAs are recruited to the 43S PIC and scanned to locate the start codon. In the presence of Ded1, there is little dependence of RE on 5′UTR structure or length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and E</xref>) and thus other mRNA characteristics must set the 48S PIC formation efficiencies. The strength of sequence context around the start codon has a modest (approximately twofold) effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), but not nearly enough to explain the range of REs observed. The 1000-fold range we observe here is strikingly similar to the range reported in a systematic study of 5′UTR variants in a yeast lysate-based translation system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niederer et al., 2022</xref>). In that work, the authors provided evidence that a variety of sequence elements in 5′UTRs can enhance or inhibit translation initiation through a range of mechanisms. Thus, it is likely that in the presence of Ded1 no single mRNA feature sets the efficiency of 48S complex assembly and instead a multitude of effects and interactions are involved, possibly including specific interactions between mRNA elements and initiation factors or the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niederer et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, mRNA elements outside of the 5′UTR, including the poly(A) tail and its interaction with PABP, might influence the efficiency of 48S PIC formation. Further studies will be required to elucidate fundamental principles and specific cases of how mRNA sequences dictate TE.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Study limitations</title><p>As with all studies, this study has caveats and limitations. The fidelity of start codon recognition in the in vitro Rec-Seq system might differ from what occurs in vivo. Likewise, the use of an unmodified, in vitro transcribed initiator tRNA might lead to altered patterns of start codon recognition in the Rec-Seq system relative to what is observed within living cells. Previous studies of start codon recognition in the in vitro reconstituted yeast translation initiation system indicated that the general trend of start codon preference reflects what is expected from in vivo studies, with AUG codons leading to the most stable PICs, followed by near-cognate codons with first position mismatches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kolitz et al., 2009</xref>). The Rec-Seq system shows a very strong preference for AUG codons over near-cognates (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) and for good Kozak consensus sequences surrounding the start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>). Nonetheless, it will be worthwhile in future studies in the Rec-Seq system to explore the effects of buffer conditions, temperature, and tRNA modifications on start codon recognition fidelity and its interplay with initiation factors and mRNA structure.</p><p>The current version of the Rec-Seq system isolates events up to and including formation of a stable 48S PIC on an mRNA start codon, but does not allow these PICs to progress to 80S initiation complexes via 60S subunit joining. It is possible that subunit joining and 80S complex formation could alter some of the patterns we have observed here. For example, rapid subunit joining could diminish the Ded1-induced leaky scanning we have observed by stabilizing the complexes and making them resistant to displacement and further scanning. Further studies will be required to assess this possibility as well as any potential effects of Ded1 on the subunit joining step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Senissar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). It should also be noted that the Rec-Seq system does not disentangle the steps of PIC binding to mRNA, scanning, and start codon recognition from one another and thus independent effects on each of these processes cannot currently be assessed with the assay.</p><p>Finally, in these experiments we monitored endpoints for 48S PIC formation at a single timepoint (15 min) under single-turnover conditions in which neither multiple rounds of initiation on a single start codon nor ribosome reinitiation events would be observed. The use of single timepoints rather than kinetic measurements likely obscured some time-dependent effects. Future experiments in which multiple timepoints are taken might allow us to observe changes in the kinetics of 48S PIC formation upon addition of Ded1 or other factors to the system. The fact that we cannot observe multiple-turnover initiation or reinitiation events using this system could limit its utility in studying translational control events that require these processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Purification of yeast total mRNA</title><p>WT <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strain F729/BY4741 (<italic>MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Winzeler et al., 1999</xref>) was cultured in Yeast Extract–Peptone–Dextrose (YPD) medium to OD<sub>600</sub> of ~1.

Similarly, reads unaligned to the spike-in genome were aligned to the yeast genome for genomic mRNA RPF counts.

The sequences for the input total mRNA were processed similarly: after trimming NEB universal linker sequences and removing non-coding RNAs, the remaining reads were mapped to the yeast genome.

With a next-generation deep-sequencing approach, Rec-Seq allows precisely targeted dissection of the roles of translation initiation factors in PIC assembly. This level of molecular precision is important to understanding mechanisms of translational control, making Rec-Seq a significant methodological advance. The authors leverage Rec-Seq to investigate the relative roles of two key helicase enzymes, Ded1p and eIF4A. While past work has pointed to differing roles for Ded1p and eIF4A helicase activity in PIC assembly, unambiguous interpretation of prior in-vivo data has been hindered by technical requirements for performing the experiments in cells. Rec-Seq circumvents these challenges, providing robust mechanistic insights. The authors find that Ded1p stimulates PIC formation selectively on mRNAs with long, structured leaders in the Rec-Seq system, while eIF4A provides much more general stimulation across mRNAs. The findings substantiate the past in-vivo results, along with adding new insights. They contrast with evidence that Ded1p promotes translation by suppressing inhibitory upstream initiation through structural remodeling, or through formation of intracellular, phase-separated granules. The conclusions of the study are well-supported by the data, and are likely to be of broad interest.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The quantitative nature of Rec-Seq, which uses an internal standard to measure absolute recruitment efficiencies, is an important strength.</p><p>The methodology decisively overcomes past experimental limitations, allowing the authors to make clear conclusions with regard to the relative roles of Ded1p and eIF4A in PIC formation. An important and useful addition to the toolbox for studying translation and translational control mechanisms, Rec-Seq substantially expands the throughput and scope of mechanistic analyses for translation initiation.</p><p>One significant finding to emerge is that the in-vitro reconstituted system used here recapitulates effects of in-vivo perturbations of translation initiation. Despite the lack of a cellular environment and its components, PIC formation appears to operate much as it does in the cell. Importantly, this highlights an inherent &quot;modularity&quot; to the system that is especially of interest in the context of how regulatory machinery beyond the PIC may control translation.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The study finds that Ded1p stimulates accumulation of PICs at internal AUG codons, i.e., within mRNA coding sequences, at an incidence of up to ~50% - thus, bypassing &quot;canonical&quot; translation start sites. Understanding the physiological significance of this activity will require further study. The authors address this in the text.</p><p>A limitation of the methodology is that, as an endpoint assay, Rec-Seq does not readily decouple effects of Ded1p on PIC-mRNA loading from those on the subsequent scanning step where the PIC locates the start codon. Considering that Ded1p activity may influence each of these initiation steps through distinct mechanisms - i.e., binding to the mRNA cap-recognition factor eIF4F, or direct mRNA interaction outside eIF4F - additional studies will be needed to gain deeper mechanistic insights. The authors discuss this in the text.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>In revising their manuscript, the authors have responded very thoughtfully and insightfully to the initial review. The final manuscript is an important contribution to the field, and I am sure it will be of broad interest.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93255.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Fujun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bocetti</surname><given-names>Julie M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hou</surname><given-names>Meizhen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Daoming</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hinnebusch</surname><given-names>Alan G</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lorsch</surname><given-names>Jon R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1</bold></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Start site fidelity in purified reconstituted systems can be drama5cally altered in different buffer conditions. Interpretation of the observed changes to start site selection in mRNAs in the absence or presence of Ded1 using only the one buffer condition used is therefore limited.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point and is something we could explore in future studies using the Rec-Seq system. We have added this caveat to the Discussion on lines 797-809. We have previously studied the fidelity of start codon recognition in the reconstituted system (Kolitz et al., [2009] RNA, 15:138-152) and found that under our standard buffer conditions the codon specificity generally reflects what we observed in vivo using a dual-luciferase reporter assay, with the most stable 48S complexes forming on AUG codons, followed by first position mismatches (GUG, UUG, CUG), with second and third position mismatches leading to significantly less stable complexes. However, as the reviewer notes, there are some deviations: ACG and AUA are poor codons in the in vitro system under the buffer conditions used but allowed relatively strong expression in our in vivo reporter assay. It should also be noted that the hierarchy of nearcognate start codon usage in vivo in yeast differs according to the study and the reporter used, making it difficult to establish a “ground truth” for start codon fidelity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have some specific comments to strengthen the manuscript and address some minor issues.</p><p>It is not clear to me whether the authors refold the purified mRNA aEer phenol/chloroform extraction? Have the authors observed different results if the mRNA is refolded or not? This is appropriate since the authors compare their Rec-Seq data to PARS scores that were generated from refolded mRNAs. One assumes that the total mRNA used is refolded in the same way as the PARS score study, but this is not clearly stated. The authors should make this point clear in the text and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. We did not use the final refolding protocol that Kertesz et al. used when they developed their PARS scores and now clarify this in the Methods section (lines 962967). It is possible that we would have seen stronger correlations in the analyses using PARS scores had we followed the renaturation protocol, although the fact that we observed significant correlations (e.g., Fig. 3E-H) suggests the structures in the Kertesz et al. mRNAs were similar to those in our mRNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not clear how the authors determine the concentration of total mRNA that is used in the assay - reported as 60 nM? Are the authors assuming a molecular weight of an average mRNA to determine the concentration? The authors should provide more detail for how they quantify their mRNA concentration and its stoichiometry compared to 43S PICs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this oversight and have now included this information on lines 849-855 of the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments regarding start site fidelity in the reconstituted system:</p><p>The authors use in vitro transcribed tRNAi-Met. Since tRNA modifications may play a role in start site fidelity, the authors should perhaps mention that this will need to be investigated in a future study in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point and we now note it as a caveat in the Discussion on lines 806-809.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state that Ded1 promotes leaky scanning regardless of the mAUG start site context (page 24; lines 533-534). The authors then state on page 25 that the level of iAUG initiation relative to mAUG initiation does depend on the mAUG context (lines 545-546). This seems contradictory unless I am not understanding this correctly? It would certainly be surprising that mAUG context didn't regulate leaky scanning in the reconstituted system given the fact that initiation codon context regulates selection in cells (when Ded1 is present).</p></disp-quote><p>These statements are correct as wrihen. As shown in Figure 5O, the frequency of leaky scanning (as measured by relative ribosome occupancy of the internal region of the ORF, not including the main start codon, to the whole ORF, including the main start codon; RRO) decreases as the context score around the start codon gets stronger (green and purple lines). The RRO is increased to the same extent when 500 nM Ded1 is added, regardless of the strength of the start codon context, indicating that Ded1 enhances leaky scanning equally (compare slopes of the green line without Ded1 to the purple line with Ded1). Because of this, the effect of Ded1on RRO (DRR0) is constant across context score bins (orange line). There is no discrepancy between our two conclusions that leaky scanning of the mAUG increases as context score decreases and that Ded1 increases leaky scanning equally for good and bad mAUG contexts, indicating that Ded1 does not inspect the mAUG context and simply decreases the dwell time equally at all contexts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further to the start site context question. It is possible that the fidelity of the reconstituted system (i.e. buffer conditions) is not fully reflecting in vivo-like start site selection. A rigorous characterization of commercially available reticulocyte lysate systems identified buffer conditions that provided similar start site fidelity to that observed in live cells (Kozak. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990 May 11;18(9):2828). While I feel that it is beyond the context of the current work to undertake a similar rigorous buffer characterization, one must be careful about interpreting the results about leaky scanning and upstream initiation sites in the current work. Perhaps one would observe similar results to Guenther et al. if the fidelity (buffer conditions) of the reconstituted system were different? I appreciate that the authors state that their results only apply to their reconstituted system and do not necessarily suggest that previous data are incorrect, but with only one buffer condition being tested in the current study it may be appropriate to further soEen the interpretation of the current results when compared to published data in live cells.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is well-taken. As noted above, we have added a caveat about possible effects of buffer conditions on start codon fidelity to the Discussion (lines 797-809). In terms of the possibility that upstream initiation is more frequent in vivo than we observe in the in vitro RecSeq system, we previously studied 5′UTR translation in vivo using ribosome profiling (Kulkarni et al. [2019] BMC Biol., 17:101). The ratio of RPFs in 5′UTRs to coding sequences in this study was0.0027, very similar to the value measured in the in vitro Rec-Seq system in the presence of Ded1 (0.0016-0.0017). Thus, it does not seem that the frequency of upstream initiation is dramatically higher in vivo than in our in vitro system. We have now made note of this point in the Results (lines 594-598). Guenther et al. employed a ribosome profiling protocol in which they added cycloheximide to their cells prior to lysis, which has been shown to create significant artifacts, particularly in 5′UTR translation (e.g., Gerashchenko and Gladyshev [2014] Nucleic Acids Res., 42:e134). Nevertheless, as suggested by the reviewer, we have modified the text in the Results and Discussion to somen the interpretation somewhat (lines 582-583; 616-618; 761763).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2</bold></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Several findings in this report are quite surprising and may require additional work to fully interpret. Primary among these is the finding that Ded1p stimulates accumulation of PICs at internal site in mRNA coding sequences at an incidence of up to ~50%. The physiological relevance of this is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that understanding the physiological significance, if any, of the apparent leaky scanning of main AUG start codons induced by Ded1 is an unanswered question that will require additional studies. It is possible that rapid 60S subunit joining and formation of the 80S initiation complex amer start codon recognition on most mRNAs reduces the leaky scanning effect in vivo. We now bring up this possibility in the Discussion section (lines 804809). However, as noted in lines 568-580, mRNAs that display significantly decreased mRPFs at 500 nM Ded1 in the Rec-Seq system also tend to have TEs that are increased in the ded1-cs- mutant relative to WT yeast in in vivo ribosome profiling experiments, suggesting that Ded1 activity also diminishes initiation on mAUG codons in these mRNAs in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A limitation of the methodology is that, as an endpoint assay, Rec-Seq does not readily decouple effects of Ded1p on PIC-mRNA loading from those on the subsequent scanning step where the PIC locates the start codon. Considering that Ded1p activity may influence each of these initiation steps through distinct mechanisms - i.e., binding to the mRNA cap-recognition factor eIF4F, or direct mRNA interaction outside eIF4F - additional studies may be needed to gain deeper mechanistic insights.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a limitation of the Rec-Seq assay and now mention this point in the Discussion section (lines 810-817). It is possible that future work using cross-linking agents to stabilize 43S complexes bound near the cap and scanning the 5′UTR, similar to the methodology used in 40S ribosome profiling, could enable us or others to disentangle these steps from one another.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As the authors note, the achievable Ded1p concentrations in Rec-Seq may mask potential effects of Ded1p-based granule formation on translation initiation. Additional factors present in the cell could potentially also promote this mechanism. Consequently, the results do not fully rule out granule formation as a potential parallel Ded1p-mediated translation-inhibitory mechanism in cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. As stated in the Discussion section (lines 735-741): “It is possible that at higher concentrations of Ded1 than were achievable in these in vitro experiments or in the presence of additional factors that modify Ded1’s ATPase or RNA binding activities the factor could directly inhibit a subset of mRNAs, by acting as an mRNA clamp that impedes scanning by the PIC, or by sequestering the mRNAs in insoluble condensates. It might be interesting in the future to test candidate factors in Rec-Seq to determine if they switch Ded1 from being a stimulatory helicase to an inhibitory mRNA clamp that removes transcripts from the soluble phase.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is certainly clear why the 15-minute timepoint was chosen for these assays. However, I wondered whether data from an earlier timepoint would provide useful information. The description on line 210 of the compiled PDF suggests data from different timepoints may be available; if it is, in my view it could be a useful addition. More generally, including language about the single-turnover nature of these reactions may be helpful for the benefit of a broad audience.</p></disp-quote><p>In preliminary experiments, we have used the Rec-Seq system to measure the kinetics of 48S PIC formation transcriptome-wide. As you probably can imagine, this is a challenging experiment and requires additional work before we would feel comfortable publishing it. We very much agree with the reviewer that resolving the kinetics of these events will provide important additional information. As suggested, we have added caveats about the endpoint and single-turnover nature of the assay to the Discussion (lines 821-828).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I wondered whether it might be useful to present additional information on the mRNAs not found in the assay. For example, are these the least abundant mRNAs, which may not have had time to recruit the 43S PIC?</p></disp-quote><p>75% of mRNAs (2719 of 3640) not observed in the Rec-Seq analysis had densities below the median (2.3 reads per nucleotide). We now mention this in the Methods section (lines 855856).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Rec-Seq recruitment reactions were carried out at 22C° . Considering that remodeling of RNA structure by helicase enzymes is a focal point of the study, linking the results to the recruitment landscape at a closer-to-physiological temperature may bolster the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>In the future, it would be interesting to test the effects of temperature on 48S PIC formation using the Rec-Seq system. As the reviewer suggests, the interplay between temperature and mRNA structure could reveal interesting phenomenon. It is worth noting, however, that there is no clear “physiological” temperature for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. For consistency and convenience, lab yeast is usually grown at 30 °C, but in the wild yeast live at a wide range of temperatures, which generally change throughout the day. From this standpoint, 22 °C seems reasonably physiological.</p><p>Results from Rec-seq experiments conducted at 15° C might be more directly comparable to in vivo Ribo-seq data with the ded1-cs mutant. However, already ~90% of the Ded1hyperdependent mRNAs identified by Ribo-seq analysis of that mutant were identified here as Ded1-stimulated mRNAs in Rec-Seq experiments at 22°C. The Ribo-seq experiments conducted by Guenther et al. were conducted on the ded1-ts mutant at 37°C; thus, any structures that confer Ded1-dependent leaky-scanning through uORFs detected in that study should have been stable in our Rec-Seq experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The introduction provides an important, detailed exposition of the state of the field with respect to Ded1p activity. Nevertheless, in my view, it is quite lengthy and could be streamlined for clarity. As just one example, the proposed function of Ded1p in the nucleus seems like a detail that could be dispensed with for the present work.</p></disp-quote><p>We have ahempted to shorten the Introduction, as suggested. However, we did not remove the short section describing Ded1’s possible roles in the nucleus and ribosome biogenesis because we felt it was important to emphasize that one of the strengths of the Rec-Seq system is that it allows us to isolate the early steps of translation initiation from later steps and from other cellular processes. In addition, at the suggestion of Reviewer #3, we added a brief explanation of Ded1’s possible role in the subunit joining step of translation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3</bold></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The slow nature of the biochemical experiments could bias results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the 15-minute time point used could mask effects that are manifested at a purely kinetic level. It should be noted that we have measured the observed rate constants for 48S formation on a variety of mRNAs in the in vitro reconstituted system in the presence of saturating Ded1 (Gupta et al. [2018] eLife, https://elifesciences.org/articles/38892 ) and found that they are generally in the range of estimates of rate constants for translation initiation in vivo in yeast (~1-10 min-1; e.g., Siwiak and Zielenkiewicz [2010], PLOS Comput. Biol., 6: e100865). In preliminary experiments, we have used the Rec-Seq system to measure the kinetics of 48S PIC formation transcriptome-wide in the absence of Ded1 and find that the mean rate constant observed (~2 min-1) is also within the range of estimates of the rate of translation initiation in vivo in yeast. We hope to publish this analysis in a future manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It has been suggested that Ded1 and its human homolog DDX3X could play a role in subunit joining postscanning (Wang et al. 2022, Cell and Geissler et al. 2012 Nucleic Acids Res). Could the authors potentially investigate this by adding GTP, eIF5B and 60S subunits into the reaction mixture and isolating 80S complexes?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting suggestion. One of our plans with the Rec-Seq system is to see if we can also observe 80S formation with it and distinguish 80S from 48S complexes. Although we haven’t yet tried this and there might be technical obstacles to doing it, if it works we would like to examine the potential effects of Ded1, as suggested. We now mention this possibility in the Discussion section (lines 709-716 and 810-817).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An incubation time of 15 minutes is quite long on the timescale of translation initiation. Presumably, the competion for 40S among mRNAs is partially kinetically controlled so it would be interesting if the authors could do a time series on the incubation time. Does Ded1 increase initiation on more structured UTRs even at shorter incubations or are those only observed with longer incubations?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. See the response to the question about kinetics above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does GDPNP lead to off-pathway events? What happens when GTP is used in the TC? Presumably in the absence of eIF5B the 48S PIC should remain stalled at the start codon.</p></disp-quote><p>In previous experiments in the reconstituted system, we showed that using GTP instead of GDPNP resulted in 48S complexes that were less stable than those stalled prior to GTP hydrolysis (e.g., Algire et al. [2002] RNA 8:382-397). This is presumably because eIF2•GDP and eIF5 release from the complex and the Met-tRNAi can dissociate in the absence of subunit joining. Although we haven’t tried it in the Rec-Seq system, we suspect that the resulting PICs would fall apart during sucrose gradient sedimentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors use assembly of a 48S PIC at the start codon as evidence of scanning but could use more evidence to back this claim up. Does removing the cap structure on the two luciferase mRNA controls disrupt initiation using this approach? That would be direct evidence of 5' end 40S loading and scanning to the start codon.</p></disp-quote><p>In previous work using the reconstituted system, we studied the effect of the 5′-cap on 48S PIC formation (Mitchell et al. [2010] Mol. Cell 39:950-962; Yourik et al. [2017] eLife https://elifesciences.org/articles/31476 ). We found that stable 48S PIC formation is strongly dependent on the presence of the 5′-cap. In addition, the cap prevents off-pathway events and enforces a requirement for the full set of initiation factors to achieve efficient 48S PIC formation. As the reviewer indicates, the cap-dependence of the system supports the conclusion that 5′end loading and scanning take place. We have now added this information and the relevant citations to the Introduction (lines 147-153). We thank the reviewer for pointing out this oversight. It should also be noted that the cases of mRNAs in which 5′UTR translation is increased by addition of Ded1 support the conclusion that the factor promotes ahachment of the PIC to the 5′ ends of mRNAs and subsequent 5′ to 3’ scanning, as noted in lines 608-618.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state that &quot;The correla5on between CDS length and RE could be indirect because CDS length also correlates with 5'UTR length&quot;. Could the authors bin the transcripts into different 5' UTR length ranges and then probe for CDS length differences on RE for each 5' UTR length bin? This could be useful to truly parse the mechanism by which CDS length is influencing RE.</p></disp-quote><p>This was an excellent suggestion. We now include this analysis in a new supplementary figure, Figure 3S-2. Corresponding text was added in lines 380-387:</p><p>“Importantly, correlations between Ded1 stimulation and 5′ UTR lengths are evident for all three groups of mRNAs containing distinct ranges of CDS lengths (Fig. 3-S2A-C). In contrast, a marked correlation between Ded1 stimulation and CDS length was detected only for the group of mRNAs with longest 5′UTRs (Fig. 3-S2D-F), and only the latter group showed a clear correlation between 5′UTR length and CDS length (Fig. 3-S2G-I). Thus, the correlation between Ded1 stimulation and CDS length appears to be indirect, driven by the tendency for the mRNAs with the longest 5′UTRs to also have correspondingly longer CDSs.”</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this very useful idea.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3I, why does RE dip for the middle bins of CDS length in both 100 nM and 500 nM conditions, and then rise back up for the later bins? In other words, why do the shortest and longest CDS have the best RE in the presence of ded1?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not know the reason for this dip and now say this in the Results on lines 377-378.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The discussion section would be well served to discuss proposed roles of Ded1 post-scanning and how those fit, if at all, with the data presented throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added this to the Discussion (lines 709-716 and 810-817).
