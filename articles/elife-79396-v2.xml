Here, we systematically mine gene expression datasets to uncover the spatiotemporal blueprint for how the chitin-based pharyngeal cuticle of the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is built. We demonstrate that the blueprint correctly predicts expression patterns and functional relevance to cuticle development. We find that as larvae prepare to molt, catabolic enzymes are upregulated and the genes that encode chitin synthase, chitin cross-linkers, and homologs of amyloid regulators subsequently peak in expression. Forty-eight percent of the gene products secreted during the molt are predicted to be intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), many of which belong to four distinct families whose transcripts are expressed in overlapping waves. These include the IDPAs, IDPBs, and IDPCs, which are introduced for the first time here. All four families have sequence properties that drive phase separation and we demonstrate phase separation for one exemplar in vitro. This systematic analysis represents the first blueprint for cuticle construction and highlights the massive contribution that phase-separating materials make to the structure.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cuticle</kwd><kwd>intrinsically disordered proteins</kwd><kwd>molting</kwd><kwd>systems analyses</kwd><kwd>phase separation</kwd><kwd>novel gene families</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NKFI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>127909</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takács</surname><given-names>Kristóf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1616265</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Michael P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Centre, Poland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019/35/B/NZ2/03997</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kotulska</surname><given-names>Malgorzata</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>376634</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roy</surname><given-names>Peter J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>313296</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roy</surname><given-names>Peter J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science and Engineering Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knox</surname><given-names>Jessica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roy</surname><given-names>Peter J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A meta-analysis yields a spatiotemporal map of gene expression that provides a blueprint for nematode cuticle construction and reveals novel families of cuticular intrinsically disordered proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over 85% of living animal species belong to the superphylum ecdysozoa. This group includes nematodes, arthropods, tardigrades, and five other phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Telford et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguinaldo et al., 1997</xref>). They are defined by having a common ancestor and a specialized extracellular matrix that covers their body called the cuticle. The ecdysozoan cuticle is shed and regrown to accommodate juvenile growth in a process called ecdysis or molting.</p><p>Cuticle shape is patterned by the tissue beneath it, but also takes on additional diversity beyond the underlying tissue shape. One example of this structural diversity is the mouthparts of nematodes. Many carnivorous nematodes and nematode parasites of animals have cuticle-based teeth that bite into their prey or host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sieriebriennikov and Sommer, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">John and Petri, 2006</xref>). Nematode parasites of plants have needle-like cuticle stylets that pierce plants and act as a syringe to deposit effectors and suck out vital nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mejias et al., 2019</xref>). Bacterivorous nematodes, like the model nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, have cuticle grinders that pulverize bacteria into digestible bits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sparacio et al., 2020</xref>). These specialized mouthparts are variations of the cuticle that lines the anterior alimentary tract. Despite this diversity in form and the importance of the cuticle to most animals, a spatiotemporal blueprint for cuticle construction is lacking. Here, we provide such a blueprint by mining published datasets of <italic>C. elegans</italic> gene expression.</p><p>All epithelia in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that would otherwise be exposed to the environment, except the intestine, are protected by a cuticle. These include the body cuticle that protects the hypodermis (aka epidermis), the anterior alimentary cuticle that reinforces the lumen of the buccal cavity and pharynx, and other cuticles that protect the rectum, vulva, and excretory pore tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altun and Hall, 2020</xref>). Here, we will refer to the anterior alimentary cuticle as the pharyngeal cuticle.</p><p>The non-chitinous body cuticle has multiple layers that include an outer carbohydrate-rich glycocalyx, a lipid-rich epicuticle, and multiple inner collagenous layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altun and Hall, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Page and Johnstone, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cox et al., 1981</xref>). By contrast, the pharyngeal cuticle is not collagenous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altun and Hall, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cox et al., 1981</xref>) and instead contains a chitin-chitosan matrix that likely helps maintain luminal integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heustis et al., 2012</xref>). The pharyngeal cuticle is layered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sparacio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wright and Thomson, 1981</xref>), but the molecular composition of the different layers is unknown. Like other ecdysozoans, <italic>C. elegans</italic> sheds its cuticles at the end of each larval stage. As the old cuticle is being shed, a new cuticle is built underneath, and the next developmental stage ensues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sparacio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lazetic and Fay, 2017</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> adults do not molt.</p><p>In addition to chitin, the pharyngeal cuticle contains a group of largely disordered proteins called the APPGs (also known as the <underline>ABU</underline>/<underline>PQN P</underline>aralog <underline>G</underline>roup) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">George-Raizen et al., 2014</xref>). The APPGs are low complexity (i.e., they have a biased composition involving a limited set of amino acids) and have been described as prion-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Michelitsch and Weissman, 2000</xref>) and potentially amyloidogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">George-Raizen et al., 2014</xref>). An examination of the expression pattern of five APPGs showed that all five are expressed in cells that surround the pharyngeal cuticle and that APPG::GFP fusion proteins are incorporated into the pharyngeal cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">George-Raizen et al., 2014</xref>). The disruption of two of these genes exhibits feeding phenotypes consistent with disruption of this cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">George-Raizen et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we find the APPGs to be one of several groups of proteins dominated by large intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) with low-complexity sequences that are likely secreted into the developing pharyngeal cuticle.</p><p>IDRs are defined here as a 30 or more continuous residues whose primary sequence fails to form a stereotypical stable tertiary structure and instead rapidly interconverts between heterogenous conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">van der Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Despite lacking ordered structure, IDRs can interact with other IDRs through local areas of hydrophobicity, complementary charge, hydrogen-bond formation, and pi-stacking interactions along the respective peptide chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vernon and Forman-Kay, 2019</xref>). IDRs often harbor repeating sequence features that can facilitate the formation of multivalent interaction networks with multiple binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vernon and Forman-Kay, 2019</xref>). Depending on the local environment, multivalent IDRs, and particularly low-complexity IDRs, can phase separate to form liquid–liquid phase-separated droplets (LLPS) (i.e., liquid condensates) or gels, which can then transition to more solid structures, including fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mittag and Parker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banani et al., 2017</xref>). LLPS has been shown to be an important first step in the self-assembly of IDR-rich proteins into the extracellular matrices of insects, arachnids, and molluscs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Muiznieks et al., 2018</xref>). For example, IDR-rich proteins that form liquid condensates fill a porous chitin-based matrix in a key step of squid beak development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Given that the affinity of any one interaction along an IDR is relatively weak, the ability of IDRs to form these phase-separated networks is easily modulated by a variety of factors, including pH, ions, temperature, protein concentration, and post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Murray et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe the spatiotemporal logic of pharyngeal cuticle construction that we have uncovered by mining published mRNA expression datasets and canonical amyloid and chitin-binding dyes. We identify six families of low-complexity proteins that are likely secreted into the developing cuticle, including the IDPAs, IDPBs, and IDPCs, each of which are described for the first time here, and the APPGs, NSPBs, and the FIPRs. These six families peak in expression level in successive waves over the course of each larval stage. Computational analyses predict that the IDPA, IDPB, IDPC, and APPG families, and 12 other singletons are IDR-rich proteins capable of phase separation. We speculate that the malleable properties of the disordered phase-separating proteins are especially suited to a flexible cuticle that must be rapidly destroyed and reconstructed during molting.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Validating fluorescent dyes as probes of pharyngeal cuticle structure</title><p>Earlier transmission electron microscopy of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> pharynx cuticle revealed it to be a complex structure that changes in character along its anterior–posterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sparacio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wright and Thomson, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To further characterize its structure, we first sought to validate dyes as probes of the cuticle. Congo Red (CR) fluoresces red and binds to amyloid oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bennhold, 1922</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wu et al., 2012</xref>) and has been previously shown to stain the cuticular grinder of the pharynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">George-Raizen et al., 2014</xref>).

This study identified 2718 genes whose expression oscillates during larval development with a peak in expression every 8 hr (p&lt;0.001); this period corresponds to the 8 hr duration of the third and fourth larval stages at 25°C. Two of these 2718 genes have been retired due to reannotation. The 2716 genes can be grouped into bins of genes that peak at different larval development phases. For example, some genes peak during the first and ninth hour, others peak during second and tenth hour etc., such that there are successive waves of genes that oscillate through time (see Figure 1e of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hendriks et al., 2014</xref>).

We also included the previously characterized ABU-14::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We counterstained the resulting transgenic animals with CFW to interrogate the spatial overlap of the tagged proteins with the chitinous cuticle. As predicted, we found that all five reporters are expressed exclusively in association with the pharynx and overlap in their localization with the pharynx cuticle. Briefly, tagged IDPA-3 was enriched in the grinder, overlapping the CFW-stained component and lining of the terminal bulb cuticle. In addition, we observed enrichment of tagged IDPA-3 in the presumptive ECM that lies between the terminal bulb and the intestinal valve (white arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Tagged IDPB-3 was expressed weakly and localized exclusively to the pm6 cells and material surrounding the CFW-stained grinder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Tagged IDPC-1 had a similar pattern to that of tagged ABU-14; associating with both the anterior and posterior components of the pharyngeal cuticle. However, tagged ABU-14 appears to localize adjacent to CFW-stained components whereas tagged IDPC-1 overlaps CFW-stained components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Tagged NSPB-12 localized to the anterior pharynx cuticle components exclusively, including that of the buccal cavity, flaps, and anterior channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Tagged FIPR-4 localized to both anterior and posterior pharynx cuticle components (but not the grinder teeth proper) and the presumptive pharynx-intestinal valve ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

We explored the potential of the different protein sets to phase separate using three different predictive algorithms, including PSPredictor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chu et al., 2022</xref>), PLAAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lancaster et al., 2014</xref>), and LLPhyScore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cai et al., 2022</xref>). PLAAC was originally designed to scan for prion-like sequences, but has been retrospectively used as a reliable tool to predict phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vernon and Forman-Kay, 2019</xref>). Each algorithm reveals that the pharynx secretome is enriched in proteins with phase separation capability (p=2E-46, p=2E-52, and p=2E-31, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>).</p><p>We also examined low-complexity, intrinsic disorder and phase-separation propensity as a function of developmental time. The peak molting hour corresponds to a clear peak in low-complexity and intrinsic disorder of secreted products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A’ and B’</xref>). The other three predictors also show significant peaks in phase separation propensity of secreted products during the peak molting hour, but variably show peaks at other time points as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C’–E’</xref>). To better understand the relative abundance of gene products with the specific sequence features highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A’–E’</xref>, we multiplied the trait value for each gene with the relative number of transcripts for each respective gene. In this light, we see a striking peak of all trends at the peak molting hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A’’–E’’</xref>).

We first used the LARKS algorithm that predicts kinked b-structure, which can drive proto-filament assembly and reversible fiber formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hughes et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, we find a significant enrichment in LARKS scores within the pharynx secretome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). This prediction is corroborated by the LLPhyScore predictor of kinked b-structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). We also investigated whether the pharynx secretome is enriched in amyloidogenic proteins. Both the Budapest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Keresztes et al., 2021</xref>) and AmyloGram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burdukiewicz et al., 2017</xref>) machine-learning predictors, as well as the structure-based PATH predictor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wojciechowski and Kotulska, 2020</xref>), fail to show any enrichment within the pharynx secretome of amyloidogenic proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–G</xref>).</p><p>We further probed the ability of the pharynx secretome to form amyloid fibers using CR dye.

This is in sharp contrast to the colorless birefringence of the crystalizing compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). While CR specifically stains the pharynx cuticle, we found that CR-stained cuticles do not emit apple green birefringence (n &gt; 30) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I and J</xref>). We are confident that our imaging system is capable of detecting CR-derived apple green birefringence because of a serendipitous observation. We found that when CR is co-incubated with a small molecule (called wact-190) that forms crystals in the pharyngeal cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kamal et al., 2019</xref>), the resulting crystals exhibit apple green birefringence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K</xref>). We infer that this happens because CR likely becomes incorporated into a regular array, that is, the wact-190 crystal. Together, these results indicate that it is unlikely that the cuticle harbors rigid amyloid fibrils, which is consistent with both the flexible nature of the pharynx cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avery, 1993</xref>) and the absence of any detectable amyloid-like fibers in previous transmission electron micrographs of the pharynx cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wright and Thomson, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">White et al., 1986</xref>).

We then transformed the Cao and Packer et al. L2 pharynx subcluster data into transcript summaries (see ‘Materials and methods’) and examined the expression level of oscillating pharynx-enriched transcripts in each of the subclusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B and C</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for the relative location of each cell type).</p><p>During hours 3, 4, and 5, abundant products are secreted by the e epithelial cells, the mc3 marginal cells and presumptive pm6 and 7 transdifferentiated cells (see below). The identity of these transcripts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>) suggests that the cells are accumulating stores for the catabolism of the old cuticle and construction of the new one at the onset of the molt. Despite being confident in our assignment of cluster 11 as pm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">2</xref>), the expression profile of cluster 11 is more like the arcade, e epithelial cells, and mc3 marginal cells than muscle, suggesting that pm1 may also play a role in the catabolism of the old cuticle. This is consistent with the correlation between the pharynx UMAP plot for ABU-14 and what we observe in animals with fluorescently tagged ABU-14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and A’</xref>).</p><p>During hours 5 and 6 (which is the peak molting hour), the arcade and e epithelial cells produce abundant secreted components, consistent with the construction of a new buccal cuticle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B and D</xref>).

Subcluster 22, which is confidently identified as pm5, pm6, pm7, and pm8 muscle, express only low levels of secreted proteins during the peak molting hour. Previous work has shown that the pm6 and pm7 cells transdifferentiate from muscle into highly secretory cells during the molting period to build a larger grinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sparacio et al., 2020</xref>). Based on the expression of a combination of markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">2</xref>) and the abundant expression of secreted products, we infer that subclusters 1 and 5 represent transdifferentiated pm6 and pm7 that secrete many of the same components used in the anterior pharynx epithelia to build the grinder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B and F</xref>). We find that the IDPAs and IDPBs are expressed in the early transdifferentiating pm6 and pm7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), and therefore likely contribute to grinder formation. This prediction is consistent with our finding that disruption of IDPA-3, which localizes to the grinder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and B’</xref>), results in obvious grinder defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This prediction is also supported by the exclusive localization of tagged IDPB-3 to the grinder and pm6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and C’</xref>). Finally, <italic>idpb-1</italic> and <italic>idpp-3</italic> are two genes belonging to subcluster 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, hours 4 and 5) and Yuji Kohara’s mRNA in situ expression database reveals robust and specific expression of these two genes in only the posterior bulb cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Motohashi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Together, these observations are consistent with the assignment of subclusters 1 and 5 to the transdifferentiating pm6 and pm7 cells.</p><p>During the peak molting hour 6, IDPCs and the APPGs are expressed in most cells that contribute to the pharyngeal cuticle.

Tagged NSPB-12 supports this prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and E’</xref>). Tagged FIPR-4, while localizing to the anterior cuticle, is also present in the posterior cuticle, suggesting that secreted FIPR-4 may be able to diffuse extensively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and F’</xref>). Cytoplasmic components involved in muscle development peak in expression during hours 7 and 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C and F</xref>).</p><p>The number of genes expressed from the gland cells is not obviously enriched in any one temporal interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B and C</xref>), yet the overall abundance of gland transcripts peak in hour 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This apparent contradiction is due to the two most abundantly expressed genes from the gland, <italic>phat-2</italic> and <italic>phat-4</italic>, peaking in expression during hour 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

PHAT-2 and PHAT-4 notwithstanding, the overall temporal pattern of expression from the gland suggests that its products do not play a large role in cuticle turnover during the molt.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>A model of pharyngeal cuticle construction</title><p>Here, we have mined published resources to bioinformatically reconstruct the <italic>C. elegans</italic> pharynx cuticle. This map provides unprecedented insight into the spatiotemporal progression of cuticle construction. During hours 3 and 4, genes that encode homologs of chitin and amyloid catabolic enzymes peak in their expression. These include the predicted chitinases CHT-1, CHT-2, CHT-5, CHT-6, two predicted amyloid peptidases (NEP-1 and NEP-12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Iwata et al., 2001</xref>), and the NAS-6 protease that helps degrade pharyngeal cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sparacio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Park et al., 2010</xref>). The predicted amyloid-fibril inhibitor ITM-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>) also peaks in expression during this interval, perhaps to prevent aggregation during disassembly. The expression profile at this interval is consistent with preparation for apolysis (the detachment of the old cuticle).</p><p>During hours 4, 5, and 6, anabolic enzymes and constructive components peak in expression. These include the characterized chitin synthase CHS-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), putative chitosan synthases LGX-1 and CHTS-1 that deacetylates chitin to produce chitosan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heustis et al., 2012</xref>), and putative chitin binders and cross-linkers CHTB-1, CHTB-2, and CHTB-3. In this interval, components implicated in amyloid metabolism also peak in expression. These include a predicted amyloid chaperone LRX-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cam et al., 2004</xref>), two predicted amyloid-chitin linkers LRPC-1 and PQN-74 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brodeur et al., 2012</xref>), and a predicted amyloid precursor protein interactor FEH-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McLoughlin and Miller, 2008</xref>).</p><p>During hours 5 and 6, a massive increase in gene expression of the pharynx secretome occurs.

We also see the peak expression of the low-complexity families NSPB and FIPR, which are likely added to the cuticle in its final phase of maturation.

In addition, multiple predicted amyloid regulators are upregulated during pharyngeal cuticle development. Yet, evidence argues against the presence of amyloid fibrils within the pharynx cuticle. We speculate that fibril formation may not occur within the pharyngeal cuticle because of the heterogeneous mixture of the IDR-rich proteins within the structure. In other words, the relatively low concentration of any one protein species within the cuticle mixture may preclude the assembly of long fibrils with birefringent properties. Indeed, the presence of other IDRs antagonizes Abeta42 fibril formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ikeda et al., 2020</xref>). A second factor that may antagonize fibril formation is the presence of a chitin matrix. During the formation of the squid beak, IDR-rich proteins form phase-separated coacervates that infiltrate a chitin matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tan et al., 2015</xref>), which may limit amyloid fibril formation. It is unknown whether similar dynamics take place during pharyngeal cuticle development. Third, the pharynx secretome is enriched with kinked β-structure that can support liquid-phase separation and may facilitate protofilament formation but otherwise antagonizes extensive fibril growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hughes et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, many well-characterized proteins with amyloidogenic propensity only form fibrils when associated with pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cremades et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The idea that the pharyngeal cuticle contains a non-rigid network of IDRs is appealing because the pharyngeal cuticle must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate pharynx movements along the dorsal–ventral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2008</xref>) and anterior–posterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avery, 1993</xref>) axes. Indeed, others have suggested that IDR-rich proteins within chitin-based cuticles might add elastic properties to what might otherwise be an inflexible chitin-based material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen, 2011</xref>). An elastic cuticle might also aid in returning the open and extended lumen (which results from pharynx muscle contraction) to the relaxed ground state position.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Potential contributions of IDPs to the cycles of cuticle formation and destruction</title><p>A key feature of phase-separating IDRs is their potential to reversibly transition between different states of matter depending on local conditions and post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Murray et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deiana et al., 2019</xref>), including liquids and gel-like biomaterials. The pharyngeal cuticle must soften, be shed, and be reconstructed about every 8 hr during larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lazetic and Fay, 2017</xref>). The notion that a network of IDR-rich proteins is not locked into a rigid state but may instead be regulated to increase or decrease intermolecular interactions and change material properties as needed during the molting cycle is an appealing idea that requires further investigation.</p><p>Both the APPGs and the IDPBs are highly enriched with cysteines and contribute heavily to an increase in the relative abundance of cysteines that is likely deposited into the developing cuticle as the animal prepares to molt. Other work has shown that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> cuticle is indeed rich in disulfides during the intermolt period and becomes reduced to facilitate apolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stenvall et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, exogenously supplied reducing agent can induce pharyngeal cuticle apolysis during the intermolt period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stenvall et al., 2011</xref>). Manipulating the redox state of cysteines can alter the ability of IDR-rich proteins to phase separate or further condense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reed and Hammer, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kato et al., 2019</xref>). Whether the abundant cysteines within the pharyngeal cuticle are key to phase separation and yield a network of variably dynamic cross-linked proteins remains to be determined.</p><p>The spatiotemporal map suggests that many different types of IDPs likely contribute to the pharyngeal cuticle. Previous studies have shown that coexisting condensed protein phases, each with distinct protein compositions, can yield complex biomaterials with layers and other non-uniform properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mountain and Keating, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lu and Spruijt, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). The distinct compositions of the six families uncovered by the spatiotemporal map are suggestive of the potential immiscibility of their condensed phases and of physical mechanisms for building the cuticle, particularly when combined with varying temporal expression, similar to what is observed during cuticle formation of the mussel byssus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jehle et al., 2020</xref>). What is becoming clearer is how evolution has repeatedly capitalized on biomolecular condensates to make complex protective structures.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The molecular composition of cuticles may be evolutionarily plastic</title><p>The extent to which the blueprint of <italic>C. elegans</italic> pharyngeal cuticle development is conserved among other phyla within Ecdysozoa is unknown.

Mounting evidence also indicates that the arthropod cuticle has abundant IDR-rich proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen, 2011</xref>) with amyloid-like folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sviben et al., 2020</xref>). However, of the 12 families of known arthropod cuticle proteins, only CPAP1 and CPAP3 have recognizable conservation with nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Willis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Muthukrishnan et al., 2019</xref>). CPAP1/3 are defined by the ChtBD2 chitin-binding domain that is also harbored in the pharyngeal cuticle proteins CHTB-2, LRPC-1, and PQN-74. CPR is the only other arthropod cuticle family protein beyond the CPAPs that is well-characterized to bind chitin; the function of the remaining families remains obscure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Willis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Muthukrishnan et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, homologs of the six low-complexity families found within the pharyngeal cuticle cannot be found beyond Nematoda. It is not clear whether the IDR-rich proteins of arthropod and nematode cuticles are of distinct evolutionary origin or have simply diverged beyond recognition because of reduced primary sequence constraints.

First, what is the mechanism by which the temporal unfurling of gene expression is coordinated? While the global oscillatory pattern of <italic>C. elegans</italic> gene expression has been modeled in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meeuse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hutchison et al., 2020</xref>), how the oscillatory pattern of each gene becomes temporally offset from other oscillating genes is not understood. One candidate regulator of oscillation is the <italic>C. elegans</italic> period ortholog LIN-42. LIN-42 is a known regulator of developmental timing in the worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jeon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McCulloch and Rougvie, 2014</xref>), is expressed in the pharynx and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Monsalve et al., 2011</xref>), and alters the timing of molting when disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Monsalve et al., 2011</xref>). Temporally uncoordinated gene expression would almost certainly be lethal, yet <italic>lin-42</italic> null mutants are viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Edelman et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that other key regulators are involved. Investigating the relationship between tissue-restricted transcription factors and their targets as a function of developmental time may provide insight into the coordinated temporal regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roy, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Second, how are catabolic and anabolic processes separated and regulated? The process of molting leaves animals vulnerable and must occur rapidly. In that light, it is perhaps not surprising that we observe a temporal overlap of expression of catabolic and anabolic components. Previous work on the ultrastructure of the grinder cuticle and molt indicates that dense core vesicles (DCVs) lie in wait until the new cuticle is assembled, at which point the DCVs likely fuse with the plasma membrane and dump their contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sparacio et al., 2020</xref>). Based on the timing of the peak expression of secreted components with respect to the timing of the molt itself, we surmise that (1) there is a temporal lag between the period of peak expression for a given gene and when protein abundance peaks, and (2) unknown mechanisms regulate the timing at which catabolic and anabolic components, perhaps within distinct DCVs, are released into the ECM. In this way, it might be possible to have temporal overlap in the peak expression of genes that encode catabolic and anabolic components. Exactly how the secretion of catabolic and anabolic components is regulated remains to be determined.</p><p>Finally, how are patterns within the pharyngeal cuticle established? Cuticle lumen shape and size are likely patterned by the underlying cells, but this simply extends the question. How is the patterning of the electron-dense cuticle ribbing established? Is the information that governs pattern of the flaps, which is seemingly independent of the shape of nearby cells, contained within the flaps’ protein components? Do the successive waves of expression of low-complexity protein families contribute to the layering of the cuticle seen in the electron micrograph cross sections? How might coexisting condensed phases of these proteins establish layering and other complexities of the cuticle structure? The spatiotemporal map of pharyngeal cuticle construction presented here may serve as the foundation for answering these and other questions in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> culture, microscopy, and synchronization</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were cultured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kamal et al., 2019</xref>).

Insertion of the mGreenLantern sequence was identified by PCR and confirmed by sequencing.</p><p>IDPA-3, IDPB-3, FIPR-4, and NSPB-12 were tagged C-terminally with mNeonGreen. The mNeonGreen coding sequence was PCR-amplified from the <italic>C. elegans</italic> strain WD835 (a kind gift from Brent Derry) using the following primers: 5-mNeon (5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GTCAGACCGGTGGCGGTGGATCAGTCTCCAAGGGAGAGGAGGACAACATGG</named-content>-3′) and 3-mNeon (5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">TTACGGAATTCTCACCCTTGTAGAGCTCGTCCATTCCCATG</named-content>-3′). The 5-mNeon primer introduced a flexible GGGGS linker sequence to the epitope tag. The resulting PCR product was purified, digested with AgeI and EcoRI, and the 728 bp fragment was ligated to the 5 kb AgeI/EcoRI digested pPRGS762 (<italic>unc-6p</italic>::YFP) vector backbone to generate pPRJK1199 (<italic>unc-6p</italic>-mNeonGreen-<italic>unc-54</italic> 3′UTR).

The PCR products were purified, digested with PstI and AgeI (IDPA-3, IDPB-3, FIPR-4) or NsiI and AgeI (NSPB-12), and ligated to the 4.2 kb fragment of the PstI/AgeI digested pPRJK1199 vector to generate pPRJK1213 (idpa-3p::IDPA-3::mNeonGreen [1232 bp of sequence upstream of the ATG]), pPRJK1202 (idpb-3p::IDPB-3::mNeonGreen [334 bp of sequence upstream of the ATG]), pPRJK1212 (fipr-4p::FIPR-4::mNeonGreen [1360 bp of sequence upstream of the ATG]), and pPRJK1203 (nspb-12p::NSPB-12::mNeonGreen [1973 bp of sequence upstream of the ATG]), respectively. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Wildtype <italic>C. elegans</italic> N2 worms were injected with each of the constructs described above along with the pPRGS382 (<italic>myo-2p</italic>::mCherry) co-injection marker at the following concentrations for expression analysis: pPRJK1213 (10 ng/μL) + pPRGS382 (2 ng/μL) + pKS (88 ng/μL); pPRJK1202 (10 ng/μL) + pPRGS382 (2 ng/μL) + pKS (88 ng/μL); pPRJK1212 (10 ng/μL) + pPRGS382 (2 ng/μL) + pKS (88 ng/μL); pPRJK1203 (10 ng/μL) + pPRGS382 (2 ng/μL) + pKS (88 ng/μL).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Pulse-chase analyses</title><p>Synchronized wildtype L1 worms are plated on 10 cm plates at 7000 L1s/plate seeded with OP50 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain. Plates with worms destined for pulse-chase analyses of larvae or adults are grown at 16°C or 25°C, respectively. Then, 72 hr after plating, the ‘L3’ samples and the ‘adult’ samples are washed with M9 to remove bacteria. The concentrations and solvents for all dyes are described in the relevant methods section. In all cases, 50 µL of packed worms from centrifugation are used per tube in the dye incubation. Note that the number of worms should not exceed 1000 because adding more worms reduces stain intensity. Also, siliconized tips are used with the ends cut with flame-sterilized scissors to avoid injuring the worms. The tubes with worms and dye are then incubated on a nutator for 3 hr in the dark at room temperature. After incubation, the 1.5 mL tubes are spun at 5000 rpm for 1 min and the concentrated pellet is carefully transferred to 15 mL falcon tube and washed with 8 mL of M9 buffer to remove excess dye. The tubes are inverted gently and spun at 2000 rpm for 1 min. The supernatant is removed and the concentrated washed worms are spotted onto the clear (agar) surface of 6 cm plates seeded with OP50. Then, 30 min later, 20–30 worms are picked onto a second plate lightly seeded with OP50. The staining of the cuticle for each is then semi-quantitatively assessed on an epifluorescent microscope. These data represent the pre-chase counts. The scoring system was as follows: animals exhibiting robust staining in the buccal cavity and anterior channels = 3; animals exhibiting moderate staining in the buccal cavity and anterior channels = 2; animals showing faint staining in the buccal cavity and anterior channels = 1; animals showing no detectable staining in any part of the pharynx cuticle = 0. The remaining animals on the original 6 cm plate are incubated for a total of 18 hr at 20°C, after which dye staining of the cuticle is quantified. These data represent the post-chase counts.</p><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Generating <italic>mlt-9(RNAi</italic>) Cuticle Defects</title><p><italic>mlt-9</italic> RNAi was carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frand et al., 2005</xref>) with some modifications.

The LLPhyScore algorithm is a machine learning-based interpretable predictive algorithm that is based on the idea that a combination of multiple different physical interactions drives protein liquid–liquid phase separation. A protein’s LLPhyScore is a weighted combination of eight sub-scores, each representing one physical feature that is inferred from the input sequence. These physical features include protein–water interactions, hydrogen bonds, pi–pi interactions, disorder, kinked-beta structure, and electrostatics. The scores are optimized via training with 500+ experimentally known phase-separating protein sequences against selected negative sequences. More details about this algorithm can be found in the manuscript in preparation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>AmyloGram and path analyses</title><p>AmyloGram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burdukiewicz et al., 2017</xref>) is a method based on machine learning, trained on hexapeptides experimentally tested for their amyloidogenic propensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wozniak and Kotulska, 2015</xref>). Amino acids are represented by the alphabet that best encoded amyloidogenicity of peptides modeled by n-grams, and it was optimized by a random forest classifier. Classification of a protein amyloidogenicity included calculating its profile with a hexapeptide window shifting along the protein chain. Proteins with amyloid propensity were identified on the basis of an appearance of at least one amyloidogenic fragment. To avoid an excessive number of false positives, non-default specificity values were used: 0.95 and 0.99.</p><p>PATH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wojciechowski and Kotulska, 2020</xref>) uses molecular modeling and machine learning.

A potentially amyloidogenic query sequence of a hexapeptide was threaded on seven representative amyloid templates. Comparative structure modeling provided evaluation of the models with statistics and physics-based functions. Next, the scores were used by the logistic regression classifier. The analyses with PATH were carried out in two stages. The first scan along the protein chain was done by AmyloGram with the specificity threshold at 0.99, which was then followed by structural modeling and classification using PATH. The second stage was only applied to amyloid-positive regions found by AmyloGram.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>LARKS analyses</title><p>LARKS predictions were done on a proteome downloaded from WormBase on October 18, 2021. Sequences not completely comprised of the 20 canonical amino acids were rejected from analysis. Each protein from the filtered proteome set of 20,042 proteins was then submitted for LARKS predictions. First, the sequence was separated into a series of overlapping hexapeptide segments (each segment overlapped with five residues from the segment before it; a 150 amino acid sequence contains 145 hexapeptides). The sidechains for each residue in a hexapeptide are computationally grafted onto a fibril model for each of three different LARKS structures (FUS-SYSGYS, FUS-STGGYG, and hnRNPA1-GYNGFG; PDB IDs: 6BWZ, 6BZP, and 6BXX). Energy minimization is done using a Rosetta energy score as a readout, and if the final energy is below a backbone-dependent threshold, then hexapeptide segment is considered a LARKS. Proteins’ LARKS content was determined by the number of favorable LARKS segments divided by the length of the protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In vitro expression and analysis of IDPs</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Expression vectors and constructs</title><p>All protein expression vectors generated for this work were derivatives of the pMBP-FUS-FL-WT (a gift from Nicolas Fawzi [Addgene plasmid # 98651; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://n2t.net/addgene">http://n2t.net/addgene</ext-link>:98651; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_98651">Addgene_98651;</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burke et al., 2015</xref>], which was modified to remove the FUS1 coding region and to have two cloning sites BamHI and NotI) for facile cloning of new proteins in phase with the HIS-tagged Maltose Binding Protein (MBP) at the N-terminus followed by a TEV protease cleavage site (TEVcs) to generate pPRRH1197.

85% of all animals, and how cuticles are formed is very poorly understood, in particular in light of the fact that cuticles are shed and regrown as animals grow. The authors present a comprehensively and carefully curated resource of the components of the pharyngeal cuticle of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and provide a spatiotemporal framework to understand cuticle assembly. In doing so, the authors propose a function for a large class of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). The significance of this work is high because our understanding of both cuticle formation and of IDPs is poor.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79396.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Cochella</surname><given-names>Luisa</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00za53h95</institution-id><institution>Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.03.11.483951">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.11.483951v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

However, they also agree this needs to be supported by direct observation: i.e. generation and analysis of at least 2-3 fluorescent reporter lines (tagging at least one member of each of the newly described protein families). The endogenous tagging approach used for idpc-1 would be the preferred approach, as this will report endogenous expression patterns.

We now have made fusion proteins with a representative of all five relevant classes of proteins, including IDPA-3, IDPB-3, IDPC-1, NSPB-12, and FIPR-4. We also included additional analysis of ABU-14, a member of the APPG class of proteins. The expression of all six proteins is driven by their own promoter/enhancer elements upstream of their ATG. As described in David Raizen’s 2014 paper (PMID 25361578), the ABU-14 fusion protein is driven from a transgenic repetitive array. Save IDPC-1, in which we previously contracted InVivoBiosystems Inc to chromosomally tag, the expression of the remaining four reporters is driven with a transgenic repetitive array.</p><p>As Figure 6 shows, all six fusion proteins are expressed in association with the pharynx exclusively and localize to the pharynx cuticle. This conclusion is supported by the pattern of the tagged proteins localized to what is obvious cuticle structures (flaps, channel ribbing, grinder etc) and colocalization with the chitin stain Calcofluor White (CFW). What we find particularly striking is how closely the resulting patterns are predicted by the Cao and Packer et al. UMAP plots, which we also provide in Figure 6. Together with the other (multiple) lines of supporting evidence in the Results section titled ‘Orthogonal Data Validate the Spatiotemporal Map’<bold>,</bold> we hope these new observations satisfies the Reviewers and Editor.</p></body></sub-article></article>
