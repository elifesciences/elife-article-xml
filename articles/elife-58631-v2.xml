Although generally safe they are potentially lethal in overdose. In-vitro data suggest that high concentrations and thus high doses are needed for COVID-19 infections, but as yet there is no convincing evidence of clinical efficacy. Bayesian regression models were fitted to survival outcomes and electrocardiograph QRS durations from 302 prospectively studied French patients who had taken intentional chloroquine overdoses, of whom 33 died (11%), and 16 healthy volunteers who took 620 mg base chloroquine single doses. Whole blood concentrations of 13.5 µmol/L (95% credible interval 10.1–17.7) were associated with 1% mortality. Prolongation of ventricular depolarization is concentration-dependent with a QRS duration &gt;150 msec independently highly predictive of mortality in chloroquine self-poisoning. Pharmacokinetic modeling predicts that most high dose regimens trialled in COVID-19 are unlikely to cause serious cardiovascular toxicity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are closely-related drugs used for the treatment of malaria and rheumatological conditions, such as lupus. Laboratory tests have indicated that these drugs could also be used against the virus that causes COVID-19. Given the urgent need, these drugs have been fast-tracked into large-scale clinical trials, bypassing the usual stages that would provide estimates for suitable dosage. The dosage is a critical factor in a clinical trial: too low and the drug will not have an effect, too high and the side effects may counteract any potential benefits.</p><p>Laboratory tests suggest that higher doses of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are needed for treating COVID-19 compared to malaria or lupus. However, there are concerns about the high doses used in some trials, as the drugs can have lethal side effects. Indeed, chloroquine has been used extensively in suicide attempts, particularly in France.</p><p>To address these concerns, Watson et al. set out to determine the highest dosage of chloroquine (and thus of hydroxychloroquine, approximately) that does not cause unacceptable side effects. First, data was analysed regarding the concentration of chloroquine in the blood of 302 patients who had intentionally overdosed on the drug, since this concentration is tightly correlated with their risk of death. Watson et al. used a statistical model to calculate the maximal chloroquine concentration in a person’s blood associated with a one per cent risk of death. This is taken to be the threshold above which any potential benefit of chloroquine treatment would be outweighed by the possibility of lethal toxicity. Watson et al. also estimated the relationship between chloroquine concentrations and changes in electrocardiogram patterns, which record the electrical activity of the heart. This makes it possible to determine whether a high dose of chloroquine has led to dangerous levels in the blood.</p><p>Using a mathematical model of how chloroquine is metabolised, Watson et al. predicted that most of the trials that tested chloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 did not reach the calculated threshold concentration. An exception was the CloroCovid-19 trial in Brazil, which was stopped early because people in the higher dosage group suffered more heart problems and died in greater numbers than those in the lower dosage group.</p><p>Two large randomised trials, RECOVERY and SOLIDARITY, have shown no benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19, changing clinical practice worldwide. Both of these trials used high doses resulting in higher hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine concentrations than normally observed in the treatment of malaria or rheumatological conditions. The results from Watson et al demonstrate that the lack of benefit seen in these two large clinical trials is not due to the drug dosage being too high.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chloroquine</kwd><kwd>overdose</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>pharmacodynamics</kwd><kwd>bayesian</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Principal Research Fellowship 093956/Z/10/C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Most chloroquine regimens trialled for the treatment of COVID19 will not result in life-threatening cardiovascular toxicity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are closely related 4-aminoquinoline drugs used for the treatment of malaria, amoebiasis and rheumatological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">World Health Organization, 2015</xref>). Until the late 1990s chloroquine was the drug of choice for the treatment of malaria. Hundreds of tons corresponding to over 200 million doses were consumed annually. Since then its use has declined because of widespread resistance in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. Today there is greater use of hydroxychloroquine in rheumatoid arthritis and discoid and systemic lupus erythematosus. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are antivirals with a broad range of activities (including flaviviruses, retroviruses, and coronaviruses) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Savarino et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mégarbane and Scherrmann, 2020</xref>). Their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV2 is expected to be weak as predicted unbound concentrations of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in vivo with currently recommended doses are lower than the half-maximal effect concentrations reported in Vero cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">White et al., 2020</xref>). This has motivated trialling of higher loading and maintenance doses than usually given in malaria or hepatic amoebiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">World Health Organization, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conan, 1949</xref>). As of the 11th June 2020, 77 interventional clinical trials evaluating these drugs in both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 were registered and recruiting participants on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows a scatter plot of the duration versus total dose in base equivalent for the 55 trials using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of hospitalised COVID-19 patients for which exact dosing could be extracted. The doses and durations varied greatly. The high doses used by some trials have caused concern over the potential for cardiovascular toxicity. Nevertheless, despite the lack of any convincing evidence of clinical benefit, these drugs are now being used extensively in COVID-19 prevention and treatment across the world. Sadly, patients who need hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for the treatment of malaria and rheumatological conditions are often having difficulty obtaining them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Straits Times, 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The total chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine dose (in grams) and duration of 55 COVID-19 treatment trials currently recruiting participants, extracted from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> on the 11th June 2020.</title><p>The black open square boxes show the four ‘flat’ dosing chloroquine regimens simulated in this paper.

The trial was stopped early after recruiting only 81 patients because of cardiac toxicity and greater mortality in the higher dose group; two of 41 patients given the higher dose regimen developed ventricular tachycardia before death and 7 of 37 patients in this group developed electrocardiograph QTcF intervals over 500 msec compared with 4 of 36 in the lower dose group. The higher dose regimen, comprising 600 mg base chloroquine administered twice daily for ten days, is substantially higher than recommended in malaria or rheumatological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">World Health Organization, 2015</xref>) and represents the standard malaria loading dose repeated 19 times at 12 hr intervals.</p><p>Chloroquine is dangerous in overdose and has been used extensively for suicide. High concentrations of chloroquine cause hypotension, arrhythmias, coma, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and fatal cardiac arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Riou et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemessy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clemessy et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mégarbane et al., 2010</xref>). In Zimbabwe the mortality of chloroquine in overdose was approximately six times higher than for other drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ball et al., 2002</xref>). In France in the early 1980s there was a suicide epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Riou et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemessy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clemessy et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mégarbane et al., 2010</xref> ) following the publication of a book entitled <italic>Suicide: mode d’emploi</italic> (Suicide: a how-to guide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guillon and Le Bonniec, 1982</xref>). This unfortunate experience allowed characterization of the factors associated with death from chloroquine overdose. Outcome in chloroquine self-poisoning depends on the dose ingested, the delay in reaching hospital and the quality of intensive care support. Using the blood concentration measurements taken from self-poisoning patients managed by experienced intensivists in the French National referral centre allowed development of a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model to estimate the relationship between chloroquine dosing and a fatal outcome. A pooled analysis using electrocardiograph QRS interval data from healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pukrittayakamee et al., 2014</xref>) and from the French self-poisoning cohorts helped characterise the contribution of QRS prolongation to the recorded QT prolongation. These models were used to estimate the safety of the main treatment regimens currently used in COVID-19 clinical trials and of the standard malaria treatment regimen for comparison.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Predicting mortality in self-poisoning from peak chloroquine concentrations</title><p>We pooled individual patient whole blood chloroquine + desethylchloroquine concentrations and outcomes from three large prospectively studied hospital self-poisoning cohorts (n = 302, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, top panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Riou et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemessy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clemessy et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mégarbane et al., 2010</xref>). All the patients included in this analysis were treated in the same hospital in Paris and all had whole blood concentrations measured on admission. The overall mortality was 11% (33 of 302).

The distribution of differences on the log scale between admission whole blood concentrations and peak concentrations in patients who peaked after hospital admission was used to estimate a correction term for all other patients. Bayesian logistic regression was used to estimate the relationship between mortality and inferred whole blood peak chloroquine concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, bottom panel) specifically adjusted for the desethyl metabolite levels and for the non-observed peak concentrations in 241 (80%) of the patients.

The whole blood chloroquine concentration associated with 1% mortality was 13.5 µmol/L (95% C.I. 10.1 to 17.7). 1% is the lowest mortality for which a reliable estimate can be derived from these data.

Five of the simulated regimens are potential COVID treatment regimens, and one is the standard malaria treatment regimen. A very wide range of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine regimens are currently in use for the treatment of COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Assuming a whole blood to plasma concentration ratio of 4, the whole blood-based model and the plasma-based model predicted approximately identical median C<sub>max</sub> values. Thus, the whole blood pharmacokinetic model provides higher estimates for fatal toxicity because it predicts a larger variance for the C<sub>max</sub> distribution and hence more extreme outliers. As a sensitivity analysis, the equivalent outputs for the plasma-based model are shown in Appendix 4.</p><p>Based on the whole blood model, the median C<sub>max</sub> following a chloroquine dose of 600 mg base equivalent given twice daily for ten days to a 70 kg adult is 10.7 µmol/L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, panel A). This is more than three times higher than the median C<sub>max</sub> for the chloroquine malaria treatment regimen at the same body weight. Approximately 60% of 70 kg adults continuing to receive the twice daily 600 mg dose have blood concentrations which rise into the ‘danger zone’ defined as whole blood concentrations above 10 µmol/L. In comparison, only two in a thousand 70 kg adults receiving the twice daily 310 mg base maintenance dose (as given in the SOLIDARITY and RECOVERY trials) for ten days would reach concentrations above 10 µmol/L (approximately the lower bound for the 1% mortality threshold). Taking into account the uncertainty around this threshold value, the model estimates that fewer than one per thousand receiving the twice daily 310 mg dose would have peak concentrations above the 1% mortality threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, panel B). Clearly body weight is an important determinant of exposure if doses are not adjusted for weight, as is common with oral administration (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine tablets usually contain 155 mg base). At most, two in a thousand 40 kg adults receiving the 3 day malaria treatment regimen without weight adjustment (i.e. an unusually high mg/kg dose) are predicted to reach peak concentrations above 10 µmol/L.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The predicted risk of potentially fatal chloroquine toxicity across the six regimens simulated under the whole blood pharmacokinetic model.</title><p>Panel A shows the simulated distribution of C<sub>max</sub> values in a 70 kg adult for the five COVID-19 treatment regimens under evaluation and the standard malaria treatment regimen.

The risk of death is proportional to drug exposure. Mortality rises steeply at whole blood chloroquine concentrations above 10 µmol/L. This corresponds very approximately to a plasma concentration of 3 µmol/L, and a combined chloroquine and desethylchloroquine concentration (as in a spectrophotometric assay) of 14 µmol/L. Importantly the electrocardiograph is a valuable indicator of toxicity as potentially lethal levels are associated with significant QRS complex widening. A QRS duration of less than 100 msec makes lethal toxicity very unlikely. When using high-dose treatments weight adjusted dosing is important to avoid toxicity.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Implications for COVID treatment regimens</title><p>Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are already being used extensively, and often in high doses, to prevent and treat COVID-19 despite the current lack of convincing evidence of benefit. Use of these drugs has become extremely politicised. The first large randomised trial in the treatment of hospitalised patients has just reported (RECOVERY, NCT04381936: press release only at the time of writing, results are not yet peer reviewed). This result strongly suggests that hydroxychloroquine (and also lopinavir-ritonavir) does not benefit hospitalised patients. The preliminary results of the same trial show that dexamethasone has a major life saving benefit in patients receiving oxygen or being ventilated. This supports a paradigm of early benefit from an effective antiviral and late benefit from an anti-inflammatory drug. Thus there remains a potential role for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in prevention and early treatment. However the prevention trials will not report for many months hence. Confusion over the risks associated with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine has been compounded by a recent high profile claim of increased mortality and high rates of ventricular arrhythmia in a very large observational data set. This data set was almost certainly fabricated (and the paper was subsequently retracted, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mehra et al., 2020</xref>). Unfortunately over-reactions by some regulatory agencies, unjustified extrapolations of risk from QT measurements, failure to distinguish the effects of the drugs given alone from the combination with azithromycin, and misunderstanding of their clinical pharmacology have conspired to reduce confidence in these drugs and jeopardise the very trials needed to characterise risks and benefits in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">White et al., 2020</xref>). Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have unusual pharmacokinetic properties with very large total apparent volumes of distribution (V<sub><italic>d</italic></sub>) (chloroquine &gt; hydroxychloroquine) and very slow terminal elimination rates (terminal half-lives exceed one month) which cannot be measured accurately. Thus, distribution processes, rather than elimination, govern the blood concentration profiles in the first days following the start of treatment. Large single doses (as in self-poisoning) are very dangerous because they result in high blood concentrations as the drugs distribute out from a central ‘compartment’ that is hundreds of times smaller than the total apparent V<sub><italic>d</italic></sub> (compartmental modeling of chloroquine pharmacokinetics provides only an approximation of the distribution processes). These high concentrations can cause potentially lethal cardiovascular and nervous system toxicity. Chloroquine affects cardiac muscle depolarization, repolarization and contractility and also causes vasodilation. There is concentration-dependent electrocardiograph QRS widening and JT prolongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemessy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clemessy et al., 1996</xref>) which both contribute to QT prolongation. Death usually results from refractory hypotension or ventricular fibrillation. Self-poisoning with chloroquine has provided an unfortunate opportunity to correlate drug exposure with the risk of iatrogenic death.</p><p>As chloroquine has relatively weak antiviral activity, if there is benefit in COVID-19 infections, it is likely to require high drug exposures. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic a large number of investigators started studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The toxicity thresholds were not well defined and a range of dose regimens were evaluated in the hope that benefits would exceed risks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The high dose chloroquine regimen evaluated by Borba et al. in Brazil did encounter cardiac toxicity. This study referenced the recommendations by the Health Commission of Guangdong Province based on the Chinese experience, but there may have been confusion between salt and base weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Multicenter collaboration group of Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province and Health Commission of Guangdong Province for chloroquine in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia, 2020</xref>). Whereas the Chinese authorities recommended 500 mg <italic>salt</italic> twice daily (two tablets of chloroquine phosphate 250 mg, comprising 155 mg base each), the Brazil study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Borba et al., 2020</xref>) gave doses in base equivalent (600 mg base 12 hourly) which were consequently much higher. Importantly the patients in the Brazilian study also received azithromycin (which also prolongs the QT interval, and this may well have contributed to ventricular arrhythmias, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saleh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lane et al., 2020</xref>). This pharmacometric analysis of the French self-poisoning cohorts provides an evidence-based toxicity threshold. It suggests that a continued regimen of 600 mg twice daily can be directly lethal. Lower dose regimens such as those evaluated in the large RECOVERY and SOLIDARITY trials, and the original Guangdong recommendations, are predicted to be safe. Doses of chloroquine alone, resulting in peak concentrations greater than 10 µmol/L are associated with more than 1% risk of fatal toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Limitations</title><p>There are several limitations to this study. It is a retrospective individual patient data analysis. In the suicide attempts, other drugs or alcohol were often taken as well, although none with the acute lethal toxicity of chloroquine. Patients were managed by experienced intensivists on intensive care units where there was close clinical and laboratory monitoring. Mortality might be higher in less well supported settings, or in overloaded hospitals in high-income settings. The age range in self-poisoning is also younger than in the majority of more seriously ill COVID-19 patients. The spectrophotometric assay method does not separate chloroquine from its desethylated metabolite, and is relatively insensitive. Desethychloroquine has generally similar biological properties, and the assay performs well at the high concentrations of relevance to this study. We corrected for the presence of the metabolite under the Bayesian model, but this correction increases uncertainty around the threshold concentration associated with 1% mortality. The predictions of absolute mortality under the regimens simulated in this work are sensitive to the parameterization of the pharmacokinetic model. C<sub>max</sub> is not observed directly but is an output model-based quantity estimated from data. There are no large population pharmacokinetic studies to verify the precision of the C<sub>max</sub> predictions, especially for the critical upper tails of the distribution.</p><p>The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model developed here was based on the largest prospective series of chloroquine self-poisonings studied in a single referral centre. However, it was not possible to apply a standard pharmacokinetic model to the observed data in order to estimate the individual C<sub>max</sub> values. Mainly because of vomiting, admission blood concentrations only weakly correlate with the self-administered chloroquine doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemessy et al., 1995</xref>). Our model was based on a majority of admission whole blood concentrations. The data from patients whose peak drug concentrations occurred after hospital admission were used to approximate the difference between unobserved peak concentrations and admission concentrations in the remaining patients. Overall, the admission concentrations were estimated to be approximately 5% lower on average than the peak concentrations. This corresponds to prior expectations: the mean interval to hospitalization for this large self-poisoning cohort was 4.5 hr compared with an average time to peak concentration after oral administration of 3 hr (range 1–6 hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pukrittayakamee et al., 2014</xref>). The outcome of chloroquine poisoning depends on the quality of intensive care support. Over the period of this retrospective review, in addition to the experience gained in this one referral centre, there were significant improvements in intensive care which would have improved the prognosis for a given drug exposure. Sustaining the cardiorespiratory system mechanically with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mégarbane et al., 2007</xref>) while toxic concentrations decline as the drug distributes may have made a significant contribution to improved survival.</p><p>One death occurred in a 32-year-old female who took 2.8 grams of chloroquine phosphate and whose admission whole blood chloroquine+desethychloroquine concentration was 9.8 µmol/L. She had homozygous sickle cell disease and an admission hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dL. She was treated with ECMO and blood transfusion. She died from hemorrhagic ARDS even though her cardiac function improved. It is likely that acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease contributed significantly to the fatal outcome associated with chloroquine overdose.</p><p>Our analysis does not make specific predictions for the toxicity of hydroxychloroquine regimens currently in use for the treatment of COVID-19. The majority of clinical trials are evaluating hydroxychloroquine, not chloroquine, as it is considered to be slightly safer and is more widely available in the countries where most trials are being conducted. Although hydroxychloroquine has a wider therapeutic margin in experimental animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McChesney, 1983</xref>), it has generally similar pharmacokinetic properties and, although there are limited data, the pharmacodynamic properties are also generally similar to chloroquine. The clinical features of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in overdose are also similar. But unlike chloroquine, there are no large cohorts of hydroxychloroquine self-poisoning on which to define toxicity thresholds. Thus, given available toxicity data, it is very unlikely that equivalent hydroxychloroquine concentrations to chloroquine are more dangerous, but rather that the safety margins are wider. Our systematic review of regimens currently being used for the treatment of COVID identified one trial currently recruiting patients (PATCH, NCT04329923) which is administering very high doses of hydroxychloroquine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This dose of 1200 mg/day (930 mg base/day) for 14 days would be predicted to have a significant risk of incurring dangerous toxicity were hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to have molar equivalent toxicities. However the majority of regimens currently being tested for COVID-19 treatment are predicted to be safe.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Electrocardiograph QT concerns limit COVID-19 studies</title><p>Concerns over QT prolongation dominate the reasons for not endorsing or not participating in COVID 19 trials with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Many recent articles on COVID-19 therapeutics caution against the risks of iatrogenic ‘torsade de pointes’ (TdP) with these drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pastick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Monzani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chary et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guzik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guastalegname and Vallone, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van den Broek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jeevaratnam, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sapp et al., 2020</xref>). Both drugs do cause significant QT prolongation and, whilst they block several different cation channels affecting myocardial depolarization (resulting in QRS prolongation) and repolarization (resulting in JT prolongation), the multichannel block is considered unbalanced, and both drugs are regarded as ‘torsadagenic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vicente et al., 2018</xref>). Many of the recent reports rediscovering this well known effect omit description of the contribution of QRS widening to QT prolongation (and thereby overestimate JT prolongation).</p><p>Approximately 350 tons of hydroxychloroquine are manufactured each year, almost all of which is used for rheumatological conditions, so millions are receiving long term regimens. Many of these patients have systemic lupus erythematosus which is commonly associated with myocarditis, QT prolongation, and a high prevalence of arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gawałko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bourré-Tessier et al., 2015</xref>). Reviews and authoritative websites all state that hydroxychloroquine causes TdP. Yet, despite this enormous use, in a systematic review of the literature we can find only a single reported case of TdP outside of COVID-19 treatment. This was in a 67-year-old Taiwanese female with systemic lupus erythematosus, cirrhosis and a previous myocardial infarct who was receiving hydroxychloroquine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2006</xref>). The patient survived. The WHO pharmacovigilance database (VigiBase) contains reports of 83 episodes of ventricular tachycardia associated with hydroxychloroquine over a 52 year period of which seven were fatal (this does not distinguish acute toxicity from the well described chronic toxic cardiomyopathy associated with use over many years). Overall, in systemic lupus erythematosus, patients receiving chloroquine have fewer arrhythmias than those on other medicines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Teixeira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wozniacka et al., 2006</xref>). In a very large retrospective observational study of 956,374 patients with rheumatoid arthritis starting hydroxychloroquine, there were significantly less arrhythmias in the first month of treatment with hydroxychloroquine compared to patients (N = 310,350) started on sulphasalazine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lane et al., 2020</xref>). This reflects the under-recognised anti-arrhythmic effects of these drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harris et al., 1988</xref>). In COVID-19 treatment there have been two reports so far of TdP. An 84-year-old Israeli woman with metastatic breast cancer who was taking bisoprolol, letrozole and memantine and received chloroquine treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Szekely et al., 2020</xref>), and a 68-year-old American male given hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chorin et al., 2020</xref>). Neither of these episodes were fatal. In Europe and the USA, where chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are allowed for compassionate use, there have been more than 300,000 deaths from COVID-19. The apparently low rates of reported ventricular arrhythmia are surprising given that evidence of myocarditis in lethal COVID-19 is common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Long et al., 2020</xref>). The two largest randomised trials in hospitalised COVID-19 patients (RECOVERY and SOLIDARITY) have together randomised 2473 patients to receive hydroxychloroquine. They do not show increased mortality at the times expected if hydroxychloroquine was causing lethal cardiovascular toxicity (i.e. on the first and last days of treatment). Except in deliberate self-poisoning TdP has not been reported with chloroquine either, despite billions of malaria treatments and extensive use in rheumatological conditions and hepatic amoebiasis for over 70 years. Thus it appears that the individual risk over the short term with currently used doses is very low. Subjects with pre-existing long QT intervals, electrolyte imbalance, concomitant QT prolonging medications (notably azithromycin in COVID-19) and structural heart disease are likely to be at greater individual risk. The very low risks of drug induced arrhythmia over the short term should be distinguished clearly from long term cumulative cardiotoxicity. The main cardiac concerns with long term usage of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are conduction defects and cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tönnesmann et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In summary, despite causing significant QT prolongation, there is no evidence that the risks of TdP and sudden death with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine given alone at currently recommended doses over the short term are increased above those of the background population. Restricting the evaluation of these drugs in COVID-19 for this specific concern therefore seems unwarranted. In assessing the potential toxicity of these drugs QRS widening correlates with severity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Risk-benefit assessment in the treatment of COVID-19</title><p>COVID-19 ranges from very mild illness to severe disease necessitating intensive care. Case fatality ratios are highly age dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). The potential toxicity of a treatment regimen has to be balanced against the severity of illness. If chloroquine is to benefit patients with COVID-19, it is likely to require high exposures. Understanding the concentration-dependent toxicity of chloroquine is essential in assessing the risk-benefit trade-off in COVID-19 clinical trials. This is evidence-based whereas the presumption of risk from lethal TdP derived from the measurement of electrocardiograph QT prolongation (which dominates the current literature) is not. From a clinical perspective, there are several practical implications of these observations in self-poisoning. If high doses of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are being given to hospitalised patients and blood concentrations cannot be measured rapidly (which is the usual situation), then electrocardiographic monitoring is informative. QRS interval widening can be used as an indicator of toxicity. If the QRS interval is less than 100 msec, then serious cardiovascular toxicity is very unlikely. JT interval prolongation is expected, and should be monitored too, but it is often harder to assess (as the end of T wave definition is often unclear in chloroquine toxicity). Hypokalemia is an important manifestation of chloroquine poisoning and a contributor to tachyarrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemessy et al., 1995</xref>). With high dose regimens plasma potassium concentrations should be maintained over 4.0 mmol/L and plasma magnesium concentrations over 0.8 mmol/L. Overall treatment regimens for hospitalised COVID-19 patients which result in whole blood chloroquine concentrations below 10 µmol/L for more than 95% of patients have an acceptable safety margin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patient data</title><p>The largest prospectively studied cohorts of self-poisoning with chloroquine have all been assembled by the national clinical toxicology unit in Paris, France (Réanimation Médicale et Toxicologique, Hôpital Lariboisière).

The extensive experience gathered in this clinical toxicology unit established the standard of care for chloroquine poisoning, including mechanical ventilation, appropriate sedation and optimum use of inotropes and vasopressors. Pre-hospital care was provided by emergency physicians in mobile intensive care units. These units could perform 12-lead electrocardiograms as well as advanced life support. Whole blood chloroquine concentrations were measured on admission and at varying times subsequently. The whole blood chloroquine concentrations following self-poisoning were determined using ultraviolet spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 343 nm.

Whole blood (the currently preferred matrix) concentrations are significantly higher than plasma concentrations because of binding to red blood cells, leukocytes and platelets. Two models were used for simulation in NONMEM (v.7.4.3, Icon Development Solution, Ellicott City, MD; the NONMEM simulation code is available online; see github repository link below). The first was a published two-compartment disposition model with a transit compartment absorption model using whole blood measurements from adult vivax malaria patients treated with a standard 25 mg base/kg regimen over three days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Höglund et al., 2016</xref>) (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>75</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, with over 1000 concentration measurements). Allometric scaling of body weight, with the exponent fixed to 0.75 for clearance parameters and one for volume parameters, was added to the published model to predict concentrations at different body weights. Although a two compartment model underestimates the terminal elimination phase, this has little effect on the blood concentration profile in the first weeks of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">White et al., 2020</xref>).

The retrospective data gave substantially different results with much higher probabilities of death (approximately 60% versus 5% at 20 µmol/L, see Appendix 1). We therefore excluded the 91 retrospectively studied patients reported in Riou et al. but retained the 11 prospectively studied patients from that publication. This gave a total of 302 unique patient observations.</p><p>We modeled the probability of death as a function of the log whole blood peak chloroquine concentration (µmol/L) using Bayesian logistic regression. The peak concentration is considered a latent variable (unobserved) for patients whose blood chloroquine concentrations peaked before hospital admission or for patients who only had their whole blood concentration measured on admission (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>241</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). The peak concentration is considered observed for those who had multiple concentration measurements and for whom the peak occurred after hospital admission (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>61</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). The model does not attempt to estimate individual peak concentrations for the patients whose peak concentrations were unobserved, but rather an average difference δ, on the log scale, between peak and admission concentrations (this can be considered as a bias correction term). This assumes that the probability of death, conditional on the peak drug concentration, was the same for those whose blood concentrations peaked before and after hospital admission. This assumption is likely to be incorrect. Patients whose levels peaked after hospital admission would have received supportive hospital care more rapidly (relative to time of peak concentration) than those who peaked before admission. However, the extent of this bias is unmeasurable.</p><p>In addition, the model adjusted for differences in hospital treatment received between the three cohorts: cohort 1 was the 11 prospectively studied patients in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Riou et al., 1988</xref>; cohort 2 was the 247 patients studied in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clemessy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clemessy et al., 1996</xref> (named herein ‘the Clemessy cohort’); cohort 3 was the 44 patients studied in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mégarbane et al., 2010</xref>. Substantial differences in standard of care occurred between these three cohorts. For example, the use of emergency extracorporeal life support started in the early 2000s and is thought to reduce chloroquine self-poisoning mortality considerably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mégarbane et al., 2007</xref>). The prior over the study specific intercept terms was a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5. We note that the stan code uses the following convention: cohort 1 coded as 0; cohort 2 coded as 1; cohort 3 coded as 2; healthy volunteers coded as 3.</p><p>To model the relationship between whole blood chloroquine concentrations and a fatal outcome we use a correction factor γ to account for the desethyl metabolite included in the assay measurement. Between 1 and 6 hr post ingestion, the desethyl metabolite will account for approximately 30% of the total concentration measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pukrittayakamee et al., 2014</xref>). The values of γ and <sub>δ</sub> are not directly identifiable from the data, but there are good a priori estimates for δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pukrittayakamee et al., 2014</xref>). The data from the individuals whose levels peaked after hospital admission were used to construct an informative prior distribution for γ.</p><p>In summary, for individuals with an observed peak concentration measurement, the likelihood function given the outcome is Bernouilli with the parameter on the logit scale equal to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <italic>x</italic> is the observed concentration (assumed to be the peak concentration), α is the global intercept term, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:msub><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the hospital cohort random intercept term, and β is the concentration-dependent effect (slope).

For the intercept term α, this was a normal distribution with mean −15 (i.e. 1 in 10<sup>7</sup> chance of dying at a whole blood concentration of 1µmol/L), and standard deviation 1; for the β coefficient on the log concentration, it was a normal distribution with mean 4 and standard deviation 1. The bias term δ was given an exponential prior with rate 8 (estimated from the 61 individuals whose levels peaked after hospital admission). The metabolite correction factor γ was given a normal prior with mean 0.7 and standard deviation 0.065 (the standard deviation was estimated from chloroquine and metabolite measurements in 107 malaria patients from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chu et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Coupled pharmacokinetic and concentration-fatality model</title><p>For each chloroquine regimen and each weight category considered, we simulated 1000 pharmacokinetic profiles. The simulation was run from the time of the first dose until 7 hr after the last dose (7 hr will adequately capture the C<sub>max</sub> value). Each simulated pharmacokinetic profile was summarised by the peak concentration denoted C<sub>max</sub>. The set of C<sub>max</sub> values was then used to predict mean fatality ratios using the concentration-fatality model estimated from the chloroquine self-poisoning data (herein referred to as the pharmacodynamic model). We propagated uncertainty from the pharmacodynamic model by estimating desired quantities using 4000 random draws from the posterior distribution. For the estimation of mortality under the different regimens, we truncated the concentration-dependent mortality prediction at 1% (the concentration at which this truncation occurs will vary depending on the draw from the posterior distribution). This is because estimating mortality ratios below 1% is unreliable given a sample size of a few hundred and will be highly dependent on the prior distribution chosen and the parametric form of the concentration-fatality curve. For example, the posterior predictive model estimates a mortality of the order of 1 per 100,000 at 2µmol/L. This is approximately the background rate of sudden unexplained death in a young adult population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2018</xref>), therefore rendering the prediction essentially unverifiable (non-scientific).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Concentration-dependent model of electrocardiograph QRS widening</title><p>We estimated the relationship between chloroquine concentrations and QRS interval duration by fitting a Bayesian sigmoid Emax model.

This helps to adjust partially for the concentration-dependent heteroskedasticity in QRS values and the differences in measurement error between pooled datasets (manually read ECGs in the Clemessy cohort and greater difficulty in accurate interval measurement at the high concentrations seen in self-poisoning (cohorts 2 and 3) versus automated reading in the healthy volunteer data).</p><p>The data from the self-poisoning patients are considered independent and identically distributed conditional on the observed concentration and the study cohort.

Figure 1 now shows the meta-data from these 55 trials (scatter plot of regimen duration versus total dose in base equivalent). We have simulated the highest currently recruiting chloroquine regimen (equal to that of the WHO SOLIDARITY trial).
