In leader blebs, is a rapid flow of cortical actin that drives the cell forward. Using RNAi, we find that co-depleting cofilin-1 and actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) led to a large increase in cortical actin, suggesting that both proteins regulate cortical actin. Furthermore, severing factors can promote contractility through the regulation of actin architecture. However, RNAi of cofilin-1 but not ADF led to a significant decrease in cell stiffness. We found cofilin-1 to be enriched at leader bleb necks, whereas RNAi of cofilin-1 and ADF reduced bleb sizes and the frequency of motile cells. Strikingly, cells without cofilin-1 and ADF had blebs with abnormally long necks. Many of these blebs failed to retract and displayed slow actin turnover. Collectively, our data identifies cofilin-1 and ADF as actin remodeling factors required for fast amoeboid migration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>amoeboid</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005190</institution-id><institution>Melanoma Research Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>688232</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ullo</surname><given-names>Maria F</given-names></name><name><surname>Logue</surname><given-names>Jeremy S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-20-019-01 - CCG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Logue</surname><given-names>Jeremy S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fast amoeboid migrating cells require both cofilin-1 and ADF for fast actin turnover at 'leader bleb' necks.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell migration requires tight spatiotemporal control of the filamentous-actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton. For mesenchymal migration, actin assembly/disassembly and myosin contraction must occur within specific regions of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</xref>). Relative to other, recently described modes of migration, the mechanisms by which mesenchymal cells coordinate these processes are reasonably well understood. Whereas, in amoeboid cells, which migrate using intracellular-driven protrusions of the plasma membrane (PM) or blebs, the mechanisms conferring spatiotemporal control of the F-actin cytoskeleton are not well known.</p><p>Within tissues, cells encounter a variety of physicochemical environments. We and others discovered that in response to tissue confinement, cancer cells frequently undergo phenotypic transitions, including to what has been termed ‘fast amoeboid migration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Logue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ruprecht et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mistriotis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wisniewski et al., 2020</xref>). A hallmark of amoeboid migration is the presence of blebs, which form as a result of PM-cortical actin separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Charras et al., 2008</xref>). Typically, blebs are rapidly retracted following the reassembly of cortical actin on bleb membranes and the recruitment of myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Charras et al., 2008</xref>). However, during fast amoeboid migration, cells form a very large and stable bleb. Within these blebs, is a cortical actin network that flows from the bleb tip to the neck, which separates leader blebs from the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Logue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ruprecht et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergert et al., 2015</xref>). Together with non-specific friction, flowing cortical actin provides the motive force for cell movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ruprecht et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, we simultaneously termed this mode of migration, leader bleb-based migration (LBBM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Logue et al., 2015</xref>). Because migration plasticity is thought to be a major contributor of metastasis, our aim here is to identify the essential factors required for the rapid cortical actin flow in leader blebs.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that myosin is enriched at the neck of leader blebs. Indeed, the myosin at this location has been shown to be required for rapid cortical actin flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ruprecht et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergert et al., 2015</xref>). However, what drives the disassembly of F-actin at the neck to replenish the pool of G-actin at the leader bleb tip is unknown. Thus, we hypothesize that actin disassembly factors within leader blebs play a pivotal role in this process. Similarly, in mesenchymal cells, retrograde actin flow is driven by both myosin contraction and actin disassembly, the latter of which is accelerated by the actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family of severing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bravo-Cordero et al., 2013</xref>). Severing depends on ADF/cofilin inducing a structural change within the actin filament, an activity known to be repressed by LIM kinase (LIMK) phosphorylation on Ser 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yang et al., 1998</xref>). However, the consequence of actin severing is variable, depending on the availability of barbed end capping proteins. At a sufficiently high level, new barbed ends are capped, promoting actin disassembly from new pointed ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wioland et al., 2017</xref>). Conversely, if left uncapped, increased polymerization from new barbed ends may occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wioland et al., 2017</xref>). The effects of ADF/cofilin on actin severing is also concentration dependent, where low and high levels of ADF/cofilin sever and stabilize actin filaments, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrianantoandro and Pollard, 2006</xref>). Additionally, by competing for F-actin binding (e.g., Arp2/3) and other mechanisms, ADF/cofilin can regulate actin architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gressin et al., 2015</xref>). The effects of ADF/cofilin on cortical actin are even less certain, as the focus of many studies has been on the actin within lamellipodia. Although Wiggan et al. have previously reported bleb defects in HeLa cells depleted of actin severing factors, the role of ADF and cofilin-1 in regulating the cortical actomyosin flow in fast amoeboid cells has not been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wiggan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>By combining an in vitro assay for the precise confinement of cells with quantitative imaging approaches, we report that ADF and cofilin-1, together, are required for the rapid disassembly of incoming cortical actin at leader bleb necks. Under conditions of confinement, we find that melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma cells depleted of both proteins display dramatic defects in bleb morphology and dynamics. Consequently, cells without ADF and cofilin-1 cannot undergo LBBM. Thus, we reveal unanticipated roles for ADF and cofilin-1 in driving confined (leader bleb-based) migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ADF and cofilin-1 are required for LBBM</title><p>Using our previously described approach for cell confinement, which involves placing cells under a slab of PDMS held at a defined height (~3 µm) above cover glass, cancer cells will switch to LBBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Logue et al., 2018</xref>).

Therefore, we set out to determine if ADF and/or cofilin-1 are important for LBBM. In melanoma A375 cells, a widely used cell line for the study of amoeboid migration, both ADF and cofilin-1 are expressed, with cofilin-1 mRNA levels being threefold higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Using A375 cells, we depleted cells of ADF and cofilin-1 alone and together by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). By manually tracking the movement of cells over time, we found that cells depleted of cofilin-1 were significantly less motile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Additionally, the adhesive transmigration of cells through small pores was hindered after depleting cofilin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Depleting cells of ADF led to a slight reduction in the number of highly motile cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Strikingly, depleting cells of both ADF and cofilin-1 appeared to have an additive effect on reducing LBBM, whereas the adhesive transmigration of cells through small pores did not display this additive behavior and was not affected by ADF depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These results suggest that these proteins play non-overlapping roles during LBBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>). In agreement with this concept, transfection of EGFP-cofilin-1 into cells depleted of both proteins was insufficient to restore LBBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Together, ADF and cofilin-1 are required to retract blebs</title><p>Subsequently, we wanted to know what is responsible for the decrease in LBBM upon depleting ADF and/or cofilin-1. Initially, we analyzed the area of the largest bleb (i.e., leader bleb), relative to the cell body, in cells depleted of ADF and/or cofilin-1. This analysis revealed that depleting cells of cofilin-1 reduced the area of the largest bleb by ~15% of control while depleting cells of both ADF and cofilin-1 reduced the area of the largest bleb by ~40% of control (non-targeting; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>). The area of all blebs was similarly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Strikingly, in cells depleted of both ADF and cofilin-1, ~30% of cells displayed blebs with elongated necks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). Detailed analyses of these cells revealed that ~60% display blebs that never retract into the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Moreover, we found this effect to not be specific to melanoma A375 cells, as depleting lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells of both ADF and cofilin-1 similarly resulted in the elongation of bleb necks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). In melanoma A375 cells, depleting both ADF and cofilin-1 had an additive effect on reducing the rate of bleb retraction, which points to these proteins having non-overlapping functions specifically at bleb necks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In support of this role, we determined the location of EGFP-cofilin-1 in confined cells. Our initial efforts were unsuccessful because of a high degree of soluble (i.e., unbound to F-actin) protein, but in cells depleted of endogenous ADF and cofilin-1 we could detect an enrichment of EGFP-cofilin-1 at leader bleb necks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>; <italic>arrow</italic>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Together, actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) and cofilin-1 are required to retract blebs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Montage of non-targeting, CFL1, ADF, and CFL1 + ADF RNAi with EGFP alone (volume marker) in melanoma A375-M2 cells.

In spherical cells, actin is predominantly cortical and endogenous cofilin-1 is diffuse throughout the cytoplasm with some enrichment at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). By combining the specificity of phalloidin for F-actin with flow cytometry, we then determined how the level of cortical actin is affected by ADF and/or cofilin-1 depletion. In cells depleted of cofilin-1, F-actin levels were increased by ~10%, whereas depletion of ADF did not lead to a significant change in the level of F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, depleting ADF with cofilin-1 had the largest effect, increasing F-actin levels by ~30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Serine 3 of cofilin-1 is phosphorylated by LIMK, inhibiting its severing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yang et al., 1998</xref>). In cells depleted of endogenous ADF and cofilin-1, transfection of EGFP-cofilin-1 reduced the level of F-actin to levels similar to control (non-target; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Similarly, F-actin was restored to near control levels by transfection of EGFP-cofilin-1 (S3A; constitutively active), whereas transfection of EGFP-cofilin-1 (S3E; constitutively inactive) led to an increased level of F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Additionally, in comparison to EGFP alone, increasing levels of EGFP-cofilin-1 correlated with reductions in F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, cortical actin levels are regulated by ADF and cofilin-1 severing.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF) and cofilin-1 rapidly disassemble cortical actin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) mEmerald-LifeAct and far-red fluorescent membrane dye in cells after non-targeting and CFL1 + ADF RNAi.

Subsequently, fluorescence decay at leader bleb necks was measured and used for determining rates of actin turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, as our measurements will be a composite of the actin turnover rate and the binding kinetics of LifeAct, these data should be strictly viewed as apparent rates of actin turnover. To demonstrate proof of concept, curves were fit with a single phase decay, yielding an R-squared value of 0.8348 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In contrast, a rapid decline in red fluorescence was not observed in paraformaldehyde treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

To address this possibility, we determined the compressibility of cells using a previously described gel sandwich approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, freshly trypsinized (spherical) cells are placed between two polyacrylamide gels of known stiffness (1 kPa). Subsequently, the ratio of the cell height (<italic>h</italic>) to the diameter (<italic>d</italic>) is used to determine compressibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). After depleting cofilin-1, we found cells to be significantly more compressible, whereas depleting ADF had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Moreover, in cofilin-1 depleted cells, the depletion of ADF did not have any additional effect on cell compressibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Reconstituting ADF and cofilin-1 RNAi cells with RFP-cofilin-1 rescued cell compressibility to levels similar to control, whereas RFP-ADF was unable to rescue compressibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>). Therefore, cofilin-1 may be particularly important for contractility. In support of this idea, cofilin-1 has been shown to modulate contractility through a variety of mechanisms, which involve changes in both actin turnover and network architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chugh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ennomani et al., 2016</xref>). As determined by immunofluorescence imaging of phosphorylated regulatory light chain (pRLC), we could confirm that signaling to myosin was not significantly affected by depleting ADF and/or cofilin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>). In confined cells, depleting ADF and cofilin-1 leads to the elongation of leader bleb necks, which are decorated with myosin (EGFP-RLC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We then used CALI to determine if the accumulation of myosin at leader blebs necks is directly caused by the removal of these proteins. Indeed, within minutes of SuperNova-cofilin-1 inactivation, we observed myosin accumulating at leader bleb necks (EGFP-RLC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>). Additionally, the flow of myosin toward leader bleb necks was significantly impeded after cofilin-1 inactivation, as determined by tracking individual myosin minifilaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).

This is significant as the rapid flow of cortical actin in leader blebs is essential for confined migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ruprecht et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergert et al., 2015</xref>). We report that melanoma cells depleted of cofilin-1 poorly undergo LBBM, whereas removing ADF did not have a significant effect. Because ADF and cofilin-1 are thought to have redundant or overlapping roles, we were surprised to then find that depleting cofilin-1 together with ADF led to a near complete inhibition of LBBM. Therefore, we set out to determine the basis for this effect in cancer cells.</p><p>Initially, we used high spatial and temporal resolution imaging for close inspection of RNAi cells. Cells lacking cofilin-1 alone had much smaller blebs. Without both cofilin-1 and ADF, many cells had blebs with elongated necks that would not retract. A similar elongated neck phenotype was observed by Wiggan et al., whereas they reported an increase in the frequency of HeLa cells with blebs after cofilin-1 RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wiggan et al., 2012</xref>). While these authors contend that cofilin-1 inhibits contractility by competing with myosin for F-actin binding, our results are in line with work showing that cofilin-1 increases contractility through optimizing actin filament lengths and de-branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chugh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ennomani et al., 2016</xref>). This led us to wonder if ADF and/or cofilin-1 may be important for actin turnover at bleb necks. In agreement with this concept, in cells lacking endogenous cofilin-1 and ADF, EGFP-cofilin-1 was enriched at bleb necks.</p><p>In confined cells, we observed a dramatic accumulation of actin at bleb necks. In order to better understand how ADF and cofilin-1 regulate the overall level of cortical actin, we utilized spherical cells which predominantly have cortical actin. Using flow cytometry, we found that depleting cells of cofilin-1 could significantly increase the overall level of actin. Although ADF on its own had no effect, depleting cofilin-1 with ADF increased the overall level of actin even further, which might suggest that ADF augments the severing activity of cofilin-1. Similarly, the level of cortical barbed ends was significantly increased in the absence of cofilin-1, whereas removing ADF marginally increased the level of cortical barbed ends. Depleting both cofilin-1 and ADF appeared to have an additive effect, leading to the largest increase in the level of uncapped (polymerization competent) barbed ends. This result suggests that cofilin-1 severing, in collaboration with ADF, leads to the rapid disassembly of cortical actin and not polymerization at new barbed ends.</p><p>Because changes in the cellular F/G-actin ratio can trigger specific transcriptional programs, such as through the activation of the transcription factor, MRTF-A, we wanted to determine if the effects we observed on LBBM are a direct result of down-regulating actin severing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Olson and Nordheim, 2010</xref>). For this, we utilized CALI for the rapid inactivation of SuperNova-cofilin-1. In cells depleted of ADF and cofilin-1, SuperNova-coflin-1 was sufficient to restore normal bleb morphology and dynamics. However, within minutes of cofilin-1 inactivation, actin began to accumulate at elongated bleb necks. By kymograph analysis, we also observed a significant decrease in the cortical actin flow rate. Using a photoactivatable LifeAct construct, we then directly measured the rate of actin turnover (i.e., fluorescence decay) at bleb necks. While depleting ADF or cofilin-1 alone did not have a significant effect on actin turnover rates, depleting both proteins led to a large increase in the rate of actin turnover at bleb necks. Thus, in cells lacking ADF and cofilin-1, defects in bleb morphology and dynamics correlate with a reduction in actin turnover at the neck.</p><p>Cofilin-1 has been previously implicated in regulating actomyosin contractility. Therefore, using spherical cells, we determined the overall effect of ADF and cofilin-1 on cortical contractility. As indicated by increased compressibility, cells were found to be less stiff after depleting cofilin-1. In contrast, removing ADF had little effect on cell stiffness. Moreover, depleting both ADF and cofilin-1 was similar to removing cofilin-1 alone and could be rescued by an RNAi resistant version of cofilin-1 but not ADF. Therefore, cofilin-1 may be particularly important to support actomyosin contractility. In line with this notion, cofilin-1 has been shown to support myosin contractility through optimizing actin filament lengths and de-branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chugh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ennomani et al., 2016</xref>). As indicated by the lack of any change in pRLC levels or localization, removing these proteins does not appear to effect signaling to myosin. The role of cofilin-1 in supporting myosin contractility is further supported by CALI. More specifically, we demonstrate that inactivating cofilin-1 decreases the rate at which myosin minifilaments flow toward the bleb neck.</p><p>Thus, our data are consistent with a model whereby ADF and cofilin-1 play key roles during LBBM. More specifically, we assert that ADF and cofilin-1, together, optimize actin disassembly and myosin contractility at bleb necks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <italic>top</italic>). Whereas, in the absence of these proteins, incoming cortical actin fails to disassemble and accumulates with myosin at the elongated necks of persistent blebs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <italic>below</italic>). Collectively, this study further points to rapid (cortical) actin flows as being essential for confined (leader bleb-based) migration. This is significant as many cancer cells have been shown to undergo LBBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Logue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) and cofilin-1 function within leader blebs.</title><p><italic>Top</italic>, in the presence of both ADF and cofilin-1, cells display large blebs with rapid cortical actin flow. <italic>Below</italic>, in the absence of cofilin-1 or ADF, cells form smaller blebs with slower cortical actin flow. <italic>Bottom</italic>, without both ADF and cofilin-1, blebs display several defects, including a failure to retract and an accumulation of actomyosin at elongated necks.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67856-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>This work also reveals an unanticipated role for ADF. In melanoma cells, ADF appears to augment the activity of cofilin-1 at bleb necks. Largely, ADF and cofilin-1 are thought to have redundant or overlapping roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hotulainen et al., 2005</xref>). However, ADF has been shown to have significant monomer sequestering activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2004</xref>). We speculate that, in the absence of both proteins, dampened actin severing coupled with uncontrolled filament elongation contributes to the severe phenotypes we observe. Thus, the dissemination of melanoma tumors is likely to be blocked by the simultaneous inhibition of ADF and cofilin-1. As actin severing by ADF and cofilin-1 can be regulated by a number of functional interactions, such as with Aip1 and cyclase-associated protein 1, future work will endeavor to determine the contribution of these factors in regulating the cortical actomyosin flow in fast amoeboid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertling et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nadkarni and Brieher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shekhar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kotila et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">A375-M2</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CRL-3223</td><td valign="top">Metastatic melanoma</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">A549</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CCL-185</td><td valign="top">Lung adenocarcinoma</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">SYLGARD 184</td><td valign="top">Dow Corning</td><td valign="top">Cat no. 24236–10</td><td valign="top">PDMS</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">EGFP-cofilin-1 WT, S3A, and S3E</td><td valign="top">Addgene (a gift from Dr James Bamburg)</td><td valign="top">Plasmid no. 50859, 50854, and 50855</td><td valign="top">Plasmid constructs to transfect</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">RFP-cofilin-1</td><td valign="top">Dr James Bamburg (Colorado State University)</td><td valign="top">n/a</td><td valign="top">Plasmid construct to transfect</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">RFP-ADF</td><td valign="top">Dr James Bamburg (Colorado State University)</td><td valign="top">n/a</td><td valign="top">Plasmid construct to transfect</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">SuperNova-cofilin-1</td><td valign="top">Dr Kazuyo Sakai (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan)</td><td valign="top">n/a</td><td valign="top">Plasmid construct to transfect and destroy cofilin-1 by CALI</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">mEos3.2-LifeAct</td><td valign="top">Addgene (a gift from Michael Davidson)</td><td valign="top">Plasmid no. 54696</td><td valign="top">Plasmid construct to transfect and monitor F-actin dynamics</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Non-targeting siRNA</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="top">Cat no. 4390844</td><td valign="top">Control siRNA to transfect</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Cofilin-1 siRNA</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="top">Cat no. 4392420; s2936</td><td valign="top">Cofilin-1 siRNA to transfect</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">ADF siRNA</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="top">Cat no. 4392422; s21737</td><td valign="top">ADF siRNA to transfect</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-cofilin-1 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="top">Cat no.

They found that depletion of both ADF and cofilin-1 suppressed the speed of bleb-based migration in confinement. Moreover, this dual intervention (1) resulted in cells displaying blebs with elongated necks, (2) reduced the bleb retraction rate, (3) increased the number of cortical barbed ends, (4) slowed down the rate of actin turnover at leader bleb necks and (5) impeded myosin minifilament flow rate after cofilin-1 inactivation. Overall, this is an interesting study worthy of publication pending appropriate revision.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1. The authors have made some inaccurate statements throughout their manuscript.

On p. 8, &quot;depleting both proteins led to a large increase in the rate of actin turnover at bleb necks&quot;. Yet, Figure 4G shows the exact opposite (i.e., the half-life of F-actin turnover increased, which means that the turnover rate is reduced).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity, the manuscript has been edited accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The authors should provide the blot showing the extent of cofilin-1 rescue.</p></disp-quote><p>Cell-by-cell analyses were used to quantify the relative levels of fluorescent protein (FP) tagged versions of cofilin-1 and ADF. More specifically, the level of cofilin-1 or ADF was determined for untransfected and transfected cells by immunofluorescence. Transfected cells were identified using the FP tag. Accordingly, the levels of FP tagged cofilin-1 and ADF were measured relative to the endogenous protein. Using this methodology, we were able to accurately determine that FP tagged versions of cofilin-1 and ADF were similar to endogenous. See figures 1I and 5C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 2A: what is the reason for showing cells at different time points? If the authors wish to show the retraction of a bleb(s), some cells at later time points go out of frame (e.g., non-target control).</p></disp-quote><p>Although I fully understand the reviewer’s point of view that these montages may not be necessary, we feel that these montages may help some readers to fully appreciate the range of observed phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. For the sake of completion, the authors should quantify the leader bled area and bleb area for siADF and dual KD in Figures 2C-D.</p><p>These data have now been added. ADF RNAi was not found to significantly reduce either leader bleb or bleb (i.e., measuring all blebs) areas.

On p. 6, the authors state that &quot;in cells depleted of ADF and cofilin-1, transfection of EGFP-cofilin-1 was not sufficient to restore cortical barbed ends to a level similar to control (Figure 3H).

What is the rationale for performing experiments with trypsinized cells? Are the phenotypes and underlying molecular pathways same for compressed and trypsinized cells ?</p></disp-quote><p>Because of the nature of our method for cell confinement, many assays that employ chemical treatments or the preparation of cell lysates are unavailable.

Is the reduction in myosin flow (Figure 5F) due to reduced actin turnover? What is the role of myosin in the neck formation ? From the proposed model in Figure 6, it looks like the neck is formed by myosin based contractility. Will inhibition of myosin activity by blebbistatin reduce the length of the neck ?</p></disp-quote><p>We will address each question in turn; (1) correct, our model is that actin turnover at the bleb neck is essential for sustained myosin contractility and thus, myosin flow, (2) we and others believe that myosin is essential to the formation of the constricted neck, however, the molecular basis for why myosin is enriched at bleb necks is not well understood, and (3) this is a very interesting idea, we would also predict that the length of the neck would be reduced upon blebbistatin treatment. Unfortunately, this would be difficult to test in cells, as high myosin activity is required to initiate a bleb.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The authors should do justice and cite relevant articles which show that confinement induces cell blebbing: PMID: 32789173 and PMID: 31690619</p></disp-quote><p>These articles are now discussed/cited within the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>Following appropriate revision and clarifications, the resulting manuscript will represent a significant contribution to the area of cell motility.</p><p>Referees cross-commenting</p><p>Reviewer #2 and I are in agreement. I also concur with her/his point (which I did not include in my review) about the use of two different siRNAs and inclusion of data on cell directionality. Lastly, I was &quot;generous&quot; regarding the estimated time to complete revisions because the π is a young Assistant Professor, and I just wanted to eliminate the pressure associated with time constraints so that he revises the manuscript meticulously.</p></disp-quote><p>We wish to thank the reviewer for their comments, which have undoubtedly improved our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>This paper interrogates the function of ADF-1 and cofilin in the leader-bleb based migration, as observed primarily in melanoma cells in confinement. Overall, this paper is reasonable and the data generally supports the conclusions, though robust statistical analysis is lacking in places. The experiments appear to be carefully performed and the FLAP experiments are innovative and informative. The main findings are that ADF-1 and cofilin each have roles in the phenotype of cells that undergo bleb-based migration and the results of inhibiting either one are distinct from (and milder than) those of inhibiting both.</p><p>Specific Comments</p><p>1. When the authors switch from studying cells with obvious leader based blebs to ones that are &quot;spherical&quot; it is unclear what else changes: is the confinement different? Are these migratory cells, etc?</p></disp-quote><p>Because of the nature of our method for cell confinement, many assays that employ chemical treatments or the preparation of cell lysates are unavailable.

In at least some cases, the figures are not labeled and described (in captions and text) well enough to help the reader understand their import. For example, Figure 1B is hardly described in either the caption or the text. In Figure 1e there are no axis labels. Are those microns? While the authors say how the cells were selected as &quot;highly motile&quot; in the Methods section it would be convenient if this was restated in the figure caption.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity, the manuscript has been edited accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. An additional concern about Figure 1 is as follows: the authors state that ADF KD results in a decrease in mobility but that statement is not accurate given the data they show, where ADF is not statistically different than control and actually has the cell with the highest average speed (although it is possible that the highest cell both in ADF and in the control are statistical outliers and should be removed from the datasets. The authors should conduct a Grubs test to confirm whether they should keep these data points in their analysis). Additionally, generally when people are discussing changes in mobility they are looking not just at the speed but also at the directionality and directional persistence of cells. It would be interesting to present this data here as well and it simply requires analysis of tracks the authors already have in hand.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity, the manuscript has now been edited to more accurately state:</p><p>‘Depleting cells of ADF led to a slight reduction in the number of highly motile cells (Figure 1E-H).’</p><p>As a general practice, we don’t remove any cells from our migration analyses. This is because it is not uncommon to observe a wide range of migration parameters under conditions of confinement.</p><p>Directional autocorrelations have now been provided. Please note that these autocorrelations were only done for highly motile cells, as directionality measurements on non- or poorly moving cells (e.g., moving in place) would not be informative. Accordingly, conditions with few motile cells will have a relatively low n-value. See Figure 1—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The data presented in Figure 2A is intriguing but also points to difficulty of concluding that the effects of ADF and cofilin are &quot;additive.&quot; At times the authors use &quot;non-overlapping,&quot; which I believe is more accurate given the results presented in Figure 2 and elsewhere in the manuscript. The blebs apparent in the dual knockdown are wild-looking and distinct from those seen in any of the other panels. The authors hardly discuss this even though they feature the elongated neck phenotype and highlight that it is not present in other treatments. If the effect of ADF and cofilin are &quot;additive&quot; one would think you would have a similar phenotype but featuring, for example, short necks in each case and then a long one when both are disrupted. At the very end of the paper the authors discuss that cofilin-1 is required for actin turnover and myosin contractility at the bleb neck. They have a very brief statement that KD of both proteins leads to an elongated bleb neck, but then spend the rest of the paragraph focusing on the effects of just cofilin-1. I think that investigating the long-necked blebs further would be of interest, especially since these cells continue to be motile and without any clear &quot;leader bleb&quot;. Is actin present in these blebs? What is the flow like? How does this direct motility (and directionality) in these cells. Investigation of this morphology may lead to a better understanding of exactly how cofilin-1 and ADF interact to regulate blebbing and migration, as only lack of both proteins results in this altered morphology.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion, 25/79 cells display the severe elongated neck phenotype (Figure 2D). In cells lacking both cofilin-1 and ADF, actin (Figure 3A) and myosin (Figure 5D) accumulate at bleb necks. In the absence of sufficient turnover, cortical actin flow is impeded (Figure 4D) and thus, these cells do not undergo leader bleb-based migration. Accordingly, these data help to form the basis of our model in which ADF and cofilin-1 collaborate to promote actomyosin flow and leader bleb-based migration (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. It is generally expected that authors will try two different siRNAs (or one siRNA and a function-inhibiting antibody) to provide reassurance that effects are on-target.</p></disp-quote><p>In general, we agree with the reviewer’s point of view, however, in this paper we have used RNAi, reconstitution, and CALI in order to provide reassurance that effects are on-target.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors state, &quot;ADF and cofilin-1 rapidly disassemble cortical actin&quot; and the authors discuss a change in the level of F-actin. However, it is not clear whether there is an overall change in actin level in the KD cells or if there is (as suggested) simply a change in ratio of F-actin : G-actin, which implies two rather different functions of these proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion, as we use phalloidin, our assays specifically measure changes in the level of F-actin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. It would be very interesting indeed if the authors could test their speculation about uncontrolled filament elongation is contributing to the unusual phenotypes observed.</p></disp-quote><p>In future work, which is likely to require purified proteins in actin polymerization and other assays (beyond the scope of the current work), we will aim to test the idea that uncontrolled actin polymerization contributes to the observed phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):General interest level in leader bleb-based migration is not especially high due to the fact that it is provoked by (non-physiological) confined environments. Even without direct physiological relevance, migratory strategies that cancer cells may adopt may be of interest to a broad community and the findings here (of &quot;additive&quot; effects of ADF and cofilin-1) may have relevance beyond this particular migratory mode. The main weaknesses of the manuscript is the incomplete description of the additive affect of ADF and cofilin: while the authors attempt to capture this in their discussion and schematic depiction, how the two proteins interact with respect to leader based bleb migration and related processes such as actin turnover remain incompletely described.</p></disp-quote><p>We would note that our assay was designed to simulate tissue environments in which cells are under conditions of high mechanical confinement. Work by us and others has shown that these assays efficiently promote the transition to fast amoeboid (leader bleb-based) migration, similar to what has been previously observed in vivo (Tozluoglu <italic>et al.</italic> 2013, <italic>Nature Cell Biology</italic>, Ruprecht <italic>et al.</italic> 2015, <italic>Cell</italic> and Venturini <italic>et al.</italic> 2020, <italic>Science</italic>).</p><p>We in general agree with the reviewer’s point of view that much remains to be done with regards to understanding the non-overlapping roles of cofilin-1 and ADF during leader bleb-based migration. However, we view this paper as providing the rationale for future (in-depth) biochemical studies. As mentioned in our point-by-point responses (above), this work is likely to involve using purified proteins in actin polymerization and other assays, which we feel is beyond the scope of the current paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main audience for this work will be anyone interested in novel migratory strategies in cancer cells as well as those who wish to understand origins of cell motility from a biophysical point of view.</p><p>Reviewer expertise is in novel migratory strategies of cancer cells, particularly in three-dimensional in vitro environments.</p><p>Referees cross-commenting</p><p>I think the other reviewer and I are generally in agreement. There are some interesting things in this manuscript but there are inconsistencies between written statements and data presented in places as well as lack of robust statistical analysis. Certainly, all data presented in figures and written description of such should be reconciled.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for these errors, as discussed in our point-by-point responses (above), these issues have now been reconciled.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The other question brought up by both reviewers that must be addressed is the fact that the authors switch from studying confined to trypsinized spherical cells at some point. Why should these two situations be studied side-by-side? There is an implication that the same underlying molecular pathways are relevant, but what evidence is there that this is the case?</p></disp-quote><p>We have copied our response to specific comment 1 (reviewer 2):</p><p>Because of the nature of our method for cell confinement, many assays that employ chemical treatments or the preparation of cell lysates are unavailable. Therefore, we use freshly trypsinized (spherical) cells, which predominantly have cortical actin and that are amenable to a unique range of assays, to in general study the cortical actin network. Previous work by us (Logue <italic>et al.</italic> 2015, <italic>eLife</italic>) and others (Bergert <italic>et al.</italic> 2012, <italic>PNAS</italic> and Liu <italic>et al.</italic> 2015, <italic>Cell</italic>) have shown that the properties of the cortical actin network in spherical cells are predictive of whether or not a cell will undergo fast amoeboid (leader bleb-based) migration.</p></body></sub-article></article>
