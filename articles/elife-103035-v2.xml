However, the coordination of these processes during development remains poorly understood. The gonad in <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure guided by the migration of distal tip cells (DTCs), which result from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors (SGPs; Z1 and Z4). We found that the polarity of Z1 and Z4, which possess mirror-symmetric orientation, is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins (CWN-1, CWN-2, and EGL-20) with distinct functions. In <italic>lin-17</italic> mutants, CWN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while CWN-1 promotes reverse and normal polarity in Z1 and Z4, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4. In <italic>lin-17 egl-20 cwn-2</italic> triple mutants with a polarity reversal of Z1, DTCs from Z1 frequently miss-migrate to the posterior side. Our further analysis demonstrates that the mis-positioning of DTCs in the gonad due to the polarity reversal of Z1 leads to mis-migration. Similar mis-migration was also observed in <italic>cki-1(RNAi</italic>) animals producing ectopic DTCs. These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In humans and other animals, cells are organized into tissues and organs that each perform distinct roles in the body. Some organs and tissues have a mirror-symmetric structure, meaning they are divided into two halves that are exact reflections of one another. However, it is not fully understood how these types of structures form during development.</p><p>The formation of mirror-symmetric structures often relies on cell polarity, which is when the components of a cell – such as its structure, internal contents and functional regions – are unevenly distributed. In the nematode worm <italic>C. elegans</italic>, for example, their mirror-symmetric gonads (or sex organs) are formed by two polarized cells called Z1 and Z4.</p><p>Both Z1 and Z4 divide asymmetrically to produce two daughter cells with distinct concentrations of a particular transcription factor. For Z1, the daughter cell facing the anterior of the gonad has lower levels of the transcription factor than the posterior daughter cell, while the two cells generated by Z4 have the opposing mirror asymmetry. This polarity drives the production of two distal tip cells – one produced by the anterior daughter cell of Z1 and the other by the posterior daughter cell of Z4 – which migrate to opposite ends of the gonad.</p><p>A cell signaling pathway known as Wnt is crucial for establishing cell polarity in many species. However, a previous study found that <italic>C. elegans</italic> could still develop healthy gonads even when all five ligand proteins that activate the Wnt pathway were mutated. Here, So et al. reveal that these mutations can impact polarity, but only when LIN-17, the receptor for the Wnt ligands, is also mutated. Further experiments showed that LIN-17 can independently regulate cell polarity and compensate for the loss of Wnt signaling.</p><p>So et al. also identified three specific Wnt ligands – CWN-1, CWN-2 and EGL-20 – that collectively control the polarity of Z1 and Z4. Each protein has a distinct role: CWN-1 promotes Z1 and Z4 to have the same polarity, while CWN-2 induces the polarity of Z1 cells to reverse. EGL-20 then stops Z1 from regaining its original polarity and no longer mirroring the polarity of Z4.</p><p>These findings shed new light on how Wnt signaling contributes to the mirror-symmetric structure of <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonads. It is possible that these proteins play similar roles in other animals to help regulate how organs form.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>cell polarity</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>organogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP16H04797</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sawa</surname><given-names>Hitoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sawa</surname><given-names>Hitoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIG-JOINT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>88A2024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>So</surname><given-names>Shuhei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mirror-symmetric structure of the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> gonad is established through the Wnt-independent function of a Frizzled protein and three Wnt proteins with distinct roles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most animals belonging to Bilateria have a mirror-symmetric body plan along the left-right axis, except for most internal organs. In mirror-symmetric tissues, cells in equivalent positions should acquire the same cell fates. Additionally, they are likely to exhibit mirror-symmetric polarity orientation for mirror-symmetric morphogenesis. However, the mechanism to produce mirror symmetric polarity has not even been postulated except for a few examples. At the midline of the neural rod in the developing zebrafish neural tube, the polarity regulator Pard3 is localized on the cleavage furrow of neural progenitors and inherited by the two daughter cells on either side of the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tawk et al., 2007</xref>). This results in a mirror-image apico-basal polarity of the daughter cells and the subsequent formation of the ventricle. In the dorsal and ventral sides of the compound eye of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, ommatidia have mirror-image chirality that is regulated by protocadherins Fat/Dachsous and PCP (planar cell polarity) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rawls et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>During the development of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, most cells are polarized in the same anterior-posterior orientation and divide asymmetrically to produce distinct daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sawa, 2012</xref>). This polarity is regulated by the Wnt signaling pathway known as the Wnt/β-catenin asymmetry pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mizumoto and Sawa, 2007</xref>). Nuclear localization of POP-1/TCF, for example, is higher in the anterior than the posterior daughter cells (hereafter called HL polarity for high-low POP-1 concentration). However, there are some exceptions to the rule that result in mirror-symmetric polarity. During the development of the vulva, one of the vulval precursor cells (VPCs) P7.p has reversed polarity with higher POP-1 in the posterior daughter (LH polarity for low-high POP-1 concentration) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deshpande et al., 2005</xref>). The mirror symmetric polarity between P7.p and another VPC P5.p is essential for their mirror-symmetric lineages and the structure of the vulva. The LH polarity of P7.p is instructed by Wnt proteins secreted from the anchor cell located between P5.p and P7.p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Green et al., 2008</xref>). In the gonad, at the L1 stage, somatic gonadal precursor (SGP) cells, Z1 and Z4 have LH and HL polarity, respectively, creating their mirror-symmetric lineages producing distal tip cells (DTCs) from the distal daughters (Z1.a and Z4.p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Siegfried et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). However, it is not known how this mirror-symmetric polarity is established. We have shown previously that SGP polarity is not affected in quintuple Wnt mutants that have mutations in all five Wnt genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, suggesting that Wnts may not be required for SGP polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yamamoto et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell lineage of somatic gonad and asymmetric localizations of POP-1/TCF between somatic gonadal precursor (SGP) daughter cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) After hatching, L1 animals have two SGPs (Z1 and Z4) and primordium germ cells (Z2 and Z3). SGPs undergo mirror-symmetric divisions along the proximal-distal axis, and their distal granddaughters Z1.aa and Z4.pp become distal tip cells (DTCs) that migrate anteriorly and posteriorly, respectively. The U-shape of gonad arms is established through the migration of DTCs. (<bold>B</bold>) Examples of POP-1 localizations in wild-type animals using GFP::POP-1 (<italic>qIs74</italic>).

First, DTCs function as niche cells for germline stem cells, inhibiting their entry into meiosis by expressing the Notch ligand LAG-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Henderson et al., 1994</xref>). Additionally, during gonadogenesis, each DTC migrates with a U-shaped trajectory to guide extension of gonad arms, resulting in U-shaped gonad both on the anterior and posterior sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A recent report suggests that DTCs may not actively migrate by themselves; instead, they are pushed distally by proliferating germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>While the quintuple Wnt mutants exhibit normal SGP polarity, we observed a significant impact on polarity when Wnt mutations are present in the background of the <italic>lin-17/</italic>Frizzled mutation. For example, triple Wnt mutations (<italic>cwn-1 cwn-2 and egl-20</italic>) combined with the <italic>lin-17</italic> mutation disrupt the polarity of both Z1 and Z4. LIN-17 functions in a Wnt-independent manner, as LIN-17 lacking the Wnt binding domain (cysteine-rich domain [CRD]) can rescue gonadal defects in compound mutants containing the <italic>lin-17</italic> mutation. In the <italic>lin-17</italic> background, the three Wnts have distinct functions. Specifically, <italic>cwn-1</italic> promotes HL polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while <italic>cwn-2</italic> promotes LH and HL polarity in Z1 and Z4, respectively. In contrast, <italic>egl-20</italic> inhibits HL polarity induced by <italic>cwn-1</italic>. In <italic>lin-17; egl-20 cwn-2</italic> animals, both Z1 and Z4 show HL polarity disrupting the mirror symmetry of polarity. Notably, in this genotype, we observed that the DTC from Z1 frequently migrates posteriorly similar to that from Z4. We further demonstrated that the ectopic positions of DTCs in the center of the gonad cause mis-migration. Our results suggest that the distal positions of DTCs in the gonad through the mirror-symmetric polarity of SGPs are required for stable distal migration, consistent with the recent report supporting the permissive migration model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2022</xref>). However, the posterior migration of ectopically positioned DTCs from Z1 passing through germ cells in the triple mutants, along with DTC migration in germless <italic>mes-1</italic> mutants, strongly suggests self-migratory mechanisms of DTCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DTC production is controlled by redundant functions of Wnts and LIN-17/Frizzled</title><p>We have previously demonstrated that DTC production and SGP polarity remain normal in any Wnt single or compound mutant strains including quintuple Wnt mutants (<italic>lin-44; cwn-1; egl-20 cwn-2; mom-2</italic>), suggesting that Wnts may not be required for SGP polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yamamoto et al., 2011</xref>). However, when a <italic>cwn-2</italic> mutation was combined with that of <italic>lin-17</italic>/Frizzled, we observed that most animals lacked one or both DTCs (a missing DTC phenotype) as determined by the expression of a DTC marker, <italic>mig-24</italic>::Venus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tamai and Nishiwaki, 2007</xref>). While <italic>lin-17(n3091</italic> with nonsense mutation) single mutants exhibit a weak missing DTC phenotype (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; Sternberg and Horvitz, 1988), <italic>lin-17; cwn-2</italic> showed a strong enhancement in regard to the absence of the anterior DTC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>: p&lt;0.0001 by Pearson’s chi-square test). We observed a similar phenotype in <italic>lin-17(n671); cwn-2</italic> double mutants, confirming that this genetic interaction is not allele-specific. Although mutations in other Wnt genes (<italic>cwn-1</italic> and <italic>egl-20</italic>) by themselves or in combination did not cause such enhancements, the <italic>cwn-1</italic> mutation enhanced the phenotype of <italic>lin-17; cwn-2</italic> for both the anterior and posterior DTCs (p&lt;0.0001 by Pearson’s chi-square test), resulting in the majority of <italic>lin-17; cwn-1; cwn-2</italic> triple mutants lacking both gonadal arms and being sterile. These results indicate that <italic>lin-17</italic>/Frizzled and Wnt genes (<italic>cwn-1</italic> and <italic>cwn-2</italic>) regulate DTC production through parallel pathways.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Missing distal tip cell (DTC) phenotype of compound mutants.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top"/><th align="left" valign="top">Genotype</th><th align="left" valign="top">Anterior</th><th align="left" valign="top">Posterior</th><th align="left" valign="top">n</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">WT</td><td align="left" valign="top">N2</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.0%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.0%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">100</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Wnt receptors</td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>lin-17(n3091</italic>)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn3">*</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">4.7%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">2.8%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">107</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>lin-17</italic> at 15°C<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn3">*</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">11.1%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1.9%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">54</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>mom-5</italic><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn6"><sup>§</sup></xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.0%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.0%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">54</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>lin-17 mom-5</italic><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn6"><sup>§</sup></xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">100%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">100%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">30</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>+osIs113</italic> (ΔCRD-LIN-17)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn3">*</xref><sup>, <xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn6">§</xref></sup></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.0%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.0%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">34</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>lin-17(os2) mom-5</italic><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn6"><sup>§</sup></xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">2.0%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1.0%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">100</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>lin-17(mn589) mom-5</italic><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn6"><sup>§</sup></xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.0%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.0%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">50</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>mig-1 lin-17(n671</italic>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">9.0%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">9.0%</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">67</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>lin-17;

Values within the 95% CI (between the red lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) indicate symmetric localization, while values lower than the 95% CI (below the lower red line) indicate reversed localization, respectively.

On the other hand, <italic>lin-17; egl-20 cwn-2</italic> mutants that exhibited the Dpd phenotype showed reversed Z1 polarity, suggesting a possible link between the polarity reversal of Z1 and the Dpd phenotype (see below).</p><p>To understand the effects of each mutation on SGP polarity, we next statistically compared the distributions of the POP-1 signal ratios among the compound mutants (statistical analyses in this chapter were done by Student’s t-test). To evaluate the effects on SGP polarization irrespective of orientation, we compared the absolute ratios (on a logarithmic scale) of signal intensities between proximal and distal daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) rather than the signed ratios described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. Symmetric POP-1 localization in the <italic>lin-17</italic> mutant was strongly and moderately enhanced by the <italic>cwn-2</italic> mutation for the Z1 and Z4 cells, respectively (p&lt;0.0001 for Z1 and p=0.0108 for Z4 at 15°C; p=0.1400 for Z1 and p=0.4764 for Z4 at 22.5°C in comparison of absolute differences). In the <italic>lin-17; cwn-2</italic> background, this symmetry was further enhanced by the <italic>cwn-1</italic> mutation for the Z4 cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>: p=0.0995 at 15°C; p=0.0088 at 22.5°C in comparison of absolute differences), indicating that, in the absence of LIN-17, Z1 polarity is mostly controlled by CWN-2, while Z4 polarity is regulated by both CWN-1 and CWN-2. In contrast to the effects of <italic>cwn-1</italic>, the <italic>egl-20</italic> mutation rescued the polarization defect in the <italic>lin-17; cwn-2</italic> background at least at 15°C (p&lt;0.0001 for Z1 and p=0.0007 for Z4 in comparison of absolute differences), indicating that <italic>egl-20</italic> has a negative role for SGP polarization. SGP polarization in <italic>lin-17; egl-20 cwn-2</italic> appears to depend on <italic>cwn-1</italic> at 22.5°C (p=0.0592 for Z1 and p&lt;0.0001 for Z4 in comparison of absolute differences).</p><p>In contrast to the rescue of polarization by <italic>egl-20</italic> in the <italic>lin-17 cwn-2</italic> background, comparison of signed but not absolute differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) showed it causes reversal of Z1 but not Z4 polarity (p&lt;0.0001 at 15°C and p=0.0015 at 22.5°C). Interestingly, in this triple mutant, especially at 15°C, Z1 and Z4 have the same HL polarity orientation, indicating that the mirror symmetry of SGP polarity is established through the functions of <italic>lin-17</italic>, <italic>egl-20,</italic> and <italic>cwn-2</italic>.</p><p>Although the <italic>egl-20</italic> mutation suppressed the loss of polarity phenotype in the <italic>lin-17; cwn-2</italic> background, it did not in the <italic>lin-17; cwn-1 cwn-2</italic> background (p=0.6327 and 0.5741 for symmetric Z1 and Z4 polarity, respectively, between <italic>lin-17; cwn-1; cwn-2</italic> and <italic>lin-17; cwn-1; egl-20 cwn-2</italic> in comparison of absolute differences at 22.5°C: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that <italic>egl-20</italic> represses <italic>cwn-1</italic> function.

These results demonstrated that SGP polarity is regulated by the parallel functions of LIN-17/Fz and Wnts.</p><p>To understand how SGP polarity orientation is regulated, we examined whether Wnt functions are instructive or permissive. We attempted to reverse Wnt gradients by ectopically expressing CWN-1 and CWN-2 which are normally expressed posteriorly and anteriorly relative to the gonad, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Harterink et al., 2011</xref>).

Therefore, it remains unclear whether these Wnts are instructive or permissive for SGP polarity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ectopically produced DTCs from Z1 can migrate posteriorly</title><p>In the wild-type, the anterior and posterior DTCs are born and migrate on the right-anterior and left-posterior sides of the body, respectively. In <italic>lin-17; egl-20 cwn-2</italic> mutants with the Dpd phenotype at the early L3 stage, the more posterior DTC among the two DTCs was observed on the left side (left-DTC) at the tip of the gonadal arm similar to the posterior DTC in the wild-type. Meanwhile, the more anterior DTC was on the right side (right-DTC) at the end of the right side gonad. The cup shape of this right-DTC with the reversed orientation compared to that in the right-anterior DTC in wild-type suggests that it was migrating toward the posterior side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). At the late L3 and early L4 stages, both left- and right-DTCs were present in the posterior region. These results strongly suggest that the Dpd phenotype is caused by the reversed migration of the DTC derived from Z1.</p><p>How are the migratory directions of DTCs controlled? Based on Z1 polarity reversal and the Dpd phenotype in <italic>lin-17; egl-20 cwn-2</italic> mutants, we initially examined the possibility that the direction of DTC migration correlates with the polarity of the DTC mother cell (DTC is a granddaughter of Z1/Z4) and that the Dpd phenotype is caused by the polarity reversal of the DTC mother. Since Z1 polarity is completely reversed in <italic>lin-17; egl-20 cwn-2</italic> at 15°C, the DTC is likely to be produced from Z1.p rather than Z1.a. To understand the relationship between Z1.p polarity and the directions of DTC migration derived from Z1.p, we first examined Z1.p polarity by GFP::POP-1 asymmetry between its daughter cells, and then observed DTC positions after the recovery and growth of the animals. In the observed triple mutants, Z1.p polarity was LH (<italic>n</italic>=5) and HL (<italic>n</italic>=5) polarity, indicating that Z1.pa and Z1.pp, respectively, became DTCs. In both cases, the DTC migrated either anteriorly or posteriorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that the migratory direction is not correlated with Z1.p polarity.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Abnormal positions of distal tip cells (DTCs) in <italic>lin-17; cwn-2 egl-20</italic> mutant cause the Dpd phenotype.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) POP-1 asymmetry in Z1.p daughter cells was observed at the late L1 stage.

In the wild-type, the <italic>lag-2</italic> promoter::GFP is weakly expressed in the Z1/Z4 cell and its expression becomes stronger in Z1.aa/Z4.pp (DTC) soon after they are born (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fujita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Henderson et al., 1994</xref>).

If so, when Z1.aa (canonical DTC) becomes a DTC in the triple mutants, it should migrate anteriorly. To examine this, we isolated Z1.aa by sequential ablation of Z1.p and Z1.ap in <italic>lin-17; egl-20 cwn-2</italic> animals grown at 22.5°C. Since the reversal of Z1 polarity is partial at 22.5°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), we expected that Z1.aa could become a DTC even in the triple mutants. However, all 10 animals we examined had one posterior gonadal arm, suggesting that Z1.aa rarely becomes DTC in the triple mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, when Z1.ap was isolated by sequential ablation of Z1.p and Z1.aa, 3 out of 15 animals had a normal anterior arm, and 3 out of 15 showed the Dpd phenotype.

The distinct responses of Z1 and Z4 to CWN-2 appear to be a key for their opposite polarity orientation and mirror-symmetric gonadogenesis. Since these cells have asymmetry in terms of their contacts with germ cells on their proximal sides and those with the basement membrane on their distal sides, CWN-2 may permissively facilitate this asymmetry to control POP-1 localization. Alternatively, Z1 and Z4 may have intrinsic differences in gene expression, leading to distinct responses to CWN-2.

Finally, the upper (<italic>e</italic><sub>upper</sub>) and lower (<italic>e</italic><sub>lower</sub>) bounds of the the 95% CI for each predicted value <italic>ŷ</italic> were calculated using the following formulas:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">w</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The deviations of the upper and lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval were defined as follows:<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>υ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ5"><mml:math id="m5"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>υ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">w</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">w</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Subsequently, distances (Z1.p-Z1.a or Z4.a-Z4.p) along the <italic>Z</italic> axis as well as fluorescent intensities in both wild-type and mutant animals with <italic>sys-1p</italic>::GFP::POP-1 (<italic>qIs74</italic>) were recorded, and the distances were used as the <italic>x</italic> values in the regression equation to calculate theoretical ratios of fluorescence expressed equally between SGP daughter cells.

To evaluate the absolute differences, cases where the residuals were greater than <italic>v</italic><sub>upper</sub> were assessed as exhibiting polarity formation (<italic>ri&gt;v</italic><sub>upper</sub>). Conversely, for the signed differences, cases where the residuals were greater than <italic>v</italic><sub>upper</sub> were defined as having normal polarity(<italic>ri&gt;v</italic><sub>upper</sub>), and cases where the residuals were less than <italic>v</italic><sub>lower</sub> were defined as having reversed polarity (<italic>ri&lt;v</italic><sub>lower</sub>).</p><p>The violin plot was created using the Seaborn library in Python. For absolute differences (|<italic>ri</italic>| values were used), the parameter cut=0 was utilized in violin plots to truncate the kernel density estimation at the minimum and maximum data points, ensuring that the density tails did not extend beyond the actual data range. In contrast, for signed differences (<italic>ri</italic> values were used), the parameter cut=2 was used, allowing the kernel density estimation to extend beyond the observed data range, providing a smoother and more comprehensive visualization of the data distribution. Additionally, to maintain a consistent bandwidth for kernel density estimation in the violin plots, the parameter <italic>bw</italic>=0.2 was set for all plots. <italic>v</italic><sub>upper</sub> and <italic>v</italic><sub>lower</sub> were used as the 95% CI on the violin plot. We used the Student’s t-test to compare the differences in fluorescence intensities between the two groups of interest. The statistical analysis was performed using JMP9 software (SAS, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Scoring the absence and migration of DTCs</title><p>The presence, absence, and positions of DTCs were determined by direct observation of the fluorescence of <italic>mig-24</italic>::Venus using epifluorescent microscopy. For animals lacking <italic>mig-24</italic>::Venus, the assessment was made based on gonad arms under Nomarski microscopy for animals that do not have <italic>mig-24</italic>::Venus. These observation was performed at the L4 or young adult stages. Initial DTC migratory direction was judged by considering the position and cup shape of the DTCs. Anterior and posterior positions of DTCs indicated initial anterior and posterior migration, respectively. When DTCs were observed in the center, their migratory direction (which is opposite to the initial migratory direction) was judged by assessing their cup shape.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cell ablation and photoconversion</title><p>The animals were immobilized on slide glasses using 10 mM sodium azide.

Point-by-point description of the revisions</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>I recommend combining Figures 1 and 3 either before or after the results shown in Figure 2, so the reader's expectation for quantification is immediately satisfied.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. In the revised manuscript, images of GFP::POP-1 in compound mutants are moved to Figure 3. The schematic diagram of the gonad (previously Figure 1A) and GFP::POP-1 images in wild type are kept in Figure 1, as they are described in Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>Delving into the figure legend of Figure 3 and the normalization procedure described in the Methods &quot;Quantification of POP-1 asymmetry in the Z1 and Z4 division&quot; raised concerns. The method therein described is overly complicated but also neglects background subtraction. My first question about this method: what range of distances between daughters is measured in Z? These distances are not discussed in absolute terms, and this is important for our understanding of how much correction for tissue depth might be necessary, as L1s are very thin.</p><p>To check my understanding, the authors use as a control a nuclear-localized GFP driven in the somatic gonad precursors in otherwise wild-type worms by the sys<sup>-1</sup> promoter. They observe that the regression on a log scale of anterior:posterior (and vice versa) Z1 and Z4 daughter fluorescence over the distance between the daughters in the Z plane is fit by y = −0.034x + 0.0148, which is practically a slope of 0 and an intercept of 0. This means that they observed an ~1:1 ratio (as log(1)=0) of fluorescence in the anterior and posterior daughters of otherwise wild-type worms, at least across the range of very small X values of relevant distances between daughters (again, the relevant range of distances really matters and should be presented), making the normalization seem unnecessary.</p></disp-quote><p>Normalization is essential to compare POP-1 signals between daughter cells since the signal intensities depend on the depth of cells. Depth differences between SGP daughter cells range from 0 to 7.5 micrometers. For example, when we input the maximum difference (7.5) into our correction equation y = −0.034x + 0.0148 (the logarithmically transformed linear regression equation), we get:</p><p>y = −0.034 * 7.5 + 0.0148 = -0.2402</p><p>To interpret this on the original scale, we apply the inverse logarithmic transformation:</p><p>10^(-0.2402) ≈0.575</p><p>This result indicates that even if GFP::POP-1 expression is the same in both cells, the depth difference alone can cause approximately a 1.74-fold (1/0. 575) difference in fluorescence intensity.</p><p>Similarly, if we use a median value of 3.5 micrometers as the depth difference, we get: y = -0.1042. After the inverse logarithmic transformation, this corresponds to a 0.787 or 1.27 (1/0.787) fold difference in fluorescence intensity.</p><p>Without normalization, we risk misinterpreting such differences in expression levels when in reality the expression is the same. Conversely, actual differences in GFP::POP-1 signal could be masked or overestimated due to the depth effect.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, examples of depth differences between SGP daughters are shown in Figure 2S which is added in response to the comment of reviewer 2, asking images of lin-17 mom-5 animals.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we explained the depth effects in the legend of Figure 3 as follows.</p><p>“Since SGP daughter cells are often present at distinct focal planes, we normalized the depth effects on fluorescence intensities (see Materials and methods for details) for the quantification shown in (B). The images in (A) and (C) are from animals with SGP daughters at similar depths.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Then based on this regression and 95% CI, the authors predict values that reflect true equivalence of fluorescence of POP-1::GFP in the two SGP daughters, compare the observed values to these predictions, and ultimately display in violin plots these differences of observed and expected. Correct?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, your understanding is correct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is this complicated treatment the only way to detect differences in polarity of anterior and posterior daughters of Z1 and Z4? What happens if the authors measure GFP::POP-1 and calculate the following?</p><p>Z1p(MGV – background control from same focal plane)</p><p>Z1a(MGV – background control from same focal plane)</p><p>If this straightforward analysis shows asymmetric signal in the control that is made symmetrical or reversed in the mutants, the hypothesis would seem to be supported with a much more straightforward method. Samples could be analyzed separately in two bins by worm body position, which affects which cell is superficial in the sample. As it is, the Figure 3 Y axis label is hard to interpret without reading the methods at length, diminishing its impact.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. Your suggested calculation would be simple if we could assume that control signals (sys<sup>-1</sup>p::GFP::NLS or sys<sup>-1</sup>p::GFP::POP-1 in the same wild-type cell) on the same focal plane are the same among animals. However, since there are apparent variations in expression levels among individuals, your suggested method is not appropriate for evaluating differences in sys<sup>-1</sup>p::GFP::POP-1 intensities between the SGP daughter cells of the same animal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Missing control: The sys<sup>-1</sup> promoter-driven NLS-tagged fluorescent protein as a control to compare to the GFP::POP-1 is analyzed only in the wild-type, and apparently not in the mutants under consideration. Phillips et al. (2007) show that sys<sup>-1</sup>p transcriptional activity is equivalent between the SGP daughters in wild-type worms, but neither those results nor the method of normalizing to a sys<sup>-1</sup>p::GFP::NLS signal in this paper address the question of whether sys<sup>-1</sup> promoter activity is equivalent in these cells in mutants upstream in the Wnt pathway. If the current method of normalization is to be used, it seems important to normalize to the sys<sup>-1</sup>p::GFP::NLS regression in each mutant background.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We used sys<sup>-1</sup>p::GFP::NLS as a control to normalize depth effects, which should be the same across all genotypes because the GFP molecules in SGPs should be equally distributed between SGP daughter cells, not because sys<sup>-1</sup> promoter activities are similar among them. Since SGP daughters divide within a short time (about 2 hours), it is likely that the fluorescence of newly synthesized GFP (maturation time of about 1 hour) in SGP daughters is neglectable compared to GFP inherited from the SGP cells. Similarly, sys<sup>-1</sup>p::GFP::POP-1 signals in SGP daughters reflect the distribution of GFP::POP-1 from SGPs rather than the transcriptional activities of the sys<sup>-1</sup> promoter in the daughter cells. sys<sup>-1</sup>p::GFP::POP-1 or sys<sup>-1</sup>p::GFP::SYS<sup>-1</sup> has been widely used to evaluate polarity of asymmetric divisions in a number of studies, none of which consider transcriptional differences of the sys<sup>-1</sup> promoter in the daughter cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. How was lin-17(mn589) generated? if this is the first report of this allele, full information on what the lesion is and how it was derived should to be reported.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question regarding the lin-17(mn589) allele. We would like to point out that the information about this allele is provided in the Methods section of the original manuscript as follows.</p><p>“lin-17(mn589) (gifted by Mike Herman) carries a mutation in the seventh cysteine residue of the CRD domain (C104Y). mn589 exhibits 47% Psa phenotype (indicating T cell polarity defects).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The methods section lacks a description of how the mes<sup>-1</sup> experiments were done, in terms of timing, duration, and temperature; mes<sup>-1</sup>(bn7) is a temperature sensitive allele.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the lack of detailed methodology for the mes<sup>-1</sup> experiments. The germless phenotype of mes<sup>-1</sup> mutants is partial even at high temperatures. We have not performed temperature shifts to observe the phenotype. As per your suggestion, we added the following text to the Strains section:</p><p>&quot;mes<sup>-1</sup>(bn7) is a temperature-sensitive allele with higher penetrance of the germless phenotype at 25°C than at 15°C, and was grown at 22.5°C. The germless phenotype of mes<sup>-1</sup>(bn7) was observed by the absence of the mex-5::GFP::PH signal through direct observation of epifluorescence.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>1. The paper lacks a discussion of precedent in the literature for Wnt-independent Frizzled activity; this is a major finding that is being undersold in the current version of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for appreciating out finding. We have added the following paragraph to the Discussion section:</p><p>“Wnt-independent functions of Frizzled receptors</p><p>We have shown that lin-17/Fzd functions in a Wnt-independent manner to control SGP polarity, since the missing DTC phenotype of lin-17; cwn-2 and lin-17 mom-5 was completely rescued by ΔCRD-LIN-17. In addition, SGP polarity is normal in the quintuple Wnt mutant that has mutations in all the Wnt genes (Yamamoto et al., 2011). In seam cells, Wnt receptors including LIN-17/Fzd and MOM-5/Fzd appear to have Wnt-independent functions for cell polarization, as seam cells are still mostly polarized in the quintuple Wnt mutants, while they are strongly unpolarized in the triple receptor mutants (lin-17 mom-5 cam-1/Ror) (Yamamoto et al., 2011). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Fz/Fzd has been primarily considered to function Wnt-independently to coordinate planar cell polarity (PCP) between neighboring cells (Lawrence et al., 2007), though Fz function can still be regulated by Wnt, as PCP orientation can be directed by ectopically expressed Wnt proteins (Wu et al., 2013).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Fz regulates PCP by interacting with other PCP components including Van Gogh (Vang). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we found that vang-1/Vang does not appear to function with LIN-17/Fz, since most vang-1 single mutants and cwn-1 cwn-2 vang-1 triple mutants have two gonadal arms (215/216 and 58/58, respectively). As Fz interacts with Disheveled (DSH) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> PCP regulation, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the Disheveled homologs DSH-2 and MIG-5 regulate SGP polarity (Phillips et al., 2007). Therefore, LIN-17 might regulate the DSH homologs in a Wnt-independent manner. “</p><p>Added Reference:</p><p>1. Lawrence PA, Struhl G, Casal J. (2007). Planar cell polarity: one or two pathways?

Important: I think &quot;Figure 6 Germ cell independent migration of germ cells&quot; title is a typo; should be &quot;Germ cell independent migration of DTCs&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the typo. We corrected it in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. This is a very important experiment! I think a greater description of the mes<sup>-1</sup> phenotype would be helpful, since loss of germline was not 100% penetrant in mes<sup>-1</sup>(bn7) hermaphrodites in Strome et al., 1995. The legend says &quot;Germless mes<sup>-1</sup> phenotype was confirmed by the absence of the mex-5::GFP::PH signal in the gonad.&quot; Consider adding a few sentences to the results (or methods, from which the mes<sup>-1</sup> experiments are currently missing) describing that only mes<sup>-1</sup> animals that lacked germline fluorescence were analyzed for DTC migration.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for providing the context. To address the concerns, we made the following changes to our manuscript:</p><p>1. In the Results section, we revised the sentence &quot;We found that 84% of DTCs (n = 90) in germless mes<sup>-1</sup> animals…&quot; to &quot;Among mes<sup>-1</sup> animals that lack germ cells, we found 84% of DTCs (n = 90)…&quot;.</p><p>2. We also modified the sentence &quot;We noticed that some germless mes<sup>-1</sup> animals…&quot; to &quot;We noticed that some mes<sup>-1</sup> animals that lack germ cells…&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Please correct &quot;secreting the Notch ligand LAG-2&quot; this is a membrane-bound, not secreted ligand</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. In the revised manuscript, we modified the relevant sentence in the Introduction section as follows:</p><p>“Firstly, DTCs function as niche cells for germline stem cells, inhibiting their entry into meiosis by expressing the Notch ligand LAG-2 (Henderson et al., 1994).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 1. The qualitative loss of polarity would be better depicted with a grayscale image instead of green-on-black.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. The GFP::POP-1 images are raw images of the green channel of the confocal microscopy. We believe that SGP polarity is clearly depicted by them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 3 the presentation of these violin plots is confusing. The central text that reads &quot;normal polarity, loss of polarity, reversed polarity&quot; with arrows looks like a second Y axis label attached to the Z4 plot. I recommend rearranging. Consider shading the top, bottom, and central regions and explaining the meaning of the shading in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions regarding the presentation of Figure 3. In response to your feedback, we have made the following modifications:</p><p>First, we moved the text and arrows from the center to the right side of the figure, creating a clearer layout. As you recommended, we applied shading to the top, bottom, and central regions of the violin plots. Additionally, to explain the meaning of the shading, we added a new explanation to the figure legend. Specifically, we included the following text:</p><p>&quot;Values within the 95% CI (between the red lines; light green regions) indicate symmetric localization. Values below the lower red line (light blue regions) indicate reversed localization, while values above the upper red line (light red regions) indicate normal localization.”</p><p>We applied the same modification to Supplemental Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>Major comments</p><p>1. Are the effects of combining the different Wnts with the lin-17 allele specific to the n3091 allele? It would be important to test another allele, for example the sy277 allele has a similar phenotype and is available at CGC. A null would be even better if it is viable. Alternatively, lin-17(RNAi) could instead be used if efficient enough. This is important since the n3091 allele could differentially alter the binding to the various Wnts, resulting in their distinct phenotypes in that background. However, these distinct phenotypes may not be relevant in a wild-type context.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful comment. The lin-17(n3091) allele contains a nonsense mutation at the 35th codon, located between the second and third cysteine residues in the CRD domain (Wnt binding domain) (Sawa et al. 1996). Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the N-terminal protein of 34 amino acids produced in lin-17(n3091) can bind to Wnts. In the revised manuscript, we added the missing-DTC phenotype of lin-17(n671) cwn-2 animals, which show a similar phenotype to lin-17(n3091) cwn-2. n671 is a reference allele in WormBase and has a nonsense mutation. Although sy277 has a deletion in the N-terminal region, its phenotype is weaker than that of n3091 and n671 (Sawa et al. 1996).</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we described lin-17(n671) cwn-2, in the Table 1, Table S1 and added the following sentence.</p><p>“We observed a similar phenotype in lin-17(n671); cwn-2 double mutants, confirming that this genetic interaction is not allele-specific.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In the lin-17; mom-5 double mutant which lacks DTCs, are Z1 and Z4 there but they do not express DTC markers, or are they never born? A lineage analysis should be presented. Also, are Z2 and Z3 still there on their own? Please show images.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We quantified sys<sup>-1</sup>p::GFP::POP-1 signals in Z1 and Z4 daughter cells of lin-17 mom-5 and have not observed any animals lacking Z1, Z4 or germ cells. In the revised manuscript, as Figure S2, we added images of sys<sup>-1</sup>p::GFP::POP-1 localizations in SGP daughters, along with germ cells in lin-17 mom-5 as well as in lin-17 cwn-1 egl-20 cwn-2, both of which were not shown in the original manuscript. In response to Reviewer 1’s comment, we also included examples of depth effects on fluorescence intensities in Figure S2 with images of different focal planes.</p><p>Figure S2 is quoted it at the end of the following sentence.</p><p>“Then, we quantified the ratios (on a logarithmic scale) of sys<sup>-1</sup>p::GFP::POP-1 signal intensities proximal to distal daughter cells in various genotypes (Figure 3A and Figure S2).”</p><p>The loss of polarity phenotype of lin-17 mom-5 has been described in Phillips et al.

Figure 2 is cited in the text before Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. Figure1 is mentioned in the Introduction before Figure 2 is referenced in the Result section in the original manuscript. We think the reviewer might be confused, as the POP-1 localization defect was shown in Figure 1. In response to the reviewer 1’s comment, we moved the POP-1 localization images of the compound mutants to Figure 3. In addition, we noticed that in the original manuscript, Figure 1B was mentioned before Figure 1A in the Introduction. Therefore, we have modified the sentences in the Introduction.</p><p>The original sentence was:</p><p>&quot;In the gonad, at the L1 stage, somatic gonadal precursor cells (SGPs), Z1 and Z4 have LH and HL polarity, respectively (Siegfried et al., 2004) (Figure 1B).

The results also suggest that MOM-5/Frizzled might be the receptor for Wnts regulating DTC production, as lin-17 mom-5 double mutants completely lack DTCs.&quot; Table 1 results rather suggest that lin-17 and mom-5 are the two frizzled receptor involved in DTC specification and that they are largely redundant.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer noted, lin-17 and mom-5 function redundantly in DTC specification (SGP polarization). However, their functions are clearly different in terms of genetic interactions with Wnt genes (e.g. lin-17 cwn-2 but not mom-5 cwn-2 show the DTC-missing phenotype). We propose that MOM-5 but not LIN-17 functions as a receptor for Wnts.</p></body></sub-article></article>
