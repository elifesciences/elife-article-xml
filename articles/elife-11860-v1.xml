Rational design of such tools requires detailed knowledge of allosteric light signaling in natural photoreceptors. To understand allosteric communication between sensor and effector domains, characterization of all relevant signaling states is required. Here, we describe the mechanism of light-dependent DNA binding of the light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) transcription factor Aureochrome 1a from <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum (Pt</italic>Au1a) and present crystal structures of a dark state LOV monomer and a fully light-adapted LOV dimer. In combination with hydrogen/deuterium-exchange, solution scattering data and DNA-binding experiments, our studies reveal a light-sensitive interaction between the LOV and basic region leucine zipper DNA-binding domain that together with LOV dimerization results in modulation of the DNA affinity of <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a. We discuss the implications of these results for the design of synthetic LOV-based photosensors with application in optogenetics.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11860.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11860.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11860.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The ability to react to sunlight is important for the survival of a wide range of lifeforms. Many organisms, including humans, plants, bacteria and algae, sense light using specialized proteins called photoreceptors. These proteins are able to translate the information transported by light into various biological activities.</p><p>The structure of a photoreceptor can be broken down into different parts, each with a specialized role. For example, the light-sensing region of a photoreceptor typically binds to small molecules called chromophores that are able to absorb light. This light absorption causes changes in the photoreceptor that are ultimately transmitted to a part of the protein that can bind to DNA or perform some other type of biological activity. This activity triggers further processes that build up to the organism’s reaction to the incoming light.</p><p>Aureochromes are photoreceptors that detect blue light and are found in algae. The light-sensing and DNA-binding parts of aureochromes are arranged in a different way to the arrangement seen in most related photoreceptors. This raises questions about how the light signal is transmitted to the DNA-binding part of the protein and how this affects the DNA binding of aureochromes.</p><p>By using a combination of biophysical and structural methods, Heintz and Schlichting now provide detailed information about the structural changes that blue light causes in the Aureochrome 1a photoreceptor found in the algae <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic>. This shows that when exposed to light, the light-sensing part of the photoreceptor, called LOV domain, detaches from the DNA binding part and binds to the LOV region of a second molecule. This helps the protein to bind to DNA.</p><p>Recently, synthetic photoreceptors have been engineered that use the light-sensing part of aureochromes. Therefore, as well as contributing to the fundamental understanding of light signaling in photoreceptors, Heintz and Schlichting’s findings can be used to help develop light-controllable artificial proteins for use in research, medicine or industry.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11860.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11860.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>allosteric signaling</kwd><kwd>light state</kwd><kwd>DNA binding</kwd><kwd>basic region leucine zipper</kwd><kwd>photoreceptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR526</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schlichting</surname><given-names>Ilme</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schlichting</surname><given-names>Ilme</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hartmut Hoffmann-Berling International Graduate School of Molecular and Cellular Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heintz</surname><given-names>Udo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Light absorption by the algal transcription factor Aureochrome 1a causes dimerization at the light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) sensing domain, which has implications for the design of synthetic photoreceptors for optogenetics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Light-sensing is essential for the survival of organisms from all kingdoms of life and plays an important role in their adaptation to different habitats. Prokaryotes, higher plants, fungi, animals and algae use light-sensing systems that encompass a variety of sensory photoreceptors that respond to different wavelengths of light. Recently, a new type of blue light photoreceptor termed Aureochrome (Aureo) was discovered in the photosynthetic stramenopile alga <italic>Vaucheria frigida</italic> that has been suggested to function as blue light-regulated transcription factor. Originally, two Aureo homologs, named Aureo 1 and 2, were identified, but only Aureo1 was shown to bind DNA in a light-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>). Since the discovery of the first Aureos, several orthologs from other stramenopile algae such as <italic>Ochromonas danica, Fucus distichus, Saccharina japonica</italic> and <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic> have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ishikawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schellenberger Costa et al., 2013</xref>). The diatom <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> has four genes encoding aureochromes: three orthologs of type 1 (<italic>Pt</italic>Au1a, b and c) and one of type 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Depauw et al., 2012</xref>). Only <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a has been functionally characterized so far and is shown to be involved in light-dependent mitosis regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huysman et al., 2013</xref>) and repress high-light acclimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schellenberger Costa et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Aureos typically consist of an N-terminal domain with unknown function, a basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) sensing domain. LOV domains are a subgroup of the Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) superfamily that sense blue light using a noncovalently bound flavin cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zoltowski and Gardner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herrou and Crosson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Losi and Gartner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Conrad et al., 2014</xref>). Photon absorption of the flavin results in formation of a flavin-C4(a)-cysteinyl adduct with a conserved cysteine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salomon et al., 2000</xref>), which initiates a cascade of structural rearrangements within the LOV core that are propagated to the domain boundaries. LOV domains can be found as isolated entities, but are often part of multidomain proteins where they are coupled to a variety of different effector domains. The effector-sensor topology observed in Aureos differs from the domain topology found in most other LOV photoreceptors where the sensory LOV domain is located N-terminally to the effector domain. This rare domain topology raises the question of how light signaling is achieved in Aureos compared with other LOV proteins.</p><p>Recent biochemical and spectroscopic experiments on <italic>V. frigida</italic> Aureo1 (<italic>Vf</italic>Au1) and <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a led to the hypothesis that DNA binding of Aureos might be influenced by light-induced LOV domain dimerization and that structural changes of the N– (A´α) and C-terminal (Jα) helices flanking the LOV core play a key role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Toyooka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herman and Kottke, 2015</xref>). This hypothesis was supported to some extent by the crystal structure of the <italic>Vf</italic>Au1 LOV domain that showed an unexpected dimeric arrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitra et al., 2012</xref>). However, this structure was determined from crystals grown in the dark and it remains unclear whether the observed dimeric LOV arrangement represents the biologically relevant light state dimer. To obtain insights into structural rearrangements within V<italic>f</italic>Au1 LOV upon light activation, dark state crystals were illuminated to study light-induced conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitra et al., 2012</xref>). However, crystal lattice constraints can prevent large conformational changes that limit this approach. Therefore, the mechanism of light-induced LOV dimerization and its consequences on DNA binding in Aureos remain unclear.</p><p>Here, we present crystal structures of a fully light-adapted LOV dimer as well as of a dark state LOV monomer of <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a. We combine these results with hydrogen/deuterium-exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments of full-length <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a and of a truncated construct that lacks the N-terminal domain, respectively. Together with functional studies, this integrative structural approach enabled us to establish a model for light signaling in Aureos where, in the dark, the LOV domain directly interacts with the bZIP domain and thereby impedes its DNA binding function. Illumination with blue light triggers intramolecular bZIP–LOV dissociation and subsequent LOV dimerization, thus enhancing the affinity of <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a for its target DNA sequence. Together, these results provide insight into the molecular mechanism of Aureo function and implicate a new model of light-dependent gene regulation by Aureos in stramenopiles. In addition, they offer new design strategies for synthetic Aureo–LOV based photosensors for applications in optogenetics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dark state recovery of <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>full</sub>, <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub> and <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub></title><p>To understand how blue light-sensing of the LOV domain influences <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a DNA binding, we used the full-length protein (<italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>full</sub>) and additionally generated N- and C-terminally truncated <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a variants encompassing the bZIP and LOV domain (<italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub>), the bZIP domain (<italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>bZIP</sub>) as well as the LOV domain (<italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub>) containing its N- and C-terminal α-helical extensions A´α (in the context of PAS domains often referred to as N-cap) and Jα, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Peak tailing and a continuous decrease of the molar mass signal in the dark and light state of <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>full</sub> and <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub> suggested an equilibrium between dimers and monomers irrespective of the light conditions.

As observed for <italic>Vf</italic>Au1 LOV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitra et al., 2012</xref>), the C-terminal Jα helix partially folds back onto the surface of the β-sheet and interacts with the LOV core via hydrogen bonds between the conserved residue Gln365 and the carbonyl and amine group of Cys316 as well as the side chains of Tyr357 and Gln330. A´α forms an amphipathic three-turn helix and interacts with the LOV core through a highly conserved 4 amino acid linker with Ala248, Glu249, Glu250 and Gln251 in the hinge region. In addition to Jα, A´α also folds back across the surface of the β-sheet and covers a large hydrophobic patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). The chromophore binding pocket is mainly formed by hydrophobic residues that stabilize the FMN chromophore together with Gln350, Gln291, Asn319, Asn329, which form hydrogen bonds with the heteroatoms of the isoalloxazine ring. FMN is additionally stabilized by Arg304 and Arg288, which interact with the phosphate group of the ribityl chain.

Therefore, to detect the full extent of light-induced structural changes, crystals of the light state need to be grown under continuous blue light illumination of the setup. The increase in structural dynamics and aggregation tendency upon illumination of most photoreceptors as well as potential photobleaching makes crystallization of photoreceptors difficult and has so far only been achieved for the single LOV domain proteins VIVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vaidya et al., 2011</xref>) and PpsB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Circolone et al., 2012</xref>) as well as for a truncated phytochrome construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Takala et al., 2014</xref>). These photoreceptors revert slowly back into their dark conformation or, as in the case of VIVID, have been modified to do so. To obtain the structure of a fully light-adapted <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> dimer, we set up crystallization screens of wildtype <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> under continuous blue light illumination and obtained colorless crystals overnight. Their lack of color is indicative of formation of the flavin-C4(a)-cysteinyl adduct. As expected from the MALS measurements, light-activated <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> crystallized as a dimer that features an assembly similar to other N-cap-comprising PAS dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heintz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayers and Moffat, 2008</xref>). The two <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> protomers are related by a 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry that does not apply to the A´α helices. The observed parallel dimer arrangement differs significantly from the antiparallel dimer arrangement observed for the dark state structure of <italic>Vf</italic>Au1 LOV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitra et al., 2012</xref>). Analysis of the contact area using the <italic>PISA</italic> web server revealed a buried surface area (BSA) of 1524 Å<sup>2</sup>, which is similar to that observed for the VIVID light state dimer (1342 Å<sup>2</sup>), supporting the observed dimer arrangement as biologically relevant. The main dimerization interface is formed by a network of hydrophobic residues on the core β-sheet and A´α. Superposition of the dark and light state structures not only reveals a variety of light-induced side chain rearrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), but also a significant change of the position of the A´α helix that is released from the hydrophobic patch on the LOV core, thus exposing the dimerization site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Compared with the dark state structure, the C-terminal part of Jα is unstructured and the hydrogen bonds between Gln365 and the carbonyl and amine group of Cys316 are broken, indicating light-induced Jα undocking from the LOV β-sheet and subsequent unfolding as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herman et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the side chains of Cys316 and Leu317 located on strand Gβ also undergo conformational changes upon illumination, which may promote light-induced Jα undocking from the LOV core. Jα seems to contribute directly to the stability of the light state dimer by interacting with A'α of the second protomer. However, the effect of these interactions needs to be interpreted with caution since the conformations of the A´α helices differ between the two protomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This could either originate from intrinsic asymmetry of the <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> light-state dimer or from asymmetry induced by crystal contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The formation of the covalent Cys287–FMN adduct and the resulting doming of the isoalloxazine ring at position C4a are supported by the F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub> omit map and the 2F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub> map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Light-induced rotamer changes were observed for a variety of residues predominantly in the vicinity of the FMN cofactor (Leu317, Phe331 and Ile333) or on the outer side of strand Iβ (Cys 351) and Gβ (Met 313). Additionally, the highly conserved Tyr266 located on strand Bβ shows a light-induced rotation out of the dimer interface, which is prerequisite for LOV dimerization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The LOV and bZIP domains of PtAu1a interact in the dark</title><p>To relate light-induced LOV dimerization to the enhanced DNA binding of <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>full</sub> in the light and to identify structural elements involved in light signaling, we performed HDX-MS measurements comparing deuterium uptake of dark- and light-adapted <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>full</sub> in the absence and presence of DNA as well as of dark- and light adapted <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub>. Measurements on <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> confirmed the important role of A´α for dimer formation and revealed slightly reduced deuterium incorporation into fast-exchanging amides of A´α in light-adapted <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). After longer exchange times, all except one of the A´α peptides show the opposite effect and exhibit slightly increased deuterium incorportation. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Analysis of the peptide overlap showed that the observed destabilization originates from an increased exchange of the amide proton of Phe252 that is located on strand Aβ and is part of the <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> dimerization site that is covered by A´α in the dark state crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). In the dark as well as light state structure, the Phe252 amide proton is in hydrogen bonding distance to the hydroxyl group of Ser268 located between strand Bβ and helix Cα that is also destabilized at later time points, suggesting interaction of these elements. Decreased conformational dynamics is observed for helix Eα encompassing the photoreactive cysteine that forms the covalent Cys287-FMN adduct upon illumination. Structural stabilization is observed for the end of strand Hβ with its adjacent loop that is in hydrogen bonding distance to Bβ upon dimer formation. Only negligible light-induced differences in deuterium uptake are observed for Jα that was shown to unwind upon illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herman et al., 2013</xref>) and that is also partially unstructured in the light state crystal structure. This originates from the fact that Jα is highly dynamic already in the dark and amide hydrogen exchange is too rapid to detect a further light-induced increase of the hydrogen exchange rate of Jα due to the limited time resolution of the chosen HDX-MS approach. Similar results were also reported for HDX-MS and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on the isolated LOV2 domain of photoropin 1 from <italic>Avena sativa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Winkler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harper et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to Jα, A´α is also highly dynamic and shows a high degree of deuterium incorporation in the dark and light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). The moderate protection observed for the crystallographic <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> light state dimer interface upon illumination is in line with HDX-MS measurements performed on VIVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2014</xref>) and suggests a rapid monomer–dimer interconversion. Thus, the HDX-MS data obtained for <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> highlight the important role of A´α for light-induced dimerization and support the observed dimer arrangement in the crystal structure also in solution.</p><p>In contrast to the weak light-induced changes observed for <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub>, measurements on <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>full</sub> revealed pronounced destabilization of several elements of the LOV domain upon illumination including Jα and A´α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, elements within the bZIP DNA-binding domain are significantly destabilized, whereas the N-terminal domain and bZIP–LOV linker region are mainly unaffected by LOV activation. The deuterium exchange behavior determined for LOV domain peptides of light-activated <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>full</sub> and free <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> are nearly identical, indicating no differences in the conformation or interaction state of the free or effector-coupled LOV domain in the light state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, the pronounced differences in deuterium exchange of the LOV and bZIP domains between dark- and light-adapted protein can be explained by a direct interaction between the two domains in the dark, which is broken upon illumination and subsequent LOV dimerization.</p><p>Closer inspection of the HDX-MS data suggests the N-terminal part of the leucine zipper as the potential interaction site of the two domains in the dark. Peptides within this region revealed bimodal exchange behavior, indicative of two distinct protein populations with slow interconversion and significantly different deuterium exchange kinetics (EX1 kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Konermann, Pan, and Liu, 2011</xref>)), which might reflect bZIP–LOV dissociation during labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Interestingly, A´α as well as elements of Iβ and the beginning of Jα show a significant increase in deuterium uptake upon illumination and exhibit exchange kinetics similar to those observed for the leucine zipper peptides around residues 176-184, suggesting functional interplay or direct interaction of these elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b–d</xref>). Structural destabilization is observed for helix Fα and its adjacent linker regions as well as Hβ and the loop between Gβ and Hβ. Since slowly exchanging amides are involved in the exchange of the aforementioned elements, the observed destabilization can be interpreted as an increase in structural dynamics. The N-terminal domain as well as the linker connecting the bZIP and LOV domain show rapid deuterium uptake in the dark and light, which identifies these regions as highly dynamic and probably unstructured as also suggested from secondary structure prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Subtle light-induced structural destabilization was observed for the region between residues 28 and 44 of the N-terminal domain, which suggests that illumination also affects the function of the N-terminal domain.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11860.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>HDX-MS data of <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>full</sub> in the absence and presence of DNA.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Changes in deuterium incorporation of <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>full</sub> mapped onto the structure of the <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> light state dimer and a model of the bZIP domain.

However, light measurements of <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub> in the presence of DNA clearly show that illumination together with DNA binding induces bZIP–LOV dissociation and results in an elongated protein–DNA complex with R<sub>g</sub> and D<sub>max</sub> values that are significantly larger than those observed for dark-adapted <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Aureos are blue light-regulated transcription factors that exhibit an unusual effector–sensor domain topology that is opposite to the domain order found in most LOV proteins and raises the question how signal transmission and light-dependent DNA binding are achieved in these photoreceptors. Our studies on <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a in the presence of its cognate DNA provide structural and functional insights into light-dependent DNA binding of Aureos with implications not only for their biological function, but also for a better understanding of allosteric light-signaling in multidomain LOV proteins.</p><p>Crystal structures of the activated light state dimer as well as of the dark state <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> monomer reveal the molecular mechanism of blue light-dependent Aureo LOV dimerization. The N- and C-terminal A'α and Jα helices flanking the LOV core play a central role in this process and are directly affected by illumination as also observed for phototropin-LOV2 from <italic>Av. sativa</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zayner, Antoniou, and Sosnick, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takeda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harper, Neil, and Gardner, 2003</xref>). In the dark, A'α covers the hydrophobic dimerization site of the LOV β-sheet that becomes exposed upon illumination and thus enables LOV dimerization. These results provide a molecular mechanism for recent size-exclusion chromatography experiments performed on isolated <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a LOV constructs lacking A'α and/or Jα that also imply that A'α covers the LOV dimerization site in the dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herman and Kottke, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herman et al., 2013</xref>). However, not only A'α, but also Jα is affected by blue light illumination. It undocks from the LOV β-sheet and partially unfolds. The light-induced structural changes observed for A'α and Jα are in line with Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy studies that also indicate light-induced structural changes in both helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herman and Kottke, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herman et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, it was reported that A'α is only affected by illumination in the presence and after unfolding of Jα, whereas Jα unfolds even in the absence of A'α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herman and Kottke, 2015</xref>). Since a direct interaction between the two helices is not observed in the dark state <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> crystal structure, the interdependence between A'α and Jα indicates an allosteric interplay between the two helices as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herman and Kottke, 2015</xref>). Allosteric signaling occurs via the LOV β-sheet and involves the central strand Iβ, which is covalently coupled to Jα and also interacts with A'α in the dark. The important role of the LOV β-sheet in light-signaling is supported by the fact that several β-sheet residues show light-induced rotamer changes. Since the dimer arrangement observed in the <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> light state structure differs from the dimeric assembly observed in the recently determined dark state crystal structure of <italic>Vf</italic>Au1 LOV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitra et al., 2012</xref>), it can be concluded that a combination of light-induced structural rearrangements within the LOV core together with undocking of Jα from the β-sheet are required to trigger the release of A'α from the LOV core, which ultimately induces the formation of the biologically relevant light state dimer. In contrast to the consecutive structural changes reported for the flanking helices of <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a LOV, A'α and Jα of phototropin-LOV2 exhibit structural changes independently of each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zayner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takeda et al., 2013</xref>), which implies differences in the signaling mechanism of Aureos and Phototropins.</p><p>Two models for light-dependent DNA binding of <italic>Vf</italic>Au1 have been proposed in the literature where LOV dimerization plays a central role. According to the first model, <italic>Vf</italic>Au1 is dimeric regardless of the light conditions and additional light-induced LOV dimerization enhances its affinity for DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Toyooka et al., 2011</xref>). In the second model, DNA binding not only depends on the light, but also on the redox conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hisatomi et al., 2014</xref>). Under reducing conditions, <italic>Vf</italic>Au1 exists as a monomer and blue light illumination changes the oligomerization state from monomers to dimers, thus increasing the affinity for its target DNA sequence. Under oxidizing conditions, intermolecular disulfide bonds are formed between the bZIP domains and the bZIP–LOV linker regions, which induce <italic>Vf</italic>Au1 dimerization and enable light-independent DNA binding. We point out that <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a does not possess cysteine residues outside the LOV domain and is therefore unable to form such disulfide bonds. Consequently, an influence of the redox conditions on the DNA binding of <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a can be ruled out. Concerning light-induced changes in the oligomerization state, we could not detect indications for light-induced <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>full</sub> and <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub> oligomerization in any of our experiments. Instead, our data suggests a mechanism where the LOV domain directly interacts with the leucine zipper region of the bZIP domain in the dark, impeding its DNA binding function. Our HDX-MS data suggest that the LOV–bZIP interaction might occur via the LOV β-sheet and directly involves A'α as well as Jα. Upon blue light illumination, structural changes occur within the LOV core that are transmitted to the flanking helices and result in bZIP–LOV dissociation and subsequent LOV dimerization, thus increasing the affinity of <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a for its target DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Such an allosteric signaling mechanism not only explains the absence of changes in structural dynamics of the bZIP–LOV linker region upon illumination, but also explains the need for the &gt; 30 amino acids long linker in Aureos, which is required to enable direct bZIP–LOV interaction. Our model is further supported by recent data on N-terminally truncated and modified <italic>Vf</italic>Au1 constructs that also indicate an interaction between the leucine zipper and the LOV domain in the dark, although it was hypothesized that this interaction stabilizes the monomeric form of the synthetic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakatani and Hisatomi, 2015</xref>). Moreover, a mechanism involving light-induced release of the LOV domain from its interaction site on the bZIP domain is consistent with the general concept of LOV and PAS domain signaling via the β-sheet surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harper et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zoltowski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Möglich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nash et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rivera-Cancel et al., 2014</xref>). Since the cellular concentration of <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a is not known, we cannot completely exclude a regulatory mechanism where light-induced LOV dimerization additionally influences the oligomerization state and thus DNA binding of <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a <italic>in vivo</italic>.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11860.029</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for light-regulated gene expression by <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a.</title><p>(<bold>1</bold>) In the dark, <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a is dimeric and the LOV and bZIP domains interact directly thus inhibiting DNA binding of <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a. 2-4: close up of the LOV domain.

Detailed structural and functional characterization of the light- and dark-adapted states are required for elucidating how the light signal is transmitted from the light-sensing LOV to the effector domain. Our data for <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a not only contribute to the understanding of the modularity and allosteric light signaling in LOV proteins, but also provides important information for rational and structure-guided design of new optogenetic tools. In fact, our data also explain the underlying working mechanism of recently engineered Aureo LOV containing light-activatable synthetic transcription factors and receptor tyrosine kinases that are based on light-dependent homo-dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grusch et al., 2014</xref>). These successful applications of Aureo LOVs highlight their efficacy as photodimerizers. However, the full potential of Aureo LOV domains for the design of optogenetic devices has not been exploited yet. In addition to their dimerization ability, the concerted undocking of A'α, Jα as well as of the bZIP domain from the LOV core can be used for the design of new optogenetic tools. The light-sensitive bZIP–LOV interaction observed in Aureos allows combining the engineering strategies developed for leucine zippers and coiled coils with the light-sensing function of LOV domains. This unique combination of different functionalities provided by Aureos offers new design strategies for robust and tightly controllable molecular switches that allow precise spatial and temporal control of biological processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning of the full-length and truncated <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a variants</title><p>The pETM-11 plasmids encoding <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> codon optimized <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>full</sub> (Epoch Life Science) and <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> were kindly provided by H.

Your article has been reviewed by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Volker Dötsch is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following peer reviewer has agreed to reveal his identity: Keith Moffat.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>LOV proteins are ubiquitous sensory transduction elements that are of widespread relevance to pathogenicity, agricultural production and optogenetic tool design. Further, shared mechanisms with PAS domain containing proteins have positioned LOV proteins as a model of allosteric signal transduction in diverse organisms. Currently, structural information on dark- and light-states of LOV proteins is unavailable for multi-domain containing LOV photoreceptors. For these reasons, concrete evidence of allosteric mechanisms is currently unavailable.</p><p>The paper by Heintz and Schlichting describes the structural characterization of the LOV transcription factor Aureochrome1. In contrast to other LOV domain-containing transcription factors, this particular one shows a different organization of its domains. The authors use size-exclusion chromatography, deuterium exchange MS measurements, SAXS measurements and x-ray crystallography to build a model of how illumination with blue light enhances the DNA binding affinity. According to their model, the LOV domain in the dark state binds to the bZIP DNA-binding domain. In the light state soem structural elements of the LOV domain are partially unfolded, allowing for a structural rearrangement that releases the LOV domain and triggers its dimerization.</p><p>This is an elegant and interesting model of a complex transcription factor. In the absence of a high resolution structure the authors use a combination of different biophysical methods to characterize the structural changes. All reviewers agreed that the results are highly relevant and interesting and that the paper is clearly written.</p><p>Some questions, however, remain that should be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the differences between the dark and the light state on the gel filtratoin column are very tiny. If illumination triggers the dimerization of the LOV domain, this should shift the equilibrium towards the dimer. The kD of LOV domain dimerization is rather weak (13 µM), however, the local high concentration when in the bZIP dimer should be high and a significant stabilization of the complex should be expected.

If illumination triggers the dimerization of the LOV domain, this should shift the equilibrium towards the dimer. The kD of LOV domain dimerization is rather weak (13 µM), however, the local high concentration when in the bZIP dimer should be high and a significant stabilization of the complex should be expected. Is there an explanation for this very weak effect? In addition, the void volume of the column should be indicated in the figures.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this important aspect and think that the reviewers refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> instead of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The observed differences between the dark and light state of the bZIP domain containing <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a variants on the gel-filtration column are indeed very small and the respective dimers dissociate rapidly in the dark and light. We initially also expected a stabilization of the complex upon light-activation and subsequent LOV dimerization. However, we could not observe such stabilization for the <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>full</sub> and <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub> dimers in any of our SEC-MALS experiments. We did not observe light-induced dimerization of <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a either, which was suggested previously for <italic>Vf</italic>Au1 (Hisatomi et al. 2014). Our SEC-MALS data indicate that the <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a bZIP domain is a weak dimerization module in the absence of DNA. Indeed, it is even possible that the basic DNA binding region negatively affects bZIP dimerization due to strong repulsive electrostatic interaction between the positively charged subunits. The bZIP containing <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a variants show a low kinetic stability and mostly elute as monomers from the gel- filtration column. Since the majority of molecules elutes as monomers, a high local LOV domain concentration, which might contribute to dimer stability, is only present in a small fraction of the molecules. Additionally, the photocycle of the bZIP domain containing <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a constructs is relatively “fast” and a significant part of the molecules decays from the adduct- back to the dark-state during gel filtration. Direct comparison of the experiments performed for <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>LOV</sub> and the bZIP domain containing <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a variants is complicated by the fact that the presence of the bZIP domain accelerates the recovery kinetic of the LOV domain about 1.8-fold (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interpretation of the SEC elution profiles and potential shifts to lower and larger retention volumes of <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a is hardly possible, because of the intrinsic flexibility and large unstructured regions that enable <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a to adopt multiple conformations. We want to emphasize that interpretation of shifts in the elution profiles in the absence of molar mass information can easily result in misinterpretation of the data. For example: Initial MALS measurements in the absence of MgCl<sub>2</sub> in the dark revealed an average molar mass, which was above the theoretical expected value for dimers indicating non-specific protein oligomerization. Upon light activation of the LOV domain, these higher oligomers dissociated, which was reflected by a decrease in the detected molar mass signal. However, the elution profile of the light activated protein shifted towards lower retention volumes compared to that observed in the dark. In the absence of molar mass information, such data could be easily interpreted as light-induced dimer stabilization or dimerization of <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a.</p><p>We carefully performed and repeated all MALS experiments and we are confident about the results presented here. We are aware of the fact that additional studies using complementary experimental techniques are required to investigate the interesting monomer-dimer equilibrium of <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a in more detail in the future. However, such studies clearly go beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to indicate the void volume of the gel-filtration column in the figures. We agree that this would be helpful for the reader and changed the figures accordingly.</p><p><italic>2) In the subsection “Blue light illumination induces dimerization of</italic> Pt<italic>Au1aLOV, but not of</italic> Pt<italic>Au1a<sub>full</sub> and</italic> Pt<italic>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub>”.

We agree that this information might be interesting for readers of the manuscript and included chromatograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) of experiments performed for <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>full</sub> and <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub> in the light at protein concentrations of 100 µM and 200 µM (the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were performed at a protein concentration of 150 µM). For both protein variants the elution profile slightly shifts toward lower retention times with increasing protein concentration. Additionally, the detected average molar mass signal increased from 28.7 kDa (100 µM) to 35.1 kDa (200 µM) for <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub> and from 48.4 kDa (100 µM) to 54.4 kDa (200 µM) for <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>full</sub>.</p><p>As discussed above, we agree with the reviewers that the relatively “fast” photocycle of the bZIP domain containing variants might be one of the reasons why we did not detect strong stabilization of the <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>full</sub> and <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub> dimers in our light experiments. We again want to point out that we could not detect indications for light-induced <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>full</sub> and <italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV</sub> dimerization in any of our experiments.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>: Why is there a kink in the SAXS density? According to the model this should be a symmetric dimer with a flexible linker.</italic> </p><p>Symmetric dimers can have asymmetric structures; the myosin structure is an example. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewers that the kink in the SAXS density obtained for the (<italic>Pt</italic>Au1a<sub>bZIP-LOV)2</sub>-DNA complex is surprising. However, this is the reproducible result of our reconstructions. Since we currently do not have structural information for the bZIP- LOV linker region, which could explain this result, we cannot give a clear answer to this question. We are working toward obtaining structural information for this region and hope that we can provide an explanation for this interesting observation in the future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
