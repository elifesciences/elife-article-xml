A coordinated cascade of steps allows intravascular leukocytes to counteract the shear stress, transmigrate through the endothelial layer, and move toward the extravascular, static environment. Those events are tightly orchestrated by integrins, but, while the molecular mechanisms leading to their activation have been characterized, the regulatory pathways promoting their detachment remain elusive. In light of this, it has long been known that platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule (<italic>Pecam1</italic>, also known as CD31) deficiency blocks leukocyte transmigration at the level of the outer vessel wall, yet the associated cellular defects are controversial. In this study, we combined an unbiased proteomic study with in vitro and in vivo single-cell tracking in mice to study the dynamics and role of CD31 during neutrophil migration. We found that CD31 localizes to the uropod of migrating neutrophils along with closed β<sub>2</sub>-integrin and is required for essential neutrophil actin/integrin polarization. Accordingly, the uropod of <italic>Pecam1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neutrophils is unable to detach from the extracellular matrix, while antagonizing integrin binding to extracellular matrix components rescues this in vivo migratory defect. Conversely, we showed that sustaining CD31 co-signaling actively favors uropod detachment and effective migration of extravasated neutrophils to sites of inflammation in vivo. Altogether, our results suggest that CD31 acts as a molecular rheostat controlling integrin-mediated adhesion at the uropod of egressed neutrophils, thereby triggering their detachment from the outer vessel wall to reach the inflammatory sites.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CD31</kwd><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>transmigration</kwd><kwd>iigrins</kwd><kwd>ITIM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016913</institution-id><institution>MSDAVENIR</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAVE-Brain</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nicoletti</surname><given-names>Antonino</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10-LABX-0017 &quot;Inflamex&quot;</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clément</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DS0404-16-RHUS-00010 &quot;iVASC&quot;</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caligiuri</surname><given-names>Giuseppina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grant EP/L014165/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maffia</surname><given-names>Pasquale</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PG/19/84/34771</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maffia</surname><given-names>Pasquale</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CD31 plays a pivotal role in neutrophil migration to inflamed sites by localizing to the uropod and promoting effective actin/integrin polarization and detachment, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying extravasation and inflammation response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the hallmarks of a successful immune response is the capacity of leukocytes to reach the sites of pathogenic stimuli. This notion is particularly true for neutrophils, the most abundant leukocyte population in the human blood, and crucial innate immune effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ley et al., 2018</xref>). Mature neutrophils incessantly patrol and scan microvascular endothelial cells (ECs), searching for extravasation cues locally driven by chemoattractants and adhesion molecules present at the surface of post-capillary venules. When appropriate, a spatiotemporally coordinated adhesion cascade on inflamed ECs allows neutrophils to counteract vascular shear stress and extravasate through the endothelial cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schnoor et al., 2021</xref>). Effective migration toward the inflammatory site occurs only after the final detachment from the outside vascular structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hyun et al., 2012</xref>). This is a fundamental but poorly characterized process that requires a quick amendment of the highly adhesive phenotype established to counteract flow conditions within the bloodstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pouwels et al., 2013</xref>) in order to migrate through the extravascular static environment.</p><p>Because neutrophils are endowed with harmful cytotoxic compounds, their aberrant recruitment and retention at inflammatory sites might result in severe bystander injury to the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Laforge et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, deciphering the molecular mechanisms of neutrophil trafficking is of paramount importance for identifying new therapeutic targets that control excessive inflammatory responses without impairing host defense.</p><p>Under dynamic blood conditions, neutrophils rapidly establish adhesive connections with the endothelial selectins. These engagements induce an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-dependent conformational change of β<sub>2</sub>-integrins (LFA-1 and Mac-1), which increases their affinity configuration and allows neutrophil arrest within the vessel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abram and Lowell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zarbock et al., 2008</xref>). Here, neutrophils must hold integrins in their maximal adhesive state to prevent them from being flushed away by the hydrodynamic forces of the bloodstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Thome et al., 2018</xref>). Once adhering to ECs, their shape changes noticeably from an almost spherical to a flattened shape due to the relocalization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion networks. After breaching the vessel wall, neutrophils interact with the basement vascular matrix constituents, searching for less dense, permissive regions for their passage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). At the rear, the uropod of migratory neutrophils is characterized by a highly contractile and low adhesive state, which is important for ensuring efficient migration through inflammatory sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hind et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pouwels et al., 2013</xref>). However, intravital observation of extravasating neutrophils has shown that, while their leading edge moves forward within the interstitial tissue, the uropod initially remains ‘trapped’ at the level of the basolateral part of the EC junctions until integrin closure allows their detachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hind et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Although this step is emerging as key for proper leukocyte recruitment, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly defined.</p><p>When blocking platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule (<italic>Pecam1</italic>, also known as CD31), most extravasating neutrophils fail to reach inflammatory sites and remain trapped on the basolateral side out of the microvessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wakelin et al., 1996</xref>). This finding was also recapitulated in <italic>Pecam1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duncan et al., 1999</xref>), yet more than 30 y later the function of CD31 in neutrophils is not completely understood.</p><p>CD31 is an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like protein known to act as a co-inhibitory receptor on lymphocytes due to the presence of two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in its cytoplasmic tail. Upon phosphorylation, CD31 ITIMs become docking sites for Src Homology 2 (SH2)-containing phosphatases, uncoupling ITAM-dependent leukocyte activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Henshall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marelli-Berg et al., 2013</xref>). Being expressed by all hematopoietic cells and ECs, CD31 ITIM signaling properties confer a pleiotropic and central role to CD31 in maintaining homeostasis at the blood–vessel interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caligiuri, 2020</xref>). The fact that extravasating neutrophils can engage in CD31:CD31 trans-homophilic interactions when crossing endothelial lateral cell junctions – where CD31 is particularly enriched – suggests a role for CD31 in the migration cascade. Since integrin opening and outside-in signaling are also ITAM-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bezman and Koretzky, 2007</xref>), we investigated whether ITIM-associated CD31 signaling could be involved in fine-tuning adhesion during the extravasation process.</p><p>Using an unbiased proteomic-based approach and functional experiments, combining in vitro and in vivo live microscopy, we uncovered the role of CD31 signaling in favoring integrin closure at the uropod of extravasating neutrophils, thus allowing their detachment from the basement membrane and efficient migration toward sites of inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neutrophil recruitment is accompanied by CD31 signaling, while its absence compromises cell detachment from the extravascular component of the vessel</title><p>We used an acute peritonitis model induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of IL-1β and quantified neutrophil migration within the extravascular space in WT and <italic>Pecam1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice by flow cytometry. In WT mice, neutrophils started to migrate and accumulate in the peritoneal cavity within 4 hr after IL-1β injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, in <italic>Pecam1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, neutrophils started to migrate to the peritoneal cavity during the first 2 hr, but eventually failed to extravasate within the peritoneal fluid at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This difference between WT and <italic>Pecam1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice was not accompanied by a difference of neutrophil number increase in the bloodstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), nor was there a defective molecular response to IL-1β in terms of chemokines involved in neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow (SDF-1), local endothelial/platelet activation at sites of extravasation (P-selectin), specific chemoattraction at the inflammatory site (CXCL1), or global acute-phase reaction (PTX3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Next, we analyzed the spatial distribution of neutrophils by fluorescence microscopy through the microvessel wall in the omentum, an important site of neutrophil extravasation in the peritoneum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buscher et al., 2016</xref>). Neutrophils from WT mice were located within the extravascular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Notably, the phosphorylation level of CD31 (pY713) was inversely correlated with neutrophil distance from the vessel wall (i.e., increased pY713 when cells were close to the blood vessel wall), suggesting that CD31 signaling in neutrophils was active during extravasation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Although most neutrophils from <italic>Pecam1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were also found to extravasate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, inset 3D section), their migration was delayed as they remained in close contact with the outer layer of the vessel wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that CD31 is involved in facilitating the detachment of neutrophils from the outer components of the vessel wall after extravasation. This detachment is crucial for the timely migration to the inflammatory site.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Pecam1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils exhibit efficient mobilization in the circulation but fail to reach the inflammatory site after crossing the vessel wall.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Absolute number of Ly6G<sup>+</sup> cells harvested in the peritoneal cavity at different time points after the induction of sterile peritonitis in WT or <italic>Pecam1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.

Proteins associated with CD31 were studied by unbiased proteomic analysis of human neutrophils stimulated with N-formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP, a synthetic peptide commonly used as a chemoattractant to induce cell migration and activation of neutrophils) compared to neutrophils maintained under resting conditions. Immunoprecipitated CD31 molecules from cell lysates were subjected to Orbitrap to identify CD31-associated partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

We found that both CD31 and CD11b rapidly relocated to the uropod during neutrophil migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), while a minor fraction of both molecules remained localized at the leading edge. Considering that neutrophil uropod is characterized by a low-adhesion state that facilitates rear detachment during forward cellular movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hind et al., 2016</xref>), we hypothesized that CD31 could have been involved in controlling β2-integrins (CD11b:CD18 and CD11a:CD18 heterodimers) conformation via inside-out signaling. To this end, we explored the functionality of CD31 and the activation state of integrins using multicolor confocal microscopy in human neutrophils interacting with immobilized ICAM-1 – one of the major β<sub>2</sub>-ligands for migrating leukocytes – and IL-8. Under these conditions, we found that CD31 localizes preferentially to the uropod and, only at the rear, CD31 displayed phosphorylated ITIM motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In addition, SH2-containing inositol phosphatase SHIP1, which has been found in the CD31 interactome, was also concentrated at the cellular rear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), supporting the notion that functional CD31 molecular clusters are present in the uropods of motile neutrophils. This prompted us to perform a detailed analysis of the activation state of integrins localized with CD31. Taking advantage of the conformation-specific antibody NKI-L16, which specifically recognizes an epitope accessible only in the activated form of the integrin alpha L chain CD11a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lefort et al., 2012</xref>), we examined the distribution of CD31 molecules in relation to total CD11a molecules (regardless of their conformation) and activated CD11a molecules (NKI-L16-positive). Interestingly, the staining patterns for CD31 and extended β2-integrins were mutually exclusive. Clusters positive for NKI-L16 (indicating active integrins, shown in red) were exclusively localized at the leading edge, where CD31 (shown in green) was absent. Conversely, the staining with this antibody was absent at the uropod, where most CD31 was concentrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). The co-localization of functional CD31 clusters with integrins that did not react with the NKI-L16 antibody indicates that CD31 is enriched at the uropod along with closed β2-integrins, in contrast to fully opened integrins that are restricted to the leading edge. Taken together, these findings suggest that CD31 signaling may contribute to maintaining integrins in a closed/bent conformation at the uropod, the region where cell detachment is required, during neutrophil migration.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-84752-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Live video microscopy of purified human neutrophils stained with anti CD31 and anti CD11b fluorescent antibody moving on fibronectin-coated surface.</title><p>Timeframe images from live video microscopy of neutrophils stained with fluorophore-coupled monoclonal antibodies directed against CD11b (light blue) and CD31 (red) moving onto a fibronectin-coated surface.</p></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CD31 genetic deficiency endows neutrophils with aberrant uropod organization</title><p>We investigated how CD31 knockout could affect integrin polarization in neutrophils interacting with laminin α4, an important constituent of the basement membrane involved in neutrophil extravasation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2006</xref>).

In the context of neutrophils, we found that the CD31 agonist consistently sustained CD31 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) during fMLP activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), specifically targeting the CD31 molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and fine-tuning cytoskeleton dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To investigate the involvement of CD31 in regulating uropod detachment in migrating neutrophils, we conducted single-cell-level analysis using a model of skin inflammation. To track neutrophils in vivo, we used two-photon microscopy and <italic>Lyz2</italic>-GFP<sup>+</sup> mice. These mice received IL-1β in the ear skin, with or without the administration of the CD31 agonist to enhance CD31 signaling. Subsequently, we recorded the extravasation of <italic>Lyz2</italic>-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells live, 1 or 3 hr after IL-1β injection. Our observations revealed that 1 hr after intradermal IL-1β injection, <italic>Lyz2</italic>-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells exhibited crawling behavior along the post-capillary blood vessels. Extravasating leukocytes demonstrated delayed uropod detachment and underwent significant elongation before being disconnected from the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). These findings confirmed previously published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hyun et al., 2012</xref>) and prompted us to investigate the effect of the CD31 agonist on this process. Administration of the CD31 agonist 1 hr after the initiation of <italic>Lyz2</italic>-GFP<sup>+</sup> cell extravasation resulted in a remarkable acceleration of uropod detachment from the basement membrane. This led to an increased migratory capacity of <italic>Lyz2</italic>-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the extravascular space compared to cells from vehicle-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). Assessment of cell length and circularity provides valuable insights into their ability to migrate through narrow spaces. Cells with longer lengths and a higher surface area to volume ratio have an advantage in navigating tight spaces and interacting with the extracellular matrix, enabling efficient movement within confined environments. By evaluating the length and circularity of the cells, we aimed to assess their proficiency in migration through narrow spaces and their ability to maneuver through the extracellular matrix. Furthermore, our investigation of the fate of extravasated <italic>Lyz2</italic>-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells 3 hr after inducing inflammation revealed that the CD31 agonist enhanced their migratory capacity in the extravascular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Videos 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>). This enhancement was demonstrated by increased speed, shorter cellular length, and greater traveling distance compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>).

We reasoned that, if the impaired migration in <italic>Pecam1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neutrophils resulted from defective control of integrin adhesion, reducing integrin interactions with the extracellular adhesive surfaces would have compensated for the absence of CD31. To experimentally test this hypothesis, we designed an in vivo rescue experiment using soluble RGD peptides to antagonize integrin binding to the ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). When RGD peptides are administered as soluble, they act as a decoy for the integrins binding site, preventing leukocyte retention on ECM surfaces, thereby promoting cellular forward movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mondal et al., 2012</xref>). In WT mice, RGD peptides did not modify IL-1β-induced neutrophil accumulation in the peritoneal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>).

Specifically, it effectively controls integrin activation at the uropod, thereby exerting a significant influence on the efficient movement of neutrophils. This regulatory mechanism ensures the timely arrival of neutrophils at the inflammatory site, facilitating their efficient migration and precise targeting of the inflamed area, thereby optimizing the immune response.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study uncovered a significant and previously unknown role for CD31 in multiple stages of neutrophil migration and recruitment to sites of inflammation. We found that CD31 signaling at the uropod plays a key role in the polarization and detachment of neutrophils, which is crucial for initiating their migration within the vascular compartment and subsequent progression through the interstitial tissue following extravasation towards inflammatory sites. Our observations confirmed the dynamic behavior of neutrophils, wherein the uropod remains trapped at the basolateral membrane of endothelial cell junctions, while the leading edge moves forward in the interstitial tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hind et al., 2016</xref>). The detachment of the uropod is a crucial process that enables neutrophils to transition from a firmly adhesive state within blood vessels, under strong hemodynamic conditions, to a rapidly migratory configuration in the static extravascular space. This transition is characterized by reduced adhesion and increased contractility, which facilitate effective navigation throughout interstitial tissue. Although our study highlights the importance of CD31 signaling in uropod detachment, we did not specifically investigate the molecular events involved in the interaction between CD31 and ICAM-1 or laminin α4, which are RGD-binding-independent interactions in the vascular compartment. Further investigations focusing on the closure of these integrins, such as αMβ2 with ICAM-1 and α6β1 with laminin α4, are required to understand the specific interactions between CD31-positive cells and the matrix in the vascular compartment. Nevertheless, our data unequivocally demonstrated that the administration of soluble RGD peptides in the extravascular space effectively rescued the stagnation of <italic>Pecam1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils within the extracellular matrix. These peptides competitively bind to the RDG motif found in various extracellular matrix proteins, potentially reversing the excessive adhesion of RGD-binding β1 integrins and facilitating proper neutrophil migration toward sites of inflammation. Therefore, our data strongly suggest that the retention of <italic>Pecam1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils in the extravascular interstitium is primarily due to the excessive adhesion of integrins to the components of the extracellular matrix. This heightened integrin adhesion hinders the initiation of neutrophil movement through the interstitial tissue toward inflammatory sites. Previous studies have proposed that impaired CD31-dependent upregulation of β1-integrin leads to the inability of <italic>Pecam1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils to exit blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dangerfield et al., 2002</xref>). However, recent evidence challenges this hypothesis by demonstrating that neutrophils lacking β1-integrins actually have an enhanced ability to reach inflamed sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sarangi et al., 2012</xref>). Our present findings suggest that CD31 may be involved in β1-integrin conformation rather than solely regulating its expression. Further investigations are needed to comprehensively elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying CD31’s regulatory functions on β1-integrin behavior during neutrophil migration.</p><p>While our primary focus was on investigating CD31’s role in uropod detachment, proteomic analysis revealed that CD31 partners were also associated with the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, we observed that the same phenotype was obtained in two scenarios, namely when CD31 expression was completely absent and when the protein was present but a part of its intracellular tail containing the ITIM motifs was deleted. This indicates that both the presence of CD31 and its intact intracellular tail with the ITIM motifs are essential for proper functional cell polarization during neutrophil migration. This polarization defect could potentially impact the coordination between the leading edge and the uropod, which is crucial for effective neutrophil extravasation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hind et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>After being phosphorylated by active co-clustered ITAM receptors, the ITIM motifs of CD31 act as docking sites for several proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Henshall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sagawa et al., 1997</xref>) and lipid SH2-containing phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ilan and Madri, 2003</xref>, p. 1), which drive downstream signaling pathways upon CD31 engagement in various biological processes. Previous studies have highlighted the significant involvement of lipid phosphatases in the regulation of leukocyte migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Michael et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mondal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nishio et al., 2007</xref>). Our data strongly suggest that SHIP-1 acts as a critical mediator of CD31 signaling in integrin closure during neutrophil migration. Further investigations specifically targeting the type of phosphatase involved in CD31-dependent uropod detachment and polarization are warranted to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>The concentration of endothelial CD31 at lateral borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Newman, 1994</xref>) likely plays a crucial role in regulating the engagement of CD31 on neutrophils during transendothelial migration. Moreover, CD31 undergoes rapid tyrosine phosphorylation in response to mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Masuda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Snyder et al., 2017</xref>). These findings suggest that, as neutrophils pass through the lateral endothelial cell junctions, CD31 may sense the gradient of mechanical forces generated within the cell across the vascular barrier. The cell experiences stretching due to firm intravascular adhesion, counteracting shear stress, and easy movement of the extravascular leading edge in the unloaded static environment of the extravascular space. The magnitude of this gradient is reflected by the elongation of the uropod out of the basal membrane. Based on our observations, we propose that the concentration of CD31 at the uropod may be required to ‘free’ this pole of the cell, allowing it to continue its journey toward the inflammatory site guided by chemokine gradients in the extravascular space. This freeing action, promoted by CD31, is potentially mediated by the recruitment of phosphatases to its mechanically driven phosphorylated ITIMs, resulting in a closed/inactive conformation of integrins at the uropod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). These observations position CD31 as a potential molecular sensor involved in regulating integrin conformation and facilitating the transition from neutrophil egression to migration.</p><p>In conclusion, our study provides important insights into the multifaceted role of CD31 in neutrophil migration and extravasation. Further investigations into the specific interactions and downstream signaling events involving CD31 and its partners will deepen our understanding of neutrophil migration and may pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions for inflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Breeding pairs of <italic>Pecam1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice on the C56BL/6 background were kindly provided by Dr. D. K. Newman (Milwaukee Blood Center, Milwaukee, WI). Mice were maintained in the animal facility under an alternating 12 hr light and 12 hr dark cycle in microisolator cages (≤4 per cage) under specific pathogen-free conditions with ad libitum access to food and water.</p><p>All the investigations conformed to the directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament, and formal approval was granted by the local Animal Ethics Committee (Comité d’étique Bichat-Debré, Paris, France).</p><p><italic>Lyz2</italic>-eGFP mice were a kind gift from Professor Sussan Nourshargh (Queen Mary University of London). These mice have the gene for eGFP knocked into the Lysozyme (Lyz) M locus, resulting in mice with fluorescent myelomonocytic cells, with neutrophils comprising the highest percentage of eGFP<sup>hi</sup> cells.

The modified BAC was linearized and electroporated into CK35 ES cells. EC cell clones carrying the mutated <italic>Pecam1</italic> gene were selected by Southern blot and injected into C57BL/6J blastocytes. Mutant mice (carrying the neo(13/14) allele) were first crossed to FLP-recombinase-expressing mice in order to remove the Neo cassette and obtain mice carrying the lox(13-14) allele. Lox(13-14) mice were then crossed to transgenic mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of a CMV promoter in order to remove exons 13 and 14 (allele out(13-14), hereafter referred to as ITIM<sup>-/-</sup>). This does not introduce a shift in the reading frame.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carla Rothlin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jacopo Di Russo (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic>. The topic of your work, that of molecular dynamics at the trailing edge (uropod) of migrating/extravasating neutrophils, is highly significant. Both reviewers found your paper of interest and importance. Major concerns include the correlative nature of the CD31 phosphorylation data. That is, many molecular signaling events occur when leukocytes vectorially migrate in response to extracellular cues, typically present during extravasation. They include Rho/Rac activation, actin oscillations, and actomyosin activation with force-generated propulsion of the MTOC toward the cell trailing edge. Within the hierarchy of all these events, it is not clear how relatively (and directly) important the noted CD31 tyrosine phosphorylation is in the forward migratory movement. Another major issue, raised by both reviewers, is that the in vivo CD31 KO data interpretation is complicated by the presence of CD31 on both myeloid and endothelial cells. Of the 2 options recommended, adoptive transfer of CD31-/- neutrophils into a WT mouse should be more easily and readily achievable than generating another genetic strain (neutrophil-specific CD31 KO). Reviewer 1's question about the interpretation of the RGD blocking peptide experiments is valid, since ICAM-1-binding beta2 integrins do not utilize the RGD sequence for that adhesion, making the compensation of uropod detachment in CD31-/- neutrophils difficult to understand. If not explained better, those experiments only confound the other data. Despite the cause-effect caveat/concern, we are interested in this work and would consider a revised version of the manuscript, addressing the Reviewers' concerns. A majority of those concerns relate to data quantification and presentation, so as to enhance the clarity and significance of the results. A few additional experiments would be necessary.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Address all Reviewer data clarification and qualification recommendations.</p><p>2) Dissect neutrophil vs. endothelial CD31 importance within the in vivo experiments – adoptive transfer of KO neutrophils would be an acceptable approach.</p><p>3) Much more thorough explanation of the inhibitory RGD peptide compensation experiments. If a good explanation cannot be presented, those experiments should be removed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Andreata F. and colleagues in this work address the function of CD31 (PECAM-1) intracellular signalling in neutrophils in regulating integrins adhesion during extravasation. To explore the hypothesis of a key role of CD31 for cell rear (uropod) detachment in the final step of extravasation, they use a combination of mouse genetics, intravital microscopy, and in vitro cell migration assay. Convincing evidence shows that the phosphorylation of CD31 intracellular motive &quot;ITIM&quot; at the neutrophil's uropod supports its detachment both in vivo and in vitro. Nevertheless, the data showing a direct effect of the investigated pathway in reducing integrin-biding affinity to endothelial ICAM-1 or basement membrane laminins remains mostly correlative. In conclusion, this work, for the first time, shows the role of CD31 phosphorylation for uropod detachment and represents an important step forward in dissecting the different mechanisms regulating the complexity of the leukocyte extravasation process.</p><p>– The correlation between neutrophils position and phosphorylation levels of CD31 in Figure 1E looks convincing. Nevertheless, the quantification of the data using a linear correlation with the Pearson coefficient is not convincing due to their distribution. I would rather use an exponential correlation.</p><p>– The authors state that CD31 -/- neutrophils fail to migrate further from the extravasating vessel and remain close to it. This should not only be shown with a representative image but also with quantification, e.g., the percentage of total cells in close proximity to a vessel.</p><p>– The authors show the re-localization of CD31 and CD11b (Integrin α M) at the uropod during neutrophil migration (Figure 2F). This does not necessarily indicate that integrin β 2 – containing heterodimers, including CD11a/CD18 (Integrin α L β 2), localise there and mediated neutrophils adhesion. To strengthen the paper's conclusion, it would be necessary to show that integrin β 2 mostly relocates there and that active integrin β 2 is mostly present at the front. Furthermore, these conclusions would need all quantitative evidence, i.e., also for figure 2F. Please note that integrin α M and integrin β 2 have been shown to function for cell adhesion independently of their dimerization. https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M406968200.</p><p>– The data presented and plotted in Figures S3C and E should be tested with one and 2-way ANOVA, respectively, and not a t-test.</p><p>– The statement that GFP+ leukocytes have more elongated uropod and delay their detachment in the presence of CD31 agonist needs to be supported not only by videos but also by quantitative data. Furthermore, it no clear neither from the text, figure caption, or method how many independent experiments were performed for this experiment.</p><p>– In the last chapter of the manuscript, the authors suggest that CD31 activation is involved in a general reduction of the integrins activation state. This is shown by the injection of RGD peptide to antagonise integrin-ECM adhesion during CD31-/- neutrophils migration. I do not doubt the validity of this very interesting finding, but I struggle to understand the direct connection with the logic of the manuscript. In the previous chapter, the authors address the role of CD31 in regulating adhesion on integrin β 2 – ICAM-1 (Figure 3) and unspecified integrins on laminin α 4 (Figure 4). Integrin α L β 2, α M β 2 and laminin α 4-binding integrins (e.g., integrin α 6 β 1) do not bind their ligands through an RGD sequence. I would suggest directly addressing integrin β 2-ICAM-1 and integrin α 6 β 1-laminin α 4 interaction in vivo (or in vitro) using blocking antibodies or peptides. On the other hand, the generalization of the CD31-mediated uropod detachment via the deactivation of ECM-integrin adhesion is very interesting. If not with some proof-of-concept experiments, the crosstalk of CD31 activation and RGD-binding integrins (e.g., integrin α 5 β 1) should be addressed in the discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study investigates the role of CD31 in neutrophil transmigration. The authors use a CD31 knockout mouse to confirm that this receptor is required for neutrophil extravasation and then go on to use proteomics to identify the CD31 interactome, which reveals integrins and multiple regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. Using microscopy, the authors compellingly show that, in neutrophils, CD31 localizes to the uropod and where it promotes termination of integrin signaling (required for uropod detachment). The manuscript is clear and well-written and the conclusions are generally robust. This is an important mechanistic addition to our understanding of neutrophil extravasation. in vivo conclusions, however, are complicated by the fact that CD31 is abundant in endothelial cells so it becomes difficult to disentangle the contribution of the neutrophil versus the endothelial CD31 pool.</p><p>Figure 1: It is difficult to conclude a neutrophil-intrinsic defect here when endothelial CD31 affects extravasation. The authors should test a neutrophil-specific knockout, or (more easily) adoptively transfer into WT mice.</p><p>Figure 1F: the authors write that CD31-/- neutrophils &quot; failed to further migrate since they remained in close contact to the outer layer of the vessel wall&quot;. This is hard to conclude from the single image and should be quantified. Also, it appears from the image that there are fewer neutrophils in the vessel, which would argue for a recruitment defect. Quantitative data would greatly clarify the phenotype in this analysis.</p><p>Figure 1C: what is the rationale for looking at those cytokines? It would be better to include the ones that are linked to IL-1, such as IL-6 and GCSF.</p><p>Figure 1F: the authors write that CD31-/- neutrophils &quot; failed to further migrate since they remained in close contact to the outer layer of the vessel wall&quot;.

It is important to note that integrins are heterodimers composed of α and β subunits. In the case of CD11b, it forms a complex with the β2 subunit, CD18, to create the functional integrin αMβ2 (also known as Mac-1). Without its β subunit partner, CD11b is unlikely to be stably expressed on the cellular membrane. Studies have demonstrated that integrins require their β subunit for proper folding, trafficking, and function (Kim M, Carman CV, Springer TA, 2003<italic>)</italic>. Therefore, it is unlikely that CD11b would be expressed alone on the cellular membrane without its β subunit partner. We apologize for any confusion caused and believe that this clarification is addressed in the revised manuscript (page 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To strengthen the paper's conclusion, it would be necessary to show that integrin β 2 mostly relocates there and that active integrin β 2 is mostly present at the front.

Consequently, our findings consistently indicate that the active form of β2 integrins, exemplified by active LFA-1, is predominantly present at the front of migrating neutrophils, thereby providing support for our conclusions.</p><p>In response to the mentioned reference (https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M406968200) discussing the potential independent functions of integrin α M (CD11b) and integrin β 2, we acknowledge its relevance. However, it is important to clarify that our study primarily focuses on investigating the role of CD31 in modulating neutrophil migration and the dynamics of integrin molecular complexes.</p><p>In our research, we highlight the relocation of CD31 at the uropod, where CD11a β2 integrins assume a closed, inactive conformation. This observation emphasizes the significance of CD31 in influencing the activity and distribution of integrin complexes during neutrophil migration.</p><p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer's attention to this aspect of our study, and we concur that the additional details provided in the Results section on <italic>page 8</italic> and the legend to Figure 2 further bolster our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The data presented and plotted in Figures S3C and E should be tested with one and 2-way ANOVA, respectively, and not a t-test.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have performed the suggested one-way and two-way ANOVA tests on the data presented in Figures S3C and E.

We appreciate your valuable input in improving the statistical analysis of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The statement that GFP+ leukocytes have more elongated uropod and delay their detachment in the presence of CD31 agonist needs to be supported not only by videos but also by quantitative data. Furthermore, it no clear neither from the text, figure caption, or method how many independent experiments were performed for this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comment and thank them for their suggestion. To address this concern, we have taken the reviewer's advice into account. We have now quantified the velocity of individual neutrophils after they have detached from the vessel wall, similar to how it was done for the 3-hour timepoint. In order to ensure accuracy, we utilized a region of interest during our analysis, focusing exclusively on neutrophils detaching from the vessel. This approach has allowed us to provide quantitative data that supports the observation that the CD31 agonist enhances detachment speed. To reflect these new findings, we have created a new graph, Figure 4C, and updated the figure legend accordingly. Additionally, in the method section, we have clarified the number of independent experiments conducted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the last chapter of the manuscript, the authors suggest that CD31 activation is involved in a general reduction of the integrins activation state. This is shown by the injection of RGD peptide to antagonise integrin-ECM adhesion during CD31-/- neutrophils migration. I do not doubt the validity of this very interesting finding, but I struggle to understand the direct connection with the logic of the manuscript. In the previous chapter, the authors address the role of CD31 in regulating adhesion on integrin β 2 – ICAM-1 (Figure 3) and unspecified integrins on laminin α 4 (Figure 4). Integrin α L β 2, α M β 2 and laminin α 4-binding integrins (e.g., integrin α 6 β 1) do not bind their ligands through an RGD sequence. I would suggest directly addressing integrin β 2-ICAM-1 and integrin α 6 β 1-laminin α 4 interaction in vivo (or in vitro) using blocking antibodies or peptides. On the other hand, the generalization of the CD31-mediated uropod detachment via the deactivation of ECM-integrin adhesion is very interesting. If not with some proof-of-concept experiments, the crosstalk of CD31 activation and RGD-binding integrins (e.g., integrin α 5 β 1) should be addressed in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>After carefully considering the reviewer's feedback, we have revised our manuscript to address the concerns raised. We agree that directly assessing the impact of CD31 signaling on integrin β 2-ICAM-1 and integrin α 6 β 1-laminin α 4 binding, which are not mediated by the RGD motif, is crucial for evaluating its global role. We acknowledge that our data only support direct evidence for a role of RGD-binding integrins in the impaired migration of Pecam1-/- neutrophils. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we were unable to conduct the suggested experiments within the scope of this study.</p><p>Nevertheless, we recognize the importance of this point and have taken steps to address this limitation in the revised manuscript. On page 13-15 of the extensively revised discussion, we highlight the need for further studies specifically investigating the interactions between CD31 activation and integrin β 2-ICAM-1, as well as integrin α 6 β 1-laminin α 4. We provide a more detailed explanation of our interpretation regarding the broader activity of soluble RDG peptides in our rescue experiments, as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>We sincerely appreciate the insightful comments from the reviewer, and although we couldn't include the additional experiments, we believe that our revised manuscript offers a more comprehensive discussion of the implications and potential avenues for future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Figure 1: It is difficult to conclude a neutrophil-intrinsic defect here when endothelial CD31 affects extravasation. The authors should test a neutrophil-specific knockout, or (more easily) adoptively transfer into WT mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for raising this important point. In a previous study by Dangerfield et al. 2003, the relative contribution of endothelial vs. neutrophil CD31 to the extravasation of the latter was precisely investigated. In their work (Figure 7a), bone marrow chimeras were used to generate CD31 deficiency either in the endothelial cells or in the hematopoietic system. Interestingly, the migratory defect was not rescued in either case, indicating that CD31 trans-homophilic interaction between endothelial cells and neutrophils is necessary for proper neutrophil migration.</p><p>However, prompted by the reviewer's suggestion, we conducted adoptive transfer experiments to investigate another unanswered question: whether CD31 intracellular signaling, rather than the mere presence of the protein, regulates neutrophil recruitment to inflammatory sites. To address this question, we conducted a new experiment in which we adoptively transferred WT or our newly-generated <italic>Pecam1</italic><sup>ITIM-/-</sup> neutrophils in a 1:1 ratio into WT recipient mice. Before injection, we performed differential CFSE/CTV staining to distinguish the origin of the neutrophils. After 24 hours, IL-1β was intraperitoneally administered to the recipient mice, and the transmigrated neutrophils were collected from the peritoneal wash 4 hours later in this competition assay (new Figure 5I).

These findings provide novel evidence that the CD31 ITIM-dependent intracellular pathway plays an important role in controlling neutrophil migration.</p><p>We believe that these additional results significantly contribute to our understanding of CD31-mediated neutrophil recruitment and highlight the importance of CD31 intracellular signaling in this process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1F: the authors write that CD31-/- neutrophils &quot; failed to further migrate since they remained in close contact to the outer layer of the vessel wall&quot;.

Specifically, we quantified the distance of neutrophils from the vessels and determined the percentage of cells located in close proximity to the vessel wall in both <italic>Pecam1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and WT mice. These quantitative data have been incorporated into two new graphs, namely Figure 1F and Figure 1H. As a result, the statement that &quot;<italic>Pecam1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> neutrophils failed to further migrate since they remained in close contact to the outer layer of the vessel wall&quot; is now supported by robust quantification.

It would be better to include the ones that are linked to IL-1, such as IL-6 and GCSF.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's feedback regarding the selection of cytokines in Figure 1C, and we acknowledge the importance cytokines specifically linked to IL-1, such as IL-6 and GCSF. However, the intention behind our chosen markers was to assess potential specific mechanisms underlying the different recruitment of neutrophils observed between WT and CD31 mice in response to IL-1β. In this perspective, PTX-3 was chosen to assess whether the difference relied on a different liver acute phase response to circulating IL-1β (Skelly DT, et al., 2013). SDF-1 was intended to explore a potential different triggering of neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow (Suratt BT, et al., 2004), and CXCL1 was meant to assess the potential different extent of chemoattraction specific to neutrophils (Sawant KV, et al., 2016). CD62P was chosen as its release as a soluble marker reflects the extent of local platelet/endothelial activation, which is a prerequisite for blood neutrophil rolling and migration at specific vascular sites (Zuchtriegel G, et al., 2015).</p><p>We have incorporated this rationale into the results paragraph referring to Figure 1C in the revised manuscript (page 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1F: the authors write that CD31-/- neutrophils &quot; failed to further migrate since they remained in close contact to the outer layer of the vessel wall&quot;.

I recommend that this is quantified and that you measure circulating neutrophil counts as well as GCSF levels, otherwise it is difficult to make conclusions about extravasation.</p></disp-quote><p>Please note that the inflammatory stimulus in these experiments was localized to the ear, and the snapshots shown in Figure 4A-D are derived from multiphoton time-lapse imaging. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the local trafficking of neutrophils. The agonist consistently increases the speed of neutrophil flow in the analyzed vessel sections. As a result, the higher density of neutrophils captured in the images with the agonist reflects the free-flowing state of most neutrophils within the vessel lumen, while stably adhering neutrophils appear to be fewer in number because they are marginated.</p><p>To directly address the reviewer's concern, we performed a repeat experiment in which we administered IL-1β directly into the ears of C57Bl6 mice. Unfortunately, the <italic>Lyz2</italic>-GFP<sup>+</sup> mice that were previously used in our study are no longer available in our laboratory. We counted the number of neutrophils in fresh heparinized blood using the ABC VET automatic formula and measured several soluble plasma parameters, including IL-6 and GM-CSF, using Thermofisher Mouse ProcartaPlex Simplex Kits. Untouched mice (no challenge) served as control (3 groups, n=4/group). These additional measurements allowed us to assess the systemic effects of the CD31 agonist, as requested by the reviewer. These experiments revealed that the neutrophil count (% of white blood cells) was not significantly influenced by either the local inflammatory process or the CD31 agonist (One-way ANOVA, p = 0.3856). Additionally, the soluble parameters, including IL-6 and GM-CSF, were not detectable in the systemic circulation across all three groups.

This is not explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize to the reviewer for the lack of clarity in explaining the relationship between cell length and circularity and migration capacity. Longer cells have a higher surface area to volume ratio, which can facilitate increased interaction with the extracellular matrix and potentially enhance adhesion. This characteristic may be particularly important for cells that need to migrate through narrow spaces, such as cancer cells invading tissue barriers or neutrophils navigating extracellular surfaces. By measuring cell length and circularity, we aimed to gain insights into the morphological features that could influence migration capacity. We understand that further explanation was necessary and have provided a more detailed discussion in the revised manuscript (Results, page 10-11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How do authors exclude macrophages in lysM-gfp mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's inquiry regarding the exclusion of macrophages in our study using <italic>Lyz2</italic>-GFP mice.

Previous research has shown that the GFP fluorescence intensity of macrophages is significantly lower compared to that of granulocytes (Faust N, et al., 2000). By carefully examining the GFP intensity, we were able to exclude macrophages from our analysis. This information has been added into the corresponding method section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: how do you exclude the effect of endothelial cd31?
