COVID-19 have been reported to experience                    poor prognosis; however, a detailed quantification of the effect of cancer on                    outcome of unvaccinated COVID-19 patients has not been performed.</p>                    <p><bold>Methods:</bold> To carry out a systematic review of the                    studies comparing the outcome of unvaccinated COVID-19 patients with and without                    cancer, a search string was devised which was used to identify relevant                    publications in PubMed up to December 31, 2020. We selected three outcomes:                    mortality, access to ICU, and COVID-19 severity or hospitalization. We                    considered results for all cancers combined as well as for specific cancers. We                    conducted random-effects meta-analyses of the results, overall and after                    stratification by region. We also performed sensitivity analyses according to                    quality score and assessed publication bias.</p>                    <p><bold>Results:</bold> For all cancer combined, the pooled odds                    ratio (OR) for mortality was 2.32 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.82-2.94,                        I<sup>2</sup> for heterogeneity 90.1%, 24 studies), that for ICU admission                    was 2.39 (95% CI 1.90-3.02, I<sup>2</sup>0.0%, 5 studies), that for disease                    severity or hospitalization was 2.08 (95% CI 1.60-2.72, I<sup>2</sup> 92.1%, 15                    studies). The pooled mortality OR for hematologic neoplasms was 2.14 (95% CI                    1.87-2.44, I<sup>2</sup> 20.8%,8 studies). Data were insufficient to perform a                    meta-analysis for other cancers. In the mortality meta-analysis for all cancers,                    the pooled OR was higher for studies conducted in Asia than studies conducted in                    Europe or North America. There was no evidence of publication bias.</p>                    <p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our meta-analysis indicates a two-fold                    increased risk of adverse outcomes (mortality, ICU admission and severity of                    COVID-19) in unvaccinated COVID-19 patients with cancer compared to COVID-19                    patients without cancer. These results should be compared with studies conducted                    in vaccinated patients; nonetheless, they argue for special effort to prevent                    SARS-Cov2 infection in patients with cancer.</p>                    <p><bold>Funding:</bold> No external funding was obtained.</p>            </abstract>            <kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism">                <title>Research organism</title>                <kwd>Human</kwd>            </kwd-group>            <funding-group>                <funding-statement>The authors declare that there was no funding for this                    work.</funding-statement>            </funding-group>        </article-meta>    </front>    <back>        <sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information">            <title>Additional information</title>            <fn-group content-type="competing-interest">                <title>Competing interest</title>                <fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1">                    <p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p>                </fn>            </fn-group>            <fn-group content-type="ethics-information">                <title>Ethics</title>                <fn fn-type="other">                    <p>Human subjects: a) All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant                        guidelines and regulations.b) The study was considered exempt and the                        informed consent was not deemed necessary given the nature of the study</p>                </fn>            </fn-group>        </sec>        <sec id="s2" sec-type="supplementary-material">            <title>Additional Files</title>            <sec id="s3" sec-type="data-availability">                <title>Data availability</title>                <p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript                    and supporting file.Dataset has been deposited on Dryad                    (doi:10.5061/dryad.00000004q)</p>                <p>The following datasets were generated:</p>                <p><element-citation id="dataset1" publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy">                        <person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Visci G</collab><collab>Di                                Felice G</collab><collab>Teglia F</collab><collab>Angelini                                M</collab><collab>Boffetta P</collab></person-group>                        <year iso-8601-date="2021">2021</year>                        <source>Data from: Effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on outcome of cancer                            patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of                            unvaccinated patients</source>                        <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.00000004q">http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.00000004q</ext-link>                        <comment>Dryad Digital Repository, doi:10.5061/dryad.00000004q</comment>                    </element-citation></p>            </sec>        <supplementary-material><ext-link xlink:href="elife-74634-supp-v1.zip">Download zip</ext-link><p>Any figures and tables for this article are included in the PDF.
