While traditional inverted confocal microscopes excel in high-resolution imaging of tissue sections and cultured cells, they face limitations in deep imaging of cleared tissues due to refractive index mismatches between the immersion media of objectives and sample container. To overcome these challenges, the RIM-Deep was developed to significantly improve deep imaging capabilities without compromising the normal function of the confocal microscope. This system facilitates deep immunofluorescence imaging of the prefrontal cortex in cleared macaque tissue, extending imaging depth from 2 mm to 5 mm. Applied to an intact and cleared Thy1-EGFP mouse brain, the system allowed for clear axonal visualization at high imaging depth. Moreover, this advancement enables large-scale, deep 3D imaging of intact tissues. In principle, this concept can be extended to any imaging modality, including existing inverted wide-field, confocal, and two-photon microscopy. This would significantly upgrade traditional laboratory configurations and facilitate the study of connectomes in the brain and other tissues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Inverted confocal microscopy</kwd><kwd>High-depth imaging</kwd><kwd>cleared tissues</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFA0806400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Hongwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Guangzhou Key Research Program on Brain Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202206060001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Hongwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82130068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Hongwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RIM-Deep enhances imaging depth in confocal microscopy enabling high-quality visualization of large cleared samples across various fields with minimal cost.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tissue clearing techniques enable 3D imaging of whole tissues and organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ueda et al., 2020</xref>). Unlike traditional histology, these techniques reduce light scattering and absorption, enhancing depth imaging capabilities and achieving single-cell resolution in deep samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Susaki et al., 2014</xref>). These approaches are now widely used in neurobiology, developmental biology, immunology, and oncology. To achieve deep imaging of fully cleared tissues, various optical sectioning techniques for three-dimensional imaging have rapidly developed, including light sheet microscopy, two-photon microscopy, and confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ueda et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>For effective 3D imaging of cleared tissues, it is crucial to utilize microscopes equipped with objectives that offer both low to medium magnification and long working distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Jonkman et al., 2020</xref>). Objectives with low numerical aperture (NA) are often used to achieve these long working distances, but they face significant challenges in maintaining high axial resolution for deep tissue imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Birk et al., 2017</xref>). The main issue arises from light scattering and reflection at the interfaces within the sample and between the sample and the lens, leading to image distortion and blurring. This phenomenon, known as spherical aberration, occurs when light rays entering the periphery of the lens focus at a different point on the optical axis compared to those entering near the center, leading to a significant degradation in fluorescence signal intensity and image resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Diel et al., 2020</xref>). Using dry objectives with high-refractive-index mounting media or cleared tissues can exacerbate this issue, as the sample itself contributes to the aberration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gibson and Lanni, 1992</xref>). Therefore, matching the refractive index (RI) of the objective’s immersion medium to that of the sample’s immersion medium is essential to mitigate axial distortion caused by spherical aberration.</p><p>Many immersion objectives feature correction collars that can be adjusted to compensate for RI mismatches. Achieving an exact match between the refractive indices of the immersion media and the sample medium is often challenging. Although dipping caps with glass windows can transform air objectives into immersion lenses by enabling the front lens to be directly inserted into the sample media, this approach helps to avoid axial deviation during imaging. However, immersion objectives on inverted microscopes encounter limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dodt et al., 2015</xref>). These objectives cannot be inserted into sample chambers and must move up and down outside the chamber, which restricts the imaging depth.</p><p>To overcome these limitations, several alternative methods have been developed. One such approach involves moving the sample within a chamber filled with mounting media, while the imaging objective remains fixed outside the chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Engelbrecht and Stelzer, 2006</xref>). Another technique utilizes adaptive optics, such as deformable mirrors or spatial light modulators, to correct aberrations across the field of view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ji, 2017</xref>). Additionally, radially symmetric phase masks are used to balance spherical aberration at various depths within the sample, thereby simplifying the image restoration process through post-capture deconvolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Patwary et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>However, inverted confocal microscopes encounter issues due to the gravitational dispersion of the RI buffer between the objective and the confocal dish, resulting in RI mismatches with air and complicating high-resolution imaging. Additionally, the use of long-working-distance air objectives causes severe spherical aberrations due to RI mismatches, further limiting imaging depth and resolution.</p><p>Here, we developed the Refractive Index Matching-Deep (RIM-Deep) system to address these challenges, which includes an immersion chamber designed around the optical components of the objective lens and a specimen holder integrated with a motorized x–y–z stage. This design effectively stabilizes the refractive index between the objective and the sample media. When paired with an immersion objective, the RIM-Deep system enables high-resolution, deep imaging, significantly enhancing the capabilities of inverted confocal microscopy. This innovation provides a practical solution for achieving high-quality 3D imaging of cleared tissues, paving the way for more detailed and accurate biological studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Official adapters for 10 X immersion objectives in Nikon inverted confocal microscopy significantly enhance cleared tissue imaging, but RI buffer leakage still occurs, causing RI mismatch and limiting imaging depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In response to this challenge, the RIM-Deep was designed based on a light sheet microscopy imaging chamber. It features a media reservoir affixed to the objective and filled with RI buffer, enabling 3D imaging of the sample within an imaging buffer. To further optimize imaging performance, a support bracket integrated into the motorized stages elevates the imaging platform and centrally positions a specimen holder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Resolution characterization and image depth of standard adapter and Refractive Index Matching-Deep (RIM-Deep).</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Schematic diagram of a 10 X immersion objective with standard adapter (<bold>A</bold>) or RIM-Deep (<bold>B</bold>).

Within the 2 mm imaging limit, 10 X immersion objectives with the standard adapter maintain both optical axial (XZ) and lateral (XY) resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>). As expected, the RIM-Deep also maintained optimal axial resolution across 5 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). However, there was no significant difference in lateral resolution between the two types of chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently, the high-depth imaging performance of the RIM-Deep was evaluated and compared to the standard adapter. Imaging was performed on a Macaca fascicularis brain section cleared using the iDISCO, CUBIC, and MACS methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Gravity affected the refractive index matching fluid at the tip of the objective, limiting the imaging depth to less than 2 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1 fig1video2 fig1video3">Figure 1—videos 1–3</xref>). As observed, with the RIM-Deep, the specimen holder was fully immersed in the RI liquid, the depth of images is obviously enhanced to about 5 mm, and the vessel structures could thereby be observed clearly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–L4</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video4">Figure 1—video 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video5">Figure 1—video 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video6">Figure 1—video 6</xref>).</p><p>The performance of the RIM-Deep method was also evaluated using a Leica inverted confocal microscope. Notably, high-resolution imaging of multiple cross-sections was successfully achieved for a Macaca fascicularis brain vasculature at depths of up to 5 mm, demonstrating consistent results across different imaging platforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video7">Figure 1—video 7</xref>).</p><p>To further assess the resolution and depth robustness of RIM-Deep in neuronal imaging, experiments were conducted on Thy1-EGFP mouse brains cleared with the CUBIC method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Generally, confocal microscopy is limited to thin sections and cannot fully study vascular networks. However, with the assistance of the RIM-Deep, complete observation of vascular damage is possible. Therefore, mouse brains with induced cortical ischemia were examined to thoroughly investigate this process. Using VALID labeling and MACS tissue clearing techniques, the cerebral vasculature was reconstructed, revealing a significantly reduced vessel density in the ischemic cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J–L</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3—video 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">Figure 3—video 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video4">Figure 3—video 4</xref>). These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the RIM-Deep in visualizing disease-related changes in vascular structures, making it a valuable tool in neuroscience research.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Inverted confocal microscopy often faces challenges such as limited axial resolution and spherical aberration when imaging cleared tissues. The RIM-Deep, featuring a media reservoir filled with RI buffer, was designed to address these issues. Experimental validations showed that the RIM deep maintained optimal axial resolution when imaging fluorescent beads. Using the three different tissue cleaning method on Macaca fascicularis brain tissues, imaging depths reached up to 5 mm with clear visualization of vascular structures. Similarly, in Thy1-eGFP mouse brains, the RIM deep extended imaging depth to approximately 5 mm, allowing clear visualization of neuronal and axonal structures. The RIM deep also effectively visualized vascular damage in mouse brains with cortical ischemia, proving valuable in neuroscience research. The RIM-Deep method also demonstrates versatility across different imaging platforms, ensuring consistent performance in various experimental setups.</p><p>The development of tissue clearing has revolutionized neuroscientific research. However, two-photon and light sheet microscopes are prohibitively expensive and their operation and maintenance costs are high, limiting their application scenarios. Many hospitals and laboratories, although capable of performing tissue clearing independently, are unable to conduct imaging. The inverted point-scanning confocal microscope, preferred for live cell and tissue slice imaging, offers advantages in deep imaging of cleared tissues over upright microscopes, including reduced sample contact and buffer use, lowering the risk of damage and cost. However, the use of long-working-distance air objectives introduces severe spherical aberrations due to RI mismatch, limiting imaging depth and resolution. Our RIM-Deep addresses these issues, extending imaging depth without compromising the microscope’s normal functionality.</p><p>Wide-field microscopes, although efficient for rapid imaging, often face limitations in depth and resolution when applied to cleared tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Shaw, 2006</xref>). The RIM-Deep can also be employed in these cases to enhance imaging performance. When using wide-field microscopy with the RIM-Deep, it is necessary to apply deconvolution algorithms or other techniques to eliminate out-of-focus signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Shaw, 2006</xref>). However, it is important to note that this system may reduce fluorescence intensity in deeper regions of the sample.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of the study and prospect</title><p>Despite the advantages offered by the RIM-Deep, several limitations remain. The imaging speed of inverted point-scanning confocal microscopy is slower compared to light sheet microscopy, necessitating advanced post-processing algorithms for high-speed 3D imaging. To address this, resonance scanning methods combined with artificial intelligence-based image analysis can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of imaging, providing a more robust solution for detailed analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Elliott, 2020</xref>). Iterative reconstruction algorithms can enhance resolution and mitigate imaging artifacts. However, achieving uniform resolution across different depths remains challenging, particularly for very dense samples.</p><p>Furthermore, our research primarily focuses on neural tissues, and its effectiveness in imaging other tissue types remains to be explored. What’s more, the objective lens used is limited to a correction collar for refractive indices between 1.33 and 1.51. Techniques like iDISCO and aqueous CUBIC/MACS, with refractive indices of 1.56 and 1.51/1.52, respectively, facilitate depth imaging to nearly 5 mm. However, if the media’s refractive index exceeds the lens’s correction range, it could compromise resolution and image quality. Recently, laboratories have developed objectives with long working distances, high numerical apertures, and broad refractive index correction capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Voigt et al., 2024</xref>). The Schmidt immersion objective, composed of spherical mirrors and aspheric correction plates, achieves an NA of 1.08 at a refractive index of 1.56, FOV of 1.1 mm, and W.D. of 11 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Voigt et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Future work should explore machine learning-based techniques to further optimize image quality and resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Melanthota et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, as imaging depth increases, maintaining a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) becomes more challenging. Advanced denoising algorithms will be critical to address these issues, ensuring high-quality imaging of thick tissue samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Mandracchia et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Li et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the RIM-Deep represents a significant advancement in deep tissue imaging for inverted confocal microscopy, addressing key challenges related to axial resolution and spherical aberration. However, further refinements and integration with advanced computational techniques are necessary to optimize its performance and expand its applicability in various research fields.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>We used 6-y-old male Macaca fascicularis brain and male Thy1-EGFP mice brain gifted from Prof. Xiong Cao (South Medical University).

A photoactive dye, Rose Bengal was injected into the tail vein. Focused 561 nm laser irradiation was then applied to the cortical area to activate the dye, causing thrombosis and inducing ischemia by obstructing blood vessels. After surgery, mice were placed in warm cages for recovery and subsequently returned to their cages. Three days later, mice underwent deep sedation via intraperitoneal administration of sodium pentobarbital at a dosage of 50 mg/kg.

Usually, the imaging depth using the classical confocal microscopy sample chamber is limited due to optical aberrations, resulting in loss of resolution and image quality. To overcome this limitation and increase depth, they generated a special imaging chamber, that is affixed to the objective and filled with a solution matching the refractive indices to reduce aberrations. Importantly, the study was conducted using a standard confocal microscope, that has not been modified apart from exchanging the standard sample chamber with the RIM-Deep sample holder. Upon analysing the imaging depth, the authors claim that the RIM-Deep method increased the depth from 2 mm to 5 mm. In summary, RIM-Deep has the potential to significantly enhance imaging quality of thick samples on a low budget, making in-depth measurements possible for a wide range of researchers that have access to an inverted confocal microscope.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors used different clearing methods to demonstrate the suitability of RIM-Deep for various sample preparation protocols with clearing solutions of different refractive indices. They clearly demonstrate that the RIM-Deep chamber is compatible with all 3 methods. Brain samples are characterized by complex networks of cells and are often hard to visualize. Despite the dense, complex structure of brain tissue, the RIM-Deep method generated high-quality images of all 3 samples given. As the authors already stated, increasing imaging depth often goes hand in hand with purchasing expensive new equipment, exchanging several microscopy parts or purchasing a new microscopy set-up. Innovations, such as the RIM-Deep chamber, hence, might pave the way for cost-effective imaging and expand the applicability of an inverted confocal microscope.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) However, since this study introduces a novel imaging technique, and therefore, aims to revolutionize the way of imaging large samples, additional control experiments would strengthen the data. From the 3 clearing protocol used (CUBIC, MACS and iDISCO), only the brain section from Macaca fascicularis cleared with iDISCO was imaged with the standard chamber and the RIM-Deep method. This comparison indeed shows that the imaging depth thereby increases more than 2-fold, which is a significant enhancement in terms of microscopy. However, it would have been important to evaluate and show the difference of the imaging depth also on the other two samples, since they were cleared with different protocols and, thus, treated with clearing solutions of different refractive indices compared to iDCISCO.</p><p>(2) The description of the figures and figure panels should be improved for a better understanding of the experiments performed and the thus resulting images/data.</p><p>(3) While the authors used a Nikon AX inverted laser scanning confocal microscope, the study would highly benefit from evaluating the performance of the RIM-Deep method using other inverted confocal microscopes or even wide-field microscopes.</p><p>Comments on Revision:</p><p>Regarding point (1)</p><p>Within the revised manuscript, Liu et al focussed on a more detailed comparison of the standard vs the RIM-Deep method of samples cleared with the 3 different methods.</p><p>Regarding point (2)</p><p>The revised description of the figures results in a better understanding of the data.</p><p>Regarding point (3)</p><p>The authors tested their method on different microscopic setups to show the compatibility.</p><p>Summary: the revised manuscript addressed all previously mentioned points.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101143.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yisi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Microbiome Medicine Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Guangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Pu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Nikon Precision</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shanghai</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>Junjie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Neurosurgery, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, The National Key Clinical Specialty, Guangzhou</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Guangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Hongwei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Microbiome Medicine Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Guangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Liu et al., present an immersion objective adapter design called RIM-Deep, which can be utilized for enhancing axial resolution and reducing spherical aberrations during inverted confocal microscopy of thick cleared tissue.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>RI mismatches present a significant challenge to deep tissue imaging, and developing a robust immersion method is valuable in preventing losses in resolution.

In truth, we have utilized three distinct clearing techniques, including iDISCO, CUBIC, and MACS, to substantiate the adaptability and multifunctionality of the RIM-Deep adapter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Liu et al., claim to have developed a useful technique for deep tissue imaging, but in its current form, the paper does not provide sufficient evidence that their technique performs better than existing ones.</p></disp-quote><p>We are in complete agreement with your recommendation, and the additional experiments will conduct a thorough comparison of the efficacy between the RIM-deep adapter and the official adapter in the context of fluorescence bead experiments, along with their performance in cubic and MASC tissue clearing techniques.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Suggestions for improvement:</p><p>Major revisions:</p><p>(1) For the bead experiment, the comparison was made to a 10X dry objective instead of an immersion objective, please make a comparison to the standard immersion objective.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We fully agree with your suggestion to make a comparison with the standard immersion objective. We plan to conduct this comparison in future experiments and will thoroughly analyze the imaging differences between the official adapter and the RIM-deep adapter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is unclear if an accurate comparison of objectives (same NA etc) is being made in Fig 1G-J, since the official adapter image appears to be of lower resolution even at the surface. At the very least, progressive 2D slices of the reconstruction must be shown for both adapters instead of just the RIM-Deep adapter.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We strictly controlled the numerical aperture (NA) of the objectives in Fig 1G-J to ensure the accuracy of the comparison. However, the imaging resolution of the official adapter is consistent with that of the RIM-deep adapter. We agree that showing progressive 2D slices of the reconstruction would provide a more comprehensive comparison of the two adapters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Similarly, since there already exists an official adapter, it would be useful to see that RIM-Deep performs better even in the mouse tissue, since the clearing method was different.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We will investigate the imaging performance of the two additional tissue clearing protocols using both the official adapter and the RIM-deep adapter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The movies need legends, as it is unclear if they even show 2-D slices very deep into the tissue.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We will add figure legends to each movie.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The purpose of Supplementary Figure 3 in its current form is unclear, as is the statement in the text related to it : &quot;The effectiveness and utility of this adapter configuration have been substantiated through a comprehensive series of experimental validations&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We will revise the statement to: &quot;We validated the effectiveness and utility of this adapter configuration through a series of experiments.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The system is variably referred to as RIM-Deep or DepthView Enhancer in the text and figures, it would be beneficial to the readers if the authors stuck to one name.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion.
