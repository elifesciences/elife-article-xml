hearing loss. ATOH1 expression in the developing cochlea can efficiently induce hair cell regeneration but the efficiency of hair cell reprogramming declines rapidly as the cochlea matures. We developed Cre-inducible mice to compare hair cell reprogramming with ATOH1 alone or in combination with two other hair cell transcription factors, GFI1 and POU4F3. In newborn mice, all transcription factor combinations tested produced large numbers of cells with the morphology of hair cells and rudimentary mechanotransduction properties. However, 1 week later, only a combination of ATOH1, GFI1 and POU4F3 could reprogram non-sensory cells of the cochlea to a hair cell fate, and these new cells were less mature than cells generated by reprogramming 1 week earlier. We used scRNA-seq and combined scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq to suggest at least two impediments to hair cell reprogramming in older animals. First, hair cell gene loci become less epigenetically accessible in non-sensory cells of the cochlea with increasing age. Second, signaling from hair cells to supporting cells, including Notch signaling, can prevent reprogramming of many supporting cells to hair cells, even with three hair cell transcription factors. Our results shed light on the molecular barriers that must be overcome to promote hair cell regeneration in the adult cochlea.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hair cell</kwd><kwd>reprogramming</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>cochlea</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1DC014832</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Groves</surname><given-names>Andrew K</given-names></name><name><surname>Raphael</surname><given-names>Yehoash</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1DC015829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Segil</surname><given-names>Neil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002046</institution-id><institution>Hearing Health Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HRP Hearing Restoration Project Consortium Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Segil</surname><given-names>Neil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002046</institution-id><institution>Hearing Health Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hearing Restoration Project Consortium Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Groves</surname><given-names>Andrew K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21OD025327</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ray</surname><given-names>Russell S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cells of the mammalian cochlea can be reprogrammed to produce mechanosensory hair cells, but epigenetic changes in the cochlea make this process less efficient with age.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hearing loss is a widespread public health issue affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Hearing loss can be treated with cochlear implants or hearing aids but biological restoration of cochlear structure and function is not currently possible. Hearing is mediated by mechanosensitive hair cells in the organ of Corti, and loss or damage to these cells results in sensorineural hearing loss. Although mammals are only capable of very modest spontaneous hair cell regeneration in the balance organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bramhall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cox et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Forge et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Golub et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kawamoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kelley et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ogata et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rubel et al., 1995</xref>), the cochlea lack this regenerative capability. This is in not the case in lower vertebrates. Robust turnover of hair cells is seen in the balance organs of many non-mammalian vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corwin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jørgensen and Mathiesen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lanford et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Popper and Hoxter, 1990</xref>). Impressive structural and functional recovery can also be achieved in the hearing organs of non-mammalian vertebrates following the killing of hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler and Raphael, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baird et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corwin and Cotanche, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cotanche, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Niemiec et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raphael, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roberson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ryals and Rubel, 1988</xref>). In these cases, supporting cells lying adjacent to hair cells can re-enter the cell cycle and trans-differentiate to generate new hair cells. These findings have prompted efforts to promote the regeneration of mammalian hair cells through genetic and pharmacological manipulations.</p><p>The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor ATOH1 is both necessary and sufficient for hair cell development and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bermingham et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chonko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Driver et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Woods et al., 2004</xref>). In vitro studies using explants of the mammalian cochlea or inner ear balance organs showed that overexpression of ATOH1 can reprogram non-sensory cells of the inner ear into hair-cell-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shou et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zheng and Gao, 2000</xref>). Adenoviral expression of <italic>Atoh1</italic> in the cochlea of guinea pigs deafened with ototoxic drugs shows a variable and partial restoration of hearing after the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Izumikawa et al., 2005</xref>). In vivo studies employing neonatal transgenic mice showed that cells of the greater epithelial ridge (GER) that lie next to the organ of Corti, and some supporting cells could be reprogrammed to hair-cell-like cells with the ectopic expression of <italic>Atoh1</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kelly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). However, the hair cell reprogramming ability of ATOH1 declines rapidly with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kelly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting a need for additional transcription factors to promote hair cell reprogramming in older animals. Moreover, cochleae where the auditory epithelium has degenerated further to state lacking hair cell and supporting cells (known as the flat epithelium; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Izumikawa et al., 2008</xref>) do not respond to ATOH1 over-expression, further indicating the need for a more complex combinatorial approach.</p><p>Several transcription factors have been tested in combination with ATOH1 for their hair cell reprogramming potential (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iyer and Groves, 2021</xref>). GFI1 and POU4F3 are two hair-cell-specific transcription factors expressed downstream of ATOH1 during development that has been implicated in hair cell survival and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hertzano et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Masuda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wallis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xiang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xiang et al., 1998</xref>). Adenoviral delivery of ATOH1 and GFI1 to adult mice in which hair cells were ablated promoted regeneration through supporting cell transdifferentiation at a higher efficiency than ATOH1 alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, transgenic over-expression of combinations of ATOH1, GATA3, and POU4F3 reprogrammed adult supporting cells into hair-cell-like cells with improved efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Walters et al., 2017</xref>). A combination of ATOH1, GFI1, and POU4F3 reprogrammed embryonic stem cells and chick otic epithelial cells in vitro to cells that expressed several hair cell genes, and showed key hair cell features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costa et al., 2015</xref>). The co-overexpression of these three factors in vivo can also reprogram neonatal Lgr5 +supporting cells into hair-cell-like cells more efficiently than ATOH1 alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, the addition of SIX1 to the three factor cocktail was able to reprogram adult mouse tail-tip fibroblasts into hair-cell-like cells which have some epigenetic and transcriptional characteristics of hair cells, as well as transduction channel protein expression, and hair-cell-like electrophysiological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Menendez et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have shown that one reason for the inability of cochlear supporting cells to convert to hair cells is that the chromatin surrounding hair cell genes becomes progressively less accessible as the ear matures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tao et al., 2021</xref>). The use of multiple hair cell transcription factors to reprogram supporting cells into hair cells may enhance the accessibility of hair cell loci in supporting cells, and recent evidence suggests that some hair cell transcription factors such as POU4F3 can do so in the developing cochlea by acting as pioneer factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). However, the question of whether combinations of multiple transcription factors simply improve the efficiency of hair cell reprogramming, or whether they can also improve the fidelity of hair cell reprogramming by activating a larger number of hair cell genes is currently unknown.</p><p>In this study, we sought to address this question by comparing the reprogramming potential of three transcription factor combinations – ATOH1 alone, ATOH1 + GFI1, and ATOH1 + GFI1+POU4F3 - in the mouse cochlea. We generated three transgenic mouse lines in which the transcription factor combinations were expressed from the ROSA26 locus in a Cre-dependent fashion. We found that ATOH1 alone is sufficient to reprogram neonatal non-sensory cells of the greater epithelial ridge into a mosaic of large numbers of hair cell-like cells that are surrounded by GLAST-positive supporting cell-like cells. The reprogrammed hair cells resembled inner hair cells and possessed stereocilia and some mechanotransduction properties. At these young ages, additional transcription factors do not enhance the number of new hair cells generated by ATOH1, nor do they increase the number of hair cells genes expressed in these reprogrammed cells, determined by single-cell RNA-seq. However, we show that after the first postnatal week, the overexpression of GFI1 and POU4F3 is necessary to enhance the hair cell reprogramming ability of ATOH1 in 8-day-old supporting cells. We also show that some supporting cell populations remain refractory to reprogramming even with three transcription factors, likely due to the action of the reprogramming factors being blocked by Notch signaling delivered by the endogenous hair cells. By simultaneously comparing the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility of cochlear cells at birth and 1 week of age using single-cell multi-omic approaches, we showed that hair cell loci become progressively less accessible in supporting cells and non-sensory cells of the cochlea during the first postnatal week. Our work provides the first mechanistic analysis of hair cell reprogramming and reveals some of the epigenetic and cell signaling obstacles that will need to be overcome in a therapeutic context in the mature inner ear.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hair cell transcription factors promote highly efficient reprogramming of non-sensory cochlear tissue into hair-cell-like cells in the neonatal mouse</title><p>To directly compare the efficiency of different transcription factor combinations in hair cell reprogramming, we targeted them to the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus using a modified <italic>Ai3</italic> targeting vector containing a transcriptional stop cassette flanked by loxP sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>).

These reprogrammed hair cells did, however, show evidence of innervation based on staining with TuJ1 antibody, and formed ribbon synapses based on positive staining for CTBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to assess the morphology of reprogrammed hair cell stereocilia across all three conditions. Low power images showed the presence of sparse reprogrammed hair cells in the ATOH1 and GFI1+ATOH1 overexpression conditions which did not stain for any hair cell markers other than Myosin VIIA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Higher magnification SEM images at 50,000 X revealed that individual hair cell stereocilia of reprogrammed hair cells in all three conditions were immature compared to endogenous hair cells and the P1 reprogrammed hair cells we observed at P8. Many of the ectopic cells possessed kinocilia but the stereocilia did not exhibit a staircase-like structure and still contained many side links between individual stereocilia, indicating their immature state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Some of the ectopic hair cells produced in all three conditions were able to take up the dye FM1-43X, suggesting that at least some of the cells have some rudimentary mechanotransduction activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, we established that all three overexpression conditions are capable of producing reprogrammed hair-cell-like cells at P15, but the Rosa26-GAP cocktail is significantly more efficient at producing new hair cells. Nevertheless, these reprogrammed hair cells created between P8 and P15 are less mature than those derived from reprogramming neonatal cells between P1 and P8.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Postnatal (<bold>P15</bold>) Rosa26-GAP reprogrammed hair cells are innervated and form ribbon synapses, but possess immature stereociliary bundles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Control and reprogrammed cochleae immunostained for the inner hair cell-specific marker, VGLUT3, outer hair-cell-specific marker, PRESTIN, neuronal marker TuJ1, ribbon synapse-specific marker CTBP2 and hair cell marker, Myosin VIIA.

However, its ability to reprogram these non-sensory cells to a hair cell fate declines in the first postnatal week, prompting attempts to augment its reprogramming activity with combinations of other hair cell transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Menendez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Walters et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yamashita et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we show that the co-expression of ATOH1 with two other hair cell transcription factors, GFI1 and POU4F3, in <italic>Rosa-GAP</italic> mice can increase the efficiency of hair cell reprogramming in older animals compared to ATOH1 alone or GFI1 +ATOH1. However, the hair cells generated by reprogramming at 8 days of age – even with three hair cell transcription factors – are significantly less mature than those generated by reprogramming at postnatal day 1. By analyzing the epigenetic landscape of the cochlea over the first two postnatal weeks, we suggest that reprogramming with multiple transcription factors is better able to access the hair cell differentiation gene regulatory network, but that additional interventions may be necessary to produce mature and fully functional hair cells.</p><p>By targeting different transcription factor combinations to the same locus – <italic>Rosa26</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) <italic>–</italic> we were able to directly compare the reprogramming ability of three hair cell transcription factor combinations without the confounds of variable expression levels caused by different transgene copy numbers or integration sites. Our results show that in newborn mice, activation of the reprogramming cocktails – ATOH1, ATOH1 +GFI1, and ATOH1 +GFI1+POU4 F3 – can produce equally large numbers of new inner hair-cell-like cells in the greater epithelial ridge that receive neuronal input, form ribbon synapses, form immature stereocilia resembling those of endogenous hair cells at this age, and exhibit rudimentary mechanotransduction properties as shown by FM1-43 uptake and expression of components of the mechanotransduction apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Moreover, these new hair-cell-like cells can survive in the transformed greater epithelial ridge for at least two weeks, overriding the process of GER remodeling via apoptosis which occurs during normal cochlear development in mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with the similar morphological and functional properties of these reprogrammed cells, we found no significant differences in the transcriptomes of the reprogrammed hair-cell-like cells produced by the three transcription factor combinations when induced at P1 and analyzed a week later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The simplest explanation for these results is that the <italic>Gfi1</italic> and <italic>Pou4f3</italic> genes are direct transcriptional targets of ATOH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hertzano et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ikeda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yu et al., 2021</xref>), and thus activation of either ATOH1 alone (or GFI1+ATOH1) would result in the activation of all three transcription factors, together with other transcriptional effectors of the hair cell gene regulatory network. In support of this idea, we observe precocious induction of POU4F3 protein in GER cells several days after the expression of ATOH1 in Rosa-A mice. In contrast, activation of ATOH1 alone just one week later in P8 Rosa-A mice is unable to activate POU4F3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A</xref>) suggesting that components of the hair cell gene regulatory network – even those immediately downstream of <italic>Atoh1</italic> – become refractory to induction by ATOH1 alone in older animals.</p><p>Our data show that co-expression of GFI1 and POU4F3 with ATOH1 in the 8-day-old cochlea is sufficient to generate significant numbers of reprogrammed hair-cell-like cells by P15, but that ATOH1 alone or ATOH1 + GFI1 produce very few new hair cells. It is important to note that the GER is undergoing significant apoptotic remodeling at this time in response to thyroid hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peeters et al., 2015</xref>), as shown by the loss of Sox9 lineage-labeled cells from the cochlea between P8 and P15 (Figure S4A). This remodeling likely leads to a loss of cells capable of being reprogrammed by <italic>Rosa-GAP</italic> mice, which we suggest leads to an under-estimate of the reprogramming capability of <italic>Rosa-GAP</italic> mice in these experiments. Nonetheless, despite the presence of significant numbers of newly reprogrammed hair cells in <italic>Rosa-GAP</italic> mice, our single-cell RNA-seq analysis of the new hair-cell-like cells at P15 reveals no significant differences in their transcriptome compared to the small number of reprogrammed cells generated by <italic>Rosa-A</italic> and <italic>Rosa-GA</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In addition, new hair cells generated in all three conditions between P8 and P15 have only rudimentary mechanotransduction as assayed by FM1-43X uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data suggest that although the combination of our three transcription factors can significantly increase the <italic>efficiency</italic> of hair cell reprogramming, they are not able to activate additional components of the hair cell gene regulatory network compared to ATOH1 alone or ATOH1 + GFI1 – in other words, the additional reprogramming factors can enhance the quantity of reprogrammed hair cells, but not their ‘quality’. However, this conclusion should be qualified by several considerations. First, the number of reprogrammed hair cells appearing in our scRNA-seq analysis of <italic>Rosa-A</italic> and <italic>Rosa-GA</italic> is very small, and second, since our RNA-seq analysis was performed only 1 week after activation of the reprogramming factors at P8, additional maturation may likely occur after longer periods. Consistent with this possibility, we note that Myosin VIIa + cells produced by <italic>Rosa-GAP</italic> mice at P15 do not have organized actin bundles on their apical surface that can be labeled by phalloidin. Significantly, such bundles begin to appear on these GAP-reprogrammed hair cells over the following two weeks, but not in the small number of extra hair cells generated by Rosa-A mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). It is also important to note that our current over-expression model causes continued expression of ATOH1 in our reprogrammed cells, whereas <italic>Atoh1</italic> expression is normally downregulated in hair cells shortly after they begin to differentiate. Such persistent expression may militate against full maturation of the new hair cells generated in our studies, and in previous studies that have used constitutive activation of <italic>Atoh1</italic> as a reprogramming strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kelly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Menendez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Walters et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yamashita et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The new hair cells generated by reprogramming in the GER region adjacent to the endogenous inner hair cells expressed at least one inner hair cell marker (VGLUT3). However, we saw no evidence for this in our P15 reprogrammed cells, suggesting that developmental signals that may specify inner versus outer hair cells may have disappeared by this age. Reprogramming with additional transcription factors specific for hair cell sub-types – such as Ikzf2 or Insm1 for outer hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chessum et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wiwatpanit et al., 2018</xref>) or Tbx2 for inner hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">García-Añoveros et al., 2022</xref>) may be necessary to generate specific kinds of hair cells in older animals. Indeed, a recent report suggests that Atoh1 and Ikzf2 can co-operate to produce hair cells with some properties of outer hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sun et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Supporting cells are essential for the function and survival of inner ear hair cells. During development, hair cells and supporting cells derive from a common progenitor, and the correct proportion of these two cell types is regulated by several signaling pathways, most prominently Notch signaling (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basch et al., 2016a</xref>). Interventions that promote conversion of supporting cells into hair cells without replacing the original supporting cells are unlikely to lead to the restoration of a functional organ of Corti. Non-mammalian vertebrates accomplish this by triggering transient proliferation of at least some supporting cells during the regenerative process, and such transient proliferation may be important to promote functional hair cell regeneration in mammals. However, the generation of reprogrammed hair cells can generate new supporting cells in the surrounding tissue through non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, again including Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stone and Cotanche, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). In the present study, we have shown that the production of large numbers of reprogrammed hair cell-like cells in the GER causes the induction of GLAST + supporting cells that interleave the new hair cells. Of note, the new hair cells produced in the GER resemble inner ear hair cells, and our scRNA-seq and antibody characterization shows that the identity of ectopic supporting cells resembles border cells and inner phalangeal cells, two supporting cell types that normally surround inner hair cells. Reprogramming in the GER is, therefore, able to generate appropriately patterned and location-specific mosaics of hair cells and supporting cells similar to those that occur in vivo.</p><p>The fact that the new supporting cell-like cells retain their identity despite continuing to express hair cell reprogramming factors suggests that signaling pathways present in supporting cells can override the action of the reprogramming factors. Our data also show that some endogenous supporting cells in the organ of Corti – notably pillar cells and Deiters’ cells – remain refractory to the effects of reprogramming factors at both P1 and P8. We have confirmed the refractory state of these supporting cell types with two different Cre lines, <italic>Sox9-CreER</italic> and <italic>Lfng-CreER</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, a recent study also expressed ATOH1, GFI1, and POU4F3 in different populations of neonatal cochlear supporting cells and reported that some of them are capable of being reprogrammed into hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). One of the Cre-expressing lines used to activate the reprogramming factors in the study by Chen and colleagues, <italic>Fgfr3-iCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>, also expresses functional Cre recombinase in up to 30% of outer hair cells at the experimental time points and ages used in the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cox et al., 2012</xref>), so it is likely that many of the labeled outer hair cells were endogenous hair cells present at the start of the experiment. Although the mice generated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021</xref> apparently targeted the three reprogramming factors to the ROSA locus and employed a chicken beta-actin promoter in the same manner as the <italic>Rosa-GAP</italic> mice we report here, it is also possible that the two targeted lines express the reprogramming factors at different levels. Although we observe transcriptional changes in supporting cells in response to our three reprogramming combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), both the hair cells and supporting cells in the organ of Corti remain healthy and viable in all conditions examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, S1-S9). In contrast, hair cell loss was observed when ATOH1, GFI1, and POU4F3 were activated by either <italic>Fgfr3-iCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> or <italic>Lgr5-CreER</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that the levels of reprogramming factors used may be important for cochlear cell viability. Hair cell survival appears to be particularly sensitive to ATOH1 levels; hair cell loss and hearing deficits are observed in mice with only one functional ATOH1 allele, or with two hypomorphic alleles of ATOH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xie et al., 2017</xref>), and so it is likely that future regenerative strategies using ATOH1 will need to calibrate the level and duration of this important transcription factor with great precision.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that Notch signaling may be responsible for overriding the reprogramming ability of our transcription factor combinations. First, most organ of Corti supporting cells in neonatal mice rapidly and readily trans-differentiate into hair cells when Notch signaling is blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Korrapati et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mizutari et al., 2013</xref>). Second, blocking Notch signaling with gamma-secretase inhibitors can cause ectopic supporting cells in the GER created by ATOH1 reprogramming to transdifferentiate to hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kelly et al., 2012</xref>). Third, our scRNA-seq data suggests that elements of the Notch signaling pathway are reconstituted in the ectopic supporting cells generated in our mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and in endogenous supporting cells that receive reprogramming factors from P8-P15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This latter result is particularly notable, as supporting cells normally transcriptionally and epigenetically down-regulate the Notch pathway in the first postnatal week and become refractory to Notch inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maass et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maass et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tao et al., 2021</xref>). Together, our data suggest that transcription factor reprogramming may reconstitute some of the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation that normally exists between developing hair cells and supporting cells, and it will be of interest in the future to understand how fully these regulatory circuits can be established by different combinations of transcription factors. In addition to the effects of Notch signaling, our multi-omic analysis of cochlear tissue at P1 and P8 shows clearly that the chromatin of hair cell loci becomes less accessible in supporting cells and GER cells during the first postnatal week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This decrease in accessibility affects hair cell loci in general, but significantly is also seen in key hair cell transcription factors downstream of Atoh1, including <italic>Gfi1</italic> and <italic>Pou4f3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A</xref>). By using a single-cell multi-omic analysis, we were able to demonstrate these epigenetic changes occurring in all supporting cell and GER cell populations during the first postnatal week. We suggest that this decrease in accessibility is a second element contributing to the need for multiple transcription factors to reprogram more mature cochlear tissue.</p><p>In conclusion, our work shows that while overexpression of multiple hair cell transcription factors in the cochlea clearly promotes more efficient reprogramming in older animals, significant challenges to producing viable, functional hair cells still remain. Future work will be necessary to determine whether more functional hair cells can be generated with extra hair cell transcription factors, by epigenetic modulation of hair cell loci in supporting cells, or by actively targeting the down-regulation of supporting cell genes during reprogramming. Finally, we emphasize that our present work focuses exclusively on the intact organ of Corti. We currently do not know what effect the acute and long-term pathological consequences of hair cell loss in the cochlea will have on the efficiency and fidelity of hair cell reprogramming, and addressing this question will be critical to promoting functional hair cell regeneration in the mammalian cochlea.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Targeting of the ROSA locus</title><p>The three conditional lines for transcription factor overexpression (Rosa-A, GA, GAP) were constructed by modifying the <italic>Ai3</italic> targeting construct (Addgene #22797; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>).

in the Baylor Optical Imaging &amp; Vital Microscopy Core at 20 X and with emulsion oil applied to a 40 X objective lens. Exposure levels were maintained between slides that were part of the same experimental batch. Maximum intensity projections obtained after processing z-stacks were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS6. Processing steps include normalization of intensity levels and derivation of 200 µm lengths of the tissue measured using the scale bar option on the Zen Blue 3.1 software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cell number quantification</title><p>All the images that were used for cell counting were analyzed on Zen Blue 3.1. Counting was done by using the event and marker options that sum the number of objects clicked upon. Inner hair cells, outer hair cells, and GER hair cells from 3 images were counted per genotype – WT, <italic>Rosa-A, Rosa-GA,</italic> and <italic>Rosa-GAP</italic>. Bar graphs were plotted employing the Graphpad Prism 5.0 software after performing an unpaired t-test comparing the control and each induced condition, to determine significance. For all experiments, three biological replicates (i.e. parallel measurements of biologically distinct samples) were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Scanning electron microscopy</title><p>Fixing solution (all reagents from Electron Microscopy Solutions) was prepared by mixing 8% glutaraldehyde (2% final concentration), 0.6 M Cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2–7.4; 0.15 M final concentration) and distilled water. The temporal bones from P8 and P15 experimental animals were removed, and the apex region of each sample was punctured. The temporal bones were incubated in the SEM fixing solution for 2 hr at room temperature. Post incubation, the temporal bones were rinsed and stored in 0.6 M cacodylate buffer at 4 °C. Samples were micro-dissection to expose the organ of Corti and processed with the OTOTO method for scanning electron microscopy. Tissues were then dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions, critical point dried, and mounted on a stub using silver paste. Images were taken with a TESCAN Rise scanning electron microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>FM 1-43 dye uptake assay</title><p>FM 1–43 dye solution was prepared by dissolving a 10 µg/µl stock of FM 1–43 (Thermo Fisher, Cat no. T35356) dye in EBSS/HBSS to a final concentration of 2 µg/ml in 0.5 ml. One cochlea at a time was dissected from live P8 experimental mice and placed on a glass slide. The tissue was incubated in 20 µl of the dye solution for 10–12 s and immediately washed with 1 X PBS. The orientation of the tissue was checked followed by the addition of mounting medium. The mounted tissue was sealed with a glass coverslip and imaged under the 488 (green) channel of a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. The light intensity and brightness were normalized for images captured from different samples using the endogenous hair cells as a reference. For labeling of P15 animals, temporal bones were dissected from the skull and the semicircular canals removed. Using a 30 gauge needle, a fenestra was created at the helicotrema and FM1-43 FX was injected into the cochlear duct and incubated for ~30 s. To remove the FM 1–43 FX, 4% paraformaldehyde (16% stock, 18814–10, Polysciences) was injected into the cochlear duct and cochlea were fixed overnight at 4 °C. Fixed cochlea were decalcified with 0.25 M EDTA for 6 hr at room temperature, followed by dissection of the sensory epithelium. Tissue was mounted in ProLong Gold (Invitrogen) and imaged with a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cell proliferation assay and EdU staining</title><p>An EdU injection solution of 5 mg/ml concentration was prepared by dissolving EdU powder (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A10044) in 1 X PBS pH 7.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #10010023). Pups were weighed and injected with this solution at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight, subcutaneously. Injections were given twice every alternate day (9 am and 5 pm). Mice at P8 and P15 were collected, fixed, and cryosectioned following the procedures described above for IHC. EdU visualization was done using the Click-iT EdU Cell Proliferation Kit for Imaging, Alexa Fluor 488 dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #C10337) following the manufacturer’s instruction accompanying the kit. Co-immunostaining with primary antibody for Myosin VIIA was performed as described previously in this section.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Single-cell dissociation of cochlear cells and FACS purification</title><p>Whole ears from P8 mice were harvested and transferred to a dish of ice-cold CMF PBS. The organ of Corti was dissected from controls and experimental samples into separate microcentrifuge tubes with 0.3 ml ice-cold CMF PBS placed on ice. For P15 animals, whole temporal bones were cleaned and punctured at the apex, then placed into tubes with 0.3 ml ice-cold CMF PBS. In both cases, tissue was washed twice with 0.3 ml ice-cold CMF PBS and incubated in 0.3 ml papain solution (20 U/ml, 1 mM L-Cysteine and 0.5 mM EDTA; Worthington Biochemical Corporation) at 37 °C for 40 min. The papain solution was removed carefully, and the tissue was washed twice with 0.3 ml ice-cold CMF PBS containing 2–5% FBS. The tissue was triturated for 3–4 min by placing tubes on ice with minimal frothing, then filtered (40 micron then 35 micron filter caps – Pluriselect) into a 5 ml round bottom polystyrene tube to remove clumps and bone fragments before sorting. Dissociated cells were sorted on an ArialI FACS sorter at the BCM Flow Cytometry core. The presort conditions specified for the nozzle were 20 psi pressure and 100 µm size, respectively. TdTomato positive sorted cells were collected in DMEM with 5% FBS solution for cDNA library preparation and single-cell RNA sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>cDNA library preparation</title><p>Purified cells were counted to estimate concentration and loaded onto a 10 X genomics Chromium controller to prepare single-cell 3’ RNA seq libraries using the Chromium single cell 3’ reagent kit v3 (10 x Genomics). In brief, single cells were partitioned into GEMS (Gel Beads-In-Emulsions) that contain a gel bead with primers that include a Illumina Truseq Read 1 primer, a 16 nucleotide (nt) 10 x barcode, a 12 nt unique molecular identifier and a 30 nt poly(dT) sequence and all the necessary components to perform reverse transcription. Almost simultaneously, the gel bead is dissolved and the partitioned cell is lysed releasing all the cellular RNA. Incubation of these components inside the GEM results in synthesis of full-length barcoded cDNA from the mRNA. Subsequently, the GEMS are lysed and cDNA from all the single-cells are pooled. Following cleanup using Dynabeads MyOne Silane Beads (Thermo Fisher, 370020), cDNA was amplified by PCR and fragmented to optimal size before end-repair, A-tailing, and adaptor ligation to prepare the paired end illumina libraries followed by a final PCR to amplify the library.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing and analysis</title><p>Sample QC was conducted using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (High Sensitivity DNA Chip, p/n 5067–4626). To quantitate the adapter-ligated library and confirm successful P5 and P7 adapter incorporations, the Applied Biosystems ViiA7 Real-Time PCR System and a KAPA Illumina/Universal Library Quantification Kit (p/n KK4824) were used. All samples were pooled at equimolar amounts and re-quantitated by qPCR and re-assessed on the Bioanalyzer. Using the concentration from the ViiA7 TM qPCR machine above, 300pM of the pooled library was loaded onto a NovaSeq S1 flowcell (Illumina p/n 20012865), using the Standard Workflow loading conditions designated by the manufacturer and amplified by exclusion amplification (ExAMP) for patterned flowcells using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing instrument. PhiX Control v3 adapter-ligated library (Illumina p/n FC110-3001) was spiked-in at 1% by weight to ensure balanced diversity and to monitor clustering and sequencing performance. A paired-end run, using 28 cycles for Read 1, 8 cycles for Index 1 Read and 91 cycles for Read 2 was set to achieve a minimum of approximately 300 M reads per sample. FastQ file generation and QC assessment were achieved using the 10 X Cell Ranger software for 10 X Chromium Platforms. Sequencing data has been uploaded to the GEO database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo</ext-link>), accession number GSE182202.</p><p>The unique molecular identifier (UMI) count matrices were generated by aligning the raw reads to the mm10 (GRCm38) genome along with the annotation gtf file (GRCm38realease-93) (from Ensembl) using the count function of the 10 x genomics Cell Ranger pipeline. Alignment, filtering, barcode, and UMI counting were also performed with Cell Ranger. The R package Seurat (v3.2) was used to process the count matrices. First, the count matrices were transformed into Seurat objects, and cells expressing less than 200 genes and genes expressed in less than 5 cells were filtered and excluded from the analysis. Another round of filtration was performed based on the distribution of the nUMI, nFeature, and percentage of mitochondrial genes expressed per cell in each dataset. Cells expressing less than 750 genes and more than 5000 genes as well as cells with greater than 30% mitochondrial genes were excluded from further analysis.

First, we identified the integration anchors for the four datasets and used them to integrate the datasets using the IntegrateData function. Next, the integrated dataset was scaled by multiplying the normalized values by a factor of 10,000, followed by dimensionality reduction by principal component analysis (PCA). Top 40 principal components were chosen as significant based on a Jackstraw plot and used to construct a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph using the FindNeighbors function. Cells were then clustered at various resolutions ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 using the Leiden algorithm in the FindClusters function of Seurat. The conserved gene markers for each cluster across the different genotypes were identified with the FindConservedMarkers function and unique gene markers for a given cluster were identified using the FindMarkers or for all clusters with FindAllMarkers function. The FindClusters and FindMarkers functions were iterated at the different resolutions until clusters with biological relevance and expected cell types were observed at a resolution of 0.8.</p><p>Each cell-type-specific cluster was identified by ranking differentially expressed genes based on the p-value of expression, average log fold change of expression, and the difference in pct1 vs pct2. A search for cell type-specific expression of the top-ranked genes yielded results unique to cell types and was thus labeled. Gene ontology analysis involved the selection of all significantly expressed genes in the hair cell clusters of the P8 and P15 datasets with a cut-off p-value of less than 1.00E<sup>–03</sup>. The analysis was done on DAVID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://david.ncifcrf.gov/tools.jsp">https://david.ncifcrf.gov/tools.jsp</ext-link>) with this gene list as input. Resultant GO terms and associated p-values (cut off 1.00E<sup>–02</sup>) are represented in the figure. Volcano plots for all differentially expressed genes were plotted using GraphPad Prism 5.0. All cutoffs assigned are marked with dotted lines on the plots.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Multiomic (combined scRNA- and ATAC-seq) sample processing</title><p>For Single Cell Multiome ATAC +Gene Expression (10 x Genomics) experiments, wildtype mice in a mixed background of CD1 and FVB/NJ, and C57BL/6 were used. Cochlear tissue was dissected from P1 and P8 mice and enzymatically dissociated with a cocktail of 400 µl of 0.25% Trypsin, 50 µl of 1 mg/ml Dispase, and 50 µl of 1 mg/ml collagenase for 20 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the digested tissue was titurated 100 times using a small-bore 200 µl pipette and centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the sample was processed according to the 10 x Genomics protocol ‘Nuclei Isolation from Complex Tissues for Single Cell Multiome ATAC +Gene Expression Sequencing’ (CG000375, Rev B). Briefly, the supernatant was decanted, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of NP-40 Lysis Buffer and incubated for 5 min on ice. Nuclei were filtered through a 40 micron cell strainer, and centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 minutes at 4 °C. The supernatant was decanted, and nuclei were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS +2% BSA and incubated for 5 min at 4 C. Nuclei were centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 100 µl of 0.1 x Lysis Buffer, and mixed with a pipet. Nuclei were incubated for 2 min on ice, followed by the addition of 1 ml Wash Buffer, mixed and centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in the appropriate volume of Diluted Nuclei Buffer for input into the Single Cell Multiome ATAC +Gene Expression protocol (10 x Genomics). For the P1 cochlea, 6065 nuclei were loaded. For the P8 cochlea, 9645 nuclei were loaded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Multiomic data processing</title><p>Raw sequencing data from both RNA and ATAC libraries in fastq format were used as input into cellranger-arc count (10 x Genomics, v2.0.0) for simultaneous alignment against the mouse mm10 genome. The cellranger-arc output files ‘filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5’ and ‘atac_fragments.tsv.gz’ were used as input into Seurat v4.1.0 for standard quality control pre-processing, resulting in 4,882 nuclei post-filtering for the P1 dataset, and 7,049 nuclei post-filtering for the P8 dataset. ATAC peaks were called using macs2 v2.1.2. Multiome datasets were clustered based on RNA, ATAC, and weighted-nearest neighbor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hao et al., 2021</xref>) to generate UMAPs. This resulted in 20 clusters for the P1 dataset, and 19 clusters for the P8 dataset. Clusters were assigned cell types based on known cell markers. Cell barcodes from clusters of interest (P1 GER, P8 GER, P1 IPh/BC, P8 IPh, and P8 BC) were used to extract ATAC reads belonging to each respective cell type and generate a pseudobulk ATAC dataset. Peaks were called on the pseudobulk ATAC datasets and common peaks were used as input into DESeq2 v1.34.0 to scale the signal between P1 and P8 datasets. Representative signal tracks were visualized in IGV v2.4.14. ATAC peaks were filtered by hair cell enhancers previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tao et al., 2021</xref>), and intersected to find common, P1-specific, and P8-specific regions.

In neonatal mice, the authors reported that Atoh1 overexpression is sufficient to drive highly efficient reprogramming of non-sensory cochlear tissue into hair cell-like cells which showed FM1-43 intake. However, in older mice (&gt;1 week), overexpression of additional transcription factors GFI1 and POU4F3 is required to enhance Atoh1-induced reprogramming of supporting cells into hair cells, which was supported by RNAseq analysis showing reprogramed cells under these conditions are transcriptionally similar and possess immature hair cell-like features. Furthermore, they showed that Notch signaling likely counteracts the reprogramming effect of these transcription factors and further demonstrated that hair cell loci become less epigenetically accessible in supporting cells and GER cells between postnatal days 1 and 8. These findings provide mechanistic insights into why Atoh1 and associated transcription factors have less reprogramming potential in older mice. Overall, the experiments were well justified and designed. However, besides showing uptake of FM1-43 in reprogrammed hair cells in neonatal mice, no functional characterization of reprogrammed hair cells in P8-P15 mice. It is possible that not only do older mice have less epigenetic accessibility in supporting cells and GER cells, but the reprogrammed hair cells in older mice might also have limited functionality. This needs to be tested. Along the line, while P8 reprogrammed hair cells show robust enrichment in genes related to sensory perception of sound (Figure 3E), it is the cell projection in P15 reprogrammed hair cells (Figure 6E). Moreover, the changes in transduction channel protein expression in neonatal, P8, and P15 reprogrammed hair cell gene sets should be analyzed. In addition, it will be a plus to characterize the electrophysiological properties of these reprogrammed hair cells at different stages.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors' comment that using Rosa26 as a promoter helps the genetic design to circumvent the issue of multiple copy numbers of the transgene is factually incorrect. However, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has a caveat of having a high chance of random insertion(s) and/or deletion(s) of the transgene and the native genome. Since the authors did not directly assess the copy number of the transgene, they should avoid this claim.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79712.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) Please show functional characterization of reprogrammed hair cells in P8-P15 mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed FM1-43 labeling of the reprogrammed cells in our mice that were reprogrammed at P8 and analyzed at P15. Because the temporal bone is calcified at P15, it is hard to expose the cochlear epithelium for rapid live imaging. We therefore isolated the cochlea, perfused a fixable form of FM1-43 into the cochlea and immediately washed it out with buffer followed by fixative. Our data show that this method labels the endogenous organ of Corti hair cells very well, and we also see a small amount of FM1-43 labeling in the ectopic reprogrammed hair cells in our mice. These data are now included as Figure 5 – Supplementary Figure 1. This suggests that the reprogrammed hair cells retain at least rudimentary mechanotransduction properties at this age, but confirms our electron microscopy data, antibody marker data and scRNA-seq data that reprogramming at this later age produces cells that are less mature than the reprogrammed cells generated at earlier ages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please address why the authors chose not to explore ATOH-1 and Pou4F3 without GFl-1.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer correctly states, previous work from both vertebrates and <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggest that Atoh1 and Gfi1 can synergize to enhance the transcriptional activity of Atoh1. We recently showed that Gfi1 does this by forming a complex with Atoh1 where Gfi1 does not itself bind DNA (Jen et al., 2022). A study from the Jarman lab (unpublished but on BioRxiv) also shows that Gfi1 is critical for the expression of hair cell genes when combined with Atoh1 and Pou4f3. Finally, we and our collaborators have also shown that viral over-expression of Gfi1 enhances the hair cell reprogramming ability of Atoh1 in vivo (Lee et al., 2020). This is why we chose to include Gfi1 in our series of reprogramming mice rather than simply test Atoh1 and Pou4f3 together.</p><p>Although we expected Gfi1 to enhance the activity of Atoh1 alone, we point out that our reprogramming experiments were only analyzed after one week. It is possible that at longer times we would see additional hair cell genes up-regulated in the Gfi1+Atoh1 condition compared to Atoh1 alone. Indeed our previous study (Lee et al., 2020) demonstrated Gfi1 enhances Atoh1 activity when both factors are over-expressed using adenovirus in deafened adult mice after 4 or 8 weeks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this manuscript, Iyer et al., investigated the effect of combining two transcription factors of promoting the reprogramming potential of Atoh1 in newborn mice and older mice.

However, besides showing uptake of FM1-43 in reprogrammed hair cells in neonatal mice, no functional characterization of reprogrammed hair cells in P8-P15 mice. It is possible that not only do older mice have less epigenetic accessibility in supporting cells and GER cells, but the reprogrammed hair cells in older mice might also have limited functionality. This needs to be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have now repeated these experiments in P8-P15 mice and have shown that the reprogrammed hair cells can indeed take up FM1-43. These data are now included as Figure 5 – Supplementary Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along the line, while P8 reprogrammed hair cells show robust enrichment in genes related to sensory perception of sound (Figure 3E), it is the cell projection in P15 reprogrammed hair cells (Figure 6E). Moreover, the changes in transduction channel protein expression in neonatal, P8, and P15 reprogrammed hair cell gene sets should be analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now analyzed our scRNA-seq data at both P8 and P15 time points and have analyzed expression of components of the mechanotransduction apparatus in the reprogrammed cells: the two putative channels TMC1 and 2, their accessory transmembrane proteins TMIE and LHFPL5/TMHS and the two components of the tip links, CDH23 and PCDH15. We find that TMC1, TMIE, LHFPL5, CDH23 and PCDH15 can all be detected in P8 reprogrammed cells compared to their unreprogrammed counterparts. At P15, we see less expression of the channel components, consistent with the more immature morphology of the reprogrammed hair cells at this age and the lower amount of FM1-43 labeling. These violin plots are now included as Figure 6 – Supplementary Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, it will be a plus to characterize the electrophysiological properties of these reprogrammed hair cells at different stages.</p></disp-quote><p>Our lab does not have electrophysiology expertise and so we have not been able to perform these experiments. We hope, however, that our FM1-43 labeling and scRNA-seq data go some way to demonstrating rudimentary mechanotransduction properties of the new hair cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors' comment that using Rosa26 as a promoter helps the genetic design to circumvent the issue of multiple copy numbers of the transgene is factually incorrect. However, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has a caveat of having a high chance of random insertion(s) and/or deletion(s) of the transgene and the native genome. Since the authors did not directly assess the copy number of the transgene, they should avoid this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>It is well-established that knock-in mice created by homologous recombination to a defined genomic location have fewer copy numbers (i.e. one copy) than mice generated by transgenesis. Nevertheless, we should have made more clear that we were not generating transgenic mice using the ROSA26 promoter in this study – we targeted the endogenous ROSA26 locus by homologous recombination. Moreover, we maintained our targeted mouse lines in the homozygous state by genotyping for the presence of the modified ROSA26 allele and the absence of the wild type ROSA26 allele. This suggests our targeting is specific to the ROSA26 locus. While it is formally possible that an extra intact copy of the targeting vector integrated elsewhere in the mouse genome, the out-crossing required to expand each founder line would tend to eliminate such modified alleles when selecting for a targeted ROSA modification at the endogenous ROSA locus on chromosome 6.</p></body></sub-article></article>
