infection. We have previously shown that these populations are replenished from naive precursors at high levels throughout life (Gossel et al., 2017). However, the nature, relative importance and timing of the forces generating these cells remain unclear. Here, we tracked the generation of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets in mice housed in facilities differing in their ‘dirtiness’. We found evidence for sequential naive to central memory to effector memory development, and confirmed that both memory subsets are heterogeneous in their rates of turnover. We also inferred that early exposure to self and environmental antigens establishes persistent memory populations at levels determined largely, although not exclusively, by the dirtiness of the environment. After the first few weeks of life, however, these populations are continuously supplemented by new memory cells at rates that are independent of environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T cell</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>microbiome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI093870</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hogan</surname><given-names>Thea</given-names></name><name><surname>Nowicka</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name><name><surname>Cownden</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name><name><surname>Yates</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P011225/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seddon</surname><given-names>Benedict</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Comparing mice in clean and dirty environments reveals that environment drives initial establishment and size of T cell memory compartments, but not their maintenance in adults.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Conventional memory T cells are defined as lymphocytes which respond rapidly to previously encountered epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gourley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kaech and Wherry, 2007</xref>). In mice, memory T cells exhibit considerable heterogeneity in their function, circulation patterns, response to re-challenge, and capacities for proliferative self-renewal and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Farber, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kaech and Wherry, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jameson and Masopust, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gossel et al., 2017</xref>). This phenotypic heterogeneity is reflected in differential expression of various cell-surface molecules. In uninfected naive mice, there are at least two distinct populations of recirculating cells distinguished by their expression of the lymph node homing receptor L-selectin (CD62L); CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD62L<sup>−</sup> effector memory (T<sub>EM</sub>) and CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD62L<sup>+</sup> central memory (T<sub>CM</sub>) cells. During immune responses to active infection, there is an even more complex mix of effector and memory intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jameson and Masopust, 2018</xref>).</p><p>While it is clear that memory to infection resides amongst these CD44<sup>hi</sup> subsets, it is also evident that they are generated in naive mice in the absence of overt infection. The functional significance of these memory-phenotype (MP) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is not fully understood, but there is evidence they can augment primary immune responses. They can facilitate rapid production of IFN-<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> during the early inflammatory phase of the immune response to <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infection and enhance T<sub>H</sub>1-type CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses later in infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kawabe et al., 2017</xref>). There is also evidence that MP cells are capable of making rapid cross-reactive responses during primary infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Min and Paul, 2005</xref>). Given that MP cells represent the majority of the memory compartment in specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kawabe et al., 2017</xref>), a better understanding of how these cells are generated and maintained is crucial for better understanding their function and impact upon conventional memory to defined challenges.</p><p>The precise nature of the forces driving the generation of MP cells remains unclear. Their development appears to require a TCR-mediated activation event; Cd28<sup>−/−</sup> mice have greatly reduced numbers of MP cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kotani et al., 2006</xref>), and mice lacking canonical NF-<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>κ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>B signalling, an obligate pathway in T cell activation, are completely devoid of such cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Webb et al., 2019</xref>). Whether the TCR stimuli derive from self or foreign recognition events is unknown. MP cell generation may reflect a stochastic process in which CD4<sup>+</sup> naive T cells occasionally encounter homeostatic stimuli that are above an activation threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sprent and Surh, 2011</xref>), and indeed MP cells are generated not only in lymphopenia but also constitutively under replete conditions throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gossel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kawabe et al., 2017</xref>). There is a positive correlation between the affinity of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to self-antigens and the potential for differentiating into MP cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kawabe et al., 2017</xref>), although self-reactivity is also positively correlated to reactivity to foreign antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mandl et al., 2013</xref>). Stronger evidence supporting an autoreactive stimulus comes from the failure of broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent conversion of naive T cells to MP cells following adoptive transfer in vivo, and the observation that mice raised in germ-free conditions contain similar numbers of MP cells as those in SPF conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kawabe et al., 2017</xref>). However, there is also a role for foreign environmental antigen in generating T cell memory compartments, since mice raised in more antigenically diverse environments, but still in the absence of overt infection, exhibit larger peripheral memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell pools than SPF mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beura et al., 2016</xref>). When exactly such environmental stimuli impact upon memory compartment development, or how foreign and self reactivity combine to form the memory compartments, is unknown.</p><p>The differentiation pathways of these MP cells are also poorly understood. They may derive either directly from naive T cells or through interconversion of other memory phenotypes. Amongst CD8<sup>+</sup> lineage cells, there is evidence that some MP subpopulations are generated in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). In the case of CD4<sup>+</sup> lineage cells, it has been suggested that MP cells derive from peripheral naive phenotype cells in a thymus-independent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kawabe et al., 2017</xref>). While both CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>CM</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub> are produced constitutively in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gossel et al., 2017</xref>), it remains unclear how their differentiation patterns relate to those of classically antigen-stimulated naive T cells.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to characterise the development and maintenance of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets in adult mice to identify the nature and timing of the signals driving these dynamics in the absence of overt infection. To do this, we quantified the homeostasis and ontogeny of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in identical strains of mice raised in two different animal facilities with distinct caging environments; those housed in individually ventilated cages (IVCs) and fed irradiated water, and those fed untreated tap water and housed in open cages, who might consequently be exposed to a greater variety of environmental antigens. We made use of an established temporal fate-mapping model in both cohorts, which allowed us to track the development of T cells under replete conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hogan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gossel et al., 2017</xref>). We also used data from germ-free (GF) mice to dissect further the relative contributions of self and environmental antigens to the generation and maintenance of MP cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Modelling the ontogeny and homeostasis of CD4<sup>+</sup> MP T cell subsets</title><p>We employed a system described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hogan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gossel et al., 2017</xref>) to examine the flow of cells into memory subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Briefly, CD45.1<sup>+</sup> C57Bl6/SJL host mice of various ages were treated with optimised doses of the transplant conditioning drug busulfan to selectively deplete haematopoeitic stem cells (HSC). The HSC compartment was then reconstituted by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with congenically labelled bone marrow from CD45.2<sup>+</sup> C57Bl6/J donors. The progeny of donor HSC were then followed as they developed in the thymus and percolated into the peripheral T cell pools, initially replete with host-derived cells. Total numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> naive T cells and T<sub>CM</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub> cells in these busulfan chimeric mice were normal, in comparison to untreated wild-type (WT) controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming that the busulfan treatment regime left peripheral compartments intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hogan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gossel et al., 2017</xref>).

At the MRC National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), mice were held in open cages and fed untreated tap water, while mice held at the UCL Comparative Biology Unit (UCL) were maintained in individually ventilated cages (IVCs) and fed irradiated water. Henceforth, we refer to UCL sourced mice as ‘clean’ and NIMR sourced mice as ‘dirty’, in reference to the presumed difference in health status of the mice. We use these terms for clarity, but emphasise that they are relative; mice co-housed with pet-store or feral mice would be expected to be substantially ‘dirtier’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beura et al., 2016</xref>), and those in turn are cleaner than truly feral mice. In both environments, the same C57Bl6/SJL strain was analysed by the same researcher and cells were enumerated using the same single CASY counter. From age 10 weeks onwards, the numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> naive T cells in mice from clean and dirty environments were broadly similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left panel). The total sizes (host+donor) of all circulating memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets remained relatively stable over the time frame of analysis, but were significantly larger in dirty mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right panels) at age 10 weeks. Following BMT, donor-derived memory T cells accumulated in similar numbers in the two environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, these two observations result in a lower proportional replacement of pre-existing memory cells with donor memory cells in dirty mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To quantify the cellular processes underlying these kinetics, we first considered a simple mechanistic explanation shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. In this ‘homogeneous’ model, each memory population (CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>CM</sub> or T<sub>EM</sub>) is fed at a constant <italic>per capita</italic> rate from a precursor population (source). We refer to this rate as the force of recruitment, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. The total cellular flux into a memory subset per day is then <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> multiplied by the size of the source population, which in principle could be CD4<sup>+</sup> naive T cells, or the complementary memory subset.

(<bold>D</bold>) The resistant memory model invokes a subpopulation of ‘incumbent’ memory cells which are presumed to be established early in life, stable in numbers, and not replenished from the source population. As in the homogeneous model, the source feeds a compartment of 'displaceable’ cells, with net loss rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48901-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We also considered a ‘two phase’ model of memory dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which was motivated by three observations. First, newly generated donor CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>CM</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub> in busulfan chimeras express Ki67, a marker of recent cell division, at higher levels than their established host-derived counterparts for some time after BMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gossel et al., 2017</xref>), although these levels eventually converge (data not shown). These observations suggest that memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations become less proliferative, on average, with time since entry into the compartment. Second, we previously found evidence, using BrdU labelling in WT mice, that both CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> and T<sub>CM</sub> appear to be kinetically heterogeneous, comprising at least two subpopulations turning over and dividing at different rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gossel et al., 2017</xref>). Third, and consistent with this picture, the increases in donor chimerism that we observed in both T<sub>CM</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub> with time post-BMT were suggestive of a biphasic kinetic, with a relatively rapid accumulation of donor cells followed by a slower increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As shown in Materials and methods, the rate of accumulation of new memory cells is dictated by both the dynamics of influx and the net loss rate of existing memory, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. Therefore, all three observations are consistent with a mechanism in which cells newly recruited into memory comprise a subpopulation that both divides rapidly and has a high net loss rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf27"><mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mtext>fast</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. These cells then transition to a more quiescent state that divides more slowly and also has a lower net loss rate, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mtext>slow</mml:mtext></mml:msub><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mtext>fast</mml:mtext></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The transient differences in Ki67 expression in donor and host memory cells could then be explained by an enrichment for ‘new’ memory (donor cells) in the fast phase in the weeks immediately following BMT, and not by any intrinsic differences in the behaviour of donor and host cells. Further, this transient difference in Ki67 expression implies a linear flow from fast to slow, rather than a branched process of establishment of the two populations separately; in the latter case, we would expect no differences in Ki67 expression between host and donor cells at any time, provided Ki67 expression within each subset derives entirely from self-renewal and is not inherited from the precursor population.</p><p>While the two-phase model is perhaps a minimal description of these observations, it seems plausible that any transition from active to quiescent memory might be more continuous. We previously found evidence for smooth changes in the rates of division and/or loss of naive T cells with their post-thymic age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rane et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore also considered a model in which the net loss rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf29"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> of a cohort of cells changes continuously with the time since their common ancestor entered memory, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf30"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (the ‘age-dependent loss model’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

These ‘incumbent' or 'resistant memory’ populations, assumed to be stable in numbers and entirely host-derived (that is, established before 5 weeks of age, the earliest age at BMT in this study), could naturally explain the limited donor chimerism within memory subsets and, if they are less dynamic than memory generated later in life, might also be able to explain host/donor differences in Ki67 expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The kinetics of accumulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> MP cells are consistent with a naive <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf34"><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> T<sub>CM</sub> <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf35"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> T<sub>EM</sub> pathway, and both memory subsets are heterogeneous in their turnover</title><p>We compared the abilities of the four mechanisms to describe the replacement kinetics of memory subsets in the dirty and clean environments.

However, the two models gave visually very similar descriptions of each dataset (not shown).

Therefore, we remain somewhat equivocal regarding the true nature of heterogeneity in each, and present parameter estimates below for both models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

We find evidence for both processes here. We show in Materials and methods that if influx declines faster than the average rate of turnover, a population will be unable to reach the same level of chimerism as its precursor – in effect, the flow from the source ‘dries up’ more quickly than the memory cells can be replaced by immigrants. We see signs of this effect; due to thymic involution, CD4<sup>+</sup> naive T cell numbers decay exponentially in both clean and dirty adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) with population half lives of 228 days (95% CI 227–231 days) and 143 (142-144) days, respectively.

In addition, both the two-phase and age-dependent models indicate that older memory clones have a fitness advantage over newer ones. Therefore, the limited replacement of host CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>CM</sub> by donor cells derives from the decline in naive T cell numbers with age, slow average rates of turnover, and the increased persistence of more established memory cells. This slow rate of accumulation of new T<sub>CM</sub> in turn acts to limit the chimerism observed in T<sub>EM</sub>, which are also lost slowly.</p><p>One can also quantify the fates of populations after entering memory, although here our insights are more model-dependent. The two-phase model predicts that the establishment of memory is relatively inefficient, with ‘fast’ populations lost over timescales of days and only a small proportion of these surviving to become more persistent ‘slow’ memory (∼2–10% of T<sub>EM</sub>, and ∼3–5% of T<sub>CM</sub>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

In contrast, the age-dependent loss model makes lower estimates of the force of recruitment into memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, left panels) but predicts more efficient establishment, with newly generated memory having clonal half-lives of 20–40 days and a much greater proportion persisting longer term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Larger memory populations in dirty mice derive from early antigen exposure</title><p>Given the similarity of the rates of generation of memory in clean and dirty adult mice, and of their rates of turnover, we infer that the larger, relatively stable T<sub>CM</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub> populations in dirty mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) must derive from their establishment in greater numbers in the first few weeks of life.

However, earlier studies reported that numbers of memory cells in the spleens of SPF and germ-free (GF) mice are similar and argue that self-recognition is therefore the sole driver of MP cell generation in early life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kawabe et al., 2017</xref>).

In addition to the clean (UCL) and dirty (NIMR) mice analysed above, we enumerated cells from GF and SPF mice obtained from the Kennedy Institute (KI) in Oxford. Consistent with these earlier studies, substantial numbers of both T<sub>CM</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub> MP cells were recovered from GF mice aged between 40 and 200d, confirming that the generation of MP cells does not depend exclusively on commensal-derived foreign antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, the memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell compartments of GF mice, enumerated from spleen and lymph nodes combined, were significantly smaller than in the SPF mice in all facilities.

CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>CM</sub> numbers were relatively stable in all facilities during this period. GF mice needed approximately 0.4 times the force of recruitment in clean adult mice, younger clean mice needed a force approximately 1.1 times greater, and dirty mice required a 2.7-fold increase.

Remarkably, after accounting for the different T<sub>CM</sub> population sizes, the force of recruitment from T<sub>CM</sub> to T<sub>EM</sub> estimated in clean adult mice was also sufficient to account for T<sub>EM</sub> numbers in all three environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, right panel).</p><p>In summary, this analysis showed that approximately 2- to 3-fold increases or decreases in the force of recruitment into CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>CM</sub> observed in clean adult (UCL) mice were sufficient to explain their numbers in dirty mice from NIMR or GF mice. However the subsequent rate of development of T<sub>EM</sub> from T<sub>CM</sub> appeared to be independent of both mouse age and environment, and differences in the numbers of T<sub>EM</sub> could be explained simply by the differences in the size of the T<sub>CM</sub> precursor population. These results suggest that the rate of generation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>CM</sub> from naive T cells in young mice reflects both self antigens and the level of exposure to environmental antigens, but that the rate of differentiation from T<sub>CM</sub> to T<sub>EM</sub> is largely insensitive to these forces.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we compared mice housed in facilities with distinct antigenic burdens to investigate the nature, magnitude and timing of the forces that establish and maintain CD4<sup>+</sup> MP T cell compartments. We examined (i) tonic recruitment into the T<sub>CM</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub> pools in adults, (ii) the kinetic substructure and maintenance of these compartments throughout life, and (iii) their generation/establishment early in life. Our analyses indicate that self recognition contributes to all these processes, but that the contribution of reactivity to commensal antigens is largely restricted to the neonatal period.</p><p>Our analysis of GF mice, which lack exposure to commensal organisms, confirmed earlier work showing that generation of MP cells in adults is not driven exclusively by foreign commensals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kawabe et al., 2017</xref>) and suggesting that self-recognition is instead the key driver. GF mice are not entirely free of environmental antigens and it is possible that proteins in bedding material and diet could represent foreign antigenic stimuli. However, the argument for self-recognition is made through the correlation of the degree of MP cell conversion and steady state proliferation with affinity for self-MHC, as indicated by CD5 expression. We also found that memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell division, as reported by Ki67, was substantial and largely independent of the level of commensals. We could not determine the extents to which Ki67 expression derived from the homeostatic proliferation of existing cells or the influx of newly generated (and recently divided) MP cells. However, the common levels of Ki67 across environments, together with our findings from the adult clean and dirty chimeric mice that the rates of memory generation and net loss were insensitive to environment, support our conclusion that self-recognition is the major driver of both recruitment and proliferative renewal in adult memory compartments.</p><p>Commensals did, however, have a substantial impact upon the sizes of the memory compartments generated early in life. CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>CM</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub> numbers in mice raised in dirty environments were 3–5 times greater than those in either GF or cleaner IVC or SPF facilities, and these differences could be explained by differences in the forces of recruitment of CD4<sup><sub>+</sub></sup> T<sub>CM</sub> during ontogeny. The estimated seven-fold difference in this force between GF and dirty mice prompts the simple interpretation that self-recognition only accounts for ∼14% of the memory compartment in dirty mice.</p><p>We ascribe differences in memory compartment sizes to different commensal burdens, but it is possible that their smaller sizes in GF mice also derive from their smaller lymph nodes. Bacterial stimulation of DCs is required for their migration into lymph nodes, and these DCs are required for their normal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wendland et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Moussion and Girard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is not straightforward to separate the indirect influence of commensals on lymphoid development from any direct influences upon memory generation. It is also possible that some of the additional force of recruitment in neonates derives not from commensals but from lymphopenia, which can drive naive T cells to acquire a memory phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Min et al., 2003</xref>). However, this process was demonstrated by transferring naive cells from adults into very young mice; it is possible that such naive cells do not represent the activity of neonatal naive T cells, which are almost exclusively recent thymic emigrants.</p><p>We observed that environment not only impacted memory but also naive T cells. Their numbers naturally decline with age, but this decline was almost twice as fast in dirty mice than in genetically identical mice housed in cleaner facilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>; numbers halve every 228d (95% CI 227–231) in clean mice, and 143d (142-144) in dirty mice). This difference likely derives from a more rapid reduction in thymic output with age in the dirty environment, and not differences in lifespans of CD4<sup>+</sup> naive T cells in the two environments, because we see similar rates of decline in the numbers of single positive thymocytes at the latest stage of thymic development (halving every every 282d (281-308) in clean mice, 151d (150-159) in dirty mice; data not shown). Therefore, it appears that another consequence of life in a more antigenically diverse environment is more rapid involution of the thymus. It is possible that this effect derives from the stress or inflammation associated with an increased commensal burden, or is somehow a consequence of expanded memory populations; but whatever the mechanism, our data clearly indicate that environmental factors can impact the maintenance of naive T cells.</p><p>Our models do not incorporate any homeostatic regulation in the sense of modulation of rates of division or loss through quorum sensing. Since memory cell numbers only vary by a factor of 2–3 between clean and dirty mice, we did not expect to detect any strong variation in net loss rate with pool size with these data, and indeed our estimates of loss rates were similar in the two environments. While we cannot rule it out at higher cell densities, there is arguably little evidence for homeostatic regulation of circulating memory T cells in SPF mice. We observed a range of relatively stable memory compartment sizes in the different containment facilities; these memory compartments do not appear to fill up rapidly with large clones in very young mice, which might occur if division or loss rates are sensitive to total pool size; and they appear to be expandable following multiple infections in older animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Vezys et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The models yielded robust conclusions regarding the nature and magnitudes of the forces generating CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>CM</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub>, and the existence of heterogeneity within both subsets, consistent with previous reports by ourselves and others of subpopulations of CD4<sup>+</sup> MP cells with distinct rates of division and turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Younes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gossel et al., 2017</xref>). However, these models are abstractions, and resolving the details of kinetic substructure in lymphocyte populations is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ganusov et al., 2010</xref>). For CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>CM</sub> in adult mice we found evidence for slow and continuous changes in their net loss rates as cells age, and additional support for such a process comes from the slow rate at which Ki67 levels in donor and host memory cells converge in adult busulfan chimeras. In contrast, the data for T<sub>EM </sub>in adult mice, and the predictions of their accumulation in younger mice, more strongly supported a discrete two-phase model with a relatively rapid transition from fast to slow memory. Our previous study of CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>CM</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub> homeostasis in adult mice used short-term BrdU labelling to identify populations in both subsets that divide and die rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gossel et al., 2017</xref>), although in that study we assumed the proliferative and more quiescent pools were maintained independently and so it is not straightforward to compare the rate estimates with those presented here. Overall, although, it seems likely that both MP cell subsets are more heterogeneous than any one of our models suggests. Indeed, there are other potential sources of heterogeneity. One possibility is that MP T cells are generated with a distribution of net loss rates, and those clones with greater intrinsic fitness (lower net loss rates) are simply selected for over time. Such a mechanism – a generalisation of the simple ‘resistant memory’ model we rejected here – could explain the under-representation of donor cells in the memory compartments of busulfan chimeric mice, and may be difficult to distinguish from our model of gradual changes in fitness with cell age; indeed the two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. Characterising the homeostatic dynamics of CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells, and ultimately how these dynamics relate to their functional capacity, requires further study.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generating busulfan chimeric mice</title><p>Mice were treated with optimised low doses of busulfan to deplete HSC but leave peripheral T cell subsets intact.

They aim to understand the main driver of the establishment of memory population in the absence of infections. This is an important and insightful paper that perfectly fits the scope of <italic>eLife</italic>. It is highly original work, very clearly written, and reports important insights into the relative roles of antigens coming from commensals, self-antigens and pathogens in the establishment and maintenance of the memory T-cell pool throughout life (of a mouse). It is also a very timely paper given the recent discussions in the immunological field on the role of exposure to &quot;dirt&quot;. The main finding is that after an early period where commensal / environmental antigens are important in driving memory, after a few weeks continuous replenishment of new memory has similar dynamics independent of the environment where the mice are housed. The paper is well-written and clear.</p><p>The reviewers were particularly impressed with the novel insights into the maintenance and formation of CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells in mice housed under various conditions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main question is regarding the modeling approach. We appreciate that the authors have tested three different models and chosen the best one. But all the models are linear, and so to achieve the balance observed between source, fast and slow cells requires fine tuning of the dynamical parameters. The question is whether it would make more biological sense to have some kind of feedback or density-dependent mechanism. Although we don't think you have to &quot;invent a more complex model&quot; when the simpler one works well, this could at least be a point of discussion.</p><p>2) Another question is that the authors model central and effector memory cells independently. Could these two cell populations be coupled, for example, through interconversion? How would this affect the modeling approach? And more importantly, could it affect the conclusions?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48901.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main question is regarding the modeling approach.

We considered it but concluded that a treatment of feedback regulation of cell numbers will not be informative here, for three reasons;</p><p>1) The memory cell numbers we observe from age 10 weeks onwards only vary by factor of 2 or 3; the average pool sizes in clean and dirty mice differ by a similar factor (Figure 1B); and we don’t find significant differences in the average net loss rates of each subset in the two environments (Figure 4B and Table 2). Without larger perturbations to cell numbers, then, we do not expect to be able to identify any density dependence of the net loss rates with our data. For the two-compartment model, we are also already at the limit of the number of parameters we are comfortable attempting to estimate.</p><p>2) None of the models require fine-tuning to achieve stability. Numbers are simply the balance of slowly declining influx from the naive pool (constant force of recruitment * naive numbers, which decline naturally); and first order decay from one or more sequential compartments. So in these models all memory (sub)compartments can achieve a stable steady state without feedback regulation.</p><p>3) Arguably there is little experimental evidence for homeostatic regulation of memory numbers, at least in SPF mice — we see three levels of stable memory in the three facilities, memory pools appears not to fill up rapidly with large clones in very young mice; and memory cell numbers are expandable following multiple infections in older animals (Vezys, Yates et al. Nature 2009).</p><p>We have added a discussion of these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another question is that the authors model central and effector memory cells independently. Could these two cell populations be coupled, for example, through interconversion? How would this affect the modeling approach? And more importantly, could it affect the conclusions?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to other comments we revisited the data with some alternative models (thank you for suggesting this) and in the process improved our descriptor functions for the sources and our strategy for parameter estimation; detailed in Materials and methods. As a result we now clearly favour a naive – CM – EM pathway.</p><p>We reached this conclusion by fitting naive -&gt; CM and CM -&gt; EM separately. We were not able to fit all three simultaneously – the number of parameters was too large, and given that we find heterogeneity within both pools there is some uncertainty in how to connect the two models. Even with a constant rate of conversion, solving two coupled models where survival changes continuously with cell age is technically beyond us. Also – since there may be an expansion factor between CM and EM, the two are only coupled weakly as regards fitting.</p><p>We did model a Naive-EM-CM pathway but the fits are extremely poor (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Indeed we argue that such a pathway is inconsistent with the timecourses of chimerism in the two pools. So we choose not to include these fits.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Best fit model in which CM cells are fed exclusively by EM cells.</title><p>The model underestimates the accumulation of CM donor chimerism, as it is constrained by the lower chimerism of the upstream EM cells.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48901-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
