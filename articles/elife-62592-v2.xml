This study provides insight into both hallmarks by uncovering a novel link between AR and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Specifically, we identify 6-phosphogluoconate dehydrogenase (<italic>6PGD</italic>) as an androgen-regulated gene that is upregulated in prostate cancer. AR increased the expression of <italic>6PGD</italic> indirectly via activation of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1). Accordingly, loss of 6PGD, AR or SREBP1 resulted in suppression of PPP activity as revealed by 1,2-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub> glucose metabolic flux analysis. Knockdown of 6PGD also impaired growth and elicited death of prostate cancer cells, at least in part due to increased oxidative stress. We investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting 6PGD using two specific inhibitors, physcion and S3, and observed substantial anti-cancer activity in multiple models of prostate cancer, including aggressive, therapy-resistant models of castration-resistant disease as well as prospectively collected patient-derived tumour explants. Targeting of 6PGD was associated with two important tumour-suppressive mechanisms: first, increased activity of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which repressed anabolic growth-promoting pathways regulated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1); and second, enhanced AR ubiquitylation, associated with a reduction in AR protein levels and activity. Supporting the biological relevance of positive feedback between AR and 6PGD, pharmacological co-targeting of both factors was more effective in suppressing the growth of prostate cancer cells than single-agent therapies. Collectively, this work provides new insight into the dysregulated metabolism of prostate cancer and provides impetus for further investigation of co-targeting AR and the PPP as a novel therapeutic strategy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pentose phosphate pathway</kwd><kwd>prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>androgen receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001111</institution-id><institution>Cancer Australia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1138766</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Centenera</surname><given-names>Margaret M</given-names></name><name><surname>Mills</surname><given-names>Ian G</given-names></name><name><surname>Lynn</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name><name><surname>Butler</surname><given-names>Lisa M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008719</institution-id><institution>Movember Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRTA3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoy</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name><name><surname>Centenera</surname><given-names>Margaret M</given-names></name><name><surname>Selth</surname><given-names>Luke A</given-names></name><name><surname>Butler</surname><given-names>Lisa M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000927</institution-id><institution>Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRTA3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoy</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name><name><surname>Centenera</surname><given-names>Margaret M</given-names></name><name><surname>Selth</surname><given-names>Luke A</given-names></name><name><surname>Butler</surname><given-names>Lisa M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000950</institution-id><institution>Cancer Council South Australia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Principal Cancer Research Fellowships</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Selth</surname><given-names>Luke A</given-names></name><name><surname>Butler</surname><given-names>Lisa M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A positive feedback loop between the androgen receptor and a key pentose phosphate pathway enzyme, 6PGD, in prostate cancer promotes tumour cell proliferation, survival and intracellular redox control.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Altered cellular metabolism is a hallmark of cancer. Perhaps the best characterised metabolic transformation in malignant cells is the so-called Warburg effect, in which cancer cells favour metabolism via glycolysis rather than the more efficient oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>). While Warburg-like metabolism plays a key role in many malignancies, more recent work has demonstrated the diversity of cancer metabolism and revealed that tissue of origin is likely to be the critical determinant of malignant metabolic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bader and McGuire, 2020</xref>). One tissue that exhibits a unique metabolic profile is the prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). Normal prostate epithelial cells exhibit a truncated tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to enable production of citrate, a key component of prostatic fluid, resulting in high rates of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bader and McGuire, 2020</xref>). By contrast, malignant transformation switches metabolism of prostate cells to a more energetically favourable phenotype by re-establishing an intact TCA cycle, whereby citrate is utilised for oxidative phosphorylation and biosynthetic processes such as lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flavin et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A major regulator of the unique metabolism of the normal and malignant prostate is the androgen receptor (AR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butler et al., 2016</xref>). AR is a hormone (androgen)-activated transcription factor that regulates expression of a large suite of genes involved in various aspects of metabolism, either directly or indirectly through activation of other master regulators such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gonthier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heemers et al., 2003</xref>). Given its integral metabolic functions, it is unsurprising that AR is the primary oncogenic driver of prostate cancer (PCa) and the major therapeutic target in advanced and metastatic disease. While suppression of AR activity by androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) is initially effective in almost all men, prostate tumours inevitably develop resistance and progress to a lethal disease state known as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). One key feature of CRPC is the maintenance or reactivation of the AR signalling axis, as revealed by the therapeutic benefit of second-generation ARPIs, such as the AR antagonist enzalutamide, in CRPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beer et al., 2014</xref>). Unfortunately, the overall survival benefits of these newer ARPIs in men with CRPC are in the order of months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Recine and Sternberg, 2015</xref>), despite many tumours retaining dependence on AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>). Collectively, these clinical observations highlight the ongoing dependence of CRPC on AR signalling and the intractable problems associated with therapies that inhibit this pathway.</p><p>Direct alterations to AR – including mutation, amplification, alternative splicing, and altered ligand availability – have been well characterised as mechanisms of resistance in CRPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coutinho et al., 2016</xref>). However, the extent to which AR-mediated metabolic reprogramming is involved in therapy resistance in CRPC is less well understood. Herein, using an unbiased approach to discover potential PCa survival factors, we identify 6-phosphogluoconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) as a novel AR-regulated factor. 6PGD is a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (also referred to as the phosphogluconate pathway or the hexose monophosphate shunt), an alternative metabolic pathway for glucose breakdown. The PPP comprises two phases: an irreversible oxidative phase that generates NADPH and ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P); and a subsequent reversible non-oxidative phase in which Ru5P is converted to ribose 5-phosphate (R5P), a sugar precursor for generation of nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jin and Zhou, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ge et al., 2020</xref>). NADPH produced by the PPP is used for many anabolic reactions, including fatty acid synthesis, as well as an electron donor to generate reduced glutathione, the major endogenous antioxidant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ge et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the PPP is a major regulator of both redox homeostasis as well as anabolic reactions, depending on cellular requirements. We demonstrate that 6PGD plays a key role in PCa growth and survival, at least in part through moderating oxidative stress, and uncover a novel feedback mechanism linking 6PGD and the AR signalling axis that provides impetus for further investigation of co-targeting AR and the PPP as a novel therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>6PGD</italic> is an androgen-regulated gene in PCa</title><p>The current clinical ARPIs, such as enzalutamide, do not target the entire repertoire of genes regulated by the AR in prostate tumour cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asangani et al., 2014</xref>). We hypothesised that ablation of AR expression would be the most appropriate ‘therapeutic benchmark’ to identify the key regulators of tumour cell survival regulated by AR. To qualitatively and quantitatively compare downstream responses to AR ablation and AR antagonism, LNCaP cells were treated with AR siRNA (siAR; i.e. AR ablation) or enzalutamide (Enz; AR antagonism) and subsequently evaluated by RNA-seq. The experimental conditions were optimised to achieve comparable suppression of the canonical AR target, prostate specific antigen (PSA), which is encoded by the <italic>KLK3</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Genes affected by siAR were highly concordant with an independent dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">He et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As expected, most (78%) genes altered by enzalutamide (compared to vehicle control) were also similarly dysregulated by siAR (compared to a control siRNA [siCon]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). An additional 2574 genes were altered in their expression by siAR but not enzalutamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; q &lt; 0.05). On closer examination, many of these genes were altered in their expression by enzalutamide but not sufficiently for them to be identified as statistically significant differentially expressed genes. A further direct statistical comparison of gene expression between the two treatment groups identified that there were 581 genes that were differentially expressed in the siAR-treated cells compared to those treated with enzalutamide including, as expected, <italic>AR</italic> itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>; q &lt; 0.05). These results provide further evidence for the hypothesis that AR ablation is more effective at suppressing the AR-regulated transcriptome compared with AR antagonism, at least in this experimental system.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>6PGD</italic> is an androgen receptor (AR)-regulated gene and is elevated in prostate cancer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Effect of siAR and enzalutamide (Enz) on the AR target, PSA.

One credible intermediary between AR and 6PGD is SREBP1, a master transcriptional regulator of genes involved in lipid and cholesterol production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heemers et al., 2006</xref>). AR enhances SREBP1 expression and activity in a multifaceted manner, most notably by upregulating the SREBP1 activator SCAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heemers et al., 2006</xref>) and by activating the mTOR pathway, which in turn leads to elevated SREBP1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duvel et al., 2010</xref>).

Treatment of LNCaP cells with physcion dose-dependently inhibited growth and elicited death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). However, low solubility limits the preclinical and clinical utility of this compound.

Similarly to physcion, S3 reduced LNCaP cell viability and caused cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Cell kill was at least partly mediated via apoptosis, as demonstrated by a flow cytometric-based Annexin/7-AAD assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

More importantly, we recapitulated the impact of S3 on mTOR signalling in our tumour PDE system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Collectively, these results reveal that PPP is an upstream regulator of AMPK, ACC1, and mTOR in PCa; therefore, targeting 6PGD could impede multiple cancer-promoting metabolic pathways.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Targeting 6PGD activates AMPK and represses ACC1 and mTOR pathways.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing key metabolic pathways downstream of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).

This observation suggested that targeting 6PGD would inhibit the AR signalling axis. We validated this hypothesis by demonstrating that S3 and physcion dose-dependently reduced the expression of AR and its target genes in multiple cell line models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>) and, importantly, in our clinical PDE tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

In the presence of MG132, accumulation of ubiquitylated AR as well as the total cellular ubiquitylated protein pool was evident in S3-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Moreover, in the presence of MG132, S3 did not reduce total AR protein levels beyond that caused by MG132 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

In support of this hypothesis, enzalutamide and S3 exhibited an additive effect in androgen-sensitive (VCaP) and CRPC (V16D) cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>).

More recently, altered glucose metabolism has emerged as another feature of this common malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we identified <italic>6PGD</italic> as an AR-regulated gene that may not be effectively suppressed in tumour cells by current ARPIs such as Enz. 6PGD is the third enzyme in a critically important glucose metabolic pathway, the PPP. Our data reveal that a positive feedback loop between AR and 6PGD enhances growth and survival of tumour cells. This work not only expands our knowledge of the interplay between hormones and glucose metabolism in PCa but also exposes a new therapeutic vulnerability.</p><p>Our identification of 6PGD as an androgen-regulated PPP enzyme lends further support to this pathway being a key metabolic target of androgens in PCa. Frigo and colleagues recently demonstrated that G6PD, the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway, is also transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally regulated by AR signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsouko et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, an enzyme that regulates the non-oxidative phase of the PPP, transketolase-like protein 1 (TKTL1), increases in expression during PCa progression, being highest in metastatic tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">da Costa et al., 2018</xref>). Such multi-level control of a single pathway emphasises the relevance of increased PPP flux in PCa. It is notable that the androgen-regulated enzymes of this pathway, 6PGD and G6PD, both catalyse steps in the NADPH-generating oxidative phase of the PPP; this represents another mechanism underlying hormonal protection against oxidative stress in the prostate.</p><p>Despite its role as a key downstream effector of androgen-regulated cellular metabolism, our data do not support a direct mode of transcriptional regulation of <italic>6PGD</italic> by AR. Rather, AR harnesses another key metabolic transcription factor, SREBP1, to drive expression of 6PGD and hence activity of the PPP. SREBP1, a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis and homeostasis that is activated and upregulated by AR signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heemers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duvel et al., 2010</xref>), is itself a therapeutic target in PCa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Galbraith et al., 2018</xref>). Some metabolic genes appear to be directly co-regulated by AR and SREBP1 based on the binding of both factors to cis-regulatory elements (e.g. <italic>FASN</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi et al., 2008</xref>). However, our observation that siRNA or pharmacological targeting of SREBP1 blocks androgen-mediated induction of <italic>6PGD</italic> suggests that SREBP1 transcriptionally activates this gene downstream of AR. Further supporting the relevance of a closely interlinked AR/SREBP1/6PGD pathway in PCa was our observation that targeting any one of these three factors had a pronounced impact on glucose flux through the oxidative branch of the PPP. Interestingly, knockdown of AR and SREBP1 also had a profound impact on the non-oxidative branch of the PPP. Although the precise mechanism(s) underlying this observation are not known, given their expansive and diverse roles in PCa cell metabolism, it is plausible that AR and SREBP1 regulate other metabolic factors that stimulate the non-oxidative PPP. Importantly, regulation of the PPP by AR-SREBP1-6PGD has a broader clinical implication; therapeutic strategies that effectively suppress this pathway would impinge on the activity of three important oncogenic drivers with multifaceted cancer-promoting activities.</p><p>We propose that AR-mediated activation of the PPP in PCa would yield additional advantages beyond the generation of key substrates for nucleic acid anabolism and the antioxidant NADPH. Most notably, PPP suppression of AMPK, itself a hub for cellular metabolic and growth control, results in augmentation of ACC1 and mTOR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zadra et al., 2014</xref>). The importance of both ACC1 and mTOR in enabling PCa cells to meet their energy demands is increasingly well recognised; indeed, both of these factors are key mediators of de novo lipogenesis, high levels of which are a hallmark of prostate tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mah et al., 2019</xref>). Mechanistically, it has been reported that 6PGD-mediated production of Ru5P inhibits AMPK by disrupting the LKB1 complex, leading to activation of ACC1 and lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, in addition to its more direct impact on lipogenesis by regulation of lipid metabolic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mah et al., 2019</xref>), our data reveal that AR also supports this metabolic process by activation of 6PGD and the PPP.</p><p>In addition to regulation of 6PGD by the androgen signalling axis, our work also revealed that 6PGD can act in a reciprocal manner to maintain AR protein levels and activity. Indeed, S3 was as effective as Enz at inhibiting the expression of some AR target genes, albeit at higher doses. We propose that this positive feedback would serve as an effective circuit to fuel PCa growth and enhance survival. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that targeting of 6PGD results in increased ubiquitylation of AR, explaining why it is decreased at the protein level. Precisely how 6PGD inhibition regulates processing of AR by the UPS is unclear. However, we note that S3 treatment increased ROS levels and activated AMPK signalling, both of which have been shown to promote AR degradation/turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we propose that 6PGD regulation of AR protein ubiquitylation, and hence stability, likely occurs at multiple levels. More broadly, unravelling the complexity of the AR/6PGD feedback loop will be important to effectively harness co-targeting strategies.</p><p>Given the important role of the PPP in PCa growth and survival, established by this study in addition to earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsouko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ros et al., 2012</xref>), targeting this pathway as a possible therapeutic strategy has merit. We investigated this concept using two inhibitors of 6PGD, physcion (1,8-dihydroxy-3-methoxy-6-methyl-anthraquinone; emodin-3-methyl ether) and S3 (1-hydroxy-8-methoxy-anthraquinone). Physcion (also known as parietin; PubChem CID 10639) was the most active inhibitor of 6PGD activity in an in vitro assay amongst a library of ~2000 small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). A plant-derived anthraquinone, physcion was initially investigated for its anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">XunLi et al., 2019</xref>). More recently, there has been significant interest in its repurposing as an oncology agent since it has been reported to possess broad anti-cancer activity (i.e. suppression of growth and migration, induction of apoptosis) in leukaemia, colorectal, cervical, and breast cancer cells, amongst others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elf et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). However, while physcion has achieved impressive anti-cancer results in some preclinical studies, its poor pharmacological attributes, including low solubility, may impede efforts to progress it to the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">XunLi et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we also tested the physcion derivative compound S3, which has been reported to possess improved pharmacological attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). Our results represent the first evaluation of physcion and S3 in PCa and collectively highlight the potential of therapeutically targeting 6PGD in this disease. Indeed, our data suggest that S3/physcion would possess multi-pronged anti-tumour activity in PCa by inhibiting oncogenic metabolism, including lipogenesis (i.e. activation of AMPK and suppression of ACC1 and mTOR); increasing levels of ROS, resulting in oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation; and finally, suppressing the levels and activity of AR, the primary oncogenic driver of this disease. Importantly, a Phase I trial reported that physcion was well tolerated with low toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tzeng et al., 2011</xref>), supporting its future clinical application.</p><p>Since AR-targeted therapies are not curative, there is intense interest in identifying combination therapies that would improve patient outcomes. Our work provides a solid rationale for co-targeting of AR and 6PGD; indeed, we observed synergistic effects of Enz and S3 in PCa models. Moreover, the existence of an AR:6PGD feedback loop enhances the appeal of such a combinatorial strategy. Although we acknowledge that physcion and S3 may not be useful clinical agents due to pharmacological issues, we expect that the future development of therapies that effectively suppress activity of 6PGD, or other components of the PPP, could have a major impact on PCa patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Each treatment comprised four replicates. After 24 hr, the cells were collected in Trizol (four replicates, for RNA analysis) or RIPA buffer + protease inhibitors (two replicates, for protein analysis). RNA extractions were completed using RNeasy Mini spin columns (Qiagen, Chadstone, VIC, Australia), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was eluted in 40 µl RNase-free H<sub>2</sub>O. RT-qPCR and western blotting were performed to verify the expected response of known AR-regulated proteins and genes, PSA/<italic>KLK3</italic> and FKBP51/<italic>FKBP5</italic>. Subsequently, libraries were generated using 800 ng of RNA and NEXTflex Rapid Illumina Directional RNA-Seq Library Prep Kits (Bio-Scientific, Kirrawee, NSW, Australia), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was carried out at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute Genomics Facility using an Illumina NextSeq 500 (single read 75 bp v2 sequencing chemistry). The quality and number of reads for each sample were assessed with FastQC v0.11.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews, 2010</xref>). Adaptors were trimmed from reads, and low-quality bases, with Phred scores &lt; 28, were trimmed from ends of reads, using Trimgalore v0.4.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krueger, 2012</xref>). Trimmed reads of &lt;20 nucleotides were discarded. Reads passing all quality control steps were aligned to the hg38 assembly of the human genome using TopHat v2.1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) allowing for up to two mismatches. Reads not uniquely aligned to the genome were discarded. HTSeq-count v0.6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2015</xref>) was used with the union model to assign uniquely aligned reads to Ensembl Hg38.86-annotated genes.

At time of collection, cells were washed twice with 0.9% w/v NaCl, scraped in MeOH:H<sub>2</sub>O (1:1). Chloroform was added prior to vortexing, centrifuging, and collecting the aqueous layer. The aqueous layer was dried in a Savant SpeedVac (Thermo Fisher Scientific) without heat. Dried samples were resuspended in 60 µl LC-MS H<sub>2</sub>O, centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min, and supernatant transferred into HPLC vials for LCMS analysis. Samples were kept at 4°C on the autosampler tray. Glycolytic and pentose-phosphate pathway metabolites were measured using 1260 Infinity (Agilent)-QTRAP5500 (AB Sciex) LC-MS/MS system. Analyte separation was achieved using a Synergi 2.5 µm Hydro-RP 100A LC Column (100 × 2 mm) (Phenomenex) at ambient temperature.

This spike-in strategy (as opposed to media exchange) enabled a rapid time course with minimal disruption to glycolytic fluxes. Experiments were stopped by quenching the cells with ice-cold methanol:H<sub>2</sub>O (1:1) and placing plates at –20°C (prior to cell scraping). After completion of the time course, cell slurries in methanol:H<sub>2</sub>O were collected by scraping and transferred into microfuge tubes. Samples were identically processed and assayed as described for metabolomics samples, with the exception that MRMs were configured to quantify mass isotopologues of glycolytic and PPP intermediates. Fluxes through the oxidative and non-oxidative branches of PP pathway were estimated using the accumulation/dilution rate of m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> isotopologues of Ru5P. Assuming steady-state metabolism, the dilution rate (<italic>D</italic>) of Ru5P was calculated using the continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) equation <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> , with <italic>m</italic> representing Ru5P mass isotopologues m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> datapoints generated from the time-course experiment. <italic>D</italic> was estimated using a least-squares Monte Carlo fitting script in MATLAB.

An automated staining protocol (U OptiView DAB IHC v6 [v1.00.0136]) using the Ventana BenchMark ULTRA IHC/ISH Staining Module (F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Switzerland) was used for the detection of AR. Quantitative image analysis for AR and pS6 (Ser235/236) was completed using FIJI software (ImageJ; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fiji.sc/Fiji">http://fiji.sc/Fiji</ext-link>; version 1.52 p). Briefly, images (obtained from NDP viewer version 2.7.52; Hamamatsu Photonics K.K, Hamamatsu City, Japan) were imported and converted into three panels using the <italic>Colour Deconvolution</italic> plug-in and vector haematoxylin and DAB staining (HDAB) commands. The <italic>Adjust Threshold</italic> plug-in was used on the DAB-only images to measure % area (positivity) and reciprocal intensity (RI). The final DAB intensity values were calculated by subtracting RI from maximal intensity (255) and multiplying by % area (positivity). Values from 20 to 70 images per treatment were measured and RI was kept constant for each patient.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are displayed as the mean; error bars are standard error.

which is a rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway. Evidence is provided that modulation of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase by androgen receptor is mediated by sterol regulatory element binding protein 1. Moreover, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase appears to be essential for the survival of prostate cancer cells while its expression is elevated in prostate cancer patient specimens. Overall, it was thought that this study is of broad interest inasmuch as it highlights previously unappreciated role of androgen receptor in metabolic reprogramming in neoplasia of the prostate, thus suggesting potentially targetable metabolic vulnerabilities.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A feedback loop between the androgen receptor and 6-phosphogluoconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) drives prostate cancer growth&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Ivan Topisirovic as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Erica Golemis as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Luke Gaughan (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at eLife&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this article, Gillis et al. provide evidence suggesting that androgen receptor (AR) targets 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). In prostate cancer cells, 6PGD levels decrease upon AR depletion but not after enzalutamide treatment. The authors further show that this AR-mediated control of 6PGD levels is regulated by SREBP1. 6PGD depletion or pharmacologic inhibition induce prostate cancer cell death, likely by increasing ROS. Moreover, the authors report that pharmacological inhibition of 6PGD coincides with AR downregulation, thus suggesting an AR/SREBP1/6PGD feedforward loop. 6PGD inhibition also appears to induce AMPK, thereby suppressing mTOR signaling and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1). Finally, the authors provide evidence that the combination of 6PGD inhibitors with AR antagonists may provide a stronger anti-neoplastic response, thereby highlighting the PPP as a potentially targetable metabolic vulnerability in prostate cancer. This is further corroborated by the findings that 6PGD is upregulated in prostate cancer patient samples. Indeed, the authors demonstrate that 6PGD inhibition impacts cell proliferation, mTOR signaling and AR in patient derived explants (PDEs). Overall, the reviewers agreed the article was of broad interest, inasmuch as it provides a hitherto unappreciated link between AR and potentially targetable metabolic reprogramming in prostate cancer. Nonetheless, several issues pertaining to insufficient understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of observed phenomena were noted.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Although previous literature show this in breast and liver cancer cell lines, the authors should conduct ChIP-qPCR in the cell lines they are studying (LNCaP and VCaP) to confirm that SREBP1 is associated with the 6PGD promoter in prostate cancer. If SREBP1 binding to this promoter is observed, does it increase as a result of AR induction and/or decrease with AR inhibition?</p><p>2. More mechanistic evidence regarding how AR controls 6PGD levels and subsequently, how 6PGD impacts on AR abundance would improve the study. The authors show that an SREBP inhibitor affects 6PGD levels, but considering potential issues with specificity of inhibitors, SREBP depletion by CRISPR or siRNA should be tested for the ability to attenuate DHT-induced 6PGD expression. Similarly, the experiments using 6PGD inhibitors (Figures 4 and 5) should be complemented by orthogonal genetic approaches.</p><p>3. It is not clear how and at which level 6PGD may affect AR levels. Experiments using transcriptional, translational and proteasome inhibitors to address the level at which 6PGD regulates AR are required to strengthen this part of the study. As a related point, the authors should investigate whether overexpression of 6PCG lead to an increase in AR levels.</p><p>4. It remains unclear whether the effects of AR on cell survival are dependent on 6PGD. Would enforced expression of 6PCG in the context of AR depletion improve cell viability through engagement of the PPP?</p><p>5. A deeper investigation of the effects on PPP is warranted. Although the levels of 6-PG (the substrate of the reaction) have been measured (Figure 3C), levels of the PPP intermediates/products (ribulose-5-phosphate or NADPH) or a final product of the pathway (e.g. ribose-5-phosphate) should be included. Isotopic tracing of 13-C glucose through the PPP following modulation of AR/SEBP1/6PGD would provide more direct evidence that PPP is indeed being affected.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62592.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Most notably, the validated ChIP antibody for SREBP1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-8984), which was used in the ENCODE ChIP-seq studies mentioned by the Reviewers, is no longer commercially available. This led us to try an alternative antibody (Santa Cruz monoclonal anti-SREBP1 2A4). However, despite optimising our experimental conditions to ensure that we selected timepoints for DHT treatment that robustly activated SREBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>), we could not demonstrate robust binding of SREBP1 to known target sites at the <italic>SCD</italic> and <italic>LDLR</italic> genes that we used as positive controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>SREBP1 activation and ChIP PCR analysis for AR/SREBP1 in prostate cancer cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) LNCaP cells were cultured in the absence or presence of DHT (10nM) for varying timepoints up to 48 hours.

Specifically, we have now performed growth, death and ROS assays in the absence or presence of siPGD in 2 additional cell lines (V16D and MR49F), and shown very similar effects to our results using the inhibitors; namely, reduced cell growth and induction of cell death and ROS production. These new data strengthen our conclusions and have been incorporated into the revised manuscript (new Figures 3A, 3B and 3G). We also now include new Western blot data showing that, as we observed using S3, siPGD leads to inhibition of ACC1 and mTOR signalling (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

As a related point, the authors should investigate whether overexpression of 6PCG lead to an increase in AR levels.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the Reviewers, we exploited transcriptional (actinomycin D), translational (cycloheximide) and proteasome (MG132) inhibitors in our experiments with the 6PGD inhibitor, S3, and assessed the effects on AR RNA (for actinomycin D) or protein (for cycloheximide and MG132) levels. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide did not influence the effect of S3 on AR. Conversely, our experiments with MG132 provide strong evidence that S3 leads to enhanced turnover of AR by the ubiquitin proteasome system. Specifically, we immunoprecipitated AR from LNCaP cells cultured with S3 in the absence and presence of MG132. Importantly, in the presence of MG132, ubiquitinylated AR accumulated in a dose-responsive manner with S3. Accordingly, we can now confidently conclude that S3 is affecting AR at the level of protein turnover, and these new data have been incorporated into the revised manuscript (new Figure 6D).</p><p>To address whether overexpression of 6PGD influences AR protein levels, we generated a LNCaP cell line stably overexpressing 6PGD via lentiviral transduction. Over multiple passages in culture, the 6PGD overexpressing line maintained similar AR levels to the control vector-transduced line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). This finding provides further evidence that 6PGD is affecting AR protein stability rather than its protein synthesis.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Influence of ectopic 6PGD overexpression on AR protein levels in stably transduced LNCaP cells at passages 6/9.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62592-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

It is, however, likely that while inhibition or knockdown of 6PGD can block the PPP to influence cell viability, selective overexpression of a single member of the PPP may not sufficiently activate this pathway in a setting where one or more other pathway factors may be limiting. Additionally, AR has many functions in prostate cancer growth beyond regulation of the PPP, and it is therefore not surprising that over-expression of 6PGD alone could not rescue loss of AR.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Effect of 6PGD overexpression on response of LNCaP prostate cancer cells to siAR treatment.</title><p>Cells stably transduced with control or 6PGD-overexpressing vectors were transfected with siCon or siAR and viable cell number measured after 6 days in culture. **** P&lt;0.001 c.f. siCon.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62592-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Accordingly, we have followed the suggestion to perform isotopic tracing with 1,2-<sup>13</sup>C glucose after knockdown of AR/SREBP1/6PGD. PPP flux was estimated over a period of 15 minutes by measuring the incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C into the immediate product of 6PGD catalytic activity, ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru-5-P). Our new data conclusively show that flux through the oxidative (irreversible) branch of the PPP (i.e. through 6PGD) significantly decreased with knockdown of 6PGD, AR or SREBP1 (included in the revised manuscript as Figures 3D-G, and Figure 3—figure supplement 2C). Interestingly, knockdown of AR and SREBP1 (but not 6PGD) also had a significant impact on flux through the non-oxidative (reversible) branch of the PPP, as determined by evaluating m2 (doubly labelled) Ru5P production via F6P/GAP (Figures 3F-G). Collectively, these glucose tracing data show that targeting 6PGD significantly suppresses PPP activity through the oxidative pathway, an effect that is also evident when targeting the upstream signalling factors AR and SREBP1. We thank the Reviewers for this suggestion, which has markedly strengthened our manuscript’s conclusions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
