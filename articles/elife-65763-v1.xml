DNA integration at a target site—is regarded as an abortive off-pathway reaction. Here, we challenge this view with a biochemical investigation of the mechanism of protospacer insertion, which is mechanistically analogous to DNA transposition, by the <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas1-Cas2 complex. In supercoiled target sites, the predominant outcome is the disintegration of one-ended insertions that fail to complete the second integration event. In linear target sites, one-ended insertions far outnumber complete protospacer insertions. The second insertion event is most often accompanied by the disintegration of the first, mediated either by the 3′-hydroxyl exposed during integration or by water. One-ended integration intermediates may mature into complete spacer insertions via DNA repair pathways that are also involved in transposon mobility. We propose that disintegration-promoted integration is functionally important in the adaptive phase of CRISPR-mediated bacterial immunity, and perhaps in other analogous transposition reactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>transposition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM124141</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Finkelstein</surname><given-names>Ilya J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1049925</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jayaram</surname><given-names>Makkuni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1949821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jayaram</surname><given-names>Makkuni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F-1274</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jayaram</surname><given-names>Makkuni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F-1808</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Finkelstein</surname><given-names>Ilya J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Disintegration, regarded as an abortive side reaction antithetical to DNA transposition, can promote protospacer integration at the CRISPR locus via DNA repair pathways.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CRISPR-based bacterial immunity uses information from a prior infection stored in the chromosome to target and destroy invading viruses or plasmids. The adaptive phase of this defense system involves the deposition of short pieces of DNA (protospacers) from foreign nucleic acids into the chromosome as spacers—the storage units of immunological memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hille et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marraffini, 2015</xref>). The CRISPR locus has a (leader-[repeat-spacer]<sub>n</sub>-repeat) organization, and the long primary transcript derived from it is processed by Cas (CRISPR-associated) and/or host nucleases into mature CRISPR-RNAs (crRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrangou and Marraffini, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrangou, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wiedenheft et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wright et al., 2016</xref>). The crRNAs, together with Cas effector protein(s), assemble the interference complex for recognition of invading nucleic acids through concerted protein-nucleic acid and base-pairing interactions followed by their cleavage and destruction.</p><p>CRISPR-Cas systems are classified into two broad categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brouns et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gasiunas et al., 2012</xref>). Class 1 systems employ a multi-protein-RNA interference complex for target recognition, termed Cascade. Class 2 systems utilize RNA-guided target recognition and cleavage by a single protein, that is, Cas9 or Cas12. These two classes are further divided into several types and subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wright et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Makarova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shmakov et al., 2015</xref>). Self-targeting is avoided via multiple mechanisms, including recognition of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) immediately bordering the crRNA-complementary DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gasiunas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang and Doudna, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elmore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pyenson and Marraffini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smargon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although CRISPR-Cas systems differ markedly in the execution of immune defense, the adaptation phase (invading DNA → pre-spacer → protospacer → integrated spacer) is well conserved but still incompletely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amitai and Sorek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krupovic et al., 2017</xref>). The conserved Cas1 and Cas2 proteins are essential (and sufficient in some systems) to carry out spacer acquisition in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nuñez et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yosef et al., 2012</xref>). In the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (Type I-E) and <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (Type II-A) Cas1-Cas2 crystal structures, a pair of Cas1 dimers flank a central Cas2 dimer on either side in a butterfly arrangement, providing a ridge that can accommodate the pre-spacer DNA (that includes the PAM sequence), or the protospacer DNA (that lacks a complete PAM), with splayed out single strand termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nuñez et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>). The <italic>E. faecalis</italic> complex reveals a second ridge that can be occupied by the acceptor DNA, suggesting its integration competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>). Other Cas proteins, such as Cas4, Csn2, and Cascade/Cas9, may improve spacer acquisition efficiency, while also contributing to the mechanism for discrimination of non-self (pre-spacer) from self (integrated spacer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wei et al., 2015a</xref>). In addition, bacterial nucleoid associated proteins such as IHF (integration host factor) assist the integration reaction and enhance target specificity in the <italic>E. coli</italic> Type I-E system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nuñez et al., 2016</xref>). Protospacer generation in the Type I and Type II systems involves PAM recognition within the pre-spacer, but also the exclusion of a complete PAM from the protospacer to be integrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wei et al., 2015a</xref>).</p><p>Protospacer integration is mechanistically analogous to DNA transposition, with terminal 3′-hydroxyls attacking the target phosphodiester bonds at the leader-repeat (L-R) junction on one strand and the repeat-spacer (R-S) junction on the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nuñez et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These transesterification reactions are carried out by the Cas1 active sites of the Cas1-Cas2 complex.

Supplementary text 1. Nearly all of the protospacer integration events in the target plasmid appear to be one-ended (transfer of only one strand), with integration being rapidly reversed by disintegration to give covalently closed plasmid molecules. Integration-disintegration requires the target site, the protospacer, and the functional Cas1-Cas2 complex. The strand transfer reaction is performed by the Cas1 active site. The nicked strand resulting from protospacer integration is not impeded from rotation before nick closure. As a result, a relaxed distribution of plasmid circles is formed by disintegration.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65763-fig1-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Cas1-Cas2 unwinds DNA within the target site during protospacer integration-disintegration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The image of the gel panel shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> (electrophoresis done in the presence of 0.4 μg/ml chloroquine) is reproduced here.

However, they also raise a number of intriguing questions. Are the adaptation steps—pre-spacer recognition, its processing into protospacer, and protospacer insertion into the CRISPR locus—carried out by the same complex, perhaps in coordination with bacterial helicase/nuclease proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amitai and Sorek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dillingham and Kowalczykowski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Levy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2020</xref>)? Or, are processing and insertion performed by separate complexes in spatially and/or temporally distinct steps? Does in vitro integration of a pre-processed protospacer by Cas1-Cas2 fully recapitulate the features of the in vivo reaction?</p><p>Here, we probe the mechanism of <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> (Spy) Cas1-Cas2 catalyzed integration in vitro. We show that partial (one-ended) integration is the most common reaction product. Attempts by Cas1-Cas2 to complete protospacer insertion by the integration of the second strand are most often accompanied by the reversal of integration (disintegration) of the first strand. As a result, complete integration of a protospacer into the target site is exceedingly rare. Nevertheless, the incomplete intermediates formed by disintegration may be rescued via repair pathways known to operate during DNA transposition. We conclude that disintegration is an intermediate step in at least one mode of integration, which may be accomplished by more than one pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Protospacer insertion into a nominal CRISPR locus present in a supercoiled plasmid</title><p>The in vitro insertion of a protospacer into a target site by the Spy Cas1-Cas2 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wright and Doudna, 2016</xref>) is inefficient, suggesting that the system may not fully represent the in vivo reaction. It may be limited by missing accessory components or because it is uncoupled from preceding DNA processing steps. We reexamined this reaction using a negatively supercoiled plasmid harboring the target site as ‘leader-repeat-spacer’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>The prominent outcome was the conversion of the supercoiled plasmid into a relaxed distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). The formation of a spacer integrant joined to the leader-proximal repeat end (L-R) on one strand and the spacer-proximal repeat end on the other (R-S) was barely detectable. Only a fraction of the product migrated as a nicked circle expected for a complete protospacer integration event or semi-integration events at either the L-R or R-S junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). We confirmed the presence of the protospacer in the ‘nicked’ plasmid band by labeling it with Cy5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). By contrast, the Cy5-labeled protospacer was not inserted into the relaxed plasmid. Supercoil relaxation by Cas1-Cas2 required the CRISPR locus to be present in the target plasmid, and was dependent on the protospacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Optimal reaction occurred at 4:1 and 2:1 molar ratios of Cas1:Cas2, with increasing Cas2 inhibiting the reaction mildly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results are consistent with previous biochemical and structural data suggesting (Cas1)<sub>4</sub>-(Cas2)<sub>2</sub> as the active insertion complex, with Cas1 performing the catalytic steps of protospacer strand transfer to the CRISPR locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nuñez et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref> and accompanying Supplementary Text S1).</p><p>The predominance of the relaxed (closed circular) plasmid over the ‘nicked’ plasmid in the product indicates that the Cas1-Cas2 complex fails to complete protospacer integration in most cases.

We probed linking number changes (ΔLks) accompanying Cas1-Cas2-mediated integration-disintegration in a supercoiled target plasmid and T4 ligase-mediated strand closure in the nicked form of the same plasmid with or without bound Cas1-Cas2. Provided the Cas1-Cas2-induced topological stress within a target site is stable throughout the reaction, it will be preserved in the plasmid topoisomers formed by integration-disintegration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). In principle, the target topology in a Cas1-Cas2-bound nicked plasmid may also be captured by resealing the nick with DNA ligase.</p><p>DNA relaxation by Cas1-Cas2 occurred progressively, although not in a regular stepwise fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The disappearance with time of the faster-migrating bands formed early in the reaction, and the corresponding increase in the more relaxed distribution, is consistent with more than one ‘semi-integration-disintegration’ event occurring in the same plasmid molecule. The relaxation pattern was distinct from a topoisomerase I-generated ladder (ΔLk=+1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that the broken strand goes through multiple rotations before it is resealed.</p><p>Integration-disintegration by Cas1-Cas2 and nick closure by T4 DNA ligase in the absence of Cas1-Cas2 resulted in similar, but not identical, plasmid topoisomer distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The slight shift between the centers of the two distributions is consistent with supercoiling strain (writhe or twist) being sequestered by Cas1-Cas2 interaction with DNA. However, the possibility that relaxation by Cas1-Cas2 had not reached equilibrium cannot be ruled out. The relaxed plasmid topoisomers formed by ligation (without bound Cas1-Cas2) reflect differences in twist or writhe in individual DNA molecules due to thermal fluctuations. As the gel fractionation did not include an intercalating agent, the position of a band below the slowest migrating fully relaxed form (ΔLk=0) indicates only its absolute deviation from the relaxed state. A molecule with ΔLk=+1 (positively supercoiled) and one with ΔLk=−1 (negatively supercoiled) would show the same migration.</p><p>Next, we analyzed the integration-disintegration and nick ligation reactions by separating DNA topoisomers in the presence of chloroquine. Unwinding of the double helix by the intercalator introduces compensatory positive supercoils in covalently closed circular molecules. Each topoisomer is separated from its nearest neighbors (migrating above and below) by one supercoil, the faster migrating one being more positively supercoiled. Strand sealing in the nicked plasmid was performed by T4 ligase without added factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; lane 3) or after pre-incubation with the indicated Cas proteins and/or the protospacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; lanes 4–7). Nearly identical topoisomer distributions were obtained after ligation in the absence of Cas1-Cas2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; lane 3) or in the presence of either Cas1-Cas2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; lane 5) or the catalytically inactive dCas1-Cas2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; lane 6). Addition of protospacer by itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; lane 4) or together with dCas1-Cas2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; lane 7) to the ligase reaction did not alter this distribution. The topoisomer distribution of the Cas1-Cas2 plus protospacer treated supercoiled plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; lane 8) was more negatively supercoiled (ΔLk between −1 and −2) than that obtained from nick closure in the presence of dCas1-Cas2 and protospacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; lane 7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The above results suggest that Cas1-Cas2 either stably constrains local negative supercoiling when bound to a target site in a supercoiled plasmid (without, however, impeding free rotation of the strand nicked by Cas1), or has had insufficient time to effect complete plasmid relaxation. For a target site present in a nicked plasmid, the Cas1-Cas2-induced topological stress is presumably dissipated via the nick before being sealed off by ligation. The observed ΔLk between the Cas1-Cas2 relaxed and T4 ligase sealed plasmid distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) is consistent with the unwinding of a little more than one DNA turn within the target sequence during protospacer integration.

In this case, insertion in either orientation would give immunity.

L-R and R-S insertions were approximately equally prevalent, although L-R insertions were more abundant at very short time points. This is consistent with semi-integration events initiated at L-R being converted to full-integration events by R-S insertion, as was suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wright and Doudna, 2016</xref>). However, alternative explanations cannot be ruled out (see below).</p><p>Unlike orientation-specific protospacer integration in vivo, in vitro Cas1-Cas2 reactions showed no strand-specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This bias-free insertion of the top or bottom strand from the protospacer was unchanged by the addition of Csn2 or Cas9 or both to the reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). These proteins, singly or in combination, also failed to stabilize protospacer integrations in the supercoiled plasmid target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Instead, they inhibited plasmid relaxation. Inhibition could occur at the level of integration per se or strand rotation during integration-disintegration.</p><p>In order to address whether the products of integration could be stabilized by preventing potential disintegration, we used target sites with nicks placed within the leader and the spacer 3 nt away from the normal integration sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The short 3 nt product (5′GAG-OH3′ or 5′GCA-OH3′) formed during integration would not be stably hydrogen-bonded to the complementary strand and is expected to diffuse away from the reaction center. The increased spacing of the 3′-hydroxyls of the shortened leader or spacer from the integration junction would block or curtail disintegration.</p><p>The nick-containing target yielded, in addition to the 81 nt and 89 nt products expected from the standard linear target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), product bands migrating slightly higher than each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,C</xref>). These extra bands, though uncharacterized, are consistent with potential integration events at the two phosphodiester positions between an authentic phosphodiester target and its proximal nick (Supplementary Text S2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The flexibility afforded by the nick could presumably facilitate these aberrant integration events. The amount of the integration product (normal plus aberrant) was increased two- to threefold in comparison to the normal product formed from the target without a nick. Although disintegration by the leader or spacer 3′-hydroxyl is reduced in the nicked target site, water-mediated disintegration could still be an impediment to stable integration (see below). The overall yield of disintegration could thus be limited.</p><p>The similar amounts of L-R and R-S insertion product bands formed in the linear target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>) may arise from equal and independent one-ended insertions in the same target or in separate targets, or from completion of two-ended insertions within individual targets. A third possibility is that, within an intermediate containing a semi-integrant, integration of the second strand is coupled to the disintegration of the first. In this case, the one-ended integrant will oscillate between the L-R and R-S junctions. As a result, the net integration events at L-R and R-S will be equal at a steady state. Their absolute amounts would be dictated by how strongly they are destabilized by disintegration under a given set of reaction conditions. The difference between nearly zero and readily detectable integration in supercoiled versus linear targets can be accounted for by this interpretation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cas1-Cas2 activity on pre-spacer mimics carrying the PAM sequence</title><p>The strand cleavage and strand transfer steps of protospacer insertion at the CRISPR locus must engender safeguards against self-targeting of the inserted spacer as well as its non-functional orientation.

For the unmodified protospacer (T/T)<sub>0</sub>, IP(R-S) was now readily detectable in the (T/T)<sub>15</sub> target (72 nt; lane 5). Even weaker R-S reaction was seen in the (T/T)<sub>10</sub>-target (67 nt; lane 4) and the (T/T)<sub>5</sub> target (62 nt; lane 3). Bands for IP(R-S) in the (T/T)<sub>15</sub> target were also visible for the (T/-)<sub>5</sub>-protospacer (77 nt and 72 nt; lane 13) and the (T/-)<sub>10</sub>-protospacer (82 nt and 72 nt; lane 17). For the (T/-)<sub>5</sub>-protospacer and the (T/T)<sub>5</sub> or (T/T)<sub>10</sub>-target combinations, IP (R-S) was barely above background (67 nt and 62 nt; lane 11, and 72 nt and 67 nt; lane 12). In all reactions with the modified target sites, the L-R junction far outmatched the R-S junction for insertion efficiency. The bands labeled as X, Y, and Z are explained in Supplementary Text S4 (see below). Unexpected co-migrating sets of bands from reactions of individual protospacers with the modified and unmodified target sites, as well as bands that were independent of Cas1-Cas2, are marked with a ‘?’ symbol. These were potential contaminants from the oligonucleotides used for protospacer assembly. The incubation mixtures run in lanes C1, 1, and C2 contained the labeled protospacer (PS(T/T)<sub>5</sub> in C1; PS(T/T)<sub>0</sub> in 1; and PS(T/-)<sub>10</sub> in C2) together with the unmodified target (T/T)<sub>0</sub> but no Cas1-Cas2. The C1 and C2 control lanes were not included in the gel panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. Lanes 1–17 here correspond to lanes 1–17 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. Supplementary Text S4. The bands X, Y, and Z were formed only in reactions containing the modified (T/T)<sub>n</sub> targets and were dependent on Cas1-Cas2. Their relative spacing (depending on the sizes of the protospacer strands) suggests a unique site of insertion common to all the targets. For example, the smallest band X was formed from the native (T/T)<sub>o</sub>protospacer (with 26 nt on either strand) in all three of the modified targets, (T/T)<sub>5</sub>, (T/T)<sub>10</sub>, and (T/T)<sub>15</sub> (lanes 3–5). The mobility of the fainter band Y formed from the (T/T)<sub>5</sub>protospacer (with 31 nt strands) was consistent with a 5 nt increase in length compared to X (lanes 7–9). With the (T/-)<sub>5</sub>protospacer (strand lengths of 31 nt and 26 nt), both X and Y were formed (lanes 11–13). And with the (T/-)<sub>10</sub>protospacer (strand lengths of 36 nt and 26 nt), X and Z were formed (lanes 15–17), the migration of Z suggesting it to be longer than X and Y by 10 nt and 5 nt, respectively. Taken together, X, Y, and Z appear to be formed by insertions of the 26 nt, 31 nt, and 36 nt protospacer strands, respectively, at the leader-proximal junction between the T<sub>n</sub>-insertion and the repeat sequence on the bottom strand. The sizes of the X, Y, and Z bands would then be 47 nt, 52 nt, and 57 nt, respectively, and match their observed gel mobilities. The double-strand/single-strand junction may mimic the DNA conformation organized by Cas1-Cas2 at the L-R or R-S junction to promote protospacer insertion during the native reaction. IP = integration product; PS = protospacer.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65763-fig3-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>The inclusion of PAM or PAM and its complement in the integration substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>) did not confer strand specificity on reactions with Cas1-Cas2 alone or with added Csn2, Cas9, or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–E</xref>).

The pre-spacer mimics containing one or both &gt;26 nt strands had reduced integration competence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–E</xref>; lane 4). Even here, the 26 nt strand with the 4 nt overhang (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>; lane 4) was preferred in integration over the longer 29 nt PAM-containing strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>; lane 4) or the 33 nt PAM complement-containing strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E</xref>; lane 4).

This is the expected outcome if the initial strand transfer occurs at L-R, and a ruler-like mechanism orients the reactive 3′-hydroxyl for the second strand transfer at R-S. This sequential two-step scheme for protospacer integration is consistent with the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> as well. These reaction features of the pre-spacer mimics were not modulated by Csn2 or Cas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–E</xref>; lanes 6 and 8), although Csn2+Cas9 was inhibitory to integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–E</xref>; lane 10).</p><p>There is no evidence for integration accompanying PAM-specific cleavage in our in vitro reactions.

As a result, the length of a modified strand was increased from the normal 26 nt by the number of inserted Ts. However, the 22 bp double-stranded region and the 4 nt 3′-overhangs at either end were retained as in the native protospacer. In the modified target sites, (5′T3′/3′T5′)<sub>n</sub> insertions replacing a central 16 bp segment of the repeat were flanked on either side by 10 bp each of the leader-proximal and spacer-proximal repeat sequences. Consequently, the repeat lengths varied from 25 nt to 30 nt and 35 nt on each strand in the individual insertion derivatives (compared to 36 nt fully complementary strands in the native target). Based on the results from prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wright and Doudna, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wei et al., 2015b</xref>), the L-R and R-S junctions of the modified target sites were expected to be integration-competent. Furthermore, the premise that the inherent structural pliability of (T/T)<sub>n</sub> or (T/-)<sub>n</sub> would at least partly compensate for changes in the absolute lengths of the Cas1-Cas2 substrates was borne out by the experimental results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>).</p><p>The native (T/T)<sub>0</sub>-protospacer as well as the ones carrying T-insertions, (T/T)<sub>n</sub> or (T/-)<sub>n</sub>, gave the predicted integration products at the L-R and R-S junctions with the native (T/T)<sub>0</sub>-target site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; lanes 2, 6, 10, and 14). As the two strands of a (T/-)<sub>n</sub>-protospacer were unequal in length, their integration at each junction resulted in two products with different gel mobilities (four bands in lanes 10 and 14). For the (T/T)<sub>5</sub>, (T/T)<sub>10</sub>, and (T/T)<sub>15</sub>-targets, integration occurred almost exclusively at the L-R junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; lanes 3–5, 7–9, 11–13, and 15–17).

Catalysis of the initial one-ended insertion at this target site follows. Within this intermediate, a ruler-like mechanism may be used to promote R-S junction interactions that culminate in the second strand transfer.

The extent of repeat sequence present adjacent to the L-R junction and/or specific repeat sequences distal to this junction may contribute to the priority in target site recognition and order of strand transfer during spacer acquisition.

Nevertheless, the strain within the strand transfer intermediate could potentially trigger disintegration mediated by the 3′-hydroxyl exposed at the leader or spacer end. Disintegration may offer a protective mechanism to prevent off-target integration events that could imperil the integrity of the bacterial genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wright and Doudna, 2016</xref>). The conformational dynamics of authentic integration at the CRISPR locus may displace the 3′-hydroxyl from the protospacer-repeat junction or misorient it with respect to the scissile phosphate.

The 3′-hydroxyl of the unintegrated protospacer strand would serve as the nucleophile for the second integration step. Similarly, the 3′-hydroxyl of the ‘leader strand’, and potentially water, could provide the nucleophiles for the disintegration reaction.

Formation of this minor product suggests that the phosphodiester bond at the L-R junction was restored by 3′-hydroxyl-mediated disintegration in at least a subpopulation of the starting substrate molecules. This junction could then serve as the target site for strand insertion from a disintegrated protospacer. Consistent with this interpretation, labeling the 5′-end of the leader strand revealed the 92 nt product expected for disintegration carried out by the leader 3′-hydroxyl to re-form the L-R junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; lanes 2′−6′).

The integration products from a protospacer in a linear target site at the L-R junction (lane 2; 89 nt) and the R-S junction (lane 2; 81 nt) provide the reference frame for interpreting the product bands from the ‘semi-integrated’ substrates. The primary products from the L-R and R-S semi-integrated substrates were integrations of the second protospacer strand at the R-S junction (lane 4; 81 nt) and the L-R junction (lane 6; 89 nt), respectively. The weaker 89 nt (lane 4) and 81 nt (lane 6) bands are consistent with the reintegration of a protospacer (following its release by disintegration) at the L-R and R-S junctions, respectively. These junctions would be re-formed during disintegration mediated by the 3′-hydroxyls of the leader and spacer strands, respectively. When the <sup>32</sup>P-label was present at the 5′-end of the leader strand, the prominent product was the resealed L-R junction (via disintegration) (92 nt; lane 8). The migration of the weaker band below in lane 8 (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; lanes 2′−6′) is consistent with a size of 84 nt (Supplementary Text S5 below).

Resealing of the R-S junction via disintegration mediated by the 3′-spacer hydroxyl was also evident from the smaller amounts of the 81 nt product formed by the semi-integration of a released protospacer at R-S. Unlike the first strand transfer step, which obeys a strict order during protospacer insertion, the second strand transfer (and subsequent strand transfers) may proceed from L-R to R-S or R-S to L-R with roughly equal efficiency.

First, integration of the second strand without disintegration of the first is quite infrequent. Second, disintegration of a protospacer from the L-R junction followed by its integration at the R-S junction in a two-step process is also rare. The IP(R-S)** band (82 nt; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) is the result of such a reaction, namely, insertion of the 26 nt protospacer strand released from the L-R junction into the R-S junction. Thus, integration of the second strand and disintegration of the first are most often concerted events, and two-ended insertion events by the Cas1-Cas2 complex seldom occur in vitro. Finally, water being better at promoting disintegration coupled integration than the 3′-hydroxyl is significant. The strand nick left unsealed during the water-mediated reaction would permit seemingly abortive intermediates to be processed by bacterial DNA repair systems into successful spacer insertion (see Discussion). Thus, paradoxically, disintegration may be an important (but unappreciated) contributing factor in the adaption stage of CRISPR immunity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cas1-Cas2-mediated adaptation is strongly conserved across CRISPR systems, but is less understood than the much more diverse interference mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wiedenheft et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krupovic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yosef et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang and Doudna, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mohanraju et al., 2016</xref>).

The 3′-hydroxyls are then transferred to the leader-repeat (L–R) and repeat-spacer (R–S) junctions of the target site. Replication across L and PS (protospacer) followed by recombination within the duplicated PS completes integration. An alternative mode of processing the strand transfer intermediate involves removal of the pre-spacer DNA flanking PS, and gap repair by limited DNA synthesis and ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The integration pathway shown at the right follows cut-and-paste DNA transposition. The steps involve excision of PS from the pre-spacer, strand transfer to L-R and R-S junctions, gap repair, and ligation. In either pathway (replicative or cut-and-paste), directing the PAM-adjacent 3′-hydroxyl to the L-R junction will ensure the functional orientation of the inserted spacer. PAM, protospacer adjacent motif.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65763-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig7s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Spacer acquisition by a mechanism that combines aspects of replicative and cut-and-paste transposition mechanisms.</title><p>An integration event may be initiated using the single-stranded ends generated by Cas1 (or Cas9) activity without the protospacer being excised from the pre-spacer DNA (as in replicative transposition; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The flanking DNA is then trimmed by a nuclease such as RecBCD, perhaps with assistance from a flap endonuclease, to generate a structure that resembles the intermediate of cut-and-paste transposition. In effect, the mechanism is ‘nick-paste-and-trim’. The final integration product is formed by gap-filling replication and ligation. The process would be analogous to the removal of host DNA attached to the ends of the infecting phage Mu genome after it has been partially integrated into the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jang and Harshey, 2015</xref>).

In vitro, either of the two protospacer strands is equally capable of integration, and coupled cleavage transfer is not detectable in DNA substrates that mimic PAM-containing pre-spacers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Retention of spacer function even in the absence of orientation specificity in strand transfer is theoretically possible by dual PAM recognition (Supplementary Text S3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cas1-Cas2-mediated integration of a pre-processed protospacer: Assistance from disintegration</title><p>If ‘normal’ (two-ended) integration by the adaptation complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) is disrupted after only one protospacer strand has been transferred to the target, salvage pathways may promote the maturation of such intermediates into complete spacer insertions. These pathways may also come into play during the integration of a protospacer that is dissociated from the adaptation complex and is captured by the Cas1-Cas2 complex. Integration under this scenario, which mimics the in vitro system, is expected to be predominantly one-ended. We suggest that disintegration events, which become prominent during the transfer of the second strand, play a central role in the salvage mechanisms.</p><p>Water-mediated disintegration of the protospacer at the L-R junction during strand transfer to the R-S junction will produce an intermediate with a gap in the bottom strand and a gap plus nick in the top strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; left). An analogous intermediate with the gap plus nick in the bottom strand may also be formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; right). Here, a protospacer is first transferred to the R-S junction with concomitant 3′-hydroxyl-mediated disintegration from the L-R junction (and restoration of this junction). This is followed by a subsequent integration in the reverse direction, with disintegration at the R-S junction promoted by water. The spacer insertion event can be completed by gap-filling/displacement DNA synthesis followed by ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, disintegration reactions mediated by the 3′-hydroxyl and by water are both relevant, though in mechanistically distinct ways, to the rescue of semi-integrated protospacers into fully integrated spacers.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A model for disintegration-assisted integration.</title><p>Integration of the protospacer by Cas1-Cas2 is predominantly one-ended. Following the initial strand transfer to the L-R junction, transfer of the second strand to the R-S junction is associated with disintegration at L-R. Oscillations of the semi-integrated protospacer become possible when disintegration mediated by the 3′-hydroxyl re-forms the L-R or R-S junction at the disintegration site. Disintegration mediated by water during a second strand transfer step will block oscillations. However, the nick between L and R or R and S will be preserved, and can be utilized by DNA repair machineries to complete protospacer insertion. Formation of the repair-suitable intermediate shown at the left is dependent only on water-mediated disintegration, the 3′-hydroxyl-mediated disintegration being dispensable. However, both types of disintegration are required to generate the intermediate shown at the right.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65763-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Disintegration relieves topological stress during protospacer integration</title><p>Disintegration is generally viewed as antithetical to the completion of the two-strand transfer events during transposition reactions, which are analogous to protospacer insertion at the CRISPR locus. However, the in vitro Cas1-Cas2 reactions suggest that disintegration can generate DNA ends capable of triggering repair events that convert one-ended strand transfer intermediates into normal insertion products. This mechanism may be especially important when two-ended insertion is impeded by the transposon being considerably shorter than the persistence length of DNA. The strand transfer complex (or post-synaptic complex; PSC) in this case would be under considerable torsional stress. A recent single-molecule FRET analysis suggests that the PSC formed during protospacer integration may be resolved by transcription from the CRISPR leader accompanied by limited DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Budhathoki et al., 2020</xref>). Resolution may also be achieved by replication, although it is argued to be less likely. The lag time in the arrival of a replication fork at the PSC in a slow-growing bacterium may cause disintegration of the protospacer and its potential reintegration in the non-functional orientation. Replication through the unwound repeat and protospacer would produce undesirable double-strand DNA breaks. However, if the integration complex functions as a strand transfer-DNA repair machinery, the DNA ends may remain protected within it to be resolved rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; pathway at the left). Precedent exists for the involvement of the replisome in the repair of the strand transfer intermediate formed during the insertion of infecting phage Mu DNA into the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jang and Harshey, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The present study demonstrates that an alternative solution to transcription/replication in simplifying PSC topology is the hydrolytic nicking of DNA (disintegration), allowing transposition (integration) to be completed by ensuing DNA repair. An analogy can be drawn to the topological problem of DNA replication. Here, the torsional stress built up ahead of the fork is removed by topoisomerases cutting DNA strands and then resealing them to permit continued fork progression. The transesterification chemistry utilized by these enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reece and Maxwell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vos et al., 2011</xref>) ensures strand cutting and repair in rapid succession without net DNA loss or gain. The distinct mechanisms for topology simplification utilized by DNA replication and CRISPR adaptation machineries are consistent with their contrasting biological purposes—maintaining genome integrity versus promoting an orderly genome rearrangement.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>A potential broader role for disintegration in DNA transposition</title><p>In a general sense, disintegration may not be limited to spacer acquisition by CRISPR loci. It may assist the movement of mini-transposons or short orphan transposons that are mobilized by ectopically supplied transposases. Disintegration need not always be counterproductive even during normal transposition, provided the DNA repair machinery is able to recommence the interrupted reaction. The Cas1-Cas2 system highlights the resourcefulness of biological catalysis in repurposing an apparently abortive reaction toward a physiologically meaningful outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>Protein expression plasmids and substrate plasmids used for in vitro assays were kindly provided by the Doudna laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wright and Doudna, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Oligonucleotides</title><p>Oligonucleotides used for the assembly of protospacers and target sites were purchased from IDT (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

integration of foreign DNA sequences into the host genome. Integration is carried out by a dedicated transposase encoded in the CRISPR array. The current work is of note for highlighting the potential for water-mediated disintegration reactions – events where the integration of phage DNA into a target site is reversal – in controlling how DNA is inserted into the chromosome, an event that may be functionally important in the adaptive phase of CRISPR-mediated bacterial immunity.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Disintegration promotes proto-spacer integration by the Cas1-Cas2 complex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, whose evaluation is detailed below, we have decided that your work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, an in vitro Cas1-Cas2 model system is used to study the reaction used to insert foreign DNA elements into a CRISPR array during the adaptive phase of immunity. The authors propose that hydrolysis of one end of the transposon DNA may be the primary mechanism for the insertion of very small DNA elements (which are difficult to bend tightly) that are found for the proto spacer sequences, and that cellular repair pathways are responsible for ligating the CRISPR array back together in vivo. The findings additionally suggest that water-mediated disintegration has an unappreciated role in the generation of CRISPR arrays as part of the bacterial immune response. These hypotheses are intriguing and of potential interest to those in the CRISPR field. However, it is unclear how this in vitro study, which does not monitor the full the reaction (directionality is lost due to the lack of a PAM sequence in the substrate and several required cellular factors are missing), relates to transposition as it occurs in vivo. Overall, this is an interesting study that challenges the current thinking in the field, but it does not present sufficient evidence to establish the physiological significance of the observed effects, thereby limiting its potential broader impact.<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Ma and colleagues present a biochemical investigation into integration by the Spy Cas1-Cas2 integrase, a key component of the type II CRISPR immune response. From this work they challenge the view that disintegration (the reverse of integration) only functions as an off-pathway reaction (proof reading) and propose that disintegration-promoted integration is functionally important for integration into CRISPR arrays.</p><p>CRISPR integration proceeds through two steps. In the first, one strand of the prespacer (fragment of foreign DNA) is integrated at the leader-repeat (R-L) junction of the CRISPR array. In the second step, the other strand of the prespacer integrates at the repeat-spacer (R-S) junction resulting in a fully integrated prespacer. The authors propose that, in vitro, water-mediated disintegration at the first site (R-L) is concomitant with second site integration (R-S). The authors present good evidence that this is happening in vitro though a series of elegant biochemical experiments using plasmid and oligo substrates.</p><p>This is an intriguing hypothesis but its significance is unclear. As the authors themselves acknowledge it could very well be that disintegration is not required in vivo and that this is an in vitro feature of the reaction. Admittedly, demonstrating that disintegration is important in vivo would be a very difficult task. In addition, the in vitro system used here is only partially reconstituted. The substrates lack a PAM sequence, which is necessary for protospacers to be incorporated in the correct orientation and may help direct the first integration event to the L-R junction. Presumably because of this all the reactions presented do not analyze the orientation of the incorporated prespacer sequence. Cas9 and Csn2 are also absent (as are other potentially required host factors), which are necessary for correct integration in vivo. Any of these missing components could change the behavior of the system with respect to disintegration.</p><p>The authors present a very interesting hypothesis, disintegration is a key step in CRISPR adaptation, but do not test this hypothesis in a meaningful way. This limits the interest of this work for a broad audience.</p><p>In addition to the above I have the following comments/suggestions:</p><p>Figure 1: using a plasmid that lacks a CRISPR array is an important control. It is necessary to establish that the integration events being monitored are indeed at the CRISPR array because formation of half-sites at other locations is expected to result in disintegration. It could also be beneficial to include sequence data to map the site of integration in the pCRISPR targets. This has been done before in this system (PMID: 27595346) but would again bolster the conclusions presented here.</p><p>On page 19; the authors state that &quot;…the kinetic correspondence between disintegration and the second integration reactions suggest that the two events are potentially coupled&quot;. However, the data presented in Figure 5A do not support this conclusion. The extent of second-site integration (the 81 nt band) and first site disintegration (the 92 nt band) do not change over the measured time frame. Both reactions appear to be over at 1 minute, which is also the first time point. Therefore it is impossible to know if both reactions occur at the same rate or if one is faster than the other.</p><p>With the exception of Figure 6, there are no markers, or sequence reaction products, on any of the acrylamide gels presented in the manuscript. It's therefore impossible for the reader to evaluate the size of any of the bands for themselves. This information should be included in any revised manuscript at least at the first instance of a particular sized product.</p><p>The experiments described in Figure S8 lack a Cas1 dead control. It's important to remove the possibility that the observed cleavage pattern results from a contaminating nuclease.</p><p>Some of the experiments are difficult to follow. For example it took me a long time to really understand the experiments in Figure 6, which are really elegant experiments but difficult to follow. I worry that this limits the accessibility of this work. I would encourage the authors to reevaluate how experiments are presented such that they are accessible to a broad audience. It would be helpful to not have to refer to a supplemental figure to understand the main figure i.e. the main figures should be self-contained.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Ma and colleagues have show that when DNA fragments are inserted into a CRISPR array in vitro, single end integrations are the primary products of proto-spacer insertion and double-end insertions are rare. The reason for this outcome is that the second insertion event is accompanied by 3'-OH mediated disintegration or hydrolysis at the initial insertion site. A double-strand break would remain following filling of the repeat sequence gaps in vivo in the case of the hydrolysis products. The authors propose that hydrolysis of one end of the transposon DNA may be the primary mechanism for insertion of very small DNA elements (which will be difficult to bend tightly) as found for the proto spacer sequences and that cellular repair pathways would be responsible for ligating the CRISPR array back together.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and the experiments carefully planned. The findings will be of interest to researchers studying transposition-like mechanisms in a broad range of systems. The experiments focus on analyses of Cas1-Cas2 catalyzed in vitro reactions using cleverly designed DNA substrates, leading to a hypothesis about how the system may work in vivo. The direct conclusions are well supported by the experimental data. The big unanswered question is whether the results obtained with a minimal Cas1-Cas2 system in vitro reflect what happens in the bacterial cell. More proteins are present in the cell that could modify the reaction and the native DNA array structure differs somewhat from what was used here. Overall, the results presented are intriguing, but their relationship to the cellular mechanism of CRISPR array generation is unclear, since it is not yet known whether DNA elements are inserted in vivo in the same way as observed here in vitro.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>I found the experiment shown in Figure 1F to be difficult to follow from the Figure legend and the text. What reaction(s) were performed for lanes 3-7? The centers of the distributions seem to differ by more than 1 step to me, but I may have misunderstood what is being compared.</p><p>Figure 2. What is the evidence that additional product bands differ by 1 and 2 nucleotides for the nicked target? It doesn't look like 3-fold more integration; is this a visual estimate or was quantitation done?</p><p>In the case that the second integration step is coupled to disintegration of the first, the authors state that the two integration products would be equal at steady state. The reason for this conclusion should be explained.</p><p>Figure 4 – the location of the 4-bp additions to the sequences should be shown.</p><p>Figure 8 and discussion. Repair of the product of a second site integration followed by a 3'-OH mediated disintegration at the first site would likely not yield the correct CRISPR array structure. Hydrolysis coupled to an eventual second site integration would yield an intermediate that could be repaired to give the correct array structure. Thus, the reversible disintegration reaction involving the 3'-OH doesn't really seem to play a role in the proposed pathway. The simple conclusion that Cas1/2 catalyzed hydrolysis of a phosphodiester may relieve strain and allow productive transposition to occur doesn't get emphasized enough in my opinion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65763.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

Either proto-spacer strand is equally competent to initiate the strand transfer reaction, as could be inferred from Figure 3 of the original submission. Here, reactions utilized modified proto-spacers that differed in their top and bottom strand lengths. They gave two insertion products (IP) each at the L-R (leader-repeat) and R-S (repeat-spacer) junctions of a normal target site. In modified targets in which integration was limited to just the L-R junction, two insertion products were formed. One panel of Figure 3 (which is retained in the revised manuscript) showing the four insertion products from the normal target (lane 10) and two from the modified targets (lanes 11-13) for a protospacer with 26 nt and 31 nt long strands.</p><p>The ability of either proto-spacer strand to initiate integration is now more directly shown in Figure 2 (new) of the revised manuscript. Here the labeled top or bottom strand of the proto-spacer (PS) gave insertion products (IP) at the L-R and R-S junctions of the target site. Panel B of Figure 2 demonstrates this result.</p><p><italic>Cas9, Csn2 included reactions</italic>: The data for reactions containing Csn2 or Cas9 or both were not shown previously, as they did not alter Cas1-Cas2 activity by promoting strand specificity of integration or suppressing disintegration. These results are now shown in the revised Figure 2 (linear target) and the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1 (supercoiled target).</p><p>The relevant revised text describing the lack of strand specificity to proto-spacer integration by Cas1-Cas2 and the Csn2/Cas9 effects on integration is detailed below.</p><p><italic>Page 15, lines 229-235</italic>. “Unlike orientation-specific proto-spacer integration in vivo, Cas1- Cas2 reactions in vitro showed no strand-specificity (Figure 2B). This bias-free insertion of the top or bottom strand from the proto-spacer was unchanged by the addition of Csn2 or Cas9 or both to the reactions (Figure 2C-E). These proteins, singly or in combiantion, also failed to stabilize proto-spacer integrations in the supercoiled plasmid target (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Instead, they inhibited plasmid relaxation. Inhibition could occur at the level of integration <italic>per se</italic> or strand rotation during integration-disintegration.”</p><p>PAM-containing substrates: We have now tested Cas1-Cas2 activity (with and without added Csn2 or Cas9 or both) on PAM-containing substrates that mimic ‘pre-spacers’, Figure 2—figure supplement 3 (new).</p><p>In these substrates, a proto-spacer strand of the standard length (26 nt; lacking PAM or its complement) is inserted at the L-R junction with higher efficiency than the longer strand (containing PAM or its complement).

The reverse reintegration from the R-S to the L-R junction is a slower reaction saturating at ~10 min. We agree that product measurements at earlier times than 1 min would be needed to establish strict kinetic correspondence between disintegration and second integration. What we intended to state was the rapid kinetics of R-S integration and disintegration compared to the reverse L-R integration is consistent with the two reactions being coupled. We have now rephrased this sentence as below.</p><p>Page 30, lines 431-434. “The prominence of disintegration (DP; 92 nt) and the rapid kinetics of disintegration and the second integration at the R-S junction (IP(R-S); 81 nt) (Figure 5A) suggest that the two events are potentially coupled.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With the exception of Figure 6, there are no markers, or sequence reaction products, on any of the acrylamide gels presented in the manuscript. It's therefore impossible for the reader to evaluate the size of any of the bands for themselves. This information should be included in any revised manuscript at least at the first instance of a particular sized product.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included size markers in the revised Figure 2 (also Figure 2—figure supplement 3) showing reactions with the linear target site. The markers run in the ‘M’ lanes of these figures are synthetic oligonucleotides of the predicted sequences for proto-spacer strand insertions at the L-R or R-S junction.</p><p>We have kept the reaction conditions similar to those used by Wright and Doudna (2016). The migration of the two product bands from the linear target site (Figure 2, for example; see 1B under ‘General comments’, reviewer 1) are consistent only with proto-spacer integration at the L-R junction (IP(L-R)) or at the R-S junction (IP(R-S)). Based on the sizes of the ‘Leader’, ‘Repeat’ and “Spacer’ segments in the target, the sizes of (IP(L-R)) and (IP(R-S)) can only be 89 nt and 81 nt, respectively, as marked in the original Figure 2 (now revised). Furthermore, the authenticity of the integration products is substantiated by the reactions shown in Figure 3. Here, when the target site is modified to alter the spacing between L-R and R-S junctions, the integration products at L-R remain but those at R-S disappear.</p><p>The trombone substrates used in Figure 6 are very different from substrates used by Wright and Doudna (2016) or in any other published study. Here size markers were important to verify the prediction that the products with and without disintegration will differ precisely by 26 nt (the size of the pre-integrated proto-spacer strand).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experiments described in Figure S8 lack a Cas1 dead control. It's important to remove the possibility that the observed cleavage pattern results from a contaminating nuclease.</p></disp-quote><p>We did try dCas1-Cas2 in the cleavage reactions using PAM-containing substrates. However, no meaningful conclusion could be drawn because the background of non-specific cleavage (seen with the Cas1-Cas2 complex) was increased in this case. We suspect that dCas1 stimulates endonucleolytic cleavage by Cas2. Note that even in reactions with Cas1-Cas2 (in Figure S8; original number), the PAM-specific cleavage was not exclusive, only significantly above random cleavage.</p><p>The cleavage mechanism that generates integration-competent proto-spacer ends is far from settled at present. The <italic>E. coli</italic> Cas1-Cas2 appears to perform this task (Wang et al., 2015, Cell 163: 840-853), as would be consistent with our results shown in Figure S8 using S. pyogenes Cas1-Cas2. However, the latest study attributes cleavage in the S. pyogenes system to Cas9 or to bacterial nuclease(s) that have not been characterized (Jakhanwal, et al., 2021, Nucleic Acids Res, in press). The interpretation of these assays were based on the recovery of integrated proto-spacers in vivo in bacteria transformed with in vitro treated DNA substrates (which further complicates the situation).</p><p>Given the uncertainties surrounding pre-spacer to proto-spacer conversion, and the lack of in vitro integration coupled to PAM-specific cleavage, we have removed the original Figure S8 from the revised manuscript. We have now addressed the properties of PAM-containing substrates in the in vitro reactions shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 3 (new) and the corresponding description under ‘Results’ (starting at line 265, page 16; ‘Cas1-Cas2 activity on pre-spacer mimics containing the PAM sequence’).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of the experiments are difficult to follow. For example it took me a long time to really understand the experiments in Figure 6, which are really elegant experiments but difficult to follow. I worry that this limits the accessibility of this work. I would encourage the authors to reevaluate how experiments are presented such that they are accessible to a broad audience. It would be helpful to not have to refer to a supplemental figure to understand the main figure i.e. the main figures should be self-contained.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that schematics of the long and short second integration products would make it easier for the reader to follow the experiments and the results. We have now added these schematics in Figure 6B, C against the product bands.</p><p>We have also revised and expanded the description of the experimental design to make them more easily accessible to the non-specialist reader. In particular, we have underscored the distinction between integrations of the second proto-spacer strand with or without disintegration of the first. Disintegration shortens the size of the product by the length of the disintegrated strand, 26 nt.</p><p>Page 32, lines 478-490. “The predicted products of the second integration event in a trombone substrate would differ by 26 nt (the size of the integrated proto-spacer strand), depending on whether it is associated with disintegration or not. Labeling the 5’-end of the proto-spacer strand integrated at L-R can only reveal integration at R-S without disintegration at L-R. The size of this product analyzed on a denaturing gel will be 183 nt (26 nt + 26 nt protospacer + 36 nt + 36 nt repeat + 10 nt spacer + 30 nt tether + 11 nt leader + 8 nt extension to leader). If integration at R-S were to be accompanied by disintegration at L-R, the predicted 157 nt product would be invisible as the release of the spacer strand (26 nt) results in the loss of the radioactive label as well. Labeling the 3’-end of the bottom strand containing the R-S junction target site (by adding one 32P-labeled nucleotide in a Klenow polymerase reaction) would reveal integration events coupled to disintegration (158 nt) or uncoupled from it (184 nt).

What reaction(s) were performed for lanes 3-7?</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose here was to estimate potential DNA unwinding of the integration target by the bound Cas1-Cas2 complex. Experimentally, the more relaxed topoisomer distribution of the supercoiled target plasmid (containing the CRISPR locus) resulting from the proto-spacer plus Cas1-Cas2 reaction is compared to the equilibrium relaxed distribution formed by strand sealing of the nicked form of the same plasmid by T4 ligase. The difference between the two distributions gives the torsional stress (writhe plus twist) sequestered by the interaction of Cas1-Cas2 with its target. Lane 3 of Figure 1F shows the reference relaxed distribution formed upon nick closure by ligase. Lanes 4-7 show the distributions formed when the nicked plasmid pre-incubated with the indicated proteins (with or without the proto-spacer) is sealed by ligase. The center of the topoisomer distributions in lanes 3-7 is very nearly the same, indicating that any topological constraint imposed by Cas1-Cas2 on the target is dissipated via the nick before strand sealing. Following incubation with Cas1-Cas2/proto-spacer, the supercoiled plasmid is relaxed (lane 8), but not to the same extent as the nicked plasmid sealed by ligase. The distribution formed by Cas1-Cas2 is more negatively supercoiled, indicating DNA unwinding by Cas1-Cas2.</p><p>We have now explained the experimental rationale in more detail as follows.</p><p>Page 7, lines 163-169. “We probed linking number changes (ΔLks) accompanying Cas1- Cas2-mediated integration-disintegration in a supercoiled target plasmid and T4 ligase-mediated strand closure in the nicked form of the same plasmid with or without bound Cas1-Cas2. Provided the Cas1-Cas2-induced topological stress within a target site is stable throughout the reaction, it will be preserved in the plasmid topoisomers formed by integration-disintegration (Figure 1B, C). In principle, the target topology in a Cas1-Cas2-bound nicked plasmid may also be captured by resealing the nick with DNA ligase.”</p><p>Page 11, lines 194-204. “Strand sealing in the nicked plasmid was performed by T4 ligase without added factors (Figure 1F; lane 3) or after pre-incubation with the indicated Cas proteins and/or the proto-spacer (Figure 1F; lanes 4-7). Nearly identical topoisomer distributions were obtained after ligation in the absence of Cas1-Cas2 (Figure 1F; lane 3) or in the presence of either Cas1-Cas2 (Figure 1F; lanes 5) or the catalytically inactive dCas1-Cas2 (Figure 1F; lane 6).</p><p>Addition of protospacer by itself (Figure 1F; lane 4) or together with dCas1-Cas2 (Figure 1F; lane 7) to the ligase reaction did not alter this distribution. The topoisomer distribution of the Cas1-Cas2 plus proto-spacer treated supercoiled plasmid (Figure 1F; lane 8) was more negatively supercoiled (ΔLk between -1 and -2) than that obtained from nick closure in the presence of dCas1-Cas2 and proto-spacer (Figure 1F; lane 7) (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The centers of the distributions seem to differ by more than 1 step to me, but I may have misunderstood what is being compared.</p></disp-quote><p>Marking the centers of the topoisomer distributions is tricky because of the inherent difficulty in adjusting the base lines for the peaks in the densitometric tracings. The individual topoisomers in the Cas1-Cas2 reaction are offset by ΔLk = ~0.5 relative to those in the ligase reaction (note the stagger between the bands in lanes 7 and 8 in Figure 1F). The difference in the relaxed distributions formed by ligase and by Cas1-Cas2 is between 1 and 2 negative supercoils. This ΔLk value is indicated in Figure S2 , and noted in the revised text detailed below:</p><p>Page 11, lines 201-204. “The topoisomer distribution of the Cas1-Cas2 plus proto-spacer treated supercoiled plasmid (Figure 1F; lane 8) was more negatively supercoiled (ΔLk between -1 and -2) than that obtained from nick closure in the presence of dCas1-Cas2 and proto-spacer (Figure 1F; lane 7) (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).”</p><p>Pages 11-12, lines 209-214. “The observed ΔLk between the Cas1-Cas2 relaxed and T4 ligase sealed plasmid distributions (Figure 1F; Figure 1—figure supplement 2) is consistent with the unwinding of a little more than one DNA turn within the target sequence during proto-spacer integration. This torsional strain may promote the formation of the repair-ready intermediate in which single stranded repeat sequences flank the inserted proto-spacer (Figure 1A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2. What is the evidence that additional product bands differ by 1 and 2 nucleotides for the nicked target?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not characterized the additional product bands in the reactions with the nicked target site (now Figure 2—figure supplement 2). However, a reasonable explanation for their formation, consistent with their gel mobilities, is strand transfer to either of the two phosphodiester bonds between the authentic phosphodiester target and the nick.</p><p>In the schematic diagram of the nicked target (from Figure S4), the normal target phosphodiester (p) and the two neighboring ones (p) towards the nick (marked by the short vertical arrow) are indicated on the top and bottom strands. The sequences flanking the nicks are shown in red for the leader (L), yellow for the repeat (R) and blue for the spacer (S). The normal proto-spacer integrant at the L-R junction and the aberrant ones (one nucleotide or two nucleotides into the leader) are 89, 90 and 91 nt long, respectively. The corresponding lengths for the integrants at the R-S junction and at the adjacent phosphodiesters in the spacer are 81, 82 and 83 nt.</p><p>The potential origin of the extra integration products from the nicked target is explained under “Results’ and in Supplementary Text S2 associated with the legend to Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><p>Pages 15-16, lines 243-249. “The nick-containing target yielded, in addition to the 81 nt and 89 nt products expected from the standard linear target (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B), product bands migrating slightly higher than each (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, C). These extra bands, though uncharacterized, are consistent with potential integration events at the two phosphodiester positions between an authentic phosphodiester target and its proximal nick (Supplementary Text S2 under Figure 2—figure supplement 2). The flexibility afforded by the nick could presumably facilitate these aberrant integration events.</p><p>Pages 53, lines 889-895. “Text S2. The uncharacterized doublet bands migrating above the 81nt and 89 nt products could indicate integrations at phosphodiester positions marked as ‘p’ in the nicked target. The expected product lengths for the upper doublet are 90 nt and 91 nt, and those for the lower doublet are 82 nt and 83 nt. The slightly uneven spacing of the 82 nt and 83 nt bands from the 81 nt band is likely due to the size difference in the additional base(s) they harbor. The 82 nt and 81 nt products differ by an extra ‘A’ gained from the spacer. The second additional base present in the 83 nt product is the smaller ‘C’.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It doesn't look like 3-fold more integration; is this a visual estimate or was quantitation done?</p></disp-quote><p>The quantitation for the nicked target includes the authentic plus aberrant integration products; that for the unnicked target comprises only the authentic products (no aberrant products are formed in this reaction).

We have now changed ‘~3 fold’ to ‘2- to 3-fold’:</p><p>Page 16, lines 249-251. “The amount of the integration product (normal plus aberrant) was increased 2- to 3-fold in comparison to the normal product formed from the target without a nick.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the case that the second integration step is coupled to disintegration of the first, the authors state that the two integration products would be equal at steady state.

However, as the present work demonstrates, integration at R-S is most often associated with disintegration at L-R (mediated by the 3’-OH or by water). Once integrated at R-S, the protospacer strand can reverse-integrate at L-R with accompanying disintegration at R-S. Over time, these oscillations will equalize integrations at L-R and R-S, even though at early times integrations at L-R would exceed those at R-S.</p><p>We have now added the following clarification to the text.</p><p>Page 16, lines 256-260. “A third possibility is that, within an intermediate containing a semi-integrant, integration of the second strand is coupled to disintegration of the first.

Repair of the product of a second site integration followed by a 3'-OH mediated disintegration at the first site would likely not yield the correct CRISPR array structure. Hydrolysis coupled to an eventual second site integration would yield an intermediate that could be repaired to give the correct array structure. Thus, the reversible disintegration reaction involving the 3'-OH doesn't really seem to play a role in the proposed pathway. The simple conclusion that Cas1/2 catalyzed hydrolysis of a phosphodiester may relieve strain and allow productive transposition to occur doesn't get emphasized enough in my opinion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly notes that hydrolysis coupled to the second integration (or disintegration by water nucleophile) is crucial in generating the intermediate that can be repaired to give the correct proto-spacer insertion without disarranging the CRISPR array. However, we disagree with the assertion that disintegration carried out by the 3’-OH has no role in proto-spacer insertion. To simplify the explanation, we have split the relevant parts of Figure 8 into panels A-C.</p><p>Panel A shows disintegration by water at the leader-repeat (L-R) junction—the first integration site--and integration at the repeat-spacer (R-S) junction (the second integration site).</p><p>This generates the proper DNA intermediate for repair (as the reviewer concurs). Panel B shows the same second integration reaction, this time disintegration at L-R being mediated by the 3’-OH. This step by itself cannot promote proto-spacer integration by DNA repair (as the reviewer rightly argues). However, the reaction restores the L-R junction, making integration in the R-S to L-R direction now possible (panel C). This reverse integration, accompanied by water mediated disintegration at R-S, will generate a productive repair intermediate (analogous to that in A). Thus, both types of disintegration (hydrolysis and transesterification) contribute to proto-spacer insertion, though in quite different ways.</p><p>The relevant text under ‘Discussion’ and revisions in the legend to Figure 8 further clarify this explanation.</p><p>Page 41, lines 580-590. “Water-mediated disintegration of the proto-spacer at the L-R junction during strand transfer to the R-S junction will produce an intermediate with a gap in the bottom strand and a gap plus nick in the top strand (Figure 8; left). An analogous intermediate with the gap plus nick in the bottom strand may also be formed (Figure 8; right). Here, a proto-spacer is first transferred to the R-S junction with concomitant 3’-hydroxyl-mediated disintegration from the L-R junction (and restoration of this junction). This is followed by a subsequent integration in the reverse direction, with disintegration at the R-S junction promoted by water. The spacer insertion event can be completed by gap-filling/displacement DNA synthesis followed by ligation (Figure 8). Thus, disintegration reactions mediated by the 3’-hydroxyl and by water are both relevant, though in mechanistically distinct ways, to the rescue of semi-integrated proto-spacers into fully integrated spacers.”</p><p>Page 47, lines 741-751. “Figure 8 legend. A model for disintegration-assisted integration. Integration of the proto-spacer by Cas1-Cas2 is predominantly one-ended. Following the initial strand transfer to the L-R junction, transfer of the second strand to the R-S junction is associated with disintegration at L-R. Oscillations of the semi-integrated proto-spacer become possible when disintegration mediated by the 3’-hydroxyl reforms the L-R or R-S junction at the disintegration site. Disintegration mediated by water during a second strand transfer step will block oscillations. However, the nick between L and R or R and S will be preserved, and can be utilized by DNA repair machineries to complete proto-spacer insertion. Formation of the repair-suitable intermediate shown at the left is dependent only on water-mediated disintegration, the 3’-hydroxyl-mediated disintegration being dispensable. However, both types of disintegration are required to generate the intermediate shown at the right.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
