roles in the biogeochemical cycling of elements. The interactions between phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria affect the fitness of both partners. It is becoming increasingly recognized that metabolic exchange determines the nature of such interactions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain underexplored. Here, we investigated the molecular and metabolic basis for the bacterial lifestyle switch, from coexistence to pathogenicity, in <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 during its interaction with <italic>Emiliania huxleyi</italic>, a cosmopolitan bloom-forming phytoplankter. To unravel the bacterial lifestyle switch, we analyzed bacterial transcriptomes in response to exudates derived from algae in exponential growth and stationary phase, which supported the <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 coexistence and pathogenicity lifestyles, respectively. In pathogenic mode, <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 upregulated flagellar motility and diverse transport systems, presumably to maximize assimilation of <italic>E. huxleyi</italic>-derived metabolites released by algal cells upon cell death. Algal dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) was a pivotal signaling molecule that mediated the transition between the lifestyles, supporting our previous findings. However, the coexisting and pathogenic lifestyles were evident only in the presence of additional algal metabolites. Specifically, we discovered that algae-produced benzoate promoted the growth of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 and hindered the DMSP-induced lifestyle switch to pathogenicity, demonstrating that benzoate is important for maintaining the coexistence of algae and bacteria. We propose that bacteria can sense the physiological state of the algal host through changes in the metabolic composition, which will determine the bacterial lifestyle during interaction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chemical communication</kwd><kwd>opportunistic pathogen</kwd><kwd>Roseobacter</kwd><kwd>phytoplankton</kwd><kwd>DMSP</kwd><kwd>Benzoate</kwd><kwd>marine</kwd><kwd>algal blooms</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Emiliania huxleyi</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Sulfitobacter </italic>D7</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>681715</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vardi</surname><given-names>Assaf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101053543</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vardi</surname><given-names>Assaf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Opportunistic bacteria modulate their lifestyle from coexistence to pathogenicity by perceiving the physiological state of their algal host through sensing of algal secreted metabolites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Half of Earth’s photosynthesis takes place in the marine environment by phytoplankton – photosynthetic single-celled algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Field et al., 1998</xref>). Phytoplankton have great ecological importance by forming the basis of marine food webs and influencing biogeochemical cycles. Therefore, the biotic interactions phytoplankton engage in, and the metabolic exchange that governs them, have immense impacts on large-scale biogeochemical processes. Phytoplankton are a main source of organic matter in the marine environment, thus fueling the growth and functioning of heterotrophic bacteria that interact with them through chemical exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cirri and Pohnert, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Seymour et al., 2017</xref>). Chemical communication takes place in the phycosphere – the diffusive boundary layer that surrounds algal cells, where molecules can accumulate to high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bell and Mitchell, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Seymour et al., 2017</xref>). Studies on algae-bacteria interactions revealed that the partners often exchange growth substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Landa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Segev et al., 2016</xref>), essential vitamins and nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Croft et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), and infochemicals (molecules that convey information) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barak-Gavish et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pohnert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Seyedsayamdost et al., 2011</xref>). Bacteria have developed mechanisms of foraging for phytoplankton cells, such as motility and chemotaxis, and cell-surface attachment mechanisms to maintain close association within the phycosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Furusawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mayali et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Miller and Belas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Slightom and Buchan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sonnenschein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Stocker and Seymour, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Marine bacteria from the <italic>Rhodobacteraceae</italic> family, often termed the Roseobacter group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Simon et al., 2017</xref>), are found to be associated with phytoplankton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alavi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Behringer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Buchan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Geng and Belas, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">González and Moran, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Rink et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Vincent et al., 2021</xref>). They are metabolically versatile and specialize on algae-derived substrates that promote interactions with phytoplankton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Newton et al., 2010</xref>). The organosulfur molecule dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), produced by many phytoplankton species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Keller, 1989</xref>), is especially known to mediate Roseobacter-phytoplankton interactions by serving as a carbon and sulfur source, as a chemotaxis cue, and as an infochemical for the presence of algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barak-Gavish et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Bürgmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Landa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Miller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Miller and Belas, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Seymour et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sule and Belas, 2013</xref>). In mutualistic interactions, algae provide organic matter such as sugars, amino acids, sulfonates, and polyamines for bacterial growth. In exchange, Roseobacters produce essential B-vitamins and growth promoting factors such as indole-3-acetic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cooper et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Durham et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Landa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wagner-Döbler et al., 2010</xref>). In recent years, cumulating studies that investigated the interactions of phytoplankton and bacteria in co-cultures revealed that some Roseobacters display a lifestyle switch from mutualism to pathogenicity toward the algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barak-Gavish et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bolch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bramucci et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mayers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Segev et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). This occurs when the algal host reaches stationary phase and is mediated by infochemicals. For example, Roseobacters can produce potent algicidal compounds, termed roseobacticides, in response to <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, an aromatic lignin breakdown product released by aging algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Seyedsayamdost et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sule and Belas, 2013</xref>). While this bacterial lifestyle switch, often termed the “Jekyll-and-Hyde” phenotype, seems to be a recurring phenomenon, knowledge about the bacterial behavior in the different modes of interaction and the regulation of such lifestyle switch are still rudimentary.</p><p>In the current study, we investigated the behavior of the Roseobacter <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7, during interaction with <italic>Emiliania huxleyi</italic>, a cosmopolitan bloom-forming phytoplankter. <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> has a significant role in biogeochemical cycling of carbon and sulfur. It produces the climatically active gas dimethyl sulfide and its precursor DMSP, both function as infochemicals during interactions with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barak-Gavish et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shemi et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> sp. are associated with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> in nature, and <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 was isolated from a natural <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> bloom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ankrah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barak-Gavish et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ku et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Vincent et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, this ecologically relevant model provides a tractable system to examine how metabolic exchange regulates the nature of interactions between algae and bacteria. Our previous work revealed that <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 displays a lifestyle switch, from coexistence to pathogenicity, during its interaction with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barak-Gavish et al., 2018</xref>). We found that algal DMSP, which usually mediates mutualistic interactions, plays a pivotal role by invoking bacterial pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barak-Gavish et al., 2018</xref>). Bacterial genes related to DMSP uptake and catabolism have been investigated in many studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Curson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Howard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Reisch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Todd et al., 2007</xref>), but the regulation of DMSP-responsive genes and their interplay with bacterial lifestyle and behavior during interactions with algae is yet to be explored. We performed a transcriptomics experiment that enabled us to elucidate the bacterial response to algal infochemicals and to characterize DMSP-responsive and pathogenicity-related genes. We revealed the signaling role of DMSP that led to a systemic remodeling of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 gene expression but only in the presence of additional algal metabolites. Overall, we unraveled the transcriptional signature of the switch from coexistence to a pathogenic bacterial lifestyle during interaction with their algal host and provide insights into the ecological context of this mode of interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>E. huxleyi</italic>-derived exudates induce remodeling of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 transcriptome</title><p>The interaction between <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 and <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> displays two distinct phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Initially, there is a coexisting phase in which the alga grows exponentially, and the bacterium grows as well. The interaction shifts to pathogenic when the virulence of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 toward <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> is invoked upon exposure to high concentrations of algal DMSP, which occurs when the alga reaches stationary phase or when DMSP is applied exogenously to algae in exponential growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barak-Gavish et al., 2018</xref>). We aimed to unravel the response of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 to the pathogenicity-inducing compound, DMSP, and to different alga-derived infochemicals that affect the lifestyle of the bacterium. We grew <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 in conditioned media (CM) derived from algal cultures at exponential and stationary phase (Exp-CM and Stat-CM, respectively), in which DMSP concentration is low and high, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barak-Gavish et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This enabled us to dissect the interaction with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> into its different phases, that is, Exp-CM represents the coexisting phase, and Stat-CM represents the pathogenic phase. An additional pathogenicity-inducing treatment was Exp-CM supplemented with 100 µM DMSP (herein Exp-CM + DMSP). This condition mimicked co-cultures to which we added DMSP exogenously and thus induced <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 pathogenicity, which led to the death of exponentially growing <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). While the concentration of DMSP measured in natural seawater is typically in the tens of nanomolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barak-Gavish et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kettle et al., 1999</xref>), algae-derived compounds are present in higher concentrations in the phycosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Seymour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Stocker, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the concentrations of DMSP measured in axenic stationary phase <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> cultures reach up to 70 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barak-Gavish et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore argue that the 100 µM concentration used in our study is appropriate and ecologically relevant, especially in light of the high densities of the algal and bacterial cultures used in our experimental system.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transcriptional profiling of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 in response to dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and additional <italic>Emiliania huxleyi</italic> infochemicals reveals the signaling role of DMSP.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Time course of <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> CCMP379 and bacterial abundance (full and dashed lines, left and right axes, respectively) in algal mono-cultures or during co-culturing with <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7.

Therefore, we grew <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 in defined minimal medium (MM), which lacks algal metabolites, supplemented it with 100 µM DMSP (herein MM + DMSP), and examined the transcriptional response.

Principle component analysis (PCA), based on the overall expression profile, showed a clear separation between the different CM treatments, while the MM ± DMSP samples clustered together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Pearson correlation analyses of all samples indicated high correlation between the triplicates of each treatment, and hierarchical clustering showed that MM samples clustered separately from the CM samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among the CM samples, Stat-CM and Exp-CM + DMSP clustered together and had higher correlation to each other compared to Exp-CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The DE genes were separated into four clusters, based on k-means clustering, and we assessed the enrichment in KEGG pathways in each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Cluster 1 contained 197 genes that were responsive to DMSP, namely DE in the Exp-CM±DMSP and the MM ±DMSP comparisons. Interestingly, the expression pattern of cluster 1 genes in response to DMSP was largely different: in Exp-CM, DMSP led to downregulation, while in MM it led to upregulation. The differential effect of DMSP in Exp-CM and MM is also visualized in the PCA and is evident by the number of DE genes in each comparison: 968 genes were DE between Exp-CM vs. Exp-CM+DMSP, while only 170 genes were DE between MM vs. MM +DMSP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Since the metabolic composition of these two media was profoundly different, it suggests that the effect of DMSP signaling depends on the simultaneous perception of other metabolites.

This cluster was enriched with genes related to the phenylalanine metabolism pathway, and specifically to phenylacetic acid (PAA) degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>). PAA is a phytohormone that can potentially promote algal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Cook, 2019</xref>), and PAA metabolism in bacteria relates to production of secondary metabolites that can affect algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Thiel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Clusters 3 and 4 contained 264 and 396 genes, respectively, that were mainly upregulated in Exp-CM +DMSP and Stat-CM compared to Exp-CM, and we consider these as pathogenicity-related clusters. Cluster 4 also contained genes that were highly expressed in MM ±DMSP. Cluster 3 was enriched with genes encoding for ABC transporters and ribosomal proteins, and cluster 4 was enriched with flagellar genes and genes related to oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>). The enrichment in genes encoding for ribosomal proteins and an F-type ATPase, related to oxidative phosphorylation, in the pathogenicity-related clusters suggests that during the pathogenic lifestyle <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 may be more metabolically active than in the coexistence lifestyle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>). Overall, this transcriptomics experimental setup enabled us to capture the gene expression of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 in coexistence and pathogenicity modes. Moreover, it demonstrated the pivotal role of DMSP in regulating gene expression, which depends also on the chemical environment. In <italic>E. huxleyi</italic>-derived CM, DMSP led to major changes in <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 transcriptome, while in MM, which lacked additional algal metabolites, DMSP had a minor effect on gene expression.

Namely, in both Exp-CM and MM, DMSP induced remodeling of the transporter repertoire. The fact that the addition of a single metabolite, that is DMSP, led to DE of a multitude of transporters for various metabolite classes demonstrates the signaling role of DMSP. When we examined the amount of DE transport genes that were shared between the comparisons of the DMSP-supplemented treatments, we found only eight genes that were DE in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Namely, DMSP led to a shift in transporter gene expression in both media, but the identity of the DE transporters was unique for each medium. This strengthens our hypothesis that the DMSP signal affects bacterial gene expression, but the activation of the coexistence and pathogenicity transcriptional profiles depends on additional algal metabolites.</p><p>The differential effect of DMSP in Exp-CM and MM was especially notable in the expression of the DMSP transporters (betaine-carnitine-choline transporters; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kiene et al., 1998</xref>), which were significantly upregulated in Stat-CM and Exp-CM +DMSP, where DMSP was present at high concentrations compared to Exp-CM.

All the genes in this benzoate-degradation gene cluster were expressed in CM treatments. Interestingly, the transporter of benzoate, which is encoded by a chromosomal gene, was also expressed in all CM, therefore it is not affected by the DMSP signal, as was observed for other transport systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Addition of only benzoate did not alter the dynamics of algal growth, but bacterial growth was enhanced at day 4, compared to the non-supplemented and DMSP-supplemented co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>).

When we applied both benzoate and DMSP in equimolar concentrations, the algal cultures declined from day 8 onward, that is, the induction of pathogenicity by DMSP was delayed by 4 days, as compared to the DMSP addition in the absence of benzoate. This suggests that benzoate hinders the pathogenicity-inducing effect of DMSP. To further support this observation, we examined the interaction of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 with a different <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> strain, CCMP2090, with which the bacterial lifestyle switch does not naturally occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We substantiated the signaling role of algal DMSP that mediates the shift toward pathogenicity by mapping the transcriptional profiles of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 in response to DMSP and other algal metabolites. However, DMSP signaling in medium that lacked <italic>E. huxleyi</italic>-derived metabolites (i.e. MM +DMSP) had a different effect on <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 transcriptome. We propose that the signaling role of DMSP that mediates the coexistence to pathogenicity lifestyle switch in <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 depends on other infochemicals produced by <italic>E. huxleyi</italic>. DMSP is a ubiquitous infochemical produced by many phytoplankton species as well as some bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Curson et al., 2017</xref>), making it a prevalent signaling molecule that mediates microbial interactions in the marine environment. Therefore, it is likely that other algal metabolites are involved in the recognition of the specific phytoplankter host by bacteria, thus ensuring specificity in DMSP signaling during alga-bacteria interactions. In natural environments, where many microbial species are present simultaneously, such a mechanism can ensure that bacteria will invest in altering gene expression and metabolic remodeling only when the right algal partners are present.</p><p>We revealed that the alga-derived aromatic compound benzoate plays a pivotal role in <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7-<italic>E. huxleyi</italic> interaction by maintaining the coexistence, even when DMSP is present at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Benzoate also acts as an efficient bacterial growth factor serving as a carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These observations provide a possible explanation for the switch in bacterial behavior from coexistence to pathogenicity. During the interaction, <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> provides benzoate and other growth substrates to <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7, which uptakes and consumes them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We propose that as long as <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 benefits from the interaction with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> by receiving beneficial growth substrates, it will maintain a coexisting lifestyle.

In nutrient limiting conditions, which often occur in stationary phase, the organic matter exuded by phytoplankton is less favorable for bacterial uptake and consumption for growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Obernosterer and Herndl, 1995</xref>). In such a chemical context, high concentrations of algae-derived infochemicals, for example, DMSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barak-Gavish et al., 2018</xref>) or <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Seyedsayamdost et al., 2011</xref>), can be perceived by bacteria and signal that the physiological state of the algal host is deteriorating. Namely, by sensing the changes in the metabolic composition of the phycosphere during the interaction, <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 executes its pathogenicity against a compromised <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> population. Therefore, the initial metabolic exchange in the coexistence phase is a prerequisite for the onset of bacterial pathogenicity.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Conceptual model of the lifestyle switch of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 in response to <italic>Emiliania huxleyi</italic>-derived metabolites.</title><p>During its interactions with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic>, <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 exhibits a lifestyle switch from coexistence to pathogenicity. In the coexistence phase, <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> secretes to the phycosphere various metabolites such as benzoate, dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), and other growth substrates, which bacteria can uptake and consume for growth. Based on the observation that benzoate hindered the pathogenicity-inducing effect of DMSP, we hypothesize that such energy-rich metabolic currencies hinder DMSP signaling in <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7. When the algal physiological state is compromised, for example, stationary phase, the amount of available growth substrates decreases, due to bacterial consumption and less secretion by the alga. In this context, high concentration of algal DMSP acts as a signal that alters the transcriptional profiles of the bacterium and leads to high expression of pathogenicity-related genes, such as flagellar and transport genes, and yet unknown virulence factors that kill <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> cells. This leads to a surge of alga-derived growth substrates that are taken up efficiently by <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7. The flagellum can mediate the dispersal of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 and to forage for an alternative host.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84400-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The ability to utilize benzoate is shared among bacterial strains that are associated with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> in the natural environment and in cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Green et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Orata et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rosana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Vincent et al., 2021</xref>). Since benzoate can act as an antibacterial compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amin and Abolmaaty, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Haque et al., 2005</xref>), we propose that secretion of benzoate by <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> can select for bacteria that specialize on this compound and is therefore important for the establishment of a coexistence phase. Similarly, the diatom <italic>Asterionellopsis glacialis</italic> produces two secondary metabolites that select for specific bacteria and affect their behavioral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Shibl et al., 2020</xref>). Bacterial sensing of general phytoplankton-derived compounds (e.g. DMSP) together with additional more selective compounds (e.g. benzoate) can ensure the recognition of the algal host by the bacteria within the phycosphere. This can increase the specificity of an interaction and ensure fine-tuning of the behavior of microorganisms by regulating gene expression. This is especially relevant for DMSP that has diverse functions in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barak-Gavish et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kessler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Miller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Miller and Belas, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Seymour et al., 2010</xref>).

Many transport systems were DE, mainly upregulated, when <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 was in pathogenic state compared to the coexistence state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Since bacteria often exert their pathogenicity as a means to access nutrients released from the host, it is likely that in this mode <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 will maximize uptake and assimilation of metabolites released by dying <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> cells. High expression of transporters for branched-chain amino acids, C4 carbohydrates, DMSP, taurine, and polyamines can facilitate the efficient uptake of these energy-rich metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

While DMSP is a known chemoattractant and therefore mediates the establishment of bacterial interactions with algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Miller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Seymour et al., 2010</xref>), we speculate that this is not the case for <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7, since its genome does not encode for known chemotaxis genes. We propose that the increased motility in response to DMSP in the pathogenic mode can serve as an ecological strategy to escape from competition with other bacteria in the phycosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Yawata et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> cell death, induced by <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7, likely leads to a surge of intracellular metabolites that may attract other bacteria. The upregulation of transport systems together with flagellar motility can enable efficient substrate uptake by <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 and swimming away to forage for alternative metabolically active hosts.

Even though <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 motility was increased in the pathogenic mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the involvement of the flagellum may be by other functions that mediate bacterial virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chaban et al., 2015</xref>); that is, flagella can mediate biofilm formation and attachment to surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, the flagellar type 3 secretion system, which is found in the basal body and necessary for secretion of the components needed for flagellum assembly, can also be used as an export system for effector proteins in pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Diepold and Armitage, 2015</xref>). In this manner, pathogenic bacteria may utilize the flagellum for multiple functions important for pathogenicity against their hosts and subsequent dispersal.</p><p>The mechanism of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 pathogenicity against <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> remains to be discovered. The genome of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 encodes numerous cellular machineries, such as type 2 secretion system (T2SS), Flp (fimbrial low-molecular-weight protein) pilus, and two type 4 secretion systems, which can potentially mediate cell-cell interactions and possibly bacterial virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Backert and Meyer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cianciotto and White, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ku et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tomich et al., 2007</xref>).

In this study, we provide a contextual framework for the switch from coexistence to pathogenicity – metabolite depletion in the phycosphere. During a phytoplankton bloom, heterotrophic bacteria can support the growth of the algae and benefit from organic matter released to the phycosphere. As the bloom progresses, various factors, such as nutrient depletion, viral infection, and grazing, can compromise the algal population and its ability to provide essential metabolic currencies for optimal bacterial growth. We propose that bacteria can sense the host's physiological state, by infochemicals secreted from stressed algae, and switch their behavior to pathogenicity. This will result in algal cell death and bacterial proliferation, which could eventually contribute to the bloom demise. Therefore, phytoplankton-associated opportunistic bacterial pathogens constitute an underappreciated component in the regulation of algal blooms dynamics. Investigating the dynamic microscale interactions of such bacteria with phytoplankton and the metabolic crosstalk that mediates them can provide insights into their impact on large scale biogeochemical processes in the marine environment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Bacteria grown in CM were plated on the corresponding semi-solid CM (0.3% agarose), and bacteria grown in ½MB were plated on each semi-solid CM. For plating, 1 µL of bacteria were pipetted in the center of each well containing semi-solid media, in 10–12 replicates per treatment. Colonies were visualized with ×2 magnification after 6 days using Nikon SMZ18 Steriomicroscope.

For control, we also sampled uninoculated medium in triplicates. To quantify extracellular benzoate concentrations, bacterial cultures or uninoculated media were gently filtered, acidified, and led through solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuhlisch et al., 2021</xref> per sample, 50 mL culture was passed through 0.22 µm polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) filters, collected in glass Erlenmeyer flasks, and spiked with 5 µL benzoate-d<sub>5</sub> (98%, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Tewsbury, MA, USA; 1.276 µg/µL in MeOH) as internal standard (IS; 1 µM final concentration). The filtrates were incubated for 30 min and then acidified to pH 2.0 using 10% HCl. Benzoate was extracted using hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced SPE cartridges (Oasis HLB, 200 mg, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) as follows: cartridges were conditioned (6 mL methanol), equilibrated (6 mL 0.01 N HCl), and loaded by gravity with the acidified samples (45 min). The cartridges were then washed (18 mL 0.01 N HCl), dried completely using a vacuum pump, and gravity-eluted with 2×2 mL methanol into 4 mL glass vials. Eluates were stored at –20°C overnight, dried under a flow of nitrogen at 0.5 mL/min and 30°C (TurboVap LV, Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden), and stored at –20°C until further processing. Glassware and chemically resistant equipment were used whenever possible and cleaned with HCl (1 or 10%) and Deconex 20 NS-x (Borer Chemie, Zuchwil, Switzerland) to reduce contaminations.</p><p>For LC-MS analysis, the dried extracts were thawed, re-dissolved in 300 µL methanol:water (1:1, v:v), vortexed, sonicated for 10 min, and centrifuged at 3200 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatants were transferred to 200 μL glass inserts in autosampler vials and analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-electrospray ionization(ESI)-high resolution mass spectrometry. An aliquot of 1 µL was analyzed using UPLC coupled to a photodiode array (PDA) detector (ACQUITY UPLC I-Class, Waters) and a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (SYNAPT G2 HDMS, Waters), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kuhlisch et al., 2021</xref>) with slight modifications. Chromatographic separation was carried out using an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (100×2.1 mm, 1.7 µm; Waters) attached to a VanGuard pre-column (5×2.1 mm, 1.7 µm; Waters). The mobile phase, at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min, consisted of water (mobile phase A) and acetonitrile (mobile phase B), both with 0.1% formic acid, and set as follows: a liner gradient from 100 to 75% A in 20 min, from 75 to 0% A in 6 min, 2 min of 100% B, and 2 min to return to the initial conditions and re-equilibrate the column. The PDA detector was set to 200–600 nm. A divert valve (Rheodyne) excluded 0–1 min and 25.5–30 min from injection to the mass spectrometer. The ESI source was operated in negative ESI mode (ESI<sup>−</sup>) and set to 140°C source and 450°C desolvation temperature, 1.0 kV capillary voltage, and 27 eV cone voltage, using nitrogen as desolvation gas (800 L/hr) and cone gas (10 L/hr). The mass spectrometer was operated in full scan MS<sup>E</sup> resolution mode with a mass range of 50–1600 Da and the mass resolution tuned to 23,000 at m/z 554 alternating with 0.1 min scan time between low- (4 eV collision energy) and high-energy scan function (collision energy ramp of 15–50 eV).</p><p>An external calibration curve was processed in parallel to the biological samples. Aliquots of 100 mL ASW were spiked with 10 µL benzoate-d<sub>5</sub> (1 µM final concentration) and benzoate standard solutions to reach final concentrations of 0.2, 1, 2, 10, 20, and 100 µM benzoate. Two blanks were prepared, one blank that was spiked only with the IS, and one blank lacking both IS and benzoate. Each sample was divided to duplicates of 50 mL and extracted as described above. After re-dissolving in 200 µL methanol:water (1:1, v:v), samples were injected subsequent to the biological samples. The peak areas of the [M-H]<sup>−</sup> ions for the IS (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 126.06) and benzoate (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 121.029) were extracted above a signal-to-noise threshold of 10 using TargetLynx (Version 4.2, Waters). The uniformly labeled aromatic ring of the IS slightly reduces its column retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Analyte response (y) was calculated by dividing the area of benzoate by the IS, plotted against the benzoate concentration (x), and the slope and intercept for a linear regression calculated (y=0.4741 x+1.665, R<sup>2</sup>=0.99) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).

A total of 12 non-infected and 12 infected algal cultures were used, and for each timepoint, 3 replicates of non-infected and infected cultures were sampled entirely for benzoate quantification in the media. Three replicates of algal growth medium (FSW +F/2) were used as medium control. At T=0 days, only three replicates of non-infected cultures were sampled for benzoate quantification. Extracellular benzoate was extracted as described above with slight modifications. Briefly, culture aliquots of 400 mL were filtered gently (&lt;0.4 bar under-pressure) over pre-combusted Whatman glass microfiber GF/A filters to remove algal cells, and subsequently over 0.22 µm PVDF filters to remove bacterial cells. Filtrates were spiked with 5 µL benzoate-d<sub>5</sub> (125 nM final concentration), acidified, and metabolites extracted using SPE cartridges. Dried extracts were stored at –80°C until LC-MS analysis. For targeted benzoate analysis, the dried extracts were re-dissolved in 200 µL of 20 mM ammonium carbonate (pH 9.25) in acetonitrile (1:1, v:v) and immediately analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Chromatography was performed on an ACQUITY UPLC I-Class (Waters Corporation); 10 µl of the sample was injected onto a ACQUITY BEH Amide column 2.1 mm × 150 mm, 1.7 µm (Waters) kept at 35°C. A binary gradient was applied using mobile phase A containing 17% acetonitrile in 20 mM ammonium carbonate (pH 9.2), and mobile phase B containing acetonitrile. The gradient elution was performed at 0.3 mL/min with initial inlet conditions at 95% B during 0.5 min, then decreasing to 20% B over 2 min, followed by a column wash at 20% B for 0.5 min, and a return to initial conditions at 95% B over 0.5 min. The total run time was 6 min. A Xevo TQ-S Tandem MS (Waters, Wilmslow, UK) operating in ESI<sup>−</sup> was used for the detection and quantification of the benzoate using the following instrument conditions: capillary voltage 1.92 kV, source temperature 150°C, desolvation temperature 400°C, cone gas flow 150 L/hr, and desolvation gas flow 700 L/hr.

General Statements</p><p>In this study, we aimed to unravel the molecular basis for the bacterial lifestyle switch, from coexistence to pathogenicity, using the ecologically important alga-bacterium model system of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 and its interaction with the bloom-forming alga <italic>Emiliania huxleyi. E. huxleyi</italic> forms massive blooms in the oceans and thus play a central role in biogeochemical cycling of elements. Therefore, mechanistic understanding of the metabolic exchange that determines the fate of this algal host has profound ecological significance.</p><p>In the current work, we demonstrate that bacteria can sense their host’s physiological state by perceiving the bouquet of secreted chemical signals, which eventually leads to the induction of bacterial pathogenicity. By profiling the transcriptional response of the bacterium, we found that the algal metabolite dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), an important signaling molecule in the marine environment, is essential for the bacterial lifestyle switch. However, the effective signaling of DMSP depended on additional algal signals. In complex environments, where many microbial species are present simultaneously, such a mechanism can ensure specificity, and thus bacteria will invest in altering gene expression and metabolic remodeling only when the right algal partners are present.</p><p>We discovered that the metabolic exchange of two key metabolic currencies, DMSP and benzoate, both produced and released by algal cells, regulate the bacterial lifestyle during interactions. Imbalance in their production, determined by the host physiological state, may induce a shift to bacterial pathogenicity towards its algal host, which could eventually contribute to algal bloom demise in natural populations.</p><p>Based on the reviewers’ suggestions, we conducted numerous experiments and added the following data that reinforce our conclusions:</p><p>1. We now provide a detailed analysis of benzoate production by <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> and its accumulation in mono-cultures and demonstrate the consumption of benzoate by <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 in co-cultures (new Figure 4d).</p><p>2. We added a new figure (new Figure 5) in which we examined two additional Sulfitobacter species that their genomes do not indicate benzoate utilization (new Figure 5a). We show their inability to grow on benzoate as sole carbon source (new Figure 5b) and their coculturing dynamics with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> (new Figure 5c).</p><p>3. We now strengthen our conclusion that benzoate hinders the DMSP-induced bacterial lifestyle switch to pathogenicity by adding evidence from co-cultures of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 with two different strains of <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> (CCMP379, new Figure 6; and CCMP 2090, new Figure S5).</p><p>4. We added evidence that benzoate, served as a sole carbon source, promotes the growth of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S4).</p><p>In addition, we improved the statistical analyses, clarified some points raised by the reviewers regarding the methodologies and made the RNAseq data more accessible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Point-by-point description of the revisions</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>This manuscript seeks to evaluate the influence of algal-derived metabolites on the transcriptomic expression of genes in a Sulfidobacter species. This particular bacteria has been observed to switch between co-existence with E. huxleyi to more of a pathogenic lifestyle. These authors seek to better understand the mechanisms driving this switch. Overall, I felt that this was a very wellwritten paper, and very clearly walked the reader through the findings and discussion of the results. However, I have some things that the authors should address prior to publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the encouraging feedback and useful comments. We have now added numerous experiments that strengthen the role of benzoate during <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7<italic>E. huxleyi</italic> interaction. We also clarified some points raised by the reviewer regarding the methodologies. We also improved and clarified the statistical analyses and significance of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. I did not think that the authors clearly demonstrated why they decided to focus on the influence of benzoate to this relationship outside of other potential metabolites. The authors state that benzoate degradation genes were highly expressed, but don't show that explicitly. It would be fine as a figure in the supplemental, but just that these genes are more highly expressed relative to others.</p><p>Additionally, Figure 4b does not show any significance. It is clear that for some genes, the ExpCM+DMSP and Stat-CM treatments are elevated relative to other treatments, however there is no indication if that elevation is significant or not. Denoting that would reinforce the importance of benzoate in mediating this interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We now added information on the statistical significance in expression values between the CM treatments and the MM treatments. In Figure 4b, we added * which mark genes that were significantly DE between all CM and MM treatments (Exp-CM vs MM, Exp-CM vs MM+DMSP, Exp-CM+DMSP vs MM, Exp-CM+DMSP vs MM+DMSP, Stat-CM vs MM and Stat-CM vs MM+DMSP). Genes marked with ** were significantly DE between all CM and MM treatments but one comparison (for <italic>BenD</italic> Exp-CM vs MM+DMSP; for <italic>PcaF</italic> Exp-CM+DMSP vs MM).</p><p>Furthermore, in Supplementary Table S5, the reviewer can find the expression values of benzoate-related genes and which of these were significantly DE.</p><p>While aromatic compound degradation is a known feature of Roseobacters, the direct degradation of benzoate seems to be limited to only a few phytoplankton-associated bacteria, based on our analysis (Figure 5a). We now added an experiment that demonstrates that <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 consumes benzoate during co-culturing, while it is accumulated in algal mono-cultures (Figure 4d). We also demonstrate now that Sulfitobacters that don’t consume benzoate do not exhibit a lifestyle switch (Figure 5b,c), suggesting that the metabolic exchange of benzoate is important for the bacterial lifestyle switch.</p><p>In order to further back up our conclusions about the importance of benzoate, we now included results of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 co-culturing with two <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> strains (CCMP2090 and CCMP379) (new Figure 6 and Figure S5). Both experiments demonstrate that benzoate hinders the pathogenicity-inducing effect of DMSP, further supporting our conclusions.</p><p>We feel that the additional experiments and data we provide in the revised manuscript reinforce our conclusions regarding the involvement of benzoate in <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7-<italic>E. huxleyi</italic> interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Were the strains of Ehux used for these experiments axenic? This actually would be a huge factor in influencing the results of this paper and it is not expressly stated in the paper. This needs to be stated, and if they were not axenic, the authors need to discuss how this may influence the results observed.</p></disp-quote><p>The algal cultures were axenic we routinely checked for bacterial contamination in the algal cultures by counting bacteria in algal cultures by flow cytometry. We now added a statement regarding this in the Materials and methods (L432-434).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The DMSP concentrations used in these experiments are higher than what has been measured previously being exuded from bacteria. Are the authors assuming that this would be a concentration bacteria would observe in the phycosphere? If so, that should be explicitly written somewhere in the manuscript. Similarly, for benzoate.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, the higher concentrations used in our study aimed to mimic concentrations that bacteria would be exposed at the surface of phytoplankton cells (in the phycosphere). We have now clarified this point in the method section, which now reads: “This concentration mimics that present in the phycosphere of <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> in stationary phase<sup>1,2</sup>.” (L457-L458)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Minor methods questions: Figure S1 – Why is there always one replicate that is not aligned on the tree or have as much similarity to the other two replicates in each treatment? Is this a function of how this dendrogram was created? Or is there that much variability among the replicates?</p></disp-quote><p>The structure of the dendrogram is created such that it draws a hierarchical binary tree, and therefore one of the triplicates is drawn on a different branch. Still, the height of the branches reflects the distance between the replicates, and one can observe that overall, the triplicates are similar. This is also in agreement with the correlation values, which are very high among the replicates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the nominal pore size of a GF/C filter, and on line 432 &quot;subsequently filtered through 0.22 μm of what kind of filter?&quot; Same issue with line 529 – what kind of 0.22 μm filters?</p></disp-quote><p>The pore size of GF/C is 1.2 µm. We now indicated what kind of filters we used for each filtration (L453, L455)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Why not use a repeated measures ANOVA for bacterial and algal growth curves? You are repeatedly measuring cell abundance from single flasks. The repeated measures ANOVA would disentangle the change in growth within a treatment over time, with differences in growth between treatments. Further, the mixed effects models require the data to be linear. Was only a fraction of the growth curve used to look for significant differences? If not, the growth curve isn't linear, therefore doesn't meet the assumptions of the mixed effects models.</p></disp-quote><p>We now changed the statistical test for the algal and bacterial growth curves to repeated measures ANOVA in new Figure 6 and Figure S5, and indicated this in the “statistical analyses” section (L659).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>This publication advances our understanding of the mechanisms that drive algal-bacteria interactions. It will be of interest to microbial ecologists as well as those interested in the chemical ecology of microbes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for acknowledging the quality and scope of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Summary</p><p>Sulfitobacter D7 changes its lifestyle from coexistence to pathogenicity when interacting with E. huxleyi. During the coexistence phase, E. huxleyi secretes metabolites such as benzoate, DMSP, and other growth substrates into the phycosphere, which bacteria can absorb and use for growth. The authors postulated that such energy-rich metabolic currencies inhibit DMSP signalling in Sulfitobacter D7 based on the discovery that benzoate neutralized the pathogenicity-inducing impact of DMSP. This observation is in contrast or complementary to previous findings. The amount of accessible growth substrates reduces when the algal physiological state is disturbed, such as during stationary growth, due to bacterial consumption and reduced secretion by the alga. In this study, a very high applied concentration of algal DMSP functions as a signal, altering the bacterium's transcriptional patterns and increasing the expression of pathogenicity-related genes.</p><p>Lifestyle switches were often reported but rarely reproduced by the scientific community. The paper is very well and interestingly written and illustrated. Further experiments should back up the far-reaching conclusions to ensure reproducibility.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for acknowledging the quality and scope of our work. In order to strengthen the conclusions of our work, we conducted numerous experiments that the reviewer requested:</p><p>1. We now provide a detailed analysis of benzoate production by <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> and its accumulation in mono-cultures and demonstrate the consumption of benzoate by <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 in co-cultures (new Figure 4d).</p><p>2. We added a new figure (new Figure 5) in which we examined two additional Sulfitobacter species that their genomes do not indicate benzoate utilization (new Figure 5a). We show their inability to grow on benzoate as sole carbon source (new Figure 5b) and their co-culturing dynamics with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> (new Figure 5c).</p><p>3. We now strengthen our conclusion that benzoate hinders the DMSP-induced bacterial lifestyle switch to pathogenicity by adding evidence from co-cultures of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 with two different strains of <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> (CCMP379, new Figure 6; and CCMP 2090, new Figure S5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. We added evidence that benzoate, served as a sole carbon source, promotes the growth of Sulfitobacter D7 in a dose-dependent manner (new Figure S4)</p><p>Major comments</p><p>– Very high concentrations of DMSP (100 µM) were applied for transcriptional profiling (line 433, line 326, Figure5)? In specific experimental approaches, such high concentrations may be justified but not for a stimulus in transcriptome analysis. This calls into question the ecological relevance of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer on this point. Although the concentration of DMSP measured in seawater are typically in the tens of nanomolar range<sup>3</sup>, these compounds are not homogeneously distributed in the water column<sup>4</sup>. Indeed, phytoplankton internal concentrations of DMSP can exceed 100 mM <sup>5,6</sup> , therefore DMSP concentrations will be orders of magnitude higher than background within the microenvironments surrounding phytoplankton (phycosphere)<sup>1</sup> or as a result of cell damage or lysis<sup>7</sup>. Furthermore, the concentrations of DMSP measured in axenic stationary phase <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> cultures in our previous studies reach up to 70 µM<sup>2</sup>. We therefore argue that the concentrations used in our study are appropriate and ecologically relevant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Do you know the natural concentration of DMSP and benzoate in the growth medium of your laboratory cultures? Did you also test lower concentrations than 100 µM?</p></disp-quote><p>The concentration of DMSP in the media of axenic <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> cultures ranges between 0.5 to 70 µM, depending on the growth phase and algal strain. This data is presented in our previous study <sup>2</sup>. We now added additional results showing the concentration of benzoate in the media of algal mono-cultures and during co-culturing with <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 (Figure 4d). The concentration of benzoate in the algal mono-culture’s medium was in the tens of nM range. Nevertheless, the concentration in the phycosphere is likely much higher<sup>1</sup>.

That information is essential to understanding the bacteria-algae interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We now added results showing the dose-dependent growth promoting effect of benzoate on <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 (Figure S4). We also performed a co-culturing experiment in which we added different concentrations of benzoate, with and without 100 µM DMSP. From these results, equimolar concentrations of 100 µM benzoate seems to be most effective for bacterial growth and for hindering the pathogenicity-inducing DMSP signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In general, I recommend performing knockout mutants of Sulfitobacter D7 (e.g,, benzoate degradation) to evaluate further the DMSP/benzoate regulated association with E. huxleyi. It will certainly take a while, but supporting such a far-reaching study and its conclusions is worthwhile.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this approach will be beneficial and help support our claims. However, unfortunately generating <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 knockout strains is currently not feasible. <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 was isolated by us from the natural environment<sup>2</sup>. Although we established a meticulous and robust model system, this bacterium is not genetically amenable. We invested strong efforts on genetically modifying <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7, but still with no successes. Therefore, this request is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, and we are currently working towards this goal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– A control experiment with a closely related non-benzoate degrading strain of Sultfitobacter spp. (listed in Figure 4d) would be desirable (Figure 4c). Is it possible that the depletion of benzoate in Figure 4c is due to adsorption by the cells? Also, I do not see statistical differences in the treatments shown in Figure 4b.</p></disp-quote><p>We now added a new figure (Figure 5) in which we show the growth on benzoate as sole carbon source and the co-culturing dynamics of two additional Sulfitobacter strains that cannot utilize benzoate. We show that <italic>S. pontiacus</italic> DSM 10014 and <italic>S. brevis</italic> DSM 11443 do not have the genes required for benzoate utilization (Figure 5a). Accordingly, these strains do not grow on benzoate as sole carbon source (Figure 5b). We also show that when we cocultured <italic>S. pontiacus</italic> and <italic>S. brevis</italic> with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> they do not switch their lifestyle to pathogenicity (Figure 5c). We further discuss this observation in the manuscript.</p><p>Regarding the depletion of benzoate in Figure 4c- we are confident that it is derived by bacterial consumption and metabolism and not due to adsorption by the cells. In this experiment <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 grew 4-orders of magnitude, therefore the bacteria must have consumed and metabolized benzoate to gain energy for growth.</p><p>Regarding the statistical differences in Figure 4b- we now added information on the statistical significance in expression values between the CM treatments and the MM treatments. In Figure 4b, we added * which mark genes that were significantly DE between all CM and MM treatments (Exp-CM vs MM, Exp-CM vs MM+DMSP, Exp-CM+DMSP vs MM, Exp-CM+DMSP vs MM+DMSP, Stat-CM vs MM and Stat-CM vs MM+DMSP). Genes marked with ** were significantly DE between all CM and MM treatments but one comparison (for <italic>BenD</italic> Exp-CM vs MM+DMSP; for <italic>PcaF</italic> Exp-CM+DMSP vs MM).</p><p>Furthermore, in Supplementary Table S5, the reviewer can find the expression values of benzoate-related genes and which of these were significantly DE.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Did you prove the biosynthetic pathway by qPCR analysis? The benzoate degradation could be determined using labelled benzoate.</p></disp-quote><p>We now added new results that show the algal production of benzoate and consumption of benzoate by <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 during co-culturing with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> (Figure 4d). We invested tremendous efforts to achieve these results, including extensive LC-MS method development and analysis. Furthermore, our results from the transcriptomics experiment demonstrate the co-transcription of the whole pathway in CM indicating that the whole pathway is indeed active if benzoate is present (Figure 4b, Table S5). This, together with our previously presented results of benzoate consumption in bacterial mono-cultures (Figure 4c), clearly demonstrates that <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 uptakes benzoate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The lifestyle switch appears to be regulated by a certain DMSP/benzoate ratio. The use of such a ratio as a proof of principle would be extremely beneficial and required to support the assumptions and results which are given in Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed an experiment in which we added different concentrations of benzoate (1, 10 and 100 µM) with and without 100 µM DMSP, to see if there is a dose-dependent effect. While the 100 µM benzoate hinders DMSP signaling statistically significant, the 10 µM benzoate concentration shows some effect, though not statistically significant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><p>In order to back up our conclusions, we now include results of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7 coculturing with two <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> strains (CCMP2090 and CCMP379) (new Figure 6 and Figure S5). Both experiments demonstrate that benzoate hinders the pathogenicity-inducing effect of DMSP, further supporting our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I am curious as to what the author thinks is going on, if the second source of benzoate (other algae) is present? How equal are all the E. huxleyi cells within a bloom (single-cell analysis and quantification of benzoate release might be necessary)?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting point. Taking into consideration the scale at which interactions occur, we think that the interaction depends on the composition of each phycosphere. In a diluted environment, such as the marine environment, bacteria will most likely not sense benzoate from a different alga, unless a bacterium is within the algal phycosphere. In lab cultures the situation is different, because there is no mixing and molecules can accumulate in the cultures’ media. Therefore, an additional source of benzoate can indeed alter the interaction with the algae, as we see in our observations (Figure 6 and Figure S5).</p><p>The second question the reviewer raised is very difficult to answer. Work on the heterogeneity of algal cells within a bloom is technologically challenging. Nevertheless, work from our group using single-cell transcriptomics, showed that during viral infection of <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> cultures the algal population is quite heterogeneous, even in isogenic populations<sup>8</sup>. Regarding the metabolic activity at the single-cell level, although there have been some advances in recent years<sup>9,10</sup>, this would still be extremely challenging to conduct and will required method development of several years. We think this subject is very interesting but beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>– Line 344: Is the statement supported by a representative study?</p></disp-quote><p>The analysis that we performed and presented in new Figure 5a supports this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 378: What does &quot;eat-and-run&quot; strategy mean?</p></disp-quote><p>It refers to the English idiom “eat and run” which describes a situation where someone eats quickly and leaves.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– If I understand the method section correctly, you have worked with two organisms only, Sulfitobacter D7 and E. huxleyi.

It possesses multiple modes of action depending on the assay performed. A more general introduction and discussion would be desirable. The same is true for benzoate.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding DMSP, we address this point in the introduction (L52-55):</p><p>“The organosulfur molecule dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), produced by many phytoplankton species<sup>11</sup>, is especially known to mediate Roseobacter-phytoplankton interactions by serving as a carbon and sulfur source, a chemotaxis cue and as an infochemical for the presence of algae<sup>2,7,12–17</sup>.” And in the discussion (L336-338):</p><p>“DMSP is a ubiquitous infochemical produced by many phytoplankton species as well as some bacteria<sup>18</sup>, making it a prevalent signaling molecule that mediates microbial interactions in the marine environment….”</p><p>Regarding benzoate, to the best of our knowledge, there is almost no literature about benzoate in the marine environment. There is, however, literature on aromatic compound degradation by Roseobacters, and we discuss this in L272-274. There are also no reports that show directly benzoate production by phytoplankton. This was, in part, what motivated us to measure benzoate in <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> cultures (Figure 4d), and to explore the prevalence of benzoate-related genes in phytoplankton-associated bacteria (Figure 5a).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why did you use different strains of E. huxleyi in experiments presented in Figure 1 (transcriptomics) and Figure 5 (benzoate experiment)?</p></disp-quote><p>We now added a similar experiment with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> strain 379, which is the strain presented in Figure 1. This data is found in new Figure 6. We moved the results with <italic>E. huxleyi</italic> strain 2090 to the supplementary (Figure S5). The difference between the two strains is the ability to naturally induce the pathogenicity of <italic>Sulfitobacter</italic> D7. This is attributed to the difference in DMSP concentration between the strains. The concentration of DMSP in the strain presented in Figure 1 (<italic>E. huxleyi</italic> 379) in higher by 10-fold than the concentration in the strain presented in the new Figure S5 (<italic>E. huxleyi</italic> 2090)<sup>2</sup>. The reason we used 2090 in the experiment in new Figure S5 is that we wanted to examine how the DMSP-benzoate interplay affects the bacterial lifestyle switch, so we used the strain in which we can induce the switch.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required))</p><p>Significance.</p><p>The study is organized excitingly and characterized by various experiments that support each other but are not yet final for the far-reaching conclusions.

They performed a series of transcriptome experiments in co-culture-derived and minimal medium with or without externally added DMSP that demonstrated that DMSP acts as an infochemical leading to major changes in the D7 transcriptome when other algae-derived metabolites are present, but not in a minimal medium. In particular, they found an activation of the flagella gene cluster and various genes for transporters. Furthermore, they found that the benzoatedegradation pathway is upregulated only in the co-culture-derived medium and that benzoate likely counteracts the signalling role of DMSP.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The authors performed a carefully planned transcriptome study and tested the hypothesis generated from its outcome in well-designed physiological experiments. I have no major concerns regarding the experimental design and interpretation of the results. Although the authors provide a table with the RNAseq data, I think some useful annotation information is missing here that could be easily added and will enhance the reusability of these data: The column with Locus tag contains not only Locus Tags but also gene symbols for some of the genes. In a few cases (lldD, gatA/B, gabD, some ncRNAs and ssrA (tmRNA)), the Locus tag is missing completely. This should be corrected. Furthermore, Paracoccus D7 harbours several plasmids, however the replicon information is missing. I suggest to include columns with the accession number of the replicon, start, end and strand to the annotation data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the encouraging and constructive feedback on our work.
