However, the properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that mediate this effect remain unclear. Here, using hippocampal neurons labeled with the fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> probes Fluo-4 or GCAMP5, we visualized action potential-independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in dendritic regions adjacent to fluorescently labeled presynaptic boutons in physiological levels of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup>. These Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients required NMDA receptor activity, and their propensity correlated with acute or genetically induced changes in spontaneous neurotransmitter release. In contrast, they were insensitive to blockers of AMPA receptors, L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, or group I mGluRs. However, inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release suppressed these transients and elicited synaptic scaling, a process which required protein translation and eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase activity. These results support a critical role for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in amplifying NMDA receptor-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at rest for the maintenance of synaptic homeostasis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09262.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09262.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09262.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Learning and memory is thought to rely on changes in the strength of the connections between nerve cells. When an electrical impulse travelling through a nerve cell reaches one of these connections (called a synapse), it causes the cell to release chemical transmitter molecules. These bind to receptors on the cell on the other side of the synapse. This starts a series of events that ultimately leads to new receptors being inserted into the membrane of this second cell, which strengthens the connection between the two cells.</p><p>The receptors involved in this process belong to two groups, called AMPA and NMDA receptors. Both groups are ion channels that regulate the flow of charged particles from one side of a cell's membrane to the other. In resting nerve cells, NMDA receptors are partially blocked by magnesium ions. However, the binding of the transmitter molecules to AMPA receptors causes these receptors to open and allow positively charged sodium ions into the cell. This changes the electrical charge across the cell membrane, which displaces the magnesium ions from the NMDA receptors so that they too open. Calcium ions then enter the cell through the NMDA receptors and activate a signaling cascade that leads to the production of new AMPA receptors.</p><p>Nerve cells also release transmitter molecules in the absence of electrical impulses, and evidence suggests that individual cells can use this ‘spontaneous transmitter release’ to adjust the strength of their synapses. When these spontaneous release levels are high, AMPA receptors are removed from the membrane of the nerve after the synapse to make it less sensitive to the transmitter molecules. Conversely, when spontaneous release levels are low, additional AMPA receptors are added to the membrane to increase the sensitivity.</p><p>Reese and Kavalali have now identified the mechanism behind this process by showing that spontaneously released transmitter molecules cause small amounts of calcium to enter the second nerve cell through NMDA receptors, even when these receptors are blocked by magnesium ions. This trickle of calcium triggers the release of more calcium from stores inside the cell, which amplifies the signal. The ultimate effect of the flow of calcium into the cell is to block the production of AMPA receptors, and ensure that the synapse does not become any stronger. As confirmation of this mechanism, Reese and Kavalali showed that simulating low levels of spontaneous activity by blocking the so-called ‘calcium-induced calcium release’ has the opposite effect. This led to more AMPA receptors being produced and stronger synapses. Taken together these findings indicate that spontaneous transmitter release exerts an outsized influence on communication between neurons by maintaining adequate levels of AMPA receptors via these ‘amplified’ calcium signals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09262.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09262.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>spontaneous neurotransmitter release</kwd><kwd>NMDA receptor signaling</kwd><kwd>Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release</kwd><kwd>homeostatic plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH066198</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kavalali</surname><given-names>Ege T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 NS069562</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reese</surname><given-names>Austin L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Individual neurons can adjust the strength of their synapses by using spontaneous calcium influx through NMDA receptors to trigger the release of additional calcium from intracellular stores, which can in turn be used to regulate protein synthesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Studies in the last decade have shown that spontaneous release events trigger biochemical signaling leading to maturation and stability of synaptic networks, local dendritic protein synthesis and control postsynaptic responsiveness during homeostatic synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung and Kavalali, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sutton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kavalali, 2015</xref>). Most surprisingly, these studies have demonstrated that postsynaptic excitatory receptor blockade or inhibition of neurotransmitter release in addition to action potential blockade induces faster and more pronounced homeostatic synaptic potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sutton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nosyreva et al., 2013</xref>). There is evidence that alterations in resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, partly triggered via activation of NMDA receptors at rest, is critical for these effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nosyreva et al., 2013</xref>). However, to date there is no direct information on the properties of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals elicited by spontaneous release events under physiological circumstances. Our group's previous work as well as others used electrophysiology to show that, indeed, under physiological levels of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) possess a sizable NMDA receptor-mediated component, indicating that NMDA receptors signal at rest under physiological conditions without requiring local AMPAR-mediated dendritic depolarizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Espinosa and Kavalali, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Povysheva and Johnson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gideons et al., 2014</xref>). The existence of an NMDA component within mEPSCs agrees with earlier estimates of incomplete Mg<sup>2+</sup> block of canonical NMDA receptors near resting membrane potentials, and therefore it does not necessarily involve NMDA receptor subunits with altered Mg<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jahr and Stevens, 1990</xref>). Nevertheless, the NMDA receptor Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx under these conditions is estimated to be small, corresponding to approximately 20% of the full Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx carried by unblocked NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Espinosa and Kavalali, 2009</xref>). Therefore, as NMDA receptor-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at rest are expected to be relatively minor in magnitude, it remains unclear how their blockade could be critical in producing homeostatic synaptic scaling. To address this question, we visualized the resting NMDA receptor-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and found that they are amplified by a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release mechanism to elicit downstream signaling events. Importantly, based on this information, we also show that direct suppression of these resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals is sufficient to elicit eEF2 kinase dependent postsynaptic scaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Visualization of miniature spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in hippocampal neurons</title><p>To detect transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that occur under resting conditions—in the absence of action potentials—we took advantage of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator dye Fluo-4 or the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive fluorescent protein GCaMP5K as reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gee et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerboom et al., 2012</xref>). To visualize synapses, both reporters were used on hippocampal neurons that were infected with lentivirus expressing the fusion protein Synaptobrevin2-mOrange (Syb2-mOrange) consisting of a chimera of the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin2 with the pH sensitive red-shifted fluorophore mOrange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ramirez et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). In these experiments, the signal contribution of Syb2-mOrange during live imaging is negligible (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In Fluo-4 experiments, neurons were initially incubated and labeled with the membrane permeable analog of Fluo-4 (Fluo-4 AM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) followed by dye removal and perfusion with a Tyrode's solution containing 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 1.25 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> as well as 1 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX) to block action potentials. Fluorescence images were collected at a frequency of 10 Hz and fluorescence intensity traces were generated for the regions of interest (ROIs) selected over Syb2-mOrange puncta which fluorescence was maximized at the end of each experiment using 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Under these conditions, we could detect rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (miniature spontaneous calcium transients or mSCTs) with absolute values that were at least 2 standard deviations above the mean of the preceding baseline period (2 s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These events occurred at a frequency of 0.32 ± 0.04 min<sup>−1</sup> per ROI, consistent with earlier estimates of the frequency of spontaneous fusion events per release site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leitz and Kavalali, 2014</xref>). Repeating the same experimental protocol with Fluo-4 AM in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> did not yield a significantly different mSCT frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) suggesting that under physiological Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations we could detect a majority of mSCTs. Interestingly, even though the presence of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> is expected to greatly diminish NMDAR current magnitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Espinosa and Kavalali, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gideons et al., 2014</xref>), imaging experiments did not reveal a significant difference in mSCT amplitudes detected in Mg<sup>2+</sup> (1.25 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> ∆F/F<sub>o</sub> = 0.063 ± 0.001, 0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> ∆F/F<sub>o</sub> = 0.067 ± 0.002, p = 0.16, Student's unpaired t-test, N = 825 events from 8 experiments). The fact that mSCT amplitude was unaffected by extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> indicates mSCTs measured by Fluo-4 AM were not likely to be solely dependent on NMDA receptor activity.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09262.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Multiple approaches to detect miniature spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (mSCTs) in the presence of TTX and physiological Mg<sup>2+</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Loading dissociated rat hippocampal cultures with Fluo-4 AM dye labels all cells on the coverslip (above) and produces the largest signal amplitudes, shown as example traces and an average with standard deviation (below) N = 38 experiments, 7 cultures.

In this setting, we detected a lower frequency of events (0.125 ± 0.035 min<sup>−1</sup> per ROI), indicating that some of the mSCTs may be susceptible to postsynaptic dialysis and wash out of soluble factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In agreement with this premise, when the same optical recording conditions were applied to neurons expressing a soluble version of the green emission Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator probe GCaMP5K, we could detect a higher frequency of mSCTs (0.230 ± 0.04 min<sup>−1</sup> per ROI).</p><p>In subsequent experiments, we expressed a fusion construct of GCaMP5K with the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD95 (GCAMP5K-PSD95) in order to target the calcium sensor specifically to the postsynaptic density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In the presence of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> based on the population average this setting provided the lowest estimate for the mSCT frequency (0.009 ± 0.004 min<sup>−1</sup> per ROI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In contrast, removal of Mg<sup>2+</sup> augmented the mSCT detection rate to a level comparable to the rates we observed with Fluo-4 or soluble GCaMP5K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This finding suggests that, in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, postsynaptically localized GCaMP5K-PSD95 has limited ability to detect the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals generated in its vicinity via Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. However, experiments in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> indicate that this probe is functional and can in principle detect these spontaneous local Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leitz and Kavalali, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recording in the presence of 1.25 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 1 µM TTX, we could detect spontaneously generated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal cells with all four techniques. Although, each probe reports a different frequency these differences are statistically insignificant except when considering the difference between Fluo-4 AM and GCaMP5K-PSD95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Relatively lower detection efficiency of GCAMP5K-PSD95 compared to soluble probes illustrates that the majority of these transients are not localized to the postsynaptic density. The failure of Mg<sup>2+</sup> to decrease mSCT amplitudes as measured with Fluo-4 AM strongly suggest that a majority of transients are generated by a signaling process downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry rather than reporting the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx per se. In order to identify the nature of this signaling, in subsequent experiments, we used the Fluo-4 AM based imaging to test conditions that alter mSCTs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The generation of mSCTs requires NMDA receptor mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx</title><p>To characterize mSCTs, neurons were labeled with Fluo-4 AM as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and imaged in Tyrode's solution containing TTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

In Fluo-4 AM imaging experiments with hippocampal cultures made from littermate control mice, the application of AP5 was able to produce a significant decrease in mSCT frequency compared to baseline recorded in TTX, as had been observed previously in wild-type rat cultures. Neurons derived from SNAP25 knock out animals had a significantly decreased baseline mSCT frequency.

Therefore, in the next set of experiments we tested whether concurrent AMPA receptor activity augments NMDA receptor activity at rest through electrical means. Such synergy between the activation of the two types of receptors may be facilitated by dendritic spines that possess a high spine neck resistance that render them electrically isolated from the dendritic shaft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloodgood and Sabatini, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harnett et al., 2012</xref>) but see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Popovic et al., 2014</xref>). In this way activation of AMPA receptors may result in sufficient local depolarization to facilitate relief of adjacent NMDA receptors from Mg<sup>2+</sup> block. Additionally, AMPA receptors lacking GluA2, which are calcium-permeable, could also contribute to these transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hollmann et al., 1991</xref>).

In these experiments NBQX (5 µM) did not affect mSCT frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

In this form of signaling, the small Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient produced by the NMDA receptor opening raises internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations near ryanodine receptors (RyRs) on the endoplasmic reticulum high enough to cause their opening at which point a much larger transient is generated. To test whether this mechanism plays a role in the mSCTs we observe, we imaged with Fluo-4 AM in the presence of dantrolene, which is known to reduce the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of RyR1 and 3 by blocking their interaction with calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fruen et al., 1997</xref>). Indeed, when compared to the TTX baseline, cells imaged with TTX + dantrolene had a significantly reduced mSCT frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This finding was validated by using ryanodine, which directly blocks all three RyR isoforms in a use-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hawkes et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meissner and el-Hashem, 1992</xref>). To facilitate use-dependent block of RyRs by ryanodine, the baseline mSCT frequency was first collected in TTX and then cells were perfused for 13 min with a solution containing 30 µM ryanodine without TTX to maximize RyR opening and ryanodine block. The cells were then perfused with Tyrode's containing TTX + ryanodine for 2 min before continuing the recording. Under these conditions, the application of ryanodine produced a ∼fivefold decrease in mSCT frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In addition, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that were detectable after ryanodine treatment were substantially decreased in amplitude suggesting that they are likely to be produced by a subpopulation of RyRs that remained unblocked or incompletely blocked (average TTX ∆F/F<sub>o</sub> = 0.052 ± 0.001, TTX + Ryanodine ∆F/F<sub>o</sub> = 0.045 ± 0.001, p = 0.002 Student's unpaired t-test, n = 199 events in TTX, 110 events in TTX + ryanodine, 8 experiments, 2 cultures). Treatment with dantrolene or ryanodine is presumed to decrease mSCT frequency by blocking RyRs responsible for producing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient. With these inhibitors present, further NMDA openings can no longer trigger an mSCT. In fact, the efficacy of ryanodine in this case allowed further investigation of the pure NMDA transient under these experimental conditions. We incubated neurons with ryanodine for 15 min to block RyRs and then loaded them with Fluo-4 AM as before. These cells were imaged in Tyrode's solution containing TTX but no extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> to allow maximal NMDA currents. Under these conditions Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were observed, but when 1.25 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> was again added no further transients could be measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These results illustrate that under physiological concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Fluo-4 cannot detect the NMDA Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient without further amplification from Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Blocking mSCTs induces homeostatic eEF2 kinase-dependent synaptic scaling</title><p>In the next set of experiments, we aimed to examine the physiological impact of RyR-dependent mSCTs by focusing on the putative role of these Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in regulation of synaptic efficacy. For this purpose, we investigated the role of mSCTs in homeostatic synaptic scaling, which is a compensatory mechanism where neurons scale the strength of their synaptic inputs multiplicatively in a uniform manner in response to global increases or decreases in activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>). This response involves the synthesis and insertion of new AMPA receptors and can be strongly induced by blocking both action potentials and NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sutton et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, although synaptic scaling in response to activity blockade occurs within a time frame of 24–48 hr, suppression of resting synaptic activity mediated by spontaneous neurotransmitter release events results in more rapid synaptic scaling detectable within hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sutton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nosyreva et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that NMDA receptor activation at rest maintains synaptic homeostasis. However, the mechanism by which NMDA receptor activity near resting membrane potentials signals to translation machinery, in particular to eEF2 kinase, has been unclear, especially when one considers the relatively small ion conductance of NMDA receptors at rest due to Mg<sup>2+</sup> block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Espinosa and Kavalali, 2009</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the role of RyR-dependent mSCTs in homeostatic synaptic scaling, hippocampal neurons were incubated for 3 hr in culture media containing TTX + vehicle (negative control), TTX + ryanodine, or TTX + AP5 as positive control. Neurons were then perfused with Tyrode's solution and whole cell voltage clamp recordings were made in 1 µM TTX, 50 µM PTX and 50 µM AP5 to isolate AMPA-mEPSCs. Under these conditions, the amplitude distributions of AMPA-mEPSCs obtained from neurons treated previously with TTX + ryanodine as well as those treated with TTX + AP5 showed a significant rightward shift towards larger amplitudes compared to the control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). When the collected mEPSC amplitudes were plotted rank order in control vs TTX + ryanodine, a linear fit revealed a scaling factor of 1.28 indicating that cell-wide, mEPSC amplitudes increased uniformly 28% over 3 hr with TTX + ryanodine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This increase in mEPSC amplitudes was not as pronounced as was found with the positive control (TTX + AP5) which may correlate with the finding that ryanodine treatment does not block mSCTs as completely as AP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2D, 4E</xref>). It is important to note that while other groups have reported an immediate decrease in mEPSC frequency with the acute application of ryanodine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Emptage et al., 1999</xref>), in our system the mEPSC frequencies in neurons treated with ryanodine for 15 min were indistinguishable from those incubated with vehicle as control (TTX mEPSC freq = 7.59 Hz ± 1.75, TTX + Ryanodine mEPSC freq = 8.92 ± 1.13, p = 0.54 using Student's t-test, N = 7 cells from 5 coverslips, 2 cultures). Since the acute application of ryanodine does not alter mEPSC frequency in this system we believe the synaptic scaling effect mainly results from ryanodine acting at the postsynapse to block mSCT activity.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09262.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Treating cells with ryanodine + TTX produces a protein synthesis dependent increase in mEPSC frequency and amplitude indicative of homeostatic synaptic scaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example voltage clamp recordings from cells treated with TTX + vehicle (negative control, N = 9 cells from 5 coverslips, 3 cultures), TTX + ryanodine (N = 8 cells from 5 coverslips, 4 cultures) or TTX + AP5 (positive control, N = 6 cells from 4 coverslips, 2 cultures) for 3 hr.

These transients are important because they are key to understanding the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling events occurring at rest that result in regulation of protein translation and gene transcription leading to synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lalonde et al., 2014</xref>) (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kavalali, 2015</xref>). Under these conditions we detected robust NMDA receptor dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at a rate of 0.32 ± 0.03 min<sup>−1</sup> where previously our group was able to measure a per synapse spontaneous release rate of 0.76 ± 0.03 min<sup>−1</sup> by imaging with presynaptic probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leitz and Kavalali, 2014</xref>). The relatively higher release rate measured earlier may suggest that not every release event is able to generate an mSCT. The link between these Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and spontaneous neurotransmitter release was verified by the parallel increase in mSCT and spontaneous neurotransmitter release frequencies in response to application of hypertonic sucrose. Furthermore, the frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients was also significantly diminished in neurons lacking SNAP-25, which show a substantial reduction in spontaneous release, and in cultures treated with NMDA receptor blockers.</p><p>Interestingly GCaMP5K-PSD95, a probe located near the postsynaptic density, revealed only a very small number of events that fulfilled our detection criteria while soluble probes proved to be much better indicators. This observation indicates that although mSCT generation depends on NMDA receptor driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, this does not result in strong signals at the postsynaptic density. Rather, mSCTs seem to rely on the activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from smooth endoplasmic reticulum which is present in spines or adjacent dendritic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spacek and Harris, 1997</xref>).</p><p>The generation of mSCTs was not dependent on AMPA receptors, L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels or postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes 1 and 5. While all of these play a role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics under other circumstances the mSCTs we observed under resting conditions were primarily driven by the coupling of the NMDA receptor to internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores through the ryanodine receptor, as the application of dantrolene or ryanodine produced a marked reduction in both mSCT frequency and amplitude. Earlier studies performed in hippocampal synapses discovered that unitary evoked EPSCs were accompanied by Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that were only minimally dependent on voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels or AMPA receptors. However, unlike the mSCTs we observe, the application of ryanodine produced only a small reduction in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude in these experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kovalchuk et al., 2000</xref>). This difference may suggest that spontaneous glutamate release-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are more dependent on internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores compared to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients elicited by evoked release.</p><p>In this study, we tested a key prediction of these observations on synaptic plasticity by assessing the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in synaptic scaling triggered at rest. Our experiments showed that the synaptic scaling produced by the blockade of spontaneous NMDA-mEPSCs is also produced by blocking the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores indicating a strong link between the two signals. The generation of relatively large store-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients provides a critical amplification step for the relatively small NMDA-mEPSCs seen under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Espinosa and Kavalali, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gideons et al., 2014</xref>). The resulting signal is delocalized and pulsatile which may allow synaptic NMDA receptors to exert signaling influence in the surrounding dendritic regions. This could be critical for local translational control as eEF2 localizes to the dendritic shaft rather than dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asaki et al., 2003</xref>). The low frequency of observed mSCTs may also be a defining attribute, as the ubiquitous Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein calmodulin is predicted to interact with different target kinases and enzymes based on the frequency and duration of its activation by free Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saucerman and Bers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Slavov et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together these findings identify a critical missing mechanistic link between spontaneous neurotransmission and the control of dendritic signaling events that regulate synaptic efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Hippocampal cultures from Sprague–Dawley rats or eEF2 kinase knockout mice and their wild-type littermate controls were generated from postnatal day 1–3 male and female pups and plated on Matrigel (Corning Inc, NY) coated coverslips as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kavalali et al., 1999</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers. The manuscript has been greatly improved over your previous submission but there are two minor corrections that must be addressed before acceptance, regarding apparent inconsistencies/ambiguities in the text. The first may be a typo regarding AP5 sensitivity reported in text vs. legend, and the second has to do with quantification of a low rate from relatively short recordings (see details below).</p><p>In general the reviewers were convinced by the revisions. Two reviewers said: “I am satisfied with all of the revisions and hope to see the paper published” and “The authors have addressed all my concerns reasonably. I have no further concerns.”</p><p>The third writes: “Most of my concerns were satisfactorily addressed but two points remain.” That reviewer listed the two inconsistencies:</p><p>1) There is an apparent contradiction between the text in subsection “mSCTs are driven by spontaneous neurotransmitter release” and in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Text: “Neurons derived from SNAP25 knock out animals had a significantly decreased baseline mSCT frequency. Also, these transients remained sensitive to AP5, which is again consistent with mSCT generation being driven by spontaneous vesicle release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>).”</p><p>The statement “these transients remained sensitive to AP5” seems to be contradicted by the statement in the legend: “The remaining mSCTs in the KO animals are unaffected by AP5.” Is “unaffected” incorrect in the legend? This needs to be clarified in the manuscript.</p><p>2) The recordings were 2 minutes long. In the third paragraph of the subsection “Visualization of miniature spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in hippocampal neurons” it states an mSCT frequency of 0.009 per min per ROI. It needs to be explained how such a low frequency (∼0.5 per hour) can be obtained from 2 min long recordings.</p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled “Spontaneous neurotransmission signals through store-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients to maintain synaptic homeostasis” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three peer reviewers, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work cannot be accepted in its present form for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers made specific suggestions for improvement of the manuscript, however, and if you wish to do the necessary experiments and carry out the suggested revisions, we would be willing to consider a new version of the manuscript. This decision was made not because we didn't find the work potentially exciting, but because the experiments that the reviewers thought important might take more than several weeks to accomplish, and it is against e<italic>Life</italic> policy to ask for extensive new experiments for a revision.</p><p>In the discussion of the reviews, three major topics emerged, which all reviewers generally agreed upon. The first is the need for a better description of the analysis, which will likely require some modification of the analysis. Ideally these would resolve the inconsistencies noted in the first review. The second has to do with the N-values and the validity of the statistics. Not only were N-values low, but explicit indication of what “N” refers to in the experiments would also be appropriate (how many independent cultures, how many different coverslips, whether similar #'s of mini's collected and considered from each cell, etc). Third were experimental questions about results that appear contradictory (why ryanodine affects Ca transient frequency but only affects mEPSC amplitude) or ambiguous (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, what is the relative sensitivity of the two different Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators, and why it is valid to directly compare data obtained using those different constructs).</p><p>The complete reviews are included below to facilitate a new submission, should you decide to submit one. Please note that it would likely require some additional experiments to address the concerns of low N as well as rewriting and reanalysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the author present experiments investigating miniature spontaneous Ca<sup>2</sup>+ transients (mSCTs) in hippocampal neurons. They report that these are activated by spontaneous glutamate release events and enhanced by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>release, confirming previous results. New insight comes mainly from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6</xref>. The authors show that inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release increases mEPSC amplitudes, indicative of synaptic scaling. This increase is abolished by a protein synthesis inhibitor and in neurons form eEF2 kinase knock-out mice, indicating that ryanodine induced synaptic scaling acts via eEF2 kinase activation.</p><p>While there is some interesting new insight from this manuscript, much of it largely confirms previous results, several sections are very poorly written and a number of technical questions arise. In particular, the description of mSCT detection and analysis is inconsistent, raising serious questions regarding the significance of observed phenomena.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) The event detection/identification needs clarification (Discussion and second paragraph, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For the 2 SD threshold 5% of points will exceed the threshold. The Methods section gives only criteria of maximum duration. Was there a minimum duration?</p><p>2) How were rise times and decay times defined and determined?</p><p>3) The average/median amplitudes of ∆F/F=0.054/0.048 seem to be nearly equal to 2 SD in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>.</p><p>4) The legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> states that events having “peak ∆F/F greater than 0.04 were counted if the peak fluorescence value was 2 standard deviations greater than the mean fluorescence”. Methods, subsection “CA<sup>2+</sup> transient analysis and statistics” states 0.035, and the distribution in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> (right) shows counts for amplitudes even smaller. The analysis seems inconsistent.</p><p>5) According to the Methods section Fluo-4 and GCaMP5k were excited with 470<bold><italic>±</italic></bold> 40 nm filter, which will also excite Syb2-mOrange, which will change it fluorescence upon vesicle fusion. What emission filter was used to exclude crosstalk?</p><p>6) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> ROIs were selected over Syb2mOrange puncta determined after NH<sub>4</sub>Cl addition. What was the size and shape of the ROIs?</p><p>7) Introducing Fluo-4 salt with a patch pipette reduced observation frequency of mSCTs and the authors interpret this as being due to wash-out. However, it seems that the pipette solution contained high gluconate, which is known to buffer Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>∼35 mM). Although <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> may appear high it would be expected to affect [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] due to its very high concentration. Washout should produce a decrease in frequency over time compared to Fluo-4 AM, was this observed?</p><p>8) Frequency of mSCTs measured with GCaMP5k-PSD95 was ∼1 very 2 hours. How long were the recordings?</p><p>9) In the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Visualization of miniature spontaneous CA<sup>2+</sup> transients in hippocampal neurons” and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>: The authors claim that differences were insignificant except comparing GCaMP5k-PSD to Fluo-4 AM. From the error bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> this seems not to be supported by the data.</p><p>10) Does the lack of events with GCaMP5k-PSD indicate that these are extrasynaptic? If so, this should be stated more clearly.</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-C</xref>: For these negative results – how did the authors ensure that the blockers actually worked in these experiments effectively blocking the respective receptors and L-type Ca current?</p><p>12) The legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: “The remaining mSCTs in the KO animals are unaffected by AP-5”. This seems not to refer to the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>.</p><p>13) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows a much larger effect of AP5 than ryanodine. How do the authors interpret this result?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting and timely paper on a topic that has received much recent attention in neuroscience. I believe that this paper should be accepted, but there is one somewhat large issue regarding sample size that need be addressed first:</p><p>Throughout the paper, the sample size for the experiments is low (N of 5 to 6 is not uncommon). For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, which encompasses five separate experiments, the total N for all five experiments appears to be less than 30.</p><p>(This general issue, RE sample size and statistics in neuroscience, is discussed here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v14/n5/full/nrn3475.html">http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v14/n5/full/nrn3475.html</ext-link>). It seems that the N should be increased in some experiments reported here.</p><p>In the first paragraph of the subsection “Visualization of miniature spontaneous CA<sup>2+</sup> transients in hippocampal neurons”: The frequency of spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients was 0.32 per minute. If you sum the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients across all release sites in entire cell, do you get a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient frequency that roughly matches the mEPSC frequency (∼1Hz)? If so, that would be a good validation of the method. If not, then either there is a problem with the method or there's some fraction of release that does not trigger NMDAR/CICR signaling, which would be good to know. If this is not technically feasible, please explain.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: It is surprising that ryanodine had no effect on mEPSC frequency.

They show action potential independent calcium transients in the dendritic region using multiple calcium indicators. The calcium transients required NMDA receptor activity and calcium release from internal stores. Furthermore they show that reducing the calcium transient through inhibiting NMDA receptors or blocking internal stores results in synaptic scaling mediated by protein synthesis and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). The authors suggest that spontaneous neurotransmission through NMDA receptor driven calcium transient is required for synaptic homeostasis.</p><p>The manuscript has several interesting findings, however one major issue is that there is quite a jump between the story on what is the source of spontaneous dendritic calcium transients to how it affects the synapse. Either they need to provide better transition or posit the paper in a different manner. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> through 4 make sense together, but the last two figures, which are addressing synaptic scaling, appear without much of a transition.</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the calcium transient from Fluo-4 AM is not increased in 0 magnesium, the authors do point that out. In light of what is indicated in the Introduction, where they state '…that calcium signal is 20% of the full calcium signal of unblocked NMDA…', it is quite surprising that the signal is not higher in 0 magnesium. This needs to be addressed. Furthermore, because Fluo-4 AM detects calcium events both in the presynapse and postsynapse, an explanation or experiment is required to distinguish these two sources. How did they define the calcium events as dendritic only? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, is the impermeable Fluo-4 experiment conducted in Syb2-mO infected neurons? If so, it is worth checking if there is any spontaneous transients in the presynaptic terminal of cells that express Syb2-mO.</p><p>2) The authors showed mSCT frequency is nicely correlated with mEPSC frequency, when influenced by presynaptic players (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure3</xref>). On the other hand intracellular calcium store blockers, Dantrolene and Ryanodine potentially only affecting the dendrite each reduce mSCT frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). It is surprising and also hard to understand how calcium release from internal stores affects frequency rather than amplitude or kinetics of the calcium transients. It would be important to address if the presynapse is affected by Dantrolene and Ryanodine.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the authors indicate that ryanodine and AP5 each only influence mEPSC amplitudes not the frequency. From the sample trace it appears that frequency is actually increased in both cases, a more representative trace is needed here.</p><p>4) Why does ryanodine affect the calcium transient frequency, but affects only the mEPSC amplitude? This seems contradictory. I would expect an effect on the mEPSC frequency as well.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09262.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) There is an apparent contradiction between the text in subsection “mSCTs are driven by spontaneous neurotransmitter release” and the legend to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>.

Briefly, mEPSCs report synaptic AMPA receptor activity, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients reflect RyR mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events triggered by residual NMDA receptor activity (seen in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>). Therefore, the two measures, although both dependent on spontaneous glutamate release and occur concurrently, report distinct nodes in the signaling cascade. Please also note that in our results Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are not sensitive to AMPA blockers in contrast to their extreme sensitivity to NMDA receptor block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Overall, in revising this manuscript, we have done the following:</p><p>1) We have clarified the description for the signal processing and analysis of Fluo-4 AM calcium transients as well as verifying that all measurements included in this manuscript conform to these analysis standards. We have included in this clarification a more detailed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> that illustrates the process used in detecting these calcium signals.</p><p>2) We have performed new measurements to increase N numbers throughout.

These experiments bolster the N numbers to 8, 9 and 8 respectively.</p><p>A new experiment has been performed to clarify the makeup of the calcium transients detected with Fluo-4 AM. This experiment is now displayed as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. Briefly, ryanodine treated cells (ER store calcium is blocked) were recorded in Fluo-4 AM with and without magnesium in order to confer or relieve the voltage dependence of the NMDA receptor. With no magnesium in the bath the undamped calcium transient of the NMDA receptor can be measured but when magnesium is added to the bath solution no further transients can be measured. This experiment illustrates that the calcium transients measured in 1.25 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> with Fluo-4 AM include a negligible amount of signal from the NMDA receptor itself and are primarily driven by ER stores.</p><p>6) A control experiment has been done to illustrate that under these recording conditions, no appreciable signal from the red channel (Synaptobrevin2-mOrange) is bleeding into the green channel (Fluo-4 AM). Under the conditions used throughout the paper to detect calcium transients with Fluo-4 AM, no appreciable bleed through was detected between the two channels.</p><p>7) Control experiments were performed to confirm the efficacy of Nimodipine.

To illustrate this, dual channel imaging was performed alternating between Fluo-4 AM and Syb2-mO excitation. Images were collected at the same exposure and gain settings as all other Fluo-4 AM experiments (100 ms exposure). 382 peaks were detected in the fluo-4 channel and aligned by peak value to generate an average event.

The fact that removing Mg<sup>2+</sup> from the extracellular solution did not yield larger mSCT amplitudes as measured by Fluo-4 AM was the first clue that these events were not solely dependent on NMDA activity. We have clarified the end of the first paragraph under the Results section to reflect this.</p><p>In order to more directly address the contribution of the NMDA receptor current to the observed Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients we have added a new experiment as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>.</p><p>We incubated neurons with ryanodine for 15 minutes to block RyRs and then loaded them with Fluo-4 AM as before. These cells were imaged in Tyrode’s solution containing TTX but no extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> to allow maximal NMDA currents. Under these conditions Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were observed, but when 1.25 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> was again added no further transients could be measured. These results illustrate that under physiological concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Fluo-4 cannot detect the NMDA Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient without further amplification from ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, because Fluo-4 AM detects calcium events both in the presynapse and postsynapse, an explanation or experiment is required to distinguish these two sources. How did they define the calcium events as dendritic only?</italic></p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> the addition of AP5 was able to abolish the vast majority of mSCTs as detected by Fluo-4 AM. This finding is evidence that these mSCTs are postsynaptic as the distribution of NMDA receptors is highly postsynaptic.</p><p>We used multiple probes or delivery methods to detect these mSCTs (postsynaptic dialysis, sparse tranfection of GCAMP5 probes etc) to verify the postsynaptic origin of the vast majority of the events. They are NMDA receptor block sensitive. Our earlier experiments in the same system provided little to no evidence for a role for presynaptic NMDA receptors during spontaneous neurotransmitter release (Atasoy et al., 2008 Supplementary Figure 2).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref><italic>, is the impermeable Fluo-4 experiment conducted in Syb2-mO infected neurons? If so, it is worth checking if there is any spontaneous transients in the presynaptic terminal of cells that express Syb2-mO.</italic></p><p>In our experiments to date we did not detect any pulsatile presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> release signals. In an earlier study, where we focused on presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in presynaptic terminals (using a similar setting as in here), we found no evidence of discrete events but only of changes in baseline Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in response to neuromodulators such as Reelin (Refer to Bal et al., 2013 Neuron, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The authors showed mSCT frequency is nicely correlated with mEPSC frequency, when influenced by presynaptic players (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure3</italic></xref><italic>). On the other hand intracellular calcium store blockers, Dantrolene and Ryanodine potentially only affecting the dendrite each reduce mSCT frequency (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>). It is surprising and also hard to understand how calcium release from internal stores affects frequency rather than amplitude or kinetics of the calcium transients. It would be important to address if the presynapse is affected by Dantrolene and Ryanodine.</italic></p><p>Calcium release from internal stores generates virtually all of the calcium signal visible with Fluo-4 imaging. The reduction in mSCT frequency with ER store blockers represents the fact that mSCTs can no longer be generated in their presence. In order to clarify this point, we have changed the wording in the Results section for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref> (subsection “mSCT generation requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores”). The remaining mSCTs after treatment with ryanodine are in fact of reduced amplitude suggesting that the remaining mSCTs are partially blocked by this treatment.</p><p>With 1.25 mM Mg <sup>2+</sup> in the extracellular solution the signal detected by Fluo-4 AM is exclusively produced by ER store calcium. To illustrate this point we conducted an experiment where cells were pre-treated with ryanodine to block calcium release from ER stores. Cells were then imaged with and without magnesium to show both the maximal current flow for the NMDA receptor (no magnesium) and the physiological condition (1.25 mM magnesium). With no magnesium in the bath and the NMDA receptor current uninhibited, we were able to measure calcium transients after the treatment with ryanodine. However when magnesium was again washed over the cells no further transients could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). From these results we conclude that the diminutive NMDA current present in 1.25 mM magnesium is not detectable by our method.</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>, the authors indicate that ryanodine and AP5 each only influence mEPSC amplitudes not the frequency. From the sample trace it appears that frequency is actually increased in both cases, a more representative trace is needed here.</italic></p><p>As we indicated in our response to reviewer #2’s comments, the acute treatment of neurons with ryanodine did not alter mEPSC frequency. We have included this data to help illustrate that the primary effect of ryanodine in driving mEPSC scaling is the postsynaptic block of mSCT activity rather than driving a change in release frequency. This point has now been clarified in the Results section discussing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (subsection “Blocking mSCTs induces homeostatic eEF2 kinase-dependent synaptic scaling”, second paragraph). Upon close inspection, the example trace shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> was not a good representative and has been replaced.</p><p><italic>4) Why does ryanodine affect the calcium transient frequency, but affects only the mEPSC amplitude? This seems contradictory. I would expect an effect on the mEPSC frequency as well.</italic></p><p>From our results, we believe that ryanodine acts downstream of mEPSC activity but its impact on generated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and local protein translation alters mEPSC amplitudes. In other words, mSCTs largely report CICR driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that are triggered but not tightly coupled to the mEPSCs (which mainly report AMPA receptor driven currents). This issue is now better stated in the text where we discuss the impact of acute ryanodine treatment on mEPSC frequency (subsection “Blocking mSCTs induces homeostatic eEF2 kinase-dependent synaptic scaling”, second paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
