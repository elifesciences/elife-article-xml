SENPs are cysteine proteases with a catalytic center located within a channel between two subdomains that catalyzes SUMO C-terminal cleavage for processing of SUMO precursors and de-SUMOylation of target proteins. The β-grasp domain of SUMOs binds to an exosite cleft, and allosterically activates SENPs via an unknown mechanism. Our molecular dynamics simulations showed that binding of the β-grasp domain induces significant conformational and dynamic changes in SENP1, including widening of the exosite cleft and quenching of nanosecond dynamics in all but a distal region. A dock-and-coalesce mechanism emerges for SENP-catalyzed SUMO cleavage: the wedging of the β-grasp domain enables the docking of the proximal portion of the C-terminus and the strengthened cross-channel motional coupling initiates inter-subdomain correlated motions to allow for the distal portion to coalesce around the catalytic center.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18249.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18249.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>allosteric activation</kwd><kwd>SUMOylation</kwd><kwd>protein dynamics</kwd><kwd>dock-and-coalesce</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM058187</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Huan-Xiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM118091</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Huan-Xiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Simulations of molecular dynamics suggest how the binding of the β-grasp domain of SUMO1 induces conformational and dynamic effects to activate SENP1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Whereas conjugation with ubiquitin targets proteins for degradation, conjugation with small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMOs), or SUMOylation, is involved in various cellular processes and required for normal growth and development in all eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson, 2004</xref>). Although there is only 18% sequence identity between ubiquitin and SUMO1 (the founding member of the SUMO family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Okura et al., 1996</xref>]), their structured domains share a common fold known as β-grasp, in which five β-strands wrap around an α-helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayer et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). SUMOylation, like ubiquitination, is through an isopeptide linkage between a conserved Gly-Gly motif at the C-terminus of SUMOs and a lysine sidechain on target proteins. All SUMOs are translated as precursors that are first processed by the SENP family of SUMO-specific proteases, whereby a short C-terminal extension is cleaved to expose the reactive Gly-Gly motif. Like the much better-known posttranslational modification phosphorylation, SUMOylation is reversible, and de-SUMOylation is also catalyzed by SENPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yeh, 2009</xref>). The catalytic activity of SENPs on short peptide substrates is low, likely to avoid off-target cleavage, and is substantially enhanced by the β-grasp domain of SUMOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mikolajczyk et al., 2007</xref>). The mechanism of this allosteric activation has remained poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to gain insight into the allosteric mechanism through extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18249.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of the SENP1-SUMO1 complex (PDB entry 2IY1).</title><p>SENP1 is shown as gray surface and cartoon representations in the left and right panels, respectively, and the closed catalytic channel is boxed and enlarged in the middle panel.

SENPs belong to the cysteine protease superfamily, and regulate both physiological and pathological processes mediated by SUMOylated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yeh, 2009</xref>). As an example, hypoxia (i.e., low oxygen), a condition common to fetal development and tumorigenesis, induces the nuclear entry and SUMOylation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>). SUMOylated HIF1α is subject to ubiquitin-dependent degradation, and hence deSUMOylation of HIF1α by SENP1 is central to hypoxia response. For this and other reasons SENP1 is overexpressed during the development of prostate cancer, and has emerged as a potential therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bawa-Khalfe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Several types of SENP inhibitors have been identified, including SUMO variants or C-terminal fragments tethered with electrophilic traps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hemelaar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borodovsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dobrota et al., 2012</xref>) and small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albrow et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ponder et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Madu et al., 2013</xref>). The therapeutic value of these inhibitors is limited by covalent linkage with the catalytic cysteine residue, low specificity, or low potency. Better understanding of the mechanism for the allosteric activation of SENPs may lead to new avenues for drug development.</p><p>Structural studies have shown that SENP catalytic domains only undergo localized conformational rearrangements upon binding SUMOs (as precursors, processed products, or SUMO conjugates), and that SENP-SUMO interactions are largely similar during precursor processing and deSUMOylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reverter and Lima, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shen et al., 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alegre and Reverter, 2014</xref>). In SENP1, the catalytic triad comprises residues His533, Asp550, and Cys603 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The catalytic domain (residues 419–644) consists of eight α-helices and seven β-strands, divided into two subdomains. The lower subdomain contains the α1, α2, and α8 helices and the β1-β2 hairpin, while the upper subdomain contains the α4-α6 helices and the β3-β7 sheet. The two remaining helices, α3 and α7, glue the two subdomains and also form the bottom of a channel where the extended C-terminus of SUMO1 lies and the catalytic triad is situated. Three loops, including residues 464–466 between α2 and α3, residues 530–533 between β4 and β5, and residues 599–602 between β7 and α7, line the channel and likely undergo transient motions during the entrance of the SUMO C-terminus into the channel. Hereafter these loops are referred to as loopA, loopB, and loopC, respectively. One tryptophan residue, Trp534, floors the substrate while another, Trp465, forms a lid over its conserved Gly-Gly motif. The burial of the catalytic center in the channel and consequently the transient motions around the channel necessary for proper alignment of the substrate with respect to the catalytic center may contribute to the low catalytic activity of SENPs on short peptides.</p><p>The β-grasp domain of SUMO1 binds into a large cleft to the side (hereafter the exosite), and makes separate contacts with the two subdomains of SENP1: the β1-β2 hairpin in the lower subdomain and the α4-α5 helices in the upper subdomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). An insertion in the β1-β2 hairpin of SENP2 that extended the interface with SUMO2 resulted in no other change in the structure of the catalytic domain but nevertheless increased its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alegre and Reverter, 2014</xref>). Given that SENPs generally lack major conformational changes upon binding SUMOs, there is no simple explanation for the allosteric activation of SENPs by the β-grasp domain of SUMOs. In this context, we note that, in addition to conformational changes, the possibility that changes in conformational dynamics can mediate allosteric effects has received attention in the recent literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo and Zhou, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Similar to SENPs, deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in the cysteine protease class also have very low catalytic activity on short peptide substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dang et al., 1998</xref>). Although the catalytic domains of DUBs in different families have different structural scaffolds, they all contain a catalytic channel that bears resemblance to that in SENPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Misaghi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Messick et al., 2008</xref>). The resemblance further extends to the positioning of the ubiquitin domain in the exosite. It may thus be expected that allosteric activation mechanisms of SENPs and DUBs share certain similarities.</p><p>A major step toward elucidating the allosteric activation of SENP1 by the β-grasp domain of SUMO1 was taken in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). These authors confirmed the ability of a pre-bound β-grasp domain, as contained in a truncated SUMO1 construct (residues 1–92, hereafter referred to as trunSUMO1), to enhance the SENP1 catalytic activity on a short peptide substrate, and further traced the enhancement solely to an increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>. Their NMR data showed that trunSUMO1 binding yielded a gradient in backbone amide chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) emanating from the exosite cleft to the catalytic center. Significant sidechain methyl CSPs were also observed on six residues that dotted the region from the exosite cleft to the catalytic center, which indicated to the authors that the allosteric effect was propagated through the hydrophobic core. Their Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersion data showed that trunSUMO1 binding enhanced microsecond-millisecond (μs-ms) dynamics for residues around the catalytic center, suggesting a realignment of these residues. Chen et al.’s NMR data provided residue-level information, but their sparseness precluded a full picture on how the allosteric communication occurred in SENP1 upon binding trunSUMO1.</p><p>Here we present an atomistic picture for the allosteric communication derived from MD simulations. The simulations showed that trunSUMO1 binding induces significant conformational and dynamic changes in SENP1, including widening of the exosite cleft and quenching of nanosecond (ns) dynamics in all but a distal region. Calculated backbone amide and sidechain methyl CSPs are in broad agreement with the experimental data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al. (2014)</xref> but more pronounced, and our sidechain CSPs clearly identify two hydrophobic pathways, each within a subdomain, for allosteric communication from the exosite cleft to the catalytic center. The β-grasp domain, by serving as a bridge that links the two exosite interface regions, strengthens intra- and inter-subdomain motional coupling, which in turn may be the underlying reason for the quenching of ns dynamics and potentially may also be the instigator of inter-subdomain μs-ms dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2015</xref>). The concerted action of the β-grasp induced conformational and dynamic changes is captured by a dock-and-coalesce mechanism for SENP-catalyzed SUMO cleavage, whereby the wedging of the β-grasp domain into the exosite cleft enables the docking of the proximal portion of the C-terminus, and the strengthened cross-channel coupling initiates inter-subdomain correlated motions to allow for the distal portion to coalesce around the catalytic center.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We carried out three replicate explicit-solvent MD simulations for apo SENP1, for SENP1 bound with trunSUMO1, and for SENP1 bound with the full-length SUMO1 precursor (referred to as preSUMO1 hereafter).

This strengthened inter-community coupling is in line with the stronger inter-subdomain contact noted above. It comes about because the β-grasp domain couples strongly to both subdomains. Therefore, the β-grasp domain, by serving as a bridge linking the two exosite interface regions, strengthens the motional coupling both within and between the subdomains of SENP1. A similar bridging role was identified for a peptide in inducing inter-domain allosteric communication in Pin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>With the strengthened intra-subdomain coupling upon trunSUMO1 binding, it can be expected that allosteric communication from the exosite cleft to the catalytic center becomes more effective. The effectiveness of allosteric communication between two sites can be measured by the lengths, defined using the residue-residue positional correlations (i.e., stronger correlations correspond to shorter lengths), of paths connecting the sites. Indeed, the path lengths from the two exosite interface regions to the catalytic center are shorter in the trunSUMO1-bound form than in the apo form. This result is in line with the two hydrophobic pathways identified by sidechain methyl CSPs.</p><p>The simultaneous occurrence of strengthened intra- and inter-subdomain coupling and quenching of ns dynamics observed here on SENP1 upon binding an allosteric activator conforms to a pattern previously recognized from a number of other proteins (including Pin1) in which conformational dynamics plays a prominent role in mediating allosteric communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo and Zhou, 2015</xref>). This pattern was explained by a dynamic model of allostery. According to this model, fast motions (e.g., those on a ns timescale) are uncorrelated; an allosteric activator strengths inter-community coupling, which in turn leads to quenching of fast motions. The strengthened coupling here comes about because the β-grasp domain serves as a bridge that links the two interfacial regions. The model further predicts another dynamic effect, i.e., slower (e.g., μs-ms), cross-community correlated motions are initiated. Indeed, Chen et al.’s CPMG data for residues around the catalytic center indicated enhanced μs-ms conformational exchange upon trunSUMO1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Allosteric effects can be reproduced by restraining the two exosite interface regions at an widened separation</title><p>The results presented above lead to the hypothesis that the conformational and dynamic effects of β-grasp binding are achieved through increasing the exosite cleft distance and then rigidly holding the two interface regions at the widened separation.

First, widening of the exosite cleft may enhance the rate at which the substrate binds to the catalytic center, although this effect may not be detectable in an enzymatic assay if the binding does not rate-limit the overall enzymatic reaction. Second, initiation of slow conformational dynamics may facilitate the proper alignment of the substrate around the catalytic residues. These putative effects can explain the observation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al.

Tethering can also help both the binding step and the subsequent catalytic step. The binding of a substrate-containing SUMO (i.e., a precursor or SUMO conjugate) likely occurs in a sequential manner: the β-grasp domain first wedges into the exosite cleft and the C-terminus then docks into the catalytic channel. Tethering can facilitate this binding by correctly orienting the C-terminal substrate. This effect and the β-grasp induced widening of the exosite cleft together may speed up the docking of the C-terminus into the catalytic channel sufficiently as to make the full binding step rate-limited by the initial wedging of the β-grasp into the exosite. Tethering can also reinforce the motional coupling between the exosite interface regions and the channel-lining loops. This may in turn intensify the slow conformational dynamics that facilitates the proper alignment of the substrate around the catalytic residues, thereby accelerating the catalytic step.</p><p>In previous studies we have put forward a docking-and-coalesce mechanism to describe the binding of intrinsically disordered proteins, which, similar to the disordered SUMO C-terminus, usually form extended conformations on their targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Qin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). Here we adapt this mechanism to describe the steps of SENP-catalyzed SUMO cleavage reaction just before the actual cut of the (iso)peptide bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The process starts with the wedging of the SUMO β-grasp domain into the SENP exosite cleft. This wedging widens the separation between and also tightly links the two exosite interface regions. The widening of the exosite cleft enables the docking of the proximal portion of the C-terminus into the catalytic channel. Moreover, the wedged β-grasp domain strengthens the motional coupling within and between the two subdomains of SENP, and the newly docked proximal portion of the SUMO C-terminus reinforces this coupling. According to a theoretical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo and Zhou, 2015</xref>), the strengthened coupling sets up the condition for the emergence of inter-subdomain correlated motions, which finally allow for the distal portion of the SUMO C-terminus to align properly around the catalytic center for bond cleavage.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18249.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Illustration of the dock-and-coalesce mechanism for SENP-catalyzed SUMO C-terminal cleavage.</title><p>SENP is shown as two ovals (representing two subdomains) connected by two strings, with the three channel-lining loops highlighted as small circles; SUMO is shown as an oval (representing the β-grasp domain) with a tail (the C-terminus).

Two hydrophobic pathways (bundles of dashed arrows) propagate the allosteric effects from the exosite interface regions to the catalytic center.

Two consequences can be expected of the more extensive exosite interactions of SENP2 with SUMO2 than with SUMO1. First, stronger electrostatic attraction across the exosite interface quickens the initial wedging of the SUMO2 β-grasp domain into the exosite and slows down the reverse process. Second, the more extensive exosite interactions likely cause stronger allosteric effects of the wedged β-grasp domain, resulting in faster docking of the SUMO2 C-terminus into the catalytic channel. These two consequences together may explain the lower <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> for SUMO2 than for SUMO1. A precedent of the second consequence occurred in Pin1, where peptides bound at an inter-domain exosite were identified to serve a bridging role similar to the one proposed here for the β-grasp domain; a peptide with more extensive across-domain interactions indeed induced stronger allosteric effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo and Zhou, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here the expectation for stronger allosteric effects is specifically supported by the observation that a pre-bound SUMO2, but not SUMO1, β-grasp domain enhanced the SENP2 catalytic activity on a peptide substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mikolajczyk et al., 2007</xref>).

The principal component analysis was done after pooling the conformations (every other saved ones) from all the three simulations, using Cα coordinates of SENP1 residues 429–637. For distributions of the cleft distance and loop movements, histograms were calculated using all the snapshots saved in the three replicate simulations. Chemical shifts were predicted separately for each simulation (using every 15th saved conformation in sim1 or sim2 or every 10th conformation in sim3), and the results from the three simulations were then averaged. For RMSF, analysis was done over non-overlapping 50-ns windows (of which there were 3, 3, and 6, respectively, in sim1, sim2, and sim3). The results were first averaged over these windows in each simulation, and then averaged again over the three replicate simulations. Finally, a community analysis was done separately for each replicate simulation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Yuan Chen for introducing the SENP1 allostery problem to us.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Allosteric Activation of SENP1 by SUMO1 β-Grasp Domain Involves a Dock-and-Coalesce Mechanism&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Volker Dötsch, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors..</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors report molecular dynamics simulations to study the mechanism of allosteric activation of SENP1 by SUMO1 β-Grasp domain. The design of the simulations was motivated in part by previous NMR studies and in part by previous simulation study by the authors of a different system (PIN1). The mechanism that emerged from the simulations, referred to as a &quot;dock-and-coalesce&quot; mechanism, suggests that the binding of SUMO1 quenches fast (nanosecond) dynamics while stimulates slow (microsecond-millisecond) collective motions that couple distal regions together. In particular, the collective motion may facilitate structural rearrangements in the active site, therefore impacting the catalytic efficiency of SENP1.</p><p>Overall, the study is well motivated by a problem (allostery) of general significance. The proposed mechanism is qualitatively consistent with reported experimental data (distinct effects on fast and slow dynamics), and it provides novel physical insights into the allosteric activation of SENP1 and related systems (e.g., DUB). The mechanism also provides new clues to the design of small molecules that target SENP1 activation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is now becoming relatively easy to reach microsecond time scales in MD simulations, even for relatively large systems, and one should make an argument for why 200 ns were deemed appropriate to address the questions posed here since modern computational resources would allow simulations in excess of what is presented here.</p><p>2) It is also now common practice to reach statistical redundancy by running replicate simulations. To obtain statistical significance of the results a replication of the simulation would be important.</p><p>3) The figure caption of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> should mention that 2C maps the sampling onto the principal components. Otherwise, the figure is confusing.</p><p>4) It would help to indicate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> where exactly the cleft distance was measured.</p><p>5) The comparison with the experimental chemical shift perturbations validates the simulations but doesn't quite help with the mechanistic picture. It would be useful to discuss a mechanistic model that explains the observed effects. In particular, how does triggering slow motions lead to reorganization of the active site that favors catalysis. Additional discussion that further clarifies this important aspect of activation would be beneficial to the clarity of the proposed mechanism.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18249.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) It is now becoming relatively easy to reach microsecond time scales in MD simulations, even for relatively large systems, and one should make an argument for why 200 ns were deemed appropriate to address the questions posed here since modern computational resources would allow simulations in excess of what is presented here.</italic> </p><p>We now report results from three replicate simulations for each of the three systems.

Additional discussion that further clarifies this important aspect of activation would be beneficial to the clarity of the proposed mechanism.</italic> </p><p>We agree that chemical shift perturbations, from either experiments or simulations, are only indicators of allosteric effects and by themselves do not provide mechanistic insight. That’s why the analyses of conformational and dynamic properties in the simulations are useful – they potentially lead to mechanistic explanations. As for the link between slow motions and catalytic activation, we have now made the discussion of our proposed mechanism somewhat tighter and more to the point (subsection “A dock-and-coalescence mechanism for SENP-catalyzed SUMO cleavage”, third paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> caption), but we feel a more detailed discussion of this link would be too speculative at this time.</p></body></sub-article></article>
