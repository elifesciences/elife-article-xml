The structural bases of their function are well established, particularly within a model archaeal homolog, sodium, and aspartate symporter Glt<sub>Ph</sub>. However, the mechanism of gating on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane remains ambiguous. We report Cryo-EM structures of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> reconstituted into nanodiscs, including those structurally constrained in the cytoplasm-facing state and either apo, bound to sodium ions only, substrate, or blockers. The structures show that both substrate translocation and release involve movements of the bulky transport domain through the lipid bilayer. They further reveal a novel mode of inhibitor binding and show how solutes release is coupled to protein conformational changes. Finally, we describe how domain movements are associated with the displacement of bound lipids and significant membrane deformations, highlighting the potential regulatory role of the bilayer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glutamate transporters</kwd><kwd>GltPh</kwd><kwd>ion-coupled membrane transporters</kwd><kwd>membrane structure</kwd><kwd>structural biology</kwd><kwd>molecular biophysics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37NS085318</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boudker</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS064357</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boudker</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Substrate releasing or inhibitor binding on the intracellular side of a glutamate transporter homologue require movements of the transport domain through the lipid membrane, which undergoes adaptive deformations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sodium and aspartate symporter Glt<sub>Ph</sub> is an archaeal homolog of human glutamate transporters, which clear the neurotransmitter glutamate from the synaptic cleft following rounds of neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Danbolt, 2001</xref>).

Recently, structural studies of the family members, including human variants, have enriched the field and have been mostly consistent with earlier findings on Glt<sub>Ph</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canul-Tec et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garaeva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). These studies collectively provide what appears to be a nearly complete picture of the structural changes that underlie transport. Briefly, the transporters are homotrimers with each protomer consisting of a centrally located scaffold or trimerization domain and a peripheral transport domain that harbors the L-aspartate (L-asp) and three sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) ions binding sites. The crucial conformational transition from the outward-facing state (OFS), in which L-asp binding site is near the extracellular solution, into the inward-facing state (IFS), from which the substrate is released into the cytoplasm, involves a rigid-body ‘elevator-like’ movement of the transport domain by ca 15 Å across the lipid membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akyuz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erkens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ruan et al., 2017</xref>). The structures of the apo transporters in the OFS and IFS showed similar positions of the transport domains that have undergone local structural rearrangements associated with the release of the bound L-asp and Na<sup>+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Verdon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jensen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The OFS and IFS conformations show a remarkable internal symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yernool et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crisman et al., 2009</xref>). In particular, the transport domains feature two pseudo-symmetric helical hairpins (HP) 1 and 2. HP1 lines the interface between the transport and scaffold domains in the OFS, reaching from the transporter’s cytoplasmic side. HP2 lies on the surface of a large extracellular bowl formed by the transporter and occludes L-asp and three Na<sup>+</sup>-binding sites (NA1, 2, and 3). The two hairpins meet near the middle of the lipid bilayer, and their non-helical tips provide essential coordinating moieties for the bound L-asp. As the transport domain translocates into the IFS, HP2 replaces HP1 on the domains interface, while HP1 now lines an intracellular vestibule leading to the substrate-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Structural and biophysical studies have established that HP2 serves as the transporter’s extracellular gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Verdon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Focke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Riederer and Valiyaveetil, 2019</xref>). HP2 closes when the transporter is bound to Na<sup>+</sup> ions and L-asp and when it is empty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Verdon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yernool et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jensen et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, it assumes open conformations when the transporter is bound only to Na<sup>+</sup> ions or Na<sup>+</sup> ions and competitive blockers DL-<italic>threo-β</italic>-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA) or (2S,3S)−3-[3-[4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoylamino]benzyloxy]aspartate (TFB-TBOA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Verdon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canul-Tec et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The gating process in the IFS is less well understood. Based on symmetry considerations, it was first proposed that HP1 might serve as the intracellular gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yernool et al., 2004</xref>) or that the very tip of HP2 might open to release the substrate and ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeChancie et al., 2011</xref>). A large opening of HP2 seemed unlikely because of the steric constraints on the domain interface. However, later structures of a gain-of-function mutant of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and human homologous neutral amino acid transporter ASCT2 showed that the transport domain in the IFS could swing away from the scaffold, opening a crevice between the domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akyuz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garaeva et al., 2018</xref>). In this so-called ‘unlocked’ conformation, there was sufficient space for HP2 to open. More recent studies of ASCT2 and of an archaeal Glt<sub>Tk</sub>, a close homolog of Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, further showed that HP2 could open, suggesting that it serves as a gate in both the OFS and IFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garaeva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arkhipova et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we report a series of Cryo-EM structures of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> reconstituted into nanodiscs in the IFS and OFS. We show that the transport domain explores a large range of motions in the IFS to which the bilayer adapts through significant bending. These motions are coupled to local changes in HP2 to mediate variable exposure of substrate-binding sites to the solvent and accommodate ligands of diverse sizes. They also affect the area of the hydrophobic interface between the transport and scaffold domains. When the transporter is bound to non-transportable blockers or Na<sup>+</sup> ions only, the area is significantly larger than when the transporter is apo or fully loaded with the substrate and ions. The more extensive interface may contribute to the transport domain’s inability to return to the OFS, providing a mechanism of inhibition and coupled transport.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Large range of motions of the transport domain in the IFS</title><p>In the outward-facing Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and EAAT1 in complex with blockers TBOA and TFB-TBOA or Na<sup>+</sup> ions only, HP2 opens to various degrees, enabling access to the substrate-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canul-Tec et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Verdon et al., 2014</xref>). To picture gating in the IFS, we imaged the Glt<sub>Ph</sub> reconstituted into MSP1E3 nanodiscs in the presence of various ligands by single-particle Cryo-EM. Because wild type Glt<sub>Ph</sub> strongly prefers the OFS in detergent and lipid environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akyuz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ruan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Georgieva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hänelt et al., 2013</xref>), we used a variant of Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, conformationally constrained in the IFS by crosslinking of cysteine residues placed into the transport and scaffold domains, Glt<sub>Ph</sub>-K55C/A364C (Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>). Earlier crystal structures of Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup> pictured the position of the transport domain that was very similar to those visualized in unconstrained inward-facing Glt<sub>Ph</sub> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akyuz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Verdon and Boudker, 2012</xref>).</p><p>We determined the structures of Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup> free of ligands (Glt<sub>Ph</sub> <sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-open) or in complex with Na<sup>+</sup> ions (Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na) and bound to L-asp (Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp), TBOA (Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TBOA), TFB-TBOA (Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA), and the wild type outward-facing Glt<sub>Ph</sub> in complex with TBOA (Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>OFS</sup>-TBOA) to 3.52, 3.66, 3.05, 3.39, 3.71, and 3.66 Å resolution, respectively (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The Cryo-EM Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp structure was nearly identical to the earlier crystal structure (RMSD of 1.0 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>). The transport domain was well packed against the scaffold primarily through interactions of HP2 and the extracellular part of TM8 (TM8a) with the scaffold TMs 2, 4, and 5. The central axis of the roughly cylindrical transport domain formed a ~ 35 ° angle with the membrane normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). HP2 was closed over the substrate-binding site and packing between the transport and scaffold domains left no space for it to open. A similar inter-domain orientation and packing were also observed in a previously solved crystal structure of the occluded apo Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup> (Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-closed, PDB code 4P19, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Verdon et al., 2014</xref>). In the new Cryo-EM structures of Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na, Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-open, Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TBOA, and Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA, approximately the same regions of HP2 and TM8a remained juxtaposed against the scaffold. However, the bulk of the transport domain swung out away from HP2 and the scaffold to different extents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) with the largest angle between the transport domain and the membrane normal of ~ 47° in Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Together, the crystal and Cryo-EM structures define gating mechanisms in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> on the extracellular and cytoplasmic sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). In the OFS, the bulk of the transport domain remains mostly static relative to the scaffold, and the labile HP2 serves as the extracellular gate. In the IFS, HP2 can maintain interactions with the scaffold, while the bulk of the transport domain swings away to allow access to the binding site. Notably, in a crystal structure of a gain-of-function aspartate-bound mutant Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-R276S/M395R, the transport domain is positioned at ~ 45 ° angle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akyuz et al., 2015</xref>), similar to the Glt<sub>Ph</sub> <sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA Cryo-EM structure. However, in Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-R276S/M395R, HP2 remains closed over the binding site and a large lipid-filled gap forms between the transport and scaffold domains. It is currently unclear whether the transport domain first swings away from the scaffold providing space for the consequent HP2 opening or whether HP2 remains in place while the bulk of the domain swings out in a ‘wag-the-dog’ manner.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Gating mechanism in the IFS.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Structures of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> protomers are shown in surface representation viewed in the membrane plane.

Our Cryo-EM structure of the outward-facing Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>OFS</sup>-TBOA in nanodisc confirmed that the transporter took the same conformation in the absence of crystal contacts in a lipid bilayer (RMSD = 1.0 Å, PDB accession code 2NWW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

We then determined the structures of the Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup> complexes with the blockers TFB-TBOA and TBOA under saturating conditions in the presence of 10 mM inhibitors.</p><p>In the Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA structure, TFB-TBOA density was well resolved, and we modeled the inhibitor in its binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We also modeled L-asp into the excess density in the binding site of Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The bound L-asp and TFB-TBOA share some critical interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Thus, R397 coordinates the side chain carboxylates of aspartate moieties, and D394 coordinates the amino groups. However, TFB-TBOA assumes a different rotomer, leading to a displacement of the backbone carboxylate and the loss of coordination by the highly conserved N401. The aromatic rings of TFB-TBOA protrude from the ligand-binding site and lodge in between the transport and scaffold domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>).

Instead, the hairpin remains mostly closed, but its N-terminal arm separates from the C-terminal arm. The bound TBOA assumes a similar rotomer as TFB-TBOA, though N401 still coordinates the backbone carboxylate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The C-terminal arm coordinates the sidechain carboxylate of the aspartate moiety as in Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp. The TBOA benzyl group inserts in between the two arms packing against M311 and M362 sidechains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>). The N-terminal arm movement disrupts the Na2 binding site, consistent with previous observations that binding of TBOA and TBA to the IFS of the transporter required only two Na<sup>+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reyes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oh and Boudker, 2018</xref>). The movement creates a small opening into the cytoplasmic milieu between the tips of HP1 and HP2. It is not clear whether this conformation reflects a functional state. Perhaps, it recapitulates a transient transporter state, in which a Na<sup>+</sup> ion has already left the Na2 site while the substrate and two other Na<sup>+</sup> ions are still bound. Water might use the cytoplasmic opening to reach and eventually displace the remaining solutes.</p><p>These structures collectively show that in Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>, bulky competitive blockers can be accommodated either by opening HP2 or by parting its N- and C-terminal arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Since the OFS and IFS share the same binding pocket for the substrate and competitive inhibitors, it is likely that the new inhibitor binding mode with parted HP2 arms can be sampled in the OFS as well. This mode of blocker binding might provide new pharmacological avenues for the inhibition of human glutamate transporters.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>M311 and R397 couple HP2 gating to ion and substrate binding</title><p>To further explore the gating mechanism, we aimed to resolve a structure of Na<sup>+</sup> only-bound Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup> and imaged nanodisc-reconstituted Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup> frozen in the presence of 200 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We isolated two distinct structural classes of Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup> protomers after symmetry expansion and classification without alignment. The structural heterogeneity was not surprising in retrospect because Na<sup>+</sup> concentration in the sample was close to the dissociation constant measured for Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reyes et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we observed both Na<sup>+</sup>-bound (Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na) and apo (Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-open) states. We assigned these states based on the conformations of the conserved non-helical NMD motif (residues 310–312) in TM7, which coordinates Na<sup>+</sup> ions in the Na1 and Na3 sites, and TM3, part of the Na3 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guskov et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, the M311 sidechain protrudes toward the L-asp and Na2 sites in Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na and Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp structures. In contrast, it flips out toward TM3 in our Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-open structure and the previous Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-closed crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Verdon et al., 2014</xref>). We did not observe density for Na<sup>+</sup> ions in the Na1 and Na3 sites of Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na. However, all ion-coordinating residues are positioned similarly to Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Notably, Na1 is coordinated in Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp, in part, by an occluded water molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). In Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na, the water is no longer occluded and is part of an aqueous cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

The opening resembles that in Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na compared to the occluded Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>) and shares the overall mechanism: HP2 remains in contact with the scaffold while the rest of the transport domain swings out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). From the transport domain viewpoint, the conformational changes lead to a similar HP2 opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Interestingly, in Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na, there is also a small shift of HP1 away from the substrate-binding site, possibly increasing water access to Na1. A similar small movement of the otherwise rigid HP1 was observed in the crystals of apo Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup> grown in an alkali-free buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Verdon et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Two residues in the transport domain - M311 and R397 - move significantly during gating and might couple solute binding and release to large-scale conformational changes. Here we consider a sequence of structural events, which might underlie ion and substrate release in the IFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), starting with Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp and going to Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na, Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-open, and Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-closed (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). In Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp, the R397 side chain extends upward, toward the extracellular side of the membrane, allowing D390 to coordinate its guanidinium group. Thus positioned, R397 makes space for L-asp and coordinates its sidechain carboxylate, while D394 coordinates its amino group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). M311 protrudes into the binding site and coordinates Na2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Extensive interaction of HP2 with the bound L-asp and Na2 favor the closed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). HP2 opening accompanies L-asp and Na2 release (Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na). R397 is now clamped between D390 and D394, while M311 remains in place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b</xref>). The consequent release of Na1 and Na3 leads to a restructuring of the NMD motif and outward rotation of M311, which now packs against the open HP2 of Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b</xref>). The guanidinium group of R397 remains between D390 and D394. To achieve the closed apo state, M311 swings further out into the lipid bilayer, allowing HP2 to close. R397 descends deep into the binding pocket, coordinated now only by D394, and is poised to make direct or through-water interactions with carbonyl oxygens of the closed tip of HP2. Steric hindrance of M311 and more positive local electrostatics may prevent R397 from entering the aspartate-binding site and closing HP2 in Na<sup>+</sup>-only-bound Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>. Physiologically, such Na<sup>+</sup>-bound occluded states should be avoided to prevent Na<sup>+</sup> leaks.</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-58417-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>M311 and R397 couple HP2 gating to ion and substrate binding in the inward-facing state.</title></caption></media><p>Interestingly, in our Cryo-EM analysis, we did not find any Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-closed structures previously visualized by crystallography. It might be that the open conformation of the apo Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup> is the preferred state of the transporter and that the Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-closed state is assumed only transiently, before the outward transition of the transport domain. Packing crystal contacts, which include extensive interactions between the cytoplasmic sides of the transport domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Verdon et al., 2014</xref>), might have stabilized the closed conformation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ligand-dependent domain interface</title><p>HP2 and TM8a comprise most of the transport domain surface interacting with the scaffold in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> inward-facing states. Strikingly, in each of our IFS structures, HP2 takes a different conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). These are similar in structures with occupied Na1 and Na3 sites, that is in complexes with Na<sup>+</sup> ions only and with L-asp, TBOA, or TFB-TBOA. The differences are mostly around the tip of HP2 near the L-asp and Na2 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>). In contrast, the helices restructure significantly in the apo conformations, particularly in Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a and c</xref>). When we superimposed all IFS structures, aligning them on the scaffold domain, we observed that the HP2/TM8a motifs present the same bulky hydrophobic residues flanking the flexible tips for interactions with the scaffold: L347, I361, and L378 form virtually the same spatial arrangement. Only in Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-open, I350 replaces L347 because the HP2/TM8a motif, particularly the HP2 N-terminal arm, moves outward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d and e</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the positions of the HP2 tip on the domain interface are mostly conserved. The structural differences in the hairpins then lead to their different orientations relative to the scaffold and different positions of the transport domains, which lean away and rotate to different extents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). The rotation is small for Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp, relative to Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-closed (7°), but is significant for Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na (23°), and Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA (29°) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). A consequence of these differences is that the bulky residues in the HP2 N-terminal arm, L339, L343, L347, and I350 make more extensive interactions with the scaffold TMs 4a and 4 c in Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na and Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA compared to other structures. Furthermore, interaction areas between HP2/TM8 and the scaffold domain differ, with Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-closed and Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp structures having the smallest areas of 1086 and 1076 Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively, and Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na showing the largest increase of ~ 400 Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Translocation-deficient states show more extensive inter-domain interfaces.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Surface representations of the scaffold domain in light brown, and cartoon representation of HP2/TM8a motif with Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp colored gray, Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-closed purple, Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-open pink, Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TBOA salmon, Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA berry, Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na red.

Of these, the most notable one is inserted between the N-terminal arm of HP2 and the scaffold TM4a (Lipid<sub>Out</sub> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref>). Interestingly, we observe lipids at almost the same location in the Cryo-EM structures of the outward- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2020</xref>) and inward-facing L-asp-bound transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). The lipid packs similarly against TM4a in the OFS and IFS but interacts differently with HP2: near the tip and the extracellular base, respectively. It is not yet clear whether during the outward-to-inward transition, as HP2 slides past TM4a, the lipid is temporarily displaced or disordered. Interestingly, HP2 opening in the OFS, as seen in Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>OFS</sup>-TBOA, and the IFS requires displacement of Lipid<sub>Out</sub>. Thus, the lipid molecules at this site could modulate gating and the translocation dynamics, affecting both substrate affinity and transport rate. In Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA and Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-open structures, the transport domain leans away from the scaffold far enough to open a window between the two domains that connects the interior of the bilayer to the solvent-filled crevice on the cytoplasmic side of the transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). We observe excess densities in the opening, suggesting that lipids enter the space at a position structurally symmetric to Lipid<sub>Out</sub> (Lipid<sub>Window</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).</p><p>Perhaps most strikingly, we observe nanodisc distortions correlated to positions of transport domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). The nanodisc is nearly flat in the Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>OFS</sup>-TBOA structure, where the hydrophobic regions of the transport domain and the scaffold are aligned. In Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp, the transport domain forms the sharpest angle to the membrane normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), and its hydrophobic region descends the furthest toward the cytoplasm. The resulting hydrophobic mismatch between the scaffold and transport domains leads to membrane bending to accommodate both, as suggested by recent computational studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>) and studies of Glt<sub>Tk</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arkhipova et al., 2020</xref>). At the protein periphery, the membrane deformation at the transport domain reaches ~ 8 Å shift toward the cytoplasm, observable from both sides of the nanodisc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). In contrast, when the inward-facing transport domains swing out, their hydrophobic regions are closer to the extracellular side, and the membrane is less bent. In an extreme case of Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA structure, the membrane bends outward, particularly when viewed from the cytoplasmic side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). It is unclear whether the nanodisc restricts how far the transport domains swing in the Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA structure. Indeed, we observe interactions between the domains and the MSP1E3 lipoprotein, suggesting the size of the nanodiscs might be limiting. Notably, structures of glutamate transporter homologs determined in detergent solutions featured similar positions of the domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garaeva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akyuz et al., 2015</xref>).</p><media id="video3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-58417-video3.mp4"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Transport domain movements coupled to nanodisc distortions.</title></caption></media></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The series of structures that we have determined by Cryo-EM suggest that both substrate translocation and substrate gating in the IFS require movements of the transport domain through membrane bilayer. The C-terminal arm of HP2 and TM8a pack against the scaffold near the engineered K55C/A364C crosslink in all IFS structures, while the rest of the transport domain moves to various degrees. It is possible that the crosslink constraints the movements, but we do not think so. First, Na<sup>+</sup>-bound unconstrained inward-facing Glt<sub>Tk</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arkhipova et al., 2020</xref>) is structurally similar to Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na (overall RMSD = 0.7), with little difference in the crosslink region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Also, in the inward-facing neutral amino acid transporter ASCT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garaeva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garaeva et al., 2019</xref>), the corresponding HP2/TM8a regions remain mostly rigid during gating, and only the HP2 tip moves to open the binding site or accommodate an inhibitor. Together, these structures suggest that the transport domain pivots around the HP2/TM8a region near resides corresponding to A364 in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> to open the substrate-binding site. This might be a shared feature of the glutamate transporter family. These movements rely on the remarkable conformational plasticity of HP2 and the interface between the transport and scaffold domains, which differ in each functional intermediate of the transporter. Our recent studies suggest that both translocation of the transport domain and substrate release into the cytoplasm are slow processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oh and Boudker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huysmans et al., 2020</xref>). Most strikingly, subtle packing mutations in HP2 at sites distant from the substrate-binding site decrease affinity in the OFS and IFS and increase the elevator transitions frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huysmans et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our structures show that Na<sup>+</sup> ions and L-asp release require movement of the transport domain, mediated by conformational changes of HP2 and the HP2/TM8a-scaffold interface. These extensive conformational changes, involving repacking the domain interface, may explain why substrate gating is slow in the IFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oh and Boudker, 2018</xref>). Gating in the OFS, where only HP2 moves to bind Na<sup>+</sup> ions and L-asp is faster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hänelt et al., 2015</xref>), although slow HP2 opening has also been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Riederer and Valiyaveetil, 2019</xref>). Notably, kinetic studies showed that the release (and binding) of one Na<sup>+</sup> ion in the IFS, most likely Na2, is rapid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oh and Boudker, 2018</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the release of Na2 requires little structural change, limited at most to the change observed in the Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TBOA structure. Our structural data further suggest that mutations in HP2 may increase the substrate dissociation rate in the IFS by increasing the dynamics of the hairpin and the hairpin/scaffold interface.</p><p>Single-molecule studies of the elevator dynamics showed that the rate-limiting high-energy transition state most likely structurally resembles the IFS, and the transport domain might make multiple attempts to achieve a stable observable IFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huysmans et al., 2020</xref>). These studies suggest that multiple IFS conformations exist and are separated by significant energetic barriers. While our structures most likely represent the lower-energy states populated during Cryo-EM imaging, and not the high-energy transition states, their multiplicity supports the existence of a complex inward-facing conformational ensemble.</p><p>Significant alterations of the structure of the surrounding membranes and some of the well-structured annular lipids accompany the observed large-scale functional domain movements. In general, it appears that lipids occupy all indentations and crevices on the surface of the protein open to the bilayer and large enough to accommodate hydrocarbon chains even in the absence of specific interactions between the headgroups and protein moieties. The density for some of the lipids, such as Lipid<sub>In</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), is very well resolved. These lipids display conserved locations and structures in all resolved protein complexes. However, it is unclear whether they are structurally immobilized or exchange rapidly with the surrounding bulk lipids.</p><p>Other lipids would have to move in and out of their binding sites during the transport cycle. These include Lipid<sub>Out</sub>, observed in the OFS and IFS, and the structurally symmetric cytoplasmic Lipid<sub>Window</sub> observed in the IFS. Interestingly, Lipid<sub>Out</sub> sits between the HP2 N-terminal arm and the scaffold in both the OFS and IFS. Thus, there is an interplay between HP2 and lipids in the two states. In the OFS, when HP2 closes over the binding site, Lipid<sub>Out</sub> fills the space between the hairpin and the scaffold, and when HP2 opens, it displaces the lipid and interacts directly with the scaffold. In the IFS, Lipid<sub>Window</sub> moves in when the transport domain leans away from HP2 to open the substrate-binding site and moves out when it closes in. Such intimate involvement of lipids suggests that they can regulate both substrate-binding and elevator dynamics. However, only modest effects of specific lipids on Glt<sub>Ph</sub> transport activity have been reported thus far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McIlwain et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, mammalian EAAT1 and ASCT2 feature a similar space between the N-terminal arm of HP2 and the scaffold in the OFS and IFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canul-Tec et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garaeva et al., 2018</xref>), and likely can accommodate lipids. Further studies are needed to establish the relevance of the identified lipid-binding sites to lipid-mediated regulation reported in mammalian EAATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zerangue et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tzingounis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fairman et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Our structures, Glt<sub>Tk</sub> structures in nanodiscs, and molecular dynamics simulations, visualize lipid bilayer bending, accommodating the conformational change from the OFS to IFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arkhipova et al., 2020</xref>). Due to the limited size of the nanodiscs, structural studies do not resolve the long-range effects on the membrane deformations. However, simulations showed that the membrane perturbation extends to nearly 100 Å. The computational study also suggests that the energy penalty of bilayer bending might be as large as 6–7 kcal/mol protomer. Our results show that not only the OFS to IFS transitions but also substrate gating in the IFS involve changes in membrane deformation. Thus, high energetic costs of membrane bending might accompany the glutamate transporter functional cycle, suggesting that the physical properties of lipid bilayers, such as thickness and stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lundbaek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rusinova et al., 2014</xref>), can significantly impact function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>DH10B</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td/><td>Cells for Glt<sub>Ph</sub>expression</td></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21(DE3)</td><td>Stratagene</td><td/><td>Cells for MSP1E3 expression</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>Glt<sub>Ph</sub></td><td>DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature03018">10.1038/nature03018</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>MSP1E3</td><td>Addgene<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.addgene.org/20064/">https://www.addgene.org/20064/</ext-link></td><td>PRID:Addgene_20064</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Origin</td><td>OriginLab</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Leginon</td><td>doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2005.03.010">10.1016/j.jsb.2005.03.010</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Relion</td><td>doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.42166">10.7554/eLife.42166</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_016274">SCR_016274</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MotionCorr2</td><td>doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4193">10.1038/nmeth.4193</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>CTFFIND4</td><td>doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2015.08.008">10.1016/j.jsb.2015.08.008</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_016732">SCR_016732</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>UCSF chimera</td><td>doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jcc.20084">10.1002/jcc.20084</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004097">SCR_004097</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>ResMap</td><td>doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2727">10.1038/nmeth.2727</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Pymol</td><td>Schrödinger</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000305">SCR_000305</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>NanoAnalyze</td><td>TAinstruments</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Nano ITCRun</td><td>TAinstruments</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Appion</td><td>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jsb.2009.01.002">10.1016/j.jsb.2009.01.002</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_016734">SCR_016734</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>PDBePISA</td><td>doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2007.05.022">10.1016/j.jmb.2007.05.022</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015749">SCR_015749</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>DoGpicker</td><td>doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2009.01.004">10.1016/j.jsb.2009.01.004</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Glt<sub>Ph</sub> expression, purification, and crosslinking</title><p>The fully functional seven-histidine mutant of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> that has been used in previous studies and that is referred to as wildtype (WT) for brevity, and the K55C/C321A/A364C Glt<sub>Ph</sub> mutant were expressed as C-terminal His<sub>8</sub> fusions and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yernool et al., 2004</xref>).

To check availability of free thiols after crosslinking, proteins were incubated with 5-fold molar excess of fluoroscein-5-maleimide (F5M). Fluorescent F5M-labeled proteins were imaged on SDS-PAGE under blue illumination and stained with Coomassie blue.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Reconstitution of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> into nanodiscs</title><p>Membrane scaffold protein MSP1E3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denisov et al., 2004</xref>) was expressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> and Glt<sub>Ph</sub> was reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs as previously described, with modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ritchie et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, <italic>E. coli</italic> polar lipid extract and egg phosphatidylcholine in chloroform (<italic>Avanti</italic>) were mixed at 3:1 (w:w) ratio and dried on rotary evaporator and under vacuum overnight. The dried lipid film was resuspended in buffer containing 20 mM Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM L-asp and 80 mM DDM by 10 freeze/thaw cycles resulting in 20 mM lipid stock. The purified Glt<sub>Ph</sub> protein in DDM was mixed with MSP1E3 and lipid stock at 0.75:1:50 molar ratio at the final lipid concentration of 5 mM and incubated at 21°C for 30 min. Biobeads SM2 (<italic>Bio-Rad</italic>) were added to one third of the reaction volume and the mixture was incubated at 21°C for 2 hr on a rotator.

The peak fractions corresponding to Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-containing nanodiscs were collected for Cryo-EM imaging. To prepare substrate-free WT Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup> in nanodiscs, the reconstitution mixtures were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 g, diluted with 10 x volume of buffer containing 20 mM Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4, and 50 mM choline chloride, and concentrated using 100 kDa cutoff concentrator. After repeating the procedure twice, substrate-free transporters in nanodiscs were purified by SEC in the same buffer. The peak fractions were collected and immediately supplemented with buffers containing 200 mM NaCl and 10 mM DL-TBOA, 200 mM NaCl and 10 mM TFB-TBOA, or 200 mM NaCl. The presence of the MSP1E3 and Glt<sub>Ph</sub> proteins in the samples was confirmed by SDS-PAGE.

All further processing steps were done using RELION 3.0 (Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp, Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TBOA, Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA, Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-NaCl) or Relion 3.1 (Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TBOA) unless otherwise indicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>). DoGpicker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Voss et al., 2009</xref>) as part of the Appion processing package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lander et al., 2009</xref>) was used for reference-free particle picking. Picked particles were then extracted and subjected to 2D classification to generate 2D class-averages which were used as templates for automated particle picking in Relion. The particles were extracted using a box size of 275 Å with 2x binning and subjected to 2 rounds of 2D classification ignoring CTFs until the first peak.</p><p>For Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp, Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TBOA, Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA, and for the Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>OFS</sup>-TBOA, particles selected from 2D classification were re-extracted without binning and further classified into six classes without enforcing symmetry using initial models generated in CryoSPARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>) and filtered to 40 Å. Particles from the best classes showing trimeric transporter arrangements were subjected to 3D refinement applying C3 symmetry. After conversion, the refinement was continued with a mask excluding the nanodisc. To further improve the resolution of the maps, the particles after 3D refinement were subject to an additional round of 3D classification without alignment with C3 symmetry applying a mask to exclude the nanodisc. Particles from the best class were subjected to further masked refinement and CTF refinement. A masked refinement following CTF refinement yielded final maps with the following resolution: 3.05 Å (Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp), 3.71 Å (Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA), 3.39 Å (Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TBOA), 3.66 Å (Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>OFS</sup>-TBOA). The resolution limits of the refined maps were assessed using Relion postprocessing and gold standard FSC value 0.143 using masks that excluded the nanodiscs. To search for potential conformational heterogeneity, we also processed these datasets with no symmetry applied at any stage of data processing (C1). The obtained C1 maps showed slightly lower resolution but no detectable difference when compared to the results from the C3 refinement. We also processed all datasets with symmetry expansion (C3) followed by focused 3D classification on one Glt<sub>Ph</sub> subunit (explained in detail for Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na data processing below) and did not find additional conformations. The cryo-EM map of Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TBOA was processed using the RESOLVE density modification program implemented in Phenix, which improved the overall estimated resolution by 0.01 Å and enabled slightly better visualization of the density of the bound TBOA benzyl group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Terwilliger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonine et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>During processing of the data for Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-NaCl, 529,155 particles selected from 2D classification were re-extracted without binning and were subjected to 3D classification with K = 1 and no symmetry applied, using Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp map as the initial model. The same particles were subject to 3D refinement with C3 symmetry. After conversion, the refinement was continued with a mask to exclude the nanodisc, resulting in a 3.56 Å resolution map. To probe for conformational heterogeneity, we performed symmetry expansion implemented in Relion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scheres, 2016</xref>). 1,587,465 protein subunits were rotated to the same position and subjected to a focused 3D classification without alignment with T = 40 into 10 classes. The local mask was generated using Chain A of PDB model 3KBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>) and included only densities from one subunit of the reference map. Two different conformations were observed. From the 10 classes, five classes showed a conformation identified as Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na and five classes showed a different conformation identified as Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-open. The best Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na class (191,349 particles), which contained 12% of the symmetry expanded protomers and the best Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-open class (148,582 particles), which contained 9% of the symmetry expanded particles, were separately subjected to a final focused 3D refinement with C1 using a mask to exclude the nanodisc. The local angular searches in this refinement were conducted only around the expanded set of orientations to prevent contributions from the neighbor subunits in the same particle. The resulting maps were postprocessed in Relion using the same mask as in 3D classification after symmetry expansion. The final resolution at gold standard FSC value 0.143 was estimated as 3.52 Å for the Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Apo-open map and 3.66 Å for Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na map. Local resolution variations were estimated using ResMap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kucukelbir et al., 2014</xref>). After symmetry expansion with C3, we also tried to first subtract the density outside of one Glt<sub>Ph</sub> subunit and then perform 3D classification without alignment on the subtracted particles. The signal subtraction did not further improve the 3D classification and the 3D refinement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Model building and refinement</title><p>For atomic model building from Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp, Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TBOA, and Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA maps, crystal structure of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> in the IFS (PDB code 3KBC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>) was docked into the density maps using UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>).

The acyl chains or ethanolamine heads were truncated to fit the visible densities. Models were iteratively refined applying secondary structure restraints and validated using Molprobity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). For further cross validation and to check for overfitting, all atoms of each model were randomly displaced by 0.3 Å and each resulting model was refined against the first half-map obtained from processing. FSC between the refined models and the half-maps used during the refinement were calculated and compared to the FSC between the refined models and the other half-maps. In addition, the FSC between the refined model and sum of both half-maps was calculated. The resulting FSC curves were similar showing no evidence of overfitting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Isothermal titration calorimetry</title><p>For ITC experiments, Glt<sub>Ph</sub> K55C/C321A/A364C proteins were purified by affinity chromatography as above.

The authors extensively explore the conformational flexibility of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> in the inward-facing state and in lipid nanodiscs, using a locked variant. They demonstrate comparably large motions of the transport domain depending on binding of substrates, but also more subtle rearrangements in the binding site region. Together, this results in important novel insights in gating and transport. In addition, the paper confirms and extends previous observations for Glt<sub>Tk</sub> and ASCT2 concerning the role of HP2 in substrate release on the cytoplasmic side of the protein, as well as on extensive bilayer deformations during transport predicted by molecular dynamics simulations indicating a dynamic interplay between the conformational state of elevator-like proteins and their environment.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A weakness of the study is that the most important findings (conformational changes associated with inhibitor binding and substrate release on the cytoplasmic side) are deduced from structures of a cross-linked triple-cysteine mutant K55C/C321A/A364C, which artificially traps the transporter in an inward-facing state. This choice is justified by the fact that crystal structures of the locked and unconstrained versions had shown a very similar structure (subsection “Large range of motions of the transport domain in the IFS”). However, this type of information is not available for several of the new structures for which no accompanying crystal structure was determined. Therefore, the consequences of this approach need to be discussed in more detail. E.g., it seems that all movements of the transport domain pivot around the 55/364 crosslink (Figure 1). Is this the only mode of flexibility still available due to the crosslink? Are there additional reasons to expect that these are representative conformations?</p><p>2) The authors should also comment on the symmetry of these structures, which apparently reflects the cross-linking, even though it is known that the native protein can form asymmetric arrangements, based on e.g. HS-AFM (Ruan et al., 2017), smFRET (Akyuz et al., 2013). Thus, it would be helpful if the authors could explain whether any asymmetry is observed between the subunits in any of the other cryo-EM images – whether in the global conformation or in the orientation of HP2 – and explicitly describe the choice of assuming either C1 or C3 symmetry for each map.</p><p>3) The putative density of the TBOA molecule in the Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup> map (Figure 2—figure supplement Figure 1B) is not sufficiently strong to unambiguously determine the binding mode of the inhibitor. While the authors attribute the absence of density for the benzyl group to a mixture of enantiomers binding to the pocket, this has not been reported to be a problem for other cryo-EM structures (or X-ray structures) of SLC1 members with TBOA. In a previous study of the last author, TBA was used instead of TBOA to circumvent the problems with mixed enantiomer binding; is there a reason why the authors did not choose this approach in the current study? An alternative explanation for the absence of benzyl density for TBOA is that, if not all three protomers are occupied by an inhibitor (see point #1), the density of unoccupied and occupied sites will be averaged when C3 symmetry is applied. A third possibility for the origin of the weak benzyl moiety density, is that the cryo-EM grid contains a mixture of asp- and inhibitor-bound species which are averaged during EM data processing. Is the binding affinity of the two inhibitors TBOA and TFB-TBOA cysteine-crosslinked variant known? If not, and if the authors are able to carry out follow-up experiments, such measurements would help demonstrate that the sites are likely to be saturated. The authors did not describe any measures in the purification protocol to remove aspartate carried over from the media (L-aspartate binds with high affinity) to prevent this scenario. Thus, an alternate suggested experiment would be to increase the purity of the sample in the presence of TBOA (e.g., by extensive washes of the membranes or affinity resin) and repeat the cryo-EM measurements. In the absence of either of these additional experiments, the authors should revise their conclusions from the TBOA-bound inward-facing EM structure.</p><p>4) The observed bilayer deformations are very interesting and even mentioned in the Abstract, but somewhat underlit and discussed in only one short paragraph. The authors are encouraged to analyze this data in more detail, e.g., using a plot similar to Figure 2 in Zhou et al., 2019 or Figure 4B in Arkhipova et al., 2020. This would allow to determine, for example, whether the deformations are indeed limited to the transport domains as predicted/observed in the indicated publications.</p><p>5) The protein is reconstituted in MSP1E3 nanodiscs. The authors should comment on to what extent the size of the nanodisc is expected to affect the conformation flexibility of the protein. E.g., do they see direct contacts between the transport domain and the nanodisc scaffold protein? Is the outward movement of the transport domain with TFB-TBOA constrained by the nanodisc, either directly (direct contacts) or indirectly (by the nanodisc putting a limitation on the extent of membrane deformation)?</p><p>6) The study explicitly discusses the positioning and potential functional relevance of lipids in different regions of the structure. The authors suggest that the annular lipids in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> play a similar regulatory role to arachidonic acid for the mammalian transporters, yet they do not include any lipid analysis to determine the identity of the annular lipids resolved in the density maps to understand which lipid in bacterial membranes could have a similar regulatory effect on Glt<sub>Ph</sub>. Without knowledge of the lipid identity and functional data assessing whether these lipids modulate the kinetics of transport in reconstituted liposomes, the proposed functional role of lipids in regulating substrate affinity and conformational dynamics remains speculative.

However, because the wild-type Glt<sub>Ph</sub> strongly prefers the outward-facing state (OFS) over the inward-facing state (IFS) in lipid bilayer environment and the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> ions or TBOA (Akyuz et al., 2015, Ruan et al., 2017, Huang et al., 2020, Georgieva et al., 2013, Hanelt et al., 2013), crosslinking was necessary to image the inhibitor-bound and substrate-releasing IFS. As mentioned by the reviewer and in the paper, the L-Asp-bound crosslinked IFS is nearly identical to the unconstrained IFS (Akyuz et al., 2015, Verdon and Boudker, 2012). We think that the substrate-releasing and inhibitor-bound IF states reported in our study are also minimally affected by the crosslink based on the following evidence:</p><p>1) The structure of the Na<sup>+</sup>-bound Glt<sub>Tk</sub> (which shares a 77% sequence identity with Glt<sub>Ph</sub>) in the IFS (PDB 6XWR) is very similar to our Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na structure (Arkhipova et al., 2020). The overall RMSD is 0.7 Å, and the crosslink sites superimpose very well (new Figure 3—figure supplement 2C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The CA-CA distances between 55C and 364C in Glt<sub>Ph</sub> and the corresponding residues in Glt<sub>Tk</sub> are 7.6 and 7.2 Å. Furthermore, when we superimposed the trimerization domains of Glt<sub>Tk</sub> in Na<sup>+</sup> with our Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), we again observed nearly identical configurations of the crosslink site, with the CA-CA distance between the cysteines in Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp of 7.4 Å. Thus, the crosslinks do not affect the transport domain's position relative to the scaffold in these structures.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na (a) and Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp (b) (in colors) aligned to Glt<sub>Tk</sub> Na<sup>+</sup>-bound structure (grey, PDB accession code 6XWR) on the trimerization domain.</title><p>55C and 364C side chains of Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Na are shown as sticks and CA atoms of the corresponding K57 and A364 of Glt<sub>Tk</sub> are shown as spheres.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58417-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>2) In the Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA structure, the transport domain adopts the same conformation as the transport domain of Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>OFS</sup>-TBOA (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). This observation suggests that the crosslink does not alter the conformation of the transport domain in Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA. We also note that in published unconstrained IFS structures of a neutral amino acid transporter ASCT2 (Garaeva et al., 2019), the transport domain swings away from the scaffold in a similar manner to Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA. Only the tip of HP2 flips open to release the substrate or to bind TBOA. The rest of HP2, including the region corresponding to 55C-364C in Glt<sub>Ph</sub>, remains mostly rigid. The CA-CA distance between A440 and L100 (equivalent to 55C and 364C in Glt<sub>Ph</sub>) in TBOA- and substrate-bound structures are 7.9 and 8.3 Å, reflecting little structural rearrangements. Notably, Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA and TBOA-bound ASCT2 IFS show similar HP2 opening and “unlocked” transport domain position. In summary, the transport domain of the glutamate transporters can move away from the scaffold domain in the IFS to various degrees, pivoting around the HP2/TM8a contact region, where the crosslink is placed.</p><p>We added the above discussion to the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should also comment on the symmetry of these structures, which apparently reflects the cross-linking, even though it is known that the native protein can form asymmetric arrangements, based on e.g. HS-AFM (Ruan et al., 2017), smFRET (Akyuz et al., 2013). Thus, it would be helpful if the authors could explain whether any asymmetry is observed between the subunits in any of the other cryo-EM images – whether in the global conformation or in the orientation of HP2 – and explicitly describe the choice of assuming either C1 or C3 symmetry for each map.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer pointed out, we could not observe OFS conformations in the crosslinked IFS constructs, based on the ~100 % crosslinking efficiency, confirmed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). However, we went through an extensive search to classify any conformational heterogeneity possible within the IFS. The initial 3D refinements with C1 symmetry of the particles imaged in 200 mM NaCl showed the density around HP2 that appeared to be a mixture of two conformations. This observation prompted us to perform symmetry expansion, followed by focused 3D classification on one protomer (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). Using this approach, we identified two states (Glt<sub>ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>–Na and Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-apo-open). Under these conditions, the trimers are likely asymmetric, with some protomers bound to Na<sup>+</sup> ions and other not. For all other datasets (Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>OFS</sup>-TBOA, Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-Asp, Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>–TBOA, Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>–TFB-TBOA), we did not observe structural heterogeneity using this strategy and applied C3 symmetry to achieve the highest resolution of the final maps. The detailed description of data processing strategies and comments on the symmetry are in the subsection “Image processing” in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The putative density of the TBOA molecule in the Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup> map (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B) is not sufficiently strong to unambiguously determine the binding mode of the inhibitor.

The improved density corresponding to TBOA benzyl group enables us to model the bound inhibitor with good confidence (revise Figure 2A, B, C, and the revised text in the subsection “Two transporter blockers bind differently to Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>”). We note that the ambiguous TBOA densities are a shared problem for the reported cryo-EM and X-ray structures. In the first report on TBOA-bound crystal structure (Boudker et al., 2007), we used brominated TBOA and anomalous scattering to place the benzyl group. In our updated 3.39 Å Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup> -TBOA map, the excess density for TBOA is as good or better than in previous reports (Garaeva et al., 2019, Arkhipova et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In a previous study of the last author, TBA was used instead of TBOA to circumvent the problems with mixed enantiomer binding; is there a reason why the authors did not choose this approach in the current study?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, TBA is no longer commercially available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An alternative explanation for the absence of benzyl density for TBOA is that, if not all three protomers are occupied by an inhibitor (see point #1), the density of unoccupied and occupied sites will be averaged when C3 symmetry is applied.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above, we were able to improve the resolution by reprocessing the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A third possibility for the origin of the weak benzyl moiety density, is that the cryo-EM grid contains a mixture of asp- and inhibitor-bound species which are averaged during EM data processing.

The affinities are 6.6 and 3.8 μM, respectively (new Figure 2—figure supplement 2, and the revised text in the subsection “Two transporter blockers bind differently to Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>”). Because we used 10 mM DL-TBOA or TFB-TBOA in our imaging buffers, the sites were likely saturated.</p><p>We also think that it is very unlikely that there were any residual L-Asp in our Cryo-EM samples. The L-Asp-free transporters were prepared by SEC of nanodisc-reconstituted crosslinked transporters in Na<sup>+</sup>-free buffer (Materials and methods subsection “Reconstitution of Glt<sub>Ph</sub> into nanodiscs”). Under these conditions, the L-Asp affinity for the transporter is very low. We and others have employed similar protocols to prepare substrate-free transporter samples in the past with success (Reyes et al., 2013). NaCl and inhibitors were then added to the substrate-free transporter before freezing grids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The observed bilayer deformations are very interesting and even mentioned in the Abstract, but somewhat underlit and discussed in only one short paragraph.

In Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup>-TFB-TBOA, the edge of the transport domain comes very close to the nanodisc rim, as is evident in the cytoplasmic view (Figure 5E). Notably, we first reconstituted crosslinked Glt<sub>Ph</sub><sup>IFS</sup> into nanodiscs in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> and L-Asp. After substrate removal (see above and Materials and methods), we added Na<sup>+</sup> and TFB-TBOA back to the nanodisc sample. Therefore, our study shows that after reconstitution into nanodisc, the transport domain can swing out to accommodate TFB-TBOA. We do not know if without the constrain of the nanodisc, the transport domain could swing out even more. We have added a corresponding sentence to the subsection “Transport domain movements coupled to lipid bilayer”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The study explicitly discusses the positioning and potential functional relevance of lipids in different regions of the structure.
