Using tunable photo- and mechano-stimulation, we identified two distinct categories of homeostatic responses during the sleep-like state of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (lethargus). In the presence of weak or no stimuli, extended motion caused a subsequent extension of quiescence. The neuropeptide Y receptor homolog, NPR-1, and an inhibitory neuropeptide known to activate it, FLP-18, were required for this process. In the presence of strong stimuli, the correlations between motion and quiescence were disrupted for several minutes but homeostasis manifested as an overall elevation of the time spent in quiescence. This response to strong stimuli required the function of the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor in neurons, but not that of NPR-1. Conversely, response to weak stimuli did not require the function of DAF-16/FOXO. These findings suggest that routine homeostatic stabilization of sleep may be distinct from homeostatic compensation following a strong disturbance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04380.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04380.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04380.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The regenerative properties of sleep are required by all animals, with even the simplest animal, the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, displaying a sleep-like state called lethargus. During development, nematodes must pass through four larval stages en route to adulthood, and the end of each stage is preceded by a period of lethargus lasting 2 to 3 hr.</p><p>Human sleep is divided into distinct stages that recur in a prescribed order throughout the night. Nematodes, on the other hand, simply experience alternating periods of activity and stillness as they sleep. Nevertheless, in both species, any disruptions to sleep automatically lead to adjustments of the rest of the sleep cycle to compensate for the disturbance and to ensure that the organism gets an adequate amount of sleep overall.</p><p>To date, it has been assumed that a single mechanism is responsible for adjusting the sleep cycle after any disturbance, regardless of its severity. However, Nagy, Tramm, Sanders et al. now show that this is not the case in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Sleeping nematodes that were lightly disturbed by exposing them to light or to vibrations—causing them to briefly increase their activity levels—compensated for the disturbance by lengthening their next inactive period. By contrast, worms that were vigorously agitated by stronger vibrations showed a different response: the alternating pattern of stillness and activity was disrupted for several minutes, followed by an overall increase in the length of time spent in the stillness phase.</p><p>Experiments using genetically modified worms revealed that these two responses involve distinct molecular pathways. A signaling molecule called neuropeptide Y affects the response to minor sleep disruptions, whereas a transcription factor called DAF-16/FOXO is involved in the corresponding role after major disruptions. Given that neuropeptide Y has already been implicated in sleep regulation in humans and flies, it is not implausible that similar mechanisms may occur in response to disturbances of our own sleep.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04380.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04380.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd><kwd>lethargus</kwd><kwd>quiescence</kwd><kwd>neuropeptides</kwd><kwd>insulin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 1256989</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Biron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CASI award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Biron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005665</institution-id><institution>Kinship Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Searle Scholars Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Biron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-0638477</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tramm</surname><given-names>Nora</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The sleep cycle of nematode worms adjusts to compensate for sleep disturbances, with neuropeptide Y involved in the response to minor disruptions, and the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO in the response to major disruptions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sleep architecture—the duration, timing, and order of individual stages of sleep—is derived from a combination of internal timekeeping pathways, a drive towards an appropriate baseline (sleep pressure), and external constraints. Collectively, the use of both mammalian and non-mammalian models has suggested that sleep is phylogenetically ancient and evolutionarily conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell and Tobler, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sehgal and Mignot, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nelson and Raizen, 2013</xref>). The key behavioral hallmarks of sleep are episodic reduced motion, reversibility, typical postures, sensory gating, and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell and Tobler, 1984</xref>). Generally, the homeostatic drive underlies correlations between the strength and duration of a disruption and the subsequent duration and quality of sleep. Behavioral signatures of homeostasis include faster time-courses of wake-to-sleep transitions, prolonged periods of sleep, and increased arousal thresholds following a period of deprivation that increases sleep pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moses et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tobler, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allada and Siegel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Raizen et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is the simplest model organism that has been shown to exhibit a sleep-like state to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Raizen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nelson and Raizen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho and Sternberg, 2014</xref>). The 2–3 hr period of lethargus, a developmental stage that precedes the termination of each larval stage, is characterized by behavioral quiescence, a cessation of feeding, reduced or delayed responses to external stimuli, a distinct posture, and compensation following deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Van Buskirk and Sternberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Raizen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schwarz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iwanir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho and Sternberg, 2014</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of the circadian clock protein PERIOD is required for synchronization of lethargus, and its mRNA levels track the developmental/molting cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jeon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allada et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tennessen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Monsalve et al., 2011</xref>).

After a deprivation period of 30 min during lethargus, the onset of long response latencies to chemical stimuli was accelerated. In addition, mechanical stimulation for 60 min at the time that the onset of lethargus was expected resulted in increased subsequent peak quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Raizen et al., 2008</xref>). Recently, quiescent behavior and homeostatic rebound were also seen when a sleep-like state was induced anachronistically in adult animals, suggesting that developmental factors are not essential for neuromodulation during <italic>C. elegans</italic> sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho and Sternberg, 2014</xref>).</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> can locomote forward or backward by propagating dorsoventral body bends from anterior to posterior or vice versa, respectively. Alternatively, they move in a variety of non-directional manners collectively referred to as dwelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">von Stetina et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gallagher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gjorgjieva et al., 2014</xref>). During lethargus, <italic>C. elegans</italic> prominently exhibit quiescence—the complete absence of dynamic muscle contraction. Alternating bouts of locomotion and quiescence comprise the simple architecture of <italic>C. elegans</italic> sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Raizen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iwanir et al., 2013</xref>). In a previous study, we have shown that the durations of these bouts are correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iwanir et al., 2013</xref>), but the mechanisms underlying this process of routine stabilization were not examined. In this study, we analyze the behavioral responses of sleeping nematodes under undisturbed, weakly disturbed, and strongly disturbed conditions. To do so, we continuously assayed the locomotion of <italic>C. elegans</italic> from the mid fourth intermolt stage (L4int), through the fourth lethargus stage (L4leth), and into the mid young adult stage (YA).</p><p>We found that weak photo- or mechano-stimulation transiently skewed the dynamics of bouts while preserving the characteristic pairwise correlations. Thus, under unperturbed or weakly perturbed conditions, homeostatic compensation manifested as a transient extension of quiescence bouts (and shortening of motion bouts under some conditions) in response to prolonged motion. This form of compensation under low noise conditions, termed micro-homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iwanir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nelson and Raizen, 2013</xref>), required the function of the neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor homolog, NPR-1.</p><p>In contrast, strong stimuli induced a qualitatively different homeostatic response: the animals moved continuously for several minutes, after which quiescence monotonically returned to its baseline level. Compensation for the motion induced by a strong stimulus manifested as an upshift in the baseline fraction of time spent in quiescence, rather than a transient extension of quiescence bouts. The homeostatic responses to strong stimuli required the function of the DAF-16/FOXO in neurons (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Driver et al., 2013</xref>) but not the function of NPR-1. Conversely, micro-homeostasis was not abolished in <italic>daf-16</italic> mutants.</p><p>In addition, we show that neuropeptidergic signaling is not strictly required for maintaining high levels of mean quiescence during lethargus. The loss of function of UNC-31/CAPS, a calcium-dependent activator protein required for dense core vesicle exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avery et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charlie et al., 2006</xref>), resulted in a minor reduction of overall quiescence. In contrast, quiescence was strongly suppressed by the loss of the subsets of mature neuropeptides that were processed by the EGL-3 proprotein convertase or the EGL-21 carboxypeptidase E (CPE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kass et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jacob and Kaplan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Husson et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2007</xref>). As previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stawicki et al., 2013</xref>), this apparent discrepancy can be resolved: collectively, our data indicate that a balance between inhibitory and excitatory contributions from different peptides modulates the duration of bouts of quiescence.</p><p>Our findings support a model in which locomotion during lethargus is coupled to a measure of increased sleep pressure. Quiescence serves to ameliorate this pressure and homeostatic regulation dynamically maintains an appropriate quiescence baseline. Interestingly, the homeostatic routine stabilization of motion and quiescence in low-noise environments is mechanistically distinct from homeostatic responses following strong, stressful, disruptions. To our knowledge, the analysis presented here is the first to identify this distinction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Motion plays a causal role in prolonging quiescence during lethargus</title><p>Homeostatic regulation of lethargus was previously examined using manually delivered strong mechanical stimuli, after which baseline levels of responsiveness were regained in 4 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Raizen et al., 2008</xref>). However, even undisturbed animals compensate for spontaneous prolonged motion with prolonged quiescence during lethargus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iwanir et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, a mechanism that dynamically stabilizes lethargus behavior may be invoked by motion in quiet or weakly noisy environments. If so, weak stimuli should transiently skew the bout architecture by elongating motion bouts and causing a subsequent (compensatory) extension of quiescence bouts. To test this, we first exposed wild-type animals at the fourth intermolt larval stage, L4int, to pulses of blue light of intensities ranging from 0.3–100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> and measured their responses using the frame subtraction method. In brief, this method consists of digitally recording the behavior of the animals and assessing the levels of motion and quiescence based on the number of pixels that change their brightness between consecutive frames (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nagy et al., 2014</xref>). The observed responses depended on the light intensity and the duration of the stimulus, and we determined that a 15 s pulse of light at an intensity of 20–40 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> evoked weak, reproducible responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1,2</xref>). Interestingly, we noted that 5 s pulses failed to produce a sharp response specifically during lethargus. This suggested that the animals were less responsive during lethargus and that reduced responsiveness could be assayed separately from delayed responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Raizen et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The response of L4int larvae and post lethargus young adult (YA) animals to weak blue light stimuli consisted of elevated levels of locomotion, which persisted for 15–25 s after the end of the pulse, followed by a 2 min decline back to baseline locomotion levels. In contrast, during L4leth the average level of locomotion crossed its baseline 1 min after it peaked, proceeded to fall below it for 2–3 additional min (p &lt; 0.01), and only then stabilized at baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The transient trough in locomotion resulted from an increase in the fraction of time the animals were quiescent rather than from slower motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04380.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Motion plays a causal role in determining the duration of subsequent quiescence during lethargus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild-type animals at the mid L4int, late L4int, L4leth, and YA stages were exposed to 30 s light stimuli at an intensity of 20 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>.

Identical responses were observed whether the onset of the stimulus interrupted a bout of quiescence or motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The increase in the fraction of time spent in quiescence after the stimulus was removed could have been caused by an extension of quiescence bouts, shortening of motion bouts, or both. To distinguish between these possibilities, we turned to an accurate and computationally intensive behavioral analysis. This previously described approach was based on continuous measurements of the dynamics of body posture at high temporal and spatial resolutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iwanir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nagy et al., 2014</xref>). Using this analysis and a 15 s weak light stimulus, we measured the durations of bouts of motion and quiescence after the stimulus was turned off. We found that, during the first half of lethargus, the compensatory response was comprised of an increase and a decrease in the durations of quiescence and motion bouts, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, p &lt; 0.01). During the second half of lethargus, a compensatory increase in the durations of quiescence bouts was still observed.

Having controlled for the mere durations, we found a significant effect of the level of locomotion on the duration of the subsequent quiescence bout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right panel). A similar analysis, performed exclusively on bouts that contained directed motion, considered the separation between the two groups based on the fraction of the bout spent in directed motion and produced similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

However, compensation took on a different form: the overall level of baseline quiescence was elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>).

Moreover, <italic>unc-31</italic> mutants did not exhibit paralysis or anachronistic quiescence outside of lethargus and their overall locomotory behavior during lethargus was similar to wild-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nagy et al., 2013</xref> and data not shown). Nevertheless, pairwise correlations between subsequent bouts in these mutants were abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This could indicate that the absence of a group of functional neuropeptides impaired the dynamic extension of quiescence bouts in response to variations in durations and compositions of motion bouts. Alternatively, the quiescence bouts of <italic>unc-31</italic> mutants may be too short to sustain detectable correlations. We favor the first explanation for two reasons. First, the Hawaiian strain (a wild isolate of <italic>C. elegans</italic>) exhibited quiescence bouts that were comparable in duration to those of <italic>unc-31</italic> mutants but nevertheless maintained wild-type correlations during minutes 45–120 from the onset of L4leth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1 fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 1,2</xref>). Second, when bout pairs containing longer quiescence bouts were excluded from the wild-type dataset, such that the mean duration of the remaining quiescence bouts equaled that of <italic>unc-31</italic> mutants, the pairwise correlation between the remaining bouts was reduced to R = 0.2 ± 0.03, but not abolished.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04380.012</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>UNC-31/CAPS is not required for establishing a high fraction of quiescence during lethargus but is required for micro-homeostasis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: the fraction of quiescence of wild-type animals and <italic>unc-31</italic>, <italic>egl-3</italic>, and <italic>egl-21</italic> mutants during L4leth (shaded area).

Expression in head neurons was constant prior to the onset of and during L4leth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Surprisingly, the reporter expression in VC neurons differed between two sub-populations of animals. When low levels of fluorescence were initially detected during L4int, reporter fluorescence was enhanced more than twofold during the first half of L4leth. In contrast, initially high fluorescence levels were not further enhanced. Expression levels of the reporter in the VC neurons of the two sub-populations were similar during the second half of L4leth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The absence of a peak in fluorescence during lethargus in the initially strongly fluorescent sub-population may have resulted from non-physiological effects of overexpression. Alternatively, it may be the case that the shift in <italic>flp-18</italic> expression or secretion can precede the onset of lethargus or be conditioned on ambient levels during late L4int.</p><p>Since <italic>Pflp-18::flp-18::SL2::gfp</italic> expression peaked during the first half of lethargus, we examined the timing of the defect in bout correlations in <italic>flp-18</italic> mutants with respect to the onset of lethargus.

Broad expression of a rescue gene, or even a fluorescent reporter, often results in subtle changes in locomotion and quiescence that our assays are able to detect. Nevertheless, the data raised the possibility of a ceiling effect for quiescence in these experiments. Two observations suggest that, plausibly, this is not the case: (i) similar differences in undisturbed baseline quiescence were observed between the two <italic>npr-1</italic> mutant alleles, yet both strains exhibited compensation for strong stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>); and (ii) undisturbed baseline quiescence in all <italic>daf-16</italic> strains was similar to <italic>npr-1(ky13)</italic> mutants and lower than wild-type. Therefore, we favor the interpretation that the function of DAF-16 was required in neurons in our assays. Importantly, the opposing phenotypes of <italic>npr-1</italic> and <italic>daf-16</italic> mutants show that micro-homeostasis, routinely used to stabilize bout architecture in weakly noisy environments, is genetically distinct from the homeostatic responses that strong and stressful disturbances invoke.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using tunable photo- and mechano-stimulation, we have identified two distinct categories of disruptions to <italic>C. elegans</italic> sleep and characterized the corresponding responses. We have shown that during lethargus, motion plays a causal role in modulating the duration of subsequent quiescence. Under low noise conditions, micro-homeostasis manifested as a dependence of the duration of quiescence bouts on the duration and nature of recently preceding motion. The dynamic extension of quiescence bouts depended on the function of an NPY receptor-like protein (NPR-1). However, this did not require DAF-16/FOXO, perhaps because transcriptional level control is typically too slow to respond dynamically on timescales of 10s of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yosef and Regev, 2011</xref>). Since biological mechanisms naturally function in a continuous range of conditions, it was both expected and observed that similar mechanisms regulated the compensatory responses in the presence of weak or no stimuli. However, homeostasis in the presence of strong stimuli was behaviorally and mechanistically distinct. A strong disturbance resulted in the temporary disruption of normal bout dynamics followed by a compensatory upshift of baseline levels of quiescence. These responses did require the function of DAF-16/FOXO but not of NPR-1.</p><p>Neuropeptides have been proposed to regulate quiescence during lethargus, but their roles were not examined in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Van Buskirk and Sternberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Van Buskirk and Sternberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Turek et al., 2013</xref>). The apparent discrepancy between the quiescence phenotypes of <italic>egl-3</italic>/<italic>egl-21</italic> and <italic>unc-31</italic> mutants resembles their seemingly contradicting roles in homeostatically ameliorating convulsions caused by cholinergic overexcitation and can be similarly rationalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stawicki et al., 2013</xref>). The mature neuropeptides processed by EGL-3 and EGL-21 are but a subset of the components of dense core vesicles, such that excitatory and inhibitory neuropeptides could act in a combinatorial manner to affect quiescence.</p><p>Resuming sleep after a strong or a mild disruption are both common experiences. Subjectively, the two are easily distinguishable, and in both cases the resulting changes to the architecture of sleep reflect homeostatic regulation. Broadly, homeostatic control ensuring adequate sleep amount and quality is a key criterion for sleep-like states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tobler, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell and Tobler, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sehgal and Mignot, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nelson and Raizen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tononi and Cirelli, 2014</xref>). Homeostasis in mammalian sleep can be readily observed under disturbed or undisturbed conditions. For instance, the spectral power density associated with slow wave sleep (in the 0.75–4.0 Hz range) decays exponentially during an undisturbed sleep period, while extending the duration of wakefulness enhances it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Franken et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kecklund and Åkerstedt, 1992</xref>). Nevertheless, the sleep literature generally regards sleep homeostasis as a single mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borbély, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daan et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saper et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andretic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mackiewicz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cirelli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crocker and Sehgal, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nelson and Raizen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Porkka-Heiskanen, 2013</xref>). To our knowledge, responses to weak disturbances to sleep were not previously carefully analyzed, and the distinction between routine stabilization and compensation for stressful agitation was not examined in detail.</p><p>Despite recent findings in genetically tractable invertebrate models, the understanding of mechanisms that regulate sleep homeostasis remains incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andretic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cirelli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sehgal and Mignot, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Driver et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shi et al., 2014</xref>). NPY was implicated in the regulation of sleep in humans, rats, fruit flies, and nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antonijevic et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tóth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dyzma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Van den Pol, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nagy et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the NPY receptor homolog NPR-1 affects a range of responses to external stimuli, as well as innate behaviors such as social feeding and quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Bono and Bargmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De Bono et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davies et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Macosko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McGrath et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nagy et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, NPR-1 was found to play a major role in both lethargus micro-homeostasis (this study) and the homeostatic response to a motoneuron imbalance. In the latter case, NPR-1 was required to compensate for cholinergic overexcitation and GABAergic inhibition that were caused by a gain-of-function in a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stawicki et al., 2013</xref>). We hypothesize that these two types of homeostatic responses are closely linked, and further studies will be required to conclusively determine if this is the case.</p><p>Recent years have seen a rise in the appreciation of the importance and abundance of peptidergic modulation of neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li and Kim, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bargmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marder, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Taghert and Nitabach, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Holden-Dye and Walker, 2013</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, peptidergic regulation was shown to affect quiescence during lethargus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Turek et al., 2013</xref>). The apparent discrepancy between the phenotypes of <italic>egl-3</italic>/<italic>egl-21</italic> and <italic>unc-31</italic> mutants suggests that quiescence may be regulated by the combinatorial action of excitatory and inhibitory neuropeptides and that this combinatorial regulation promotes responsive bout dynamics. Our findings are consistent with a model in which activity during lethargus generates a ‘pressure’ which is ameliorated during periods of quiescence. A particular balance of inhibitory and excitatory neuropeptides may be required for keeping a record of and/or for the process of alleviating this pressure.</p><p>Finally, responses to external stimuli during lethargus were different from responses during the L4int and YA stages. In contrast, responses were similar whether the onset of the stimulus coincided with quiescence or motion during lethargus. This suggests that bouts of motion are not analogous to brief intervals of wakefulness. Rather, <italic>C. elegans</italic> sleep may progress through two alternating micro-states.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were maintained and grown according to standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

Animals were imaged at 2 frames per second at a 1.2× magnification for frame subtraction experiments or 10 frames per second at a 4.2× magnification for posture-based analysis using a CCD camera (Prosilica GC2450, Allied Vision Technologies, Stadtroda, Germany).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L Calabrese, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors present a behavioral analysis of homeostasis during the sleep-like state of lethargus in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. They find two distinct levels of homeostasis separable phenomenologically by the response to disturbing stimuli. Micro-homeostasis occurs in undisturbed or weakly disturbed (stimulated) animals and homeostasis occurs in strongly disturbed (stimulated) animals. The behavioral data set is extensive and thorough and for the main part the data are appropriately interpreted. They then begin to differentiate between these two forms of homeostasis genetically. While some of these genetic data are essential to differentiate the responses there needs to be a rescue experiment to increase certainty of the specificity of the <italic>flp-18</italic> mutant response and some of the other genetic data should be deleted as too preliminary (expression experiment for <italic>flp-18</italic> and <italic>unc-31</italic>, <italic>dgk-1</italic>, and <italic>goa-1</italic> mutant analyses). The authors should be aware that <italic>eLife</italic> has Advances, so that an additional part of the story that takes it to the next step (e.g., a more in depth mutant analysis) could be linked to this paper, if it is accepted by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>In revision the authors should focus on the following:</p><p>1) The three reviewers agree that the observation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> of two homeostatic mechanisms in sleep disturbance is a significant advance as homeostasis is generally regarded as one mechanism in the mammalian sleep literature. This should be shored up by attention more generally to the sleep literature in the Discussion.</p><p>2) The paper is not written for a general audience of educated biologists. It is filled with undefined acronyms and abbreviations and with the jargon of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Make sure to define all terms, e.g. YA, L4int etc. The Results section is especially overly terse; please explain the sophisticated behavioral analyses more thoroughly, adding additional explanatory figures if necessary.</p><p>3) The reviewers agree that the authors are far from establishing mechanisms for either type of homeostatic response. What is important about the genetic experiments is their use to show that the two responses are controlled differently: this is a novel notion with relevance to other animals. The analysis aimed at mechanisms (e.g. <italic>flp-18</italic> reporter expression, g-protein pathway analysis) is generally weak and a distraction from the above punch line. Some aspects of <italic>flp-18</italic> genetic should remain, i.e. mutant analysis, but this needs to be shored up with rescue experiments. The <italic>flp-18</italic> strain used, VC2016 is a heavily mutagenized strain carrying multiple mutations. There is a strain (AX1444) carrying a wild-type <italic>flp-18</italic> transgene, which you could use for a rescue experiment. The <italic>flp-18</italic> expression analysis is weak and should be removed. The <italic>unc-31</italic>, <italic>dgk-1</italic>, and <italic>goa-1</italic> analyses are incomplete and should be deleted.</p><p>4) We are also concerned that the conclusions go too far based on the current genetic analyses. The data make it safe to conclude that genetic perturbations support the novel hypothesis that there are two homeostatic processes regulating responses to sleep disturbance. It is not warranted yet to argue that <italic>npr-1</italic> regulates one of these processes.</p><p>5) One thing that was very confusing and needs clarification is the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-E</xref>. Why was baseline quiescence measured before the stimulus? Is the stimulus repeated and there is a cumulative effect? How is this a meaningful measure? Shouldn't the post-stimulus baseline be compared to the pre-stimulus baseline? Other figures use the same measure. This must be explained and justified.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “Homeostasis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> sleep is characterized by two behaviorally and genetically distinct mechanisms” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

One concern was over the presentation and its accessibility to a general reader of <italic>eLife</italic>. This concern has been substantially addressed so that the manuscript is now more readable for biologists outside the <italic>C. elegans</italic> community. Another concern about the context of the results in the field of sleep research has been addressed by additions to Discussion. Concerns about <italic>flp-18</italic> genetics and expression have also been addressed.</p><p>Concerns about the behavioral analyses were addressed by more clearly and explicitly stating what was done but there are still some important clarifications to be made. There is clear consensus on this issue. To quote one of the expert reviewers: “The schematic at the top of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is helpful in understanding the authors' stimulation and analysis protocol. However, nowhere in the figures or supplementary figures could I find a clear example showing the elevated baseline quiescence in the 5 minutes prior to the next stimulus. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig8">Figure 4B and 8B</xref> shows the 5 minutes prior to the strong mechanical stimulation, and then the 10 minutes after the stimulus. The 5 minutes of baseline quiescence before the stimulus looks to my eye the same as the 10 minutes of quiescence after the stimulus. Isn't the relevant period 10-15 minutes <italic>after</italic> the stimulus? This is the new baseline prior to the next stimulus. Also, if the strong stimulus is repeated every 15 minutes, and there is a consequent elevation of 'baseline quiescence' in the 5 minutes prior to the next stimulation, is the subsequent 'baseline quiescence' further elevated? That is, is the effect of stimulations cumulative? Showing the data in 4B and 8B with the longer time scale shown in 3A may be helpful.”</p><p>There are serious concerns by all reviewers on some sentences in which claims are made about the role of NPR-1 in homeostasis. “Thus, in addition to the phenotypic differences described above, homeostatic compensation during undisturbed or weakly disturbed lethargus was regulated by NPR-1, while homeostatic compensation for strong stimuli was not. Thus, the routine stabilization of lethargus behavior in low-noise environments and the homeostatic compensation for stressful disturbances are mechanistically separable. These findings are consistent with a model in which NPR-1 dynamically modulates quiescence during lethargus in response to spontaneous or induced mild variations in locomotion.” Specifically the phrase '...regulated by NPR-1...' must be altered to something more in line with the data like '...affected by...' or '...required...' and the word 'dynamically' removed ('...dynamically modulates...').</p><p>The section on Combinatorial Peptide Action in the Results section overstates the case and needs to be cut back. You have observed inconsistent effects of different general peptide secretion mutants and conclude that it is combinatorial. The authors should simply report their observations in Results without the current heading and potentially include one sentence in the Discussion saying that the different phenotypes of <italic>egl</italic> and <italic>unc</italic> mutations can be rationalized by postulating multiple peptides with positive and negative effects.</p><p>Moreover in the opinion of the one reviewer the genetic analysis remains superficial and the paper would benefit from further restricting claims made on the basis of these experiments</p><p>These serious concerns must be addressed; this should require only minor re-writing and can be handled in the future by the BRE.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04380.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The three reviewers agree that the observation in C. elegans of two homeostatic mechanisms in sleep disturbance is a significant advance as homeostasis is generally regarded as one mechanism in the mammalian sleep literature.

The text was revised accordingly.</p><p><italic>3) The reviewers agree that the authors are far from establishing mechanisms for either type of homeostatic response. What is important about the genetic experiments is their use to show that the two responses are controlled differently: this is a novel notion with relevance to other animals. The analysis aimed at mechanisms (e.g.</italic> flp-18 <italic>reporter expression, g-protein pathway analysis) is generally weak and a distraction from the above punch line. Some aspects of</italic> flp-18 <italic>genetic should remain, i.e. mutant analysis, but this needs to be shored up with rescue experiments.</italic></p><p>The <italic>Pflp‐18</italic> promoter drives expression in approximately 20 head neurons and in cholinergic motor neurons. Expression of <italic>flp‐18</italic> was reported to be generally lower in the motor neurons. The AX1444 reporter strain exhibits defects in locomotion and quiescence, plausibly due to overexpression of <italic>flp‐18</italic> in an unidentified subset of these neurons. Such defects would confound the interpretation of the simple rescue experiment suggested by the reviewers.</p><p>However, we obtained mutants carrying a second allele, <italic>flp‐18(db99)</italic>, and assayed them using the frame subtraction method. This 2kb deletion of a region spanning the promoter and the first two exons (including the initiation codon) is likely to be a strong loss‐of‐function or null allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen at al., 2009</xref>, Cell Met]. In this assay, compensation deficiency of <italic>flp‐18(db99)</italic> mutants was stronger than that of <italic>flp‐18(gk3063)</italic> mutants and comparable to that of <italic>npr‐1</italic> mutants. These results validated the role of <italic>flp‐18</italic> peptides in the homeostatic response for weak stimuli, although they came short of conclusively excluding roles for additional peptides.</p><p><italic>The</italic> flp-18 <italic>strain used, VC2016 is a heavily mutagenized strain carrying multiple mutations. There is a strain (AX1444) carrying a wild-type</italic> flp-18 <italic>transgene, which you could use for a rescue experiment. The</italic> flp-18 <italic>expression analysis is weak and should be removed.</italic></p><p>The analysis of <italic>flp‐18</italic> expression, which was based on a fluorescent reporter, can and will be removed from the manuscript at the discretion of the reviewers. However, we feel that taken together with the mutant analysis these results strengthen the case for a lethargus‐specific role for <italic>flp‐18</italic> peptides in homeostatic responses. Therefore, the current version includes these results as supplementary figures accompanied by two paragraphs in the text. Before the final decision to remove these results is reached, we would like to offer the following considerations:</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, GFP has a fast maturation rate of about ½ hr (see, e.g., Boulin, Etchberger, and Hobert, Wormbook, 2006), such that the kinetics of maturation are not expected to strongly affect our results. In addition, the complete absence of change in fluorescence in head neurons provides an excellent internal control for this measurement. Importantly, since the change in expression is expected to occur only in the motor neurons a subset of <italic>flp‐18</italic> expressing neurons; changes in expression are not expected to be detectable above noise using qPCR analysis of whole animals. In agreement with these considerations, a recently published profiling of the temporal expression pattern of <italic>flp‐18</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> used the very same reporter strain and did not perform qPCR [Stawicki et al., PLoS Gen, 2013]. Our data supports the idea that these phenomena may be linked.</p><p><italic>The</italic> unc-31<italic>,</italic> dgk-1<italic>, and</italic> goa-1 <italic>analyses are incomplete and should be deleted.</italic></p><p>The analysis of <italic>unc‐43</italic>, <italic>dgk‐1,</italic> and <italic>goa‐1</italic> was removed as suggested by the reviewers.</p><p>However, NPR‐1 is an extremely well-studied neuropeptide receptor. Therefore, the <italic>unc-31</italic> results implicating neuropeptides in the flexibility/responsiveness of bout dynamics are highly relevant to the manuscript. Since two independent alleles of <italic>unc‐31</italic> were assayed, the confidence that the observed phenotype was caused by the <italic>unc‐31</italic> mutation is (at least) comparable to a rescue experiment with an innate promoter – see response above. In the revised version, the discussion of the <italic>unc‐31</italic> data was moved to the Results section and its relevance to the NPR‐1 results was explicitly noted.</p><p>These results suggest an apparent discrepancy when compared to the <italic>egl‐3</italic>/<italic>egl‐21</italic> phenotypes, both in our hands and as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Turek et al., 2013</xref>). We felt that this issue could and should be addressed. Therefore, it is discussed in the Results section. We note that in this case the identical phenotypes of <italic>egl‐3</italic> and <italic>egl‐21</italic> served the same purpose as assaying two independent alleles.</p><p><italic>4) We are also concerned that the conclusions go too far based on the current genetic analyses. The data make it safe to conclude that genetic perturbations support the novel hypothesis that there are two homeostatic processes regulating responses to sleep disturbance. It is not warranted yet to argue that npr-1 regulates one of these processes</italic>.</p><p>Assaying two independent mutant alleles of the same gene is considered to be at least as reliable as a general rescue experiment under a native promoter, since rescues can be partial and subject to various caveats. It is standard in the field to use the two approaches interchangeably (as reflected by one of the specific comments: &quot;testing a second allele…would be required to prove that the phenotype is explained by the mutation in the gene of interest.”).</p><p>As noted by reviewer #3, we originally presented an analysis of a single <italic>daf‐16</italic> allele and erroneously referred to related published data obtained from a second allele (Driver el al., 2013). David Raizen has kindly provided us with transgenic strains that were used in his study and we assayed the second <italic>daf‐16</italic> allele, a native promoter rescue strain, a pan‐neuronal rescue strain, and a body‐wall muscle rescue strain. In brief, our data suggest that the function of DAF‐16 in neurons, but not in muscles, is required for homeostatic compensation for strong disturbances. These results are described in the Results section and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) One thing that was very confusing and needs clarification is the data of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C-E</italic></xref><italic>.

Therefore, in the data presented the distinction between “5 minutes before” and “10 minutes after” a stimulus is not a meaningful one. In the averaged data, both “5 minutes before…” or “10 minutes after…” would refer to the very same time point, namely the time point at 2/3 of the interval between two consecutive stimuli. In other words, the averaged data has periodic boundaries. Graphically, this can be represented by plotting this data on a circular time axis where “before” and “after” are indistinguishable (as long as the fraction of quiescence is in its steady state).</p><p>During lethargus, the short-term response to each stimulus lasted 3 minutes. After this short-term response was complete, the fraction of quiescence returned to a steady state characteristic of the conditions of the experiment. The fraction of time spent in quiescence during this steady state was defined as the baseline level of quiescence for the relevant experimental conditions. In this framework, baselines were compared between different conditions. Elevation of the steady state quiescence, as compared to the mean quiescence of undisturbed animals, constituted the sustained response to the presence of repeated strong stimuli.</p><p>A supplementary figure was added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and the text was revised to clarify these points.</p><p><italic>There are serious concerns by all reviewers on some sentences in which claims are made about the role of NPR-1 in homeostasis. “Thus, in addition to the phenotypic differences described above, homeostatic compensation during undisturbed or weakly disturbed lethargus was regulated by NPR-1, while homeostatic compensation for strong stimuli was not.
