neural tracking increases when speech is masked by background noise, despite reduced speech intelligibility. Noise-related amplification could indicate that stochastic resonance – the response facilitation through noise – supports neural speech tracking, but a comprehensive account is lacking. In five human electroencephalography experiments, the current study demonstrates a generalized enhancement of neural speech tracking due to minimal background noise. Results show that (1) neural speech tracking is enhanced for speech masked by background noise at very high signal-to-noise ratios (~30 dB SNR) where speech is highly intelligible; (2) this enhancement is independent of attention; (3) it generalizes across different stationary background maskers, but is strongest for 12-talker babble; and (4) it is present for headphone and free-field listening, suggesting that the neural-tracking enhancement generalizes to real-life listening. The work paints a clear picture that minimal background noise enhances the neural representation of the speech onset-envelope, suggesting that stochastic resonance contributes to neural speech tracking. The work further highlights non-linearities of neural tracking induced by background noise that make its use as a biological marker for speech processing challenging.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>electroencephalography</kwd><kwd>speech encoding</kwd><kwd>stochastic resonance</kwd><kwd>background noise</kwd><kwd>temporal response function</kwd><kwd>story listening</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC-2019-00156</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herrmann</surname><given-names>Björn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2021-02602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herrmann</surname><given-names>Björn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human electroencephalography reveals that neural speech tracking is enhanced by minimal background noise and that this enhancement is independent of attention and generalizes across noise types and sound-delivery systems.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Speech in everyday life is often masked by background sound, such as music or speech by other people, making speech comprehension challenging, especially for older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pichora-Fuller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Herrmann and Johnsrude, 2020</xref>). Speech comprehension challenges are a serious barrier to social participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nachtegaal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Heffernan et al., 2016</xref>) and can have long-term negative health consequences, such as cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lin and Albert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Panza et al., 2019</xref>). Understanding how individuals encode speech in the presence of background sound is thus an important area of research and clinical application. One successful approach to characterize speech encoding in the brain is to quantify how well neural activity recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) tracks relevant speech features of continuous speech, such as the amplitude envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crosse et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crosse et al., 2021</xref>). Greater speech tracking has been associated with higher speech intelligibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ding et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Vanthornhout et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lesenfants et al., 2019</xref>), leading to the suggestion that speech tracking could be a useful clinical biomarker, for example, in individuals with hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gillis et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Palana et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schmitt et al., 2022</xref>). Counterintuitively, however, neural speech tracking has been shown to increase in the presence of background masking sound even at masking levels for which speech intelligibility is decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yasmin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Panela et al., 2024</xref>). The causes of this increase in speech tracking under background masking are unclear.</p><p>In many everyday situations, a listener must block out ambient, stationary background noise, such as multi-talker babble in a busy restaurant. For low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) between speech and background noise, neural speech tracking decreases relative to high SNRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ding and Simon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Vanthornhout et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yasmin et al., 2023</xref>), possibly reflecting the decreased speech understanding under speech masking. In contrast, for speech in moderate background noise, when a listener can understand most words, neural speech tracking can be increased relative to clear speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yasmin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Panela et al., 2024</xref>). This has been interpreted to reflect the increased attention required to understand speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hauswald et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yasmin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Panela et al., 2024</xref>). However, the low-to-moderate SNRs (e.g., &lt;10 dB) typically used to study neural speech tracking require listeners to invest cognitively and thus do not allow distinguishing a cognitive mechanism from the possibility that the noise per se leads to an increase in neural tracking, for example, through stochastic resonance, where background noise amplifies the response of a system to an input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kitajo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McDonnell and Ward, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Krauss et al., 2016</xref>). Examining neural speech tracking under high SNRs (e.g., &gt;20 dB SNR), for which individuals can understand speech with ease, is needed to understand the noise-related tracking enhancement.</p><p>A few previous studies suggest that noise per se may be a relevant factor. For example, the neural-tracking increase has been observed for speech masked by multi-talker background babble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yasmin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Panela et al., 2024</xref>), but appears to be less present for noise that spectrally matches the speech signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ding and Simon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Synigal et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting that the type of noise is important. Other research indicates that neural responses to tone bursts can increase in the presence of minimal noise (i.e., high SNRs) relative to clear conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alain et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alain et al., 2014</xref>), pointing to the critical role of noise in amplifying neural responses independent of speech.</p><p>Understanding the relationship between neural speech tracking and background noise is critical because neural tracking is frequently used to investigate consequences of hearing loss for speech processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Presacco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Decruy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Van Hirtum et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, older adults often exhibit enhanced neural speech tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Presacco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brodbeck et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Broderick et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Panela et al., 2024</xref>) which is thought to be due to a loss of inhibition and increased internal noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zeng, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auerbach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Krauss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zeng, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Herrmann and Butler, 2021</xref>). The age-related neural-tracking enhancement may be harder to understand if external, sound-based noise also drives increases in neural speech tracking.</p><p>The current study comprises five EEG experiments in younger adults that aim to investigate how neural speech tracking is affected by different degrees of background masking (Experiment 1), whether neural-tracking enhancements are due to attention investment (Experiment 2), the generalizability of changes in neural speech tracking for different masker types (Experiments 3 and 4), and whether effects generalize from headphone to free-field listening (Experiment 5). The results point to a highly generalizable enhancement in neural speech tracking at minimal background masking levels that is independent of attention, suggesting that stochastic resonance plays a critical role.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1: Enhanced neural speech tracking due to minimal background babble</title><p>Experiment 1 aimed to investigate the neural tracking of speech in the presence of different degrees of background masking.

Critically, Experiment 1 expands the previous work by showing that background babble also leads to enhanced neural speech tracking for very minimal background masking levels (~30 dB SNR). A noise-related enhancement at moderate babble levels (9 dB SNR) has previously been interpreted to result from increased attention or effort to understand speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yasmin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Panela et al., 2024</xref>). However, speech for very high SNRs (&gt;15 dB) used in Experiment 1 is highly intelligible and thus should require little or no effort to understand. It is therefore unlikely that increased attention or effort drive the increase in neural speech tracking in background babble. Nonetheless, participants attended to the speech in Experiment 1, and it can thus not be fully excluded that attention investment played a role in the noise-related enhancement.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Experiment 2: Noise-related enhancement in speech tracking is unrelated to attention</title><p>To investigate the role of attention in the noise-related enhancement of neural speech tracking, participants in Experiment 2 (<italic>N</italic> = 22; median age: 23 years) were presented with stories under the same speech-clarity conditions as for Experiment 1 while performing a visual 1-back digit memory task and ignoring the stories.

Because participants did not pay attention to the speech in Experiment 2, the results indicate that attention is unlikely to drive the masker-related enhancement in neural tracking observed here and previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yasmin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Panela et al., 2024</xref>). The enhancement may thus be exogenously rather than endogenously driven.

This leads to a reduction in the speech-signal amplitude as SNR decreases, which, in fact, works against the observation that neural speech tracking is enhanced for speech in babble. In the other studies, the level of the speech signal was kept the same for all materials and background noise was added at specific SNRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ding and Simon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Synigal et al., 2023</xref>).

The results show that 12-talker babble enhances neural tracking at very high SNRs (~30 dB) relative to clear speech (Experiment 1) and that this enhancement is present even when participants carry out an unrelated visual task (Experiment 2), suggesting that attention or effort do not cause the noise-related neural-tracking enhancement. The results further show that the enhancement of neural speech tracking is greater for speech in the presence of 12-talker babble compared to a stationary noise that spectrally matches the speech (Experiments 3 and 4), although both masker types spectrally overlap with the speech. The enhancement was also greater for 12-talker babble compared to pink noise and white noise (Experiment 4). Finally, the enhanced neural speech tracking generalizes from headphone to free-field listening (Experiment 5), pointing to the real-world nature of the tracking enhancement. Overall, the current study paints a clear picture of a highly generalized enhancement of neural speech tracking in the presence of minimal background noise, making links to speech intelligibility and listening difficulties in noise challenging.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Enhanced neural tracking of speech under minimal background noise</title><p>Across all five experiments of the current study, speech masked by background noise at high SNRs (up to 30 dB SNR) led to enhanced neural tracking of the amplitude-onset envelope of speech (this was also present for the amplitude envelope, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The enhancement was present for different background maskers, but most prominently for 12-talker babble.

However, in these works, SNRs have been lower (&lt;10 dB) to investigate neural tracking under challenging listening conditions. At low SNRs, neural speech tracking decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ding and Simon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yasmin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), thus resulting in an inverted u-shape in relation to SNR for attentive and passive listening (Experiments 1 and 2). Moreover, the speech-tracking enhancement was smaller for speech-matched noise compared to babble noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), potentially explaining the absence of the enhancement for speech-matched noise at low SNRs in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ding and Simon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Synigal et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The noise-related enhancement in the neural tracking of the speech envelope was greatest for 12-talker babble, but it was also present for speech-matched noise, pink noise, and, to some extent, white noise. The latter three noises bare no perceptional relation to speech, but resemble stationary, background buzzing from industrial noise, heavy rain, waterfalls, wind, or ventilation. Twelve-talker babble – which is also a stationary masker – is clearly recognizable as overlapping speech, but words or phonemes cannot be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bilger, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bilger et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wilson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wilson et al., 2012a</xref>). There may thus be something about the naturalistic, speech nature of the background babble that facilitates neural speech tracking.</p><p>The spectral power for both the 12-talker babble and the speech-matched noise overlaps strongly with the spectral properties of the speech signal, although the speech-matched noise most closely resembles the spectrum of speech. Spectral overlap of the background sound and the speech signal could cause energetic masking in the auditory periphery and degrade accurate neural speech representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brungart et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mattys et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wilson et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kidd et al., 2019</xref>). Although peripheral masking would not explain why neural speech tracking is enhanced in the first place, more peripheral masking for the speech-matched noise compared to the 12-talker babble would be consistent with a reduced enhancement for the former compared to the latter masker. However, pink noise and white noise spectrally overlap much less with speech than the other two background maskers, but the neural-tracking enhancement did not differ between the speech-matched noise, pink noise, and white noise maskers. This again suggests that there may be something about the speech nature of the babble masker that drives the larger neural-tracking enhancement.</p><p>Critically, the current results have implications for research and clinical applications. The neural tracking of the speech envelope has been linked to speech intelligibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ding et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Vanthornhout et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lesenfants et al., 2019</xref>) and has been proposed to be a useful clinical biomarker for speech encoding in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dial et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gillis et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schmitt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kries et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Panela et al., 2024</xref>). However, speech intelligibility, assessed here via gist ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davis and Johnsrude, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ritz et al., 2022</xref>), only declines for SNRs below 15 dB SNR (consistent with intelligibility scores; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Irsik et al., 2022</xref>), whereas the neural-tracking enhancement is already present for ~30 dB SNR. This result questions the link between neural envelope tracking and speech intelligibility, or at least makes the relationship non-linear (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yasmin et al., 2023</xref>). Research on the neural tracking of speech using background noise must thus consider that the noise itself may enhance the tracking.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Potential mechanisms associated with enhanced neural speech tracking</title><p>Enhanced neural tracking associated with a stationary background masker or noise-vocoded speech has been interpreted to reflect an attentional gain when listeners must invest cognitively to understand speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hauswald et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yasmin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Panela et al., 2024</xref>). However, these works used moderate to low SNRs or moderate speech degradations, making it challenging to distinguish between attentional mechanisms and mechanisms driven by background noise per se. The current study demonstrates that attention unlikely causes the enhanced neural tracking of the speech onset-envelope. First, the tracking enhancement was observed for very high SNRs (~30 dB) at which speech is highly intelligible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Holder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rowland et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Spyridakou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Irsik et al., 2022</xref>). Arguably, little or no effort is needed to understand speech at ~30 dB SNR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rowland et al., 2018</xref>), making attentional gain an unlikely explanation. Importantly, neural speech tracking was enhanced even when participants performed a visual task and were passively presented with the speech materials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Participants are unlikely to invest effort to understand speech when performing an attention-demanding visual task. Taken together, the current study provides little evidence that noise-related enhancements of neural speech tracking are due to attention or effort investment.</p><p>Another possibility put forward in the context of enhanced neural responses to tone bursts in noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alain et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alain et al., 2014</xref>) is that background noise increases arousal, which, in turn, amplifies the neural response to sound. However, a few pieces of evidence are inconsistent with this hypothesis. Arousal to minimal background noise habituates quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvar and Francis, 2024</xref>) and arousal does not appear to affect early sensory responses but rather later, non-sensory responses in EEG (&gt;150 ms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Han et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, pupil dilation – a measure of arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mathôt, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Joshi and Gold, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burlingham et al., 2022</xref>) – is similar for speech in noise at SNRs ranging from +16 to +4 dB SNR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ohlenforst et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ohlenforst et al., 2018</xref>), for which neural tracking increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Hence, arousal is unlikely to explain the noise-related enhancement in neural speech tracking, but more direct research is needed to clarify this further.</p><p>A third potential explanation of enhanced neural tracking is stochastic resonance, reflecting an automatic mechanism in neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Stein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McDonnell and Abbott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McDonnell and Ward, 2011</xref>). Stochastic resonance has been described as the facilitation of a near-threshold input through noise. That is, a near-threshold stimulus or neuronal input, that alone may be insufficient to drive a neuron beyond its firing threshold, can lead to neuronal firing if noise is added, because the noise increases the stimulus or neuronal input for brief periods, causing a response in downstream neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Ward et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Moss et al., 2004</xref>). However, the term is now used more broadly to describe any phenomenon where the presence of noise in a non-linear system improves the quality of the output signal than when noise is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McDonnell and Abbott, 2009</xref>). Stochastic resonance has been observed in humans in several domains, such as in tactile, visual, and auditory perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kitajo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wells et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tabarelli et al., 2009</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rufener et al., 2020</xref>). In the current study, speech was presented at suprathreshold levels, but stochastic resonance may still play a role at the neuronal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Stocks, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McDonnell and Abbott, 2009</xref>). EEG signals reflect the synchronized activity of more than 10,000 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Niedermeyer and Silva, 2005</xref>). Some neurons may not receive sufficiently strong input to elicit a response when a person listens to clear speech but may be pushed beyond their firing threshold by the additional, acoustically elicited noise in the neural system. Twelve-talker babble was associated with the greatest noise-related enhancement in neural tracking, possibly because the 12-talker babble facilitated neuronal activity in speech-relevant auditory regions, where the other, non-speech noises were less effective.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The current study provides a comprehensive account of a generalized increase in the neural tracking of the amplitude-onset envelope of speech due to minimal background noise. The results show that (1) neural speech tracking is enhanced for speech masked by background noise at very high SNRs (~30 dB), (2) this enhancement is independent of attention, (3) it generalizes across different stationary background maskers, although being strongest for 12-talker babble, and (4) it is present for headphone and free-field listening, suggesting the neural-tracking enhancement generalizes to real-life situations. The work paints a clear picture that minimal background noise enhances the neural representation of the speech envelope. The work further highlights the non-linearities of neural speech tracking as a function of background noise, challenging the feasibility of neural speech tracking as a biological marker for speech processing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MATLAB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MATLAB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">JASP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">JASP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_015823">SCR_015823</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PsychToolbox</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PsychToolbox</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_002881">SCR_002881</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">OpenAI</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ChatGPT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_023775">SCR_023775</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FieldTrip</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FieldTrip</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_004849">SCR_004849</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>The current study comprised five experiments. Participants were native English speakers or grew up in English-speaking countries (mostly Canada) and have been speaking English since early childhood (&lt;5 years of age). Participants reported having normal hearing abilities and no neurological disease (one person reported having attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, but this did not affect their participation). Participants gave written informed participation consent, consent to publish, and data-sharing consent prior to the experiment and were compensated for their participation. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the Canadian Tri-Council Policy Statement on Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans (TCPS2-2014), and was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the Rotman Research Institute at Baycrest Academy for Research and Education (REB # 21-27).</p><p>Twenty-two adults participated in Experiment 1 (median: 23.5 years; range: 18–35 years; 12 males, 9 females, 1 transgender). Twenty-two adults participated in Experiment 2 (median: 23 years; range: 18–31 years; 11 males, 10 females, 1 transgender; five additional datasets were excluded due to low performance in the visual task; see details below). Twenty-three people participated in Experiment 3 (median: 25 years; range: 19–33 years; 7 males, 15 females, 1 transgender; data from one additional person were excluded due to technical issues resulting in missing triggers). Twenty individuals participated in Experiment 4 (median: 25.5 years; range: 19–34 years; 4 males, 15 females, 1 transgender; one additional dataset was excluded due to missing triggers). Twenty-two adults participated in Experiment 5 (median: 26 years; range: 19–34 years; 10 males, 11 females, 1 transgender; one additional dataset was excluded due to spurious triggers and artifacts). Several participants took part in more than one of the experiments, in separate sessions on separate days: 7, 7, 9, 9, and 14 (for Experiments 1–5, respectively) participated only in one experiment; 3 individuals participated in all 5 experiments; 68 unique participants took part across the 5 experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sound environment and stimulus presentation</title><p>Data collection was carried out in a sound-attenuating booth.

Each story was on a different topic (e.g., a long-lost friend, a struggling artist). GPT stories, questions, and answer choices were manually edited wherever needed to ensure accuracy. Auditory story files were generated using Google’s modern AI-based speech synthesizer using the male ‘en-US-Neural2-J’ voice with default pitch, speed, and volume parameters (i.e., 0, 1, and 0, respectively; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices">https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices</ext-link>).

A new set of 24 stories and corresponding comprehension questions and multiple-choice options were generated for each of the 5 experiments (due to a mistake 8 stories from Experiments 1–4 were also used in Experiment 5).

Each comprehension question comprised four response options (chance level = 25%). Participants further rated the degree to which they understood the gist of what was said in the story, using a 9-point scale that ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 9 (strongly agree; the precise wording was: ‘I understood the gist of the story’ and ‘Please rate this statement independently of how you felt about the other stories)’. Gist ratings were linearly scaled to range between 0 and 1 to facilitate interpretability similar to the proportion of correct responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mathiesen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Panela et al., 2024</xref>).

Averaging across three stories was calculated to reduce noise in the data and match the averaging of three stories for the clear condition. For TRFs, analyses focused on the P1-N1 and the P2-N1 amplitude differences. For the statistical analyses, the clear condition was compared to each SNR (resulting from the sliding average) using a paired samples <italic>t</italic>-test. False discovery rate (FDR) was used to account for multiple comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Genovese et al., 2002</xref>). In cases where the data indicated a breaking point in behavior or brain response as a function of SNR, an explorative piece-wise regression (broken-stick analysis) with two linear pieces was calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McZgee and Carleton, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vieth, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Toms and Lesperance, 2003</xref>). Identification of the breaking point and two pieces was calculated on the across-participant average as the minimum root-mean-squared error. A linear function was then fit to each participant’s data as a function of SNR and the estimated slope was tested against zero using a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test, separately for each of the two pieces.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Experiment 2: Stimuli, procedures, and analyses</title><p>A new set of 24 stories was generated and participants were presented with 4 stories in each of 6 blocks. Speech-clarity levels were the same as in Experiment 1 (i.e., clear speech and SNRs ranging from +30 to –2 dB SNR). In Experiment 2, participants were instructed to ignore the stories and instead perform a visual 1-back task. In no part of the experiment were participants instructed to attend to the speech.</p><p>For the visual 1-back task, images of white digits (0–9) on black background were taken from the MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li Deng, 2012</xref>). The digit images were selected, because different images of the same digit differ visually and thus make it challenging to use a simple feature-matching strategy to solve the 1-back task. A new digit image was presented every 0.5 s throughout the time over which a story was played (1:30 to 2:30 min). A digit image was presented for 0.25 s followed by a 0.25-s black screen before the next image was presented. The continuous stream of digits contained a digit repetition (albeit a different image sample) every 6–12 digits. Participants were tasked with pressing a button on a keyboard as soon as they detected a repetition. We did not include comprehension questions or gist ratings in Experiment 2 to avoid that participants feel they should pay attention to the speech materials. Hit rate and response time were used as behavioral measures.</p><p>Analyses examining the effects of SNR in Experiment 2 were similar to the analyses in Experiment 1. Behavioral data (hit rate, response time in 1-back task) and EEG data (prediction accuracy, TRFs) for the three clear stories were averaged and a sliding average procedure across SNRs (three neighbors) was used for stories in babble. Statistical tests compared SNR conditions to the clear condition, including FDR-thresholding. An explorative piece-wise regression with two linear pieces was calculated in cases where the data indicated a breaking point in behavior or brain response as a function of SNR. Data from five participants were excluded from analysis because they performed below 60% in the visual <italic>n</italic>-back task. A low performance could mean that the participants did not fully attend to the visual task and instead attended to the spoken speech. To avoid this possibility, data from low performers were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Experiment 3: Stimuli, procedures, and analyses</title><p>A new set of 24 stories, comprehension questions, and multiple-choice options were generated. Participants listened to four stories in each of six blocks. Four of the 24 stories were presented under clear conditions. Ten stories were masked by 12-talker babble at five different SNRs (two stories each: +5, +10, +15, +20, and +25 dB SNR), whereas the other 10 stories were masked by a stationary noise that spectrally matched the speech signal at five different SNRs (two stories each: +5, +10, +15, +20, and +25 dB SNR). To obtain the spectrally matched noise, the long-term spectrum of the clear speech signal was calculated using a fast Fourier transform (FFT). The inverted FFT was calculated using the frequency-specific amplitudes estimated from the speech signal jointly with randomly selected phases for each frequency. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows a time course snippet, a power spectrum, and a short snippet of the spectrogram for clear speech, speech masked by babble, and speech masked by the spectrally matched noise. Twelve-talker babble and speech-matched noise spectrally overlap extensively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), but 12-talker babble recognizably contains speech (although individual elements cannot be identified), whereas the speech-matched noise does not contain recognizable speech elements.</p><p>For 5 of the 10 stories per masker type (babble, noise), the speech-plus-masker sound signal (mixed at a specific SNR) was normalized to the same RMS amplitude as the clear speech stories. This normalization results in a decreasing level of the speech signal in the speech-plus-masker mixture as SNR decreases. For the other five stories, the RMS amplitude of the speech signal was kept the same for all stories and a masker was added at the specific SNRs. This normalization results in an increasing sound level (RMS) of the sound mixture as SNR decreases. In other words, the speech signal in the sound mixture is played at a slightly lower intensity for the former than for the latter normalization type. We thus refer to this manipulation as speech with ‘lower’ and ‘higher’ intensities for the two normalization types, respectively. Note that these differences in speech level are very minor due to the high SNRs used here. Stories were presented in randomized order and the assignment of stories to conditions was randomized across participants.</p><p>Behavioral data (comprehension accuracy, gist ratings), EEG prediction accuracy, and TRFs for the four clear stories were averaged. For the stories in babble and speech-matched noise, a sliding average across SNRs was calculated for behavioral data, EEG prediction accuracy, and TRFs, such that data for four neighboring SNR levels were averaged, separately for the two masker types (babble, noise) and normalization types (adjusted speech level, non-adjusted speech level). Averaging across four stories was calculated to reduce noise in the data and match the number of stories included in the average for the clear condition. For TRFs, analyses focused on the P1-N1 and the P2-N1 amplitude differences. For the statistical analyses, the clear condition was compared to each SNR level (resulting from the sliding average) using a paired samples <italic>t</italic>-test. FDR was used to account for multiple comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Genovese et al., 2002</xref>). Differences between masker types and normalization types were examined using an rmANOVA with the within-participant factors SNR (10, 15, and 20 dB SNR), Masker Type (babble, speech-match noise), and Normalization Type (lower vs. higher speech levels). Post hoc tests were calculated for significant main effects and interactions. Holm’s methods was used to correct for multiple comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Holm, 1979</xref>). Statistical analyses were carried out in JASP software (v0.18.3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">JASP, 2023</xref>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_015823">SCR_015823</ext-link>). Note that JASP uses pooled error terms and degrees of freedom from an rmANOVA for the corresponding post hoc effects. The reported degrees of freedom are thus higher than for direct contrasts had they been calculated independently from the rmANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Experiment 4: Stimuli, procedures, and analyses</title><p>A new set of 24 stories, corresponding comprehension questions, and multiple-choice options were generated. Participants listened to four stories in each of six blocks. After each story, they answered five comprehension questions and rated gist understanding. Three stories were presented in each of eight conditions: clear speech (no masker), speech with added white noise, pink noise, stationary noise that spectrally matched the speech signal (Experiment 3), 12-talker babble (Experiments 1–3), and three additional 12-talker babbles. The additional babble maskers were created to ensure there is nothing specific about the babble masker used in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yasmin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Panela et al., 2024</xref>) and in Experiments 1–3 that could lead to an enhanced tracking response and to vary spectral properties of the babble associated with different voice genders (male, female). For the three additional babble maskers, 24 text excerpts of about 800 words each were taken from Wikipedia (e.g., about flowers, forests, insurance, etc.). The 24 text excerpts were fed into Google’s AI speech synthesizer to generate 24 continuous speech materials (~5 min) of which 12 were from male voices and 12 from female voices. The three 12-talker babble maskers were created by adding speech from 6 male and 6 female voices (mixed gender 12-talker babble), speech from the 12 male voices (male gender 12-talker babble), and speech from the 12 female voices (female gender 12-talker babble). Maskers were added to the speech signal at 20 dB SNR and all acoustic stimuli were normalized to the same RMS amplitude. A power spectrum for each of the seven masker types is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Stories were presented in randomized order and the assignment of stories to the eight different conditions was randomized across participants.</p><p>Behavioral data (comprehension accuracy, gist ratings), EEG prediction accuracy, and TRFs were averaged across the three stories for each condition.

Participants listened to four stories in each of six blocks. After each story, they answered five comprehension questions and rated gist understanding. For three of the six blocks, participants listened to the stories through headphones, as for Experiments 1–4, whereas for the other three blocks, participants listened to the stories via computer loudspeakers placed in front of them. Blocks for different sound-delivery conditions (headphones, loudspeakers) alternated within each participant’s session, and the starting condition was counter-balanced across participants. For each sound-delivery condition, participants listened to three stories each under clear conditions, +10, +15, and +20 dB SNR (12-talker babble, generated using Google’s AI voices as described for Experiment 4). Stories were distributed such that the four speech-clarity conditions were presented in each block in randomized order. All acoustic stimuli were normalized to the same RMS amplitude. The sound level of the headphones and the sound level of the loudspeakers (at the location of a participant’s head) were matched.</p><p>Behavioral data (comprehension accuracy, gist ratings), EEG prediction accuracy, and TRFs were averaged across the three stories for each speech-clarity and sound-delivery condition.

These findings generalize across di erent background noise types and listening conditions, o ering insights into speech processing in real-world environments. I find this paper well-written, the experiments and results are clearly described. However, I have a few comments that may be useful to address.</p></disp-quote><p>I thank the reviewer for their positive feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) The behavioral accuracy and EEG results for clear speech in Experiment 4 di er from those of Experiments 1-3. Could the author provide insights into the potential reasons for this discrepancy? Might it be due to linguistic/ acoustic di erences between the passages used in experiments? If so, what was the rationale behind using di erent passages across di erent experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>The slight di erences in behavior and EEG magnitudes may be due to several factors. Di erent participants took part in the di erent experiments (with some overlap). Stories and questions were generated using ChatGPT using the same approach, but di erent research assistants have supported story and question generation, and ChatGPT advanced throughout the course of the study, such that di erent versions were used over time (better version control was only recently introduced by OpenAI). The same Google voice was used for all experiments, so this cannot be a factor. Most critically, within each experiment, assignment of speech-clarity conditions to di erent stories was randomized, such that statistical comparisons are una ected by these minor di erences between experiments. The noise-related enhancement generalizes across all experiments, showing that minor di erences in experimental materials do not impact it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Regarding peak amplitude extraction, why were the exact peak amplitudes and latencies of the TRFs for each subject not extracted, and instead, an amplitude average within a 20 ms time window based on the group-averaged TRFs used? Did the latencies significantly di er across di erent SNR conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>Estimation of peak latency can be challenging if a deflection is not very pronounced in a participant. Especially the N1 was small for some conditions. Using the mean amplitude in a specific time window is very common practice in EEG research that mitigates this issue. Another, albeit less common, approach is to use a Jackknifing procedure to estimate each participant’s latencies (Smulders 2010 Psychophysiology; although this may sometimes not work well). For the revision, I used the Jackknifing approach to estimate peak latencies for each participant and condition, and extracted the mean amplitude around the peak latency. As expected, this approach provides very similar e ects as reported in the main article, here exemplified for Experiments 1 and 2. The results are thus not a ected by this data analysis choice. The estimated latencies di ered across SNRs, e.g., the N1 increased with decreasing SNR (this is less surprising/novel and was thus not added to the manuscript to avoid increasing the amount of information).</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>P1-minus-N1 amplitude for Experiment 1 and 2, using amplitudes centered on individually estimated peak latencies.</title><p>The asterisk indicates a significant di erence from the clear speech condition (FDR-thresholded).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100830-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) How is neural tracking quantified in the current study? Does improved neural tracking correlate with EEG prediction accuracy or individual peak amplitudes? Given the di ering trends between N1 and P2 peaks in babble and speech-matched noise in experiment 3, how is it that babble results in greater envelope tracking compared to speech-matched noise?</p></disp-quote><p>Neural tracking is generally used for responses resulting from TRF analyses, crosscorrelations, or coherence, where the speech envelope is regressed against the brain signals (see review of Brodbeck &amp; Simon 2020 Current Opinion in Physiology). Correlations between EEG prediction accuracy and individual peak amplitudes was not calculated because the data used for the analyses are not independent. The EEG prediction accuracy essentially integrates information over a longer time interval (here 0–0.4 s), whereas TRF amplitudes are more temporally resolved. If one were to shorten the time interval (e.g., 0.08–0.12 s), then EEG prediction accuracy would look more similar to the TRF results (because the TRF is convolved with the amplitude-onset envelope of the speech [predicted EEG] before calculating the EEG prediction accuracy). Regarding the enhancement di erence between speech-matched noise and babble, I have discussed a possible interpretation in the discussion section. The result is indeed surprising, but it replicates across two experiments (Experiments 3 and 4), and is consistent with previous work using speech-matched noise that did not find the enhancement. I reproduce the part of the discussion here.</p><p>“Other work, using a noise masker that spectrally matches the target speech, have not reported tracking enhancements (Ding and Simon, 2013; Zou et al., 2019; Synigal et al., 2023). However, in these works, SNRs have been lower (&lt;10 dB) to investigate neural tracking under challenging listening conditions. At low SNRs, neural speech tracking decreases (Ding and Simon, 2013; Zou et al., 2019; Yasmin et al., 2023; Figures 1 and 2), thus resulting in an inverted u-shape in relation to SNR for attentive and passive listening (Experiments 1 and 2).”</p><p>“The noise-related enhancement in the neural tracking of the speech envelope was greatest for 12talker babble, but it was also present for speech-matched noise, pink noise, and, to some extent, white noise. The latter three noises bare no perceptional relation to speech, but resemble stationary, background buzzing from industrial noise, heavy rain, waterfalls, wind, or ventilation. Twelve-talker babble – which is also a stationary masker – is clearly recognizable as overlapping speech, but words or phonemes cannot be identified (Bilger, 1984; Bilger et al., 1984; Wilson, 2003; Wilson et al., 2012b). There may thus be something about the naturalistic, speech nature of the background babble that facilitates neural speech tracking.”</p><p>“Twelve-talker babble was associated with the greatest noise-related enhancement in neural tracking, possibly because the 12-talker babble facilitated neuronal activity in speech-relevant auditory regions, where the other, non-speech noises were less e ective.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The paper discusses how speech envelope-onset tracking varies with di erent background noises. Does the author expect similar trends for speech envelope tracking as well? Additionally, could you explain why envelope onsets were prioritized over envelope tracking in this analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>The amplitude-onset envelope was selected because several previous works have used the amplitude-onset envelope, our previous work that first observed the enhancement also used the amplitude-onset envelope, and the amplitude-onset envelope has been suggested to work better for speech tracking. This was added to the manuscript. For the manuscript revision, analyses were calculated for the amplitude envelope, largely replicating the results for the amplitude-onset envelope. The results for the amplitude envelope are now presented in the Supplementary Materials and referred to in the main text.</p><p>“The amplitude-onset envelope was selected because (a) several previous works have used it (Hertrich et al., 2012; Fiedler et al., 2017; Brodbeck et al., 2018a; Daube et al., 2019; Fiedler et al., 2019), (b) our previous work first observing the enhancement also used the amplitude-onset envelope (Yasmin et al., 2023; Panela et al., 2024), and (c) the amplitude-onset envelope has been suggested to elicit a strong speech tracking response (Hertrich et al., 2012). Results for analyses using the amplitude envelope instead of the amplitude-onset envelope show similar e ects and are provided in the Supplementary Materials (Figure 1-figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>(1) Include all relevant parameters related to data analysis where applicable.

However, some points might benefit from addressing them.</p><p>(1) The absence of comprehension e ects is on the one hand surprising, as the decreased intelligibility should (theoretically) be visible in this data. On the other hand, from my own experience, the generation of &quot;good&quot; comprehension questions is quite di icult. While it is mentioned in the methods section, that comprehension accuracy and gist rating go hand in hand, this is not the case here. I am wondering if the data here should be rather understood as &quot;there is no di erence in intelligibility&quot; or that comprehension assessment via comprehension questions is potentially not a valid measure.</p></disp-quote><p>I assume that the reviewer refers to Experiment 1, where SNRs approximately below 15 dB led to reduced gist ratings (used as a proxy for speech intelligibility; Davis and Johnsrude, 2003, J Neurosci; Ritz et al., 2022, J Neurosci). That story comprehension accuracy does not decrease could be due to the comprehension questions themselves (as indicated by the reviewer, “good” questions can be hard to generate, potentially having low sensitivity). On the other hand, speech for the most di icult SNR was still ‘reasonably’ intelligible (gist ratings suggest ~85% of words could be understood), and participants may still have been able to follow the thread of the story. I do not further discuss this point in the manuscript, since it is not directly related to the noise-related enhancement in the neural tracking response, because the enhancement was present for high SNRs for which gist ratings did not show a di erence relative to clear speech (i.e., 20 dB and above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) However, if I understood correctly, the &quot;lower&quot; manipulation (same RMS for the whole sound stimulus) of experiment 3 was, what was also used in experiment 1. In experiment 3, unlike 1, there are comprehension e ects. I wondered if there are ideas about why that is.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes indeed, the ‘lower’ manipulation in Experiment 3 was also used in Experiments 1, 2, 4, and 5. The generation of the stimulus materials was similar across experiments. However, a new set of stories and comprehension questions was used for each experiment and the participants di ered as well (with some overlap). These aspects may have contributed to the di erence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Concerning the prediction accuracy, for a naive reader, some surrounding information would be helpful: What is the purpose/expectation of this measure? Is it to show that all models are above chance?</p></disp-quote><p>EEG prediction accuracy was included here, mainly because it is commonly used in studies using TRFs. A reader may wonder about EEG prediction accuracy if it were not reported. The hypotheses of the current study are related to the TRF weights/amplitude. This was added to the manuscript.</p><p>“EEG prediction accuracy was calculated because many previous studies report it (e.g., Decruy et al., 2019; Broderick et al., 2021; Gillis et al., 2021; Weineck et al., 2022; Karunathilake et al., 2023), but the main focus of the current study is on the TRF weights/amplitude.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Regarding the length of training and test data I got confused: It says per story 50 25-s snippets. As the maximum length of a story was 2:30 min, those snippets were mostly overlapping, right? It seems that depending on the length of the story and the &quot;location within the time series&quot; of the snippets, the number of remaining non-over-lapping snippets is variable. Also, within training, the snippets were overlapping, correct? Otherwise, the data for training would be too short. Again, as a naive reader, is this common, or can overlapping training data lead to overestimations?</p></disp-quote><p>The short stories made non-overlapping windows not feasible, but the overlap unlikely a ects the current results. Using cross-correlation (Hertrich et al 2012 Psychophysiology; which is completely independent for di erent snippets) instead of TRFs shows the same results (now provided in the supplementary materials). In one of our previous studies where the enhancement was first observed (Yasmin et al. 2023 Neuropsychologia), non-overlapping data were used because the stories were longer. This makes any meaningful impact of the overlap very unlikely. Critically, speech-clarity levels were randomized and all analyses were conducted in the same way for all conditions, thus not confounding any of the results/conclusions. The methods section was extended to further explain the choice of overlapping data snippets.</p><p>“Speech-clarity levels were randomized across stories and all analyses were conducted similarly for all conditions. Hence, no impact of overlapping training data on the results is expected (consistent with noise-related enhancements observed previously when longer stories and non-overlapping data were used; Yasmin et al., 2023). Analyses using cross-correlation, for which data snippets are treated independently, show similar results compared to those reported here using TRFs (Figure 1figure supplement 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) For experiment 1, three stories were clear, while the other 21 conditions were represented by one story each. Presumably, the ratio of 3:1 can a ect TRFs?</p></disp-quote><p>TRFs were calculated for each story individually and then averaged across three stories: either three clear stories, or three stories in babble for neighboring SNRs. Hence, the same number of TRFs were averaged for clear and noise conditions, avoiding exactly this issue. This was described in the methods section and is reproduced here:</p><p>“Behavioral data (comprehension accuracy, gist ratings), EEG prediction accuracy, and TRFs for the three clear stories were averaged. For the stories in babble, a sliding average across SNR levels was calculated for behavioral data, EEG prediction accuracy, and TRFs, such that data for three neighboring SNR levels were averaged. Averaging across three stories was calculated to reduce noise in the data and match the averaging of three stories for the clear condition.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Was there an overlap in participants?</p></disp-quote><p>Some participants took part in several of the experiments in separate sessions on separate days. This was added to the manuscript.</p><p>“Several participants took part in more than one of the experiments, in separate sessions on separate days: 7, 7, 9, 9, and 14 (for Experiments 1-5, respectively) participated only in one experiment; 3 individuals participated in all 5 experiments; 68 unique participants took part across the 5 experiments.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Can stochastic resonance also explain inverted U-shape results with vocoded speech?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. Distortions to the neural responses to noise-vocoding may reflect internal noise, but this would require additional research. For example, the Hauswald study (2022 EJN), showing enhancements due to noise-vocoding, used vocoding channels that also reduced speech intelligibility. The study would ideally be repeated with a greater number of vocoding channels to make sure the e ects are not driven by increased attention due to reduced speech intelligibility. I did not further discuss this in detail in the manuscript as it would go too far away from the experiments of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Typo in the abstract: box sexes is probably meant to say both sexes?</p></disp-quote><p>This text was removed, because more detailed gender identification is reported in the methods, and the abstract needed shortening to meet the eLife guidelines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewing Editor Comments:</bold></p><p>Interesting series of experiments to assess the influence of noise on cortical tracking in di erent conditions, interpreting the results with the mechanism of stochastic resonance.</p></disp-quote><p>I thank the editor for their encouraging feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For experiment 2, the author wishes to exclude the role of attention, by making participants perform a visual task. Data from low performers on the visual task was excluded, to avoid that participants attended the spoken speech. However, from the high performers on the visual task, how can you be sure that they did not pay attention to the auditory stimuli as well (as auditory attention is quite automatic, and these participants might be good at dividing their attention)? I understand that you can not ask participants about the auditory task during the experiment, but did you ask AFTER the experiment whether they were able to understand the stimuli? I think this is crucial for your interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>Participants were not asked whether they were able to understand the stimuli. Participants would unlikely invest e ort/attention in understanding the stories in babble without a speech-related task. Nevertheless, for follow-up analyses, I removed participants who performed above 0.9 in the visual task (i.e., the high performers), and the di erence between clear speech and speech in babble replicates. In the plots, data from all babble conditions above 15 dB SNR (highly intelligible) were averaged, but the results look almost identical if all SNRs are averaged. Moreover, the correlation between visual task performance and the babble-related enhancement was not-significant. These analyses were added to the Supplementary Materials (Figure 2-figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Statistics: inconsistencies across experiments with a lot of simple tests (FDR corrected) and in addition sometimes rmANOVA added - if interactions in rmANOVA are not significant then all the simple tests might not be warranted. So a bit of double dipping and over-testing here, but on the whole the conclusions do not seem to be overstated.</p></disp-quote><p>The designs of the di erent experiments di ered, thus requiring di erent statistical approaches. Moreover, the di erent tests assess di erent comparisons. For all experiments, contrasting the clear condition to all noise conditions was the main purpose of the experiments. To correct for multiple comparison, the False Discovery Rate correction was used. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were conducted in addition to this – excluding the clear condition because it would not fit into a factorial structure (e.g., Experiment 3) or to avoid analyzing it twice (e.g., Experiment 5) – to investigate di erences between di erent noise conditions. There was thus no over-testing in the presented study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Small points:</p><p>Question on methods: For each story, 50 25-s data snippets were extracted (Page 7, line 190). As you have stories with a duration of 1.5 to 2 minutes, does that mean there is a lot of overlap across data snippets? How does that influence the TRF/prediction accuracy?</p></disp-quote><p>The short stories made non-overlapping windows not feasible, but the overlap unlikely a ects the current results.

Analyses using crosscorrelation, for which data snippets are treated independently, show similar results compared to those reported here using TRFs (Figure 1-figure supplement 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results Experiment 3: page 17, line 417: no di erences were found between clear speech and masked speech - is this a power issue (as it does look di erent in the figure, Figure 4b)?</p></disp-quote><p>I thank the editor for pointing this out. Indeed, I made a minor mistake. Two comparisons were significant after FDR-thresholding. This is now included in the revised Figure 4. I also made sure the mistake was not present for other analyses; which it was not.</p></body></sub-article></article>
