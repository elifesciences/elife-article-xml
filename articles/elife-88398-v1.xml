The genome of an allopolyploid species results from initial interactions between parental genomes and long-term evolution. Distinguishing the contributions of these two phases is essential to understanding the evolutionary trajectory of allopolyploid species. Here, we compared phenotypic and transcriptomic changes in natural and resynthesized <italic>Capsella</italic> allotetraploids with their diploid parental species. We focused on phenotypic traits associated with the selfing syndrome and on transcription-level phenomena such as expression-level dominance (ELD), transgressive expression (TRE), and homoeolog expression bias (HEB). We found that selfing syndrome, high pollen, and seed quality in natural allotetraploids likely resulted from long-term evolution. Similarly, TRE and most down-regulated ELD were only found in natural allopolyploids. Natural allotetraploids also had more ELD toward the self-fertilizing parental species than resynthesized allotetraploids, mirroring the establishment of the selfing syndrome. However, short-term changes mattered, and 40% of the cases of ELD in natural allotetraploids were already observed in resynthesized allotetraploids. Resynthesized allotetraploids showed striking variation of HEB among chromosomes and individuals. Homoeologous synapsis was its primary source and may still be a source of genetic variation in natural allotetraploids. In conclusion, both short- and long-term mechanisms contributed to transcriptomic and phenotypic changes in natural allotetraploids. However, the initial gene expression changes were largely reshaped during long-term evolution leading to further morphological changes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>polyploidy</kwd><kwd>hybridization</kwd><kwd>selfing syndrome</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>capsella bursa-pastoris</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grant 2019-00806</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lascoux</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Erik Philip-Sorensen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lascoux</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005753</institution-id><institution>Royal Physiographic Society in Lund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Nilsson-Ehle research grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duan</surname><given-names>Tianlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sven och Lily Lawskis fond</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duan</surname><given-names>Tianlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grant 2018-05973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lascoux</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A comparison between artificially created allopolyploids and natural ones reveals that the latter underwent significant evolutionary steps after their formation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Allopolyploidization is the coupling of whole genome duplication and interspecific hybridization, resulting in organisms possessing two or more diverged genomes. This intriguing evolutionary transition is widespread in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertin and Marullo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barker et al., 2016</xref>) and is of agricultural importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Behling et al., 2020</xref>). Allopolyploidization is expected to have both short-term and long-term consequences: not only can the merging of divergent genomes itself be seen as a macromutation but also it triggers subsequent genomic changes over distinct time scales.</p><p>Right after allopolyploidization or within a few generations, various genomic and transcriptomic changes can be caused by a series of mechanisms, including DNA methylation repatterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Edger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2019</xref>), reactivation of transposable elements (TE, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vicient and Casacuberta, 2017</xref>), chromosome rearrangements, including homoeologous exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Parisod et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Szadkowski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lashermes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Xiong et al., 2021</xref>) and intergenomic interactions between regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hu and Wendel, 2019</xref>). These multifaceted effects were initially proposed to be dramatic but are likely smoother and more subtle than initially thought. The fact remains that these short-term mechanisms add further complexity to the genetic variation gathered from parental lineages. Genetic changes can reinforce some initial epigenetic changes, leading to long-term heritable consequences in established allopolyploids. For instance, an epigenetically downregulated/silenced gene copy is more likely to degenerate than the other copy due to weaker purifying selection.</p><p>Apart from instant genomic changes, allopolyploidization also alters multiple genetic attributes, impacting the long-term evolution of allopolyploid genomes. First, as a minority cytotype, newly formed allopolyploid populations often experience a bottleneck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Levin, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Novikova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Griffiths et al., 2019</xref>). This bottleneck reduces genetic variation within allopolyploid species and favors the fixation of neutral or slightly deleterious mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Novikova et al., 2017</xref>). Second, with an extra genome, allotetraploid species could undergo a period of relaxed purifying selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lynch and Conery, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Douglas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Paape et al., 2018</xref>). Relaxed selection also accelerates the accumulation of deleterious mutations on allopolyploid genomes. At the same time, it facilitates neofunctionalization by allowing functional mutations to accumulate in one paralog while maintaining the ancestral function through the second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ohno, 1970</xref>). Third, allopolyploidization immediately distorts both the relative and absolute dosage of gene product, which further alters physiological balance and efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anneberg and Segraves, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Domínguez-Delgado et al., 2021</xref>). In the long term, both relative and absolute dosages of gene expression of allopolyploid genomes are expected to be under selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bekaert et al., 2011</xref>), and gradually adapt to a polyploid or hybrid state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bomblies, 2020</xref>). Under the joint action of these forces, allopolyploid subgenomes are further co-adapted and degenerated, and subgenomes are often biasedly retained, termed biased fractionation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schnable et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Renny-Byfield et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wendel et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Both short-term reactions and long-term evolution can generate novel evolutionary opportunities and potentially allow allopolyploid lineages to have advantages in adaptation to novel environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baniaga et al., 2020</xref>). In established allopolyploids, phenomena caused by long-term evolutionary forces can be confounded by traces of short-term genomic changes. The relative contributions of short- and long-term mechanisms to genomic changes in allopolyploids can be assessed by comparing established natural allopolyploids with resynthesized allopolyploids (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buggs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yoo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhang et al., 2016b</xref>).</p><p>Variation and novelties in gene expression caused by allopolyploidization are often assessed by homoeolog expression bias (HEB) and non-additive gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grover et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yoo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shan et al., 2020</xref>). HEB measures the separate contributions of gene copies from different parental species (homoeologs) and non-additive gene expression measures the deviation of the total expression of both homoeologs from an intermediate value between parental species. Non-additive patterns of gene expressions are further classified as expression level dominance (ELD) and transgressive expression (TRE). ELD means that the total expression of both homoeologs is similar to the expression level of only one parental species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grover et al., 2012</xref>), but differs from the expression level of the other. TRE means that gene expression in allopolyploids is higher or lower than in both parental species. Variation of HEB and non-additive gene expression in allopolyploids can be triggered by several mechanisms in the early generations of the new allopolyploid; or alternatively, they may arise during long-term evolution due to either neutral or selective processes.</p><p><italic>Capsella bursa-pastoris</italic> is a natural allotetraploid plant species which originated about 100,000 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Douglas et al., 2015</xref>). Two diploid species, <italic>C. orientalis</italic> and <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>, are extant relatives of the maternal and paternal progenitors (hereinafter referred to as parental species) of <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hurka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Douglas et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> is self-incompatible (SI), but <italic>C. orientalis</italic> was already self-compatible (SC) before the formation of <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bachmann et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic> is also a self-compatible species, with typical selfing-syndrome characteristics. In particular, it has smaller petals, fewer pollen grains, and shorter styles than the outcrossing <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Neuffer and Paetsch, 2013</xref>). Yet, it remains unclear whether the inconspicuous flower phenotypes of <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic> only reflect the dominance relationship of the parental alleles or if these traits have also evolved post-allopolyploidization.</p><p>Natural <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic> exhibits disomic inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hurka et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Roux and Pannell, 2015</xref>), with which chromosomes only recombine and segregate with their homologs during meiosis, but not with homoeologs. However, the strictness of disomic inheritance in <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic> has not been tested. In general, the two subgenomes of <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic> are still well-retained and functional. There is no sign of large-scale gene loss or silencing, although purifying selection has been weaker genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Douglas et al., 2015</xref>), and the <italic>C. orientalis</italic>-derived subgenome (Cbp_co) has accumulated more putatively deleterious mutations than the <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>-derived subgenome (Cbp_cg), both before and after the formation of <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Douglas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kryvokhyzha et al., 2019a</xref>). The majority of genes are expressed from both homoeologs, and on average there is only a slight HEB toward Cbp_cg homoeologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Douglas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kryvokhyzha et al., 2019a</xref>). Most genes are additively expressed in natural <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic>, but ELD and transgressive gene expression have also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kryvokhyzha et al., 2019a</xref>). Despite the moderate HEB and non-additive expression, gene expression in <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic> showed some striking tissue-specific features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kryvokhyzha et al., 2019a</xref>). In flowers, gene expression levels in <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic> resembled those in <italic>C. orientalis</italic>, while in leaves and roots, gene expression levels were more similar to those in <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>.</p><p>In contrast to the drastic genomic or transcriptomic changes observed in allopolyploid wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhang et al., 2016a</xref>), <italic>Brassica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Szadkowski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lloyd et al., 2018</xref>), and <italic>Tragopogon</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chester et al., 2012</xref>), natural <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic> represents another paradigm where established allopolyploid species show only mild genomic changes and expression bias. This contrast raises questions. Was the genome of natural <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic> less affected by putative short-term mechanisms, or was it the result of 100,000 years’ evolution, which filtered out or compensated for the initial drastic changes? What are the relative strengths of short-term mechanisms and long-term evolution in shaping genomic and phenotypic variation in allopolyploids?</p><p>Resynthesized allopolyploids are the closest approximation to the early stage of natural allopolyploids. They provide a reference point for separating the short-term effects of allopolyploidization from long-term evolutionary changes. The present study builds upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duan et al., 2023</xref>, which showed that hybridization played a much larger role than whole genome doubling during the creation of resynthesized polyploids in the <italic>Capsella</italic> genus. Here, we compared transcriptomes and phenotypes of resynthesized <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic>-like allotetraploids with natural <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic> and its two diploid progenitors. We focused on teasing apart the contributions from short- and long-term processes to (1) phenotypes, (2) non-additive gene expression, and (3) HEB in <italic>Capsella</italic> allotetraploids.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The selfing syndrome was observed in natural C. bursa-pastoris but not in resynthesized allotetraploids</title><p>The breakdown of self-incompatibility in allotetraploid <italic>Capsella</italic> can directly result from hybridizing with the self-fertilizing species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bachmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duan et al., 2023</xref>).

There are two salient features. First, compared to either diploid progenitor, most DEGs in both resynthesized and natural allotetraploid groups were up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The proportion of down-regulated DEGs increased, nevertheless, in natural allotetraploids. Second, both resynthesized allotetraploids, Sd and Sh, have much more DEG with Co2 than with Cg2. However, this is no longer the case in Cbp where the two comparisons yielded similar results.</p><p>Although we could not make a clear expectation for gene ontology (GO) terms that would be overrepresented in DEGs between resynthesized and natural allopolyploids, we are not the only study that compared newly resynthesized and established allopolyploids, and GO terms that were repeatedly revealed by exploratory analysis may give a hint for future studies. For this reason, we further performed a GO enrichment analysis, using genes that were differentially expressed in both Cbp-Sd and Cbp-Sh contrasts as the test set, and all expressed genes with GO annotations as the background set. In flowers or leaves, the top 10 most-enriched GO terms for biological processes were related to proteolysis, xenobiotic transport, regulation of translational fidelity, telomere maintenance and organization, DNA geometric change and duplex unwinding, cellular response to toxic substance, aminoacylation, peptidyl-lysine methylation, and heterochromatin formation and organization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). But after adjusting p-values with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, only GO term proteolysis (GO:0006508) was significantly overrepresented in DEGs between resynthesized and natural allotetraploids in leaves (Fisher’s exact test, adjusted p-value = 0.0175).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Both short- and long-term mechanisms contributed to expression level dominance in natural Cbp, but transgressive expressions were mainly from long-term evolution</title><p>Non-additive gene expression shared by natural allotetraploids may be triggered right after allopolyploidization by short-term deterministic mechanisms, such as intergenomic interactions of regulatory elements. Alternatively, non-additive expression may have been caused by mechanisms with stochastic effects or arose later during long-term evolution. We explored to what extent the non-additive expression shared by natural allotetraploids could reflect short-term deterministic mechanisms. By comparing gene expression levels in allotetraploids and diploid species, 21,647 genes in flowers and 18,758 genes in leaves were classified into one of the 10 expression categories, using the results of DE analysis on unphased gene expression (FC &gt;2 and FDR &lt;0.05). We focused on complete ELD and TREs: complete ELD is obtained when the gene expression level in an allopolyploid group is similar to that in one diploid group but not to the expression in the other diploid group, and TRE is detected when the gene expression level in an allopolyploid group is either higher or lower than in both diploid groups.</p><p>The percentage of genes showing complete ELD was altogether limited but doubled in natural allotetraploids relative to resynthesized allotetraploids (5.5% of genes in resynthesized allotetraploids and 10.2% in natural allotetraploids. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

When HEB of genes was plotted along chromosomal positions, we found that the extra peaks in the distribution of HEB can be further explained by large genomic segments separated by a sudden change of average HEB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">6</xref>). Altogether, the pattern suggested that some chromosomes or chromosomal regions in resynthesized allotetraploids had an unbalanced number of cg- and co-homoeologs (not 2:2), which were likely caused by the segregation and recombination of homoeologous chromosomes. Both the segregation and recombination of homoeologous chromosomes are outcomes of homoeologous synapsis (synapsis between homoeologous chromosomes during meiosis), which reflects polysomic or mixed inheritance in resynthesized allopolyploids.

(ii) If ELD was mainly caused by mechanisms with random effects, such as TE transposition, on average, there should be no large difference between the expression changes of EL-dominant and EL-recessive homoeologs. Because the occurrence and regulatory effects of new TE transpositions do not depend on the original relative expression level of the two homoeologs, that is the highly and lowly expressed homoeologs are equally likely to be up- or down-regulated by new TE transpositions. (iii) Predictions for new intergenomic interactions of regulatory elements can be complex, but under a simple scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hu and Wendel, 2019</xref>), ELD may be caused by divergent trans-acting factors. In allopolyploids, stronger trans-acting factors act on the cis-regulatory elements of the opposite homoeolog, causing a similar regulatory effect if transcription rate were not limited by the concentration of these trans-regulators. If this mechanism were the main cause of ELD, on average the EL-recessive homoeolog should have the larger expression change in all categories of ELD, while the expression of EL-dominant homoeolog is not expected to change. In all other cases, we would not have direct inference on the exact mechanism of ELD, but at least the three mechanisms listed above could not be the predominant cause of ELD.</p><p>Concerning the ELD found in resynthesized allotetraploids, the change of homoeolog expression fits the third scenario. In all four categories of ELD, the EL-recessive homoeolog had a larger average expression change in the same direction as ELD, while the average expression change of EL-dominant homoeolog was closer to zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig8sdata1">Figure 8—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>The Cbp-specific ELD showed a different pattern.

In this sense, short-term transcriptomic changes in new allopolyploids are also part of parental legacy but are not observable with only information from diploid parental species. In this study, we used resynthesized <italic>Capsella</italic> allotetraploids as an approximation of the early stage of the natural allotetraploid species to separate and compare the short- and long-term transcriptomic and phenotypic changes.

Colchicine treatment could affect pollen and seed quality and the rate of homoeologous synapsis in resynthesized allotetraploids.

In the case of allotetraploid <italic>Capsella</italic>, the selection of selfing-syndrome-related traits and the adaptation to a polyploid state (e.g. decreasing the size of cell or organ for physiological efficiency or better energy allocation) may work synergistically and can be difficult to separate.</p><p>Apart from the selfing-syndrome-related traits, newly resynthesized <italic>Capsella</italic> allotetraploids had lower proportions of viable pollen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l</xref>) and normal seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1m</xref>). In contrast, pollen and seed quality in natural <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic> were much higher and as good as in diploid species.

In diploid or polyploid interspecific hybrids, overexpression is often more common than underexpression. The trend has been observed in a wide range of organisms, including <italic>Brassica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wei et al., 2021</xref>) and <italic>Raphanobrassica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Ye et al., 2016</xref>), cotton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yoo et al., 2013</xref>), brown algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sousa et al., 2019</xref>), and copepod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barreto et al., 2015</xref>). Results in <italic>Capsella</italic> further showed that short-term mechanisms mainly caused the excess of up-regulated ELDs. Among the short-term mechanisms, intergenomic interaction of regulatory elements is the most likely candidate for generating the excess of up-regulated ELDs, considering that these up-regulated ELDs were highly shared between the two resynthesized allotetraploid groups, and between resynthesized and natural allotetraploids. A global DNA methylation change may also contribute to the excess of up-regulation in resynthesized allotetraploids, if methylation levels were systematically lower in <italic>Capsella</italic> allotetraploids, as observed in <italic>Mimulus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Edger et al., 2017</xref>). However, methylation change alone fails to explain why the majority of these up-regulated ELDs in resynthesized allotetraploids were retained in natural allotetraploids, especially in leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Besides, the relict ELDs contained more Cg-ELDs than Co-ELD, but Cbp-specific ELDs had more Co-ELDs, especially in flowers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The increase of Co-ELDs in natural <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic> mirrored the morphological difference: The floral organ size of resynthesized allotetraploids was similar to that of <italic>C. grandiflora</italic>, whereas natural <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic> was more similar to <italic>C. orientalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–g</xref>). However, it is worth noting that the reversed trend of ELD may not be the fundamental genetic basis of selfing syndrome, but reflect the different composition of tissue/cells in RNA samples. Both morphological changes and the direction of ELD could result from upstream regulatory changes.</p><p>In addition, although unbalanced homoeolog content (not 2:2) caused by homoeologous synapsis was common in our resynthesized allotetraploids, they were still not the main cause of ELD in resynthesized allotetraploids. If ELD were mainly caused by possessing more than two copies of the EL-dominant homoeolog, we would expect the relative expression from the EL-dominant homoeolog to increase and the EL-recessive homoeolog to decrease in genes with significant ELD. In contrast to this expectation, we found that, on average, the expression of EL-dominant homoeologs (relative to the transcriptome of the subgenome) was similar to that in diploid parental species, while the expression of EL-recessive homoeologs changed toward the EL-dominant homoeolog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This suggests that ELD is mainly achieved by altering the expression of EL-recessive homoeologs.

The contrast between resynthesized and natural allotetraploids suggested that preferential synapsis was rapidly improved in natural <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic>, and/or a balanced number of homoeologs was strongly preferred by selection, otherwise, we would expect a much higher proportion of homoeolog replacement (having four copies of the same homoeolog) after 100,000 year recurrent self-fertilization with tetrasomic/heterosomic inheritance.</p><p>Homoeologous synapsis was the major mechanism for the variation of HEB and homoeolog expression loss in resynthesized <italic>Capsella</italic> allopolyploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Several models have been proposed to explain HEB and biased genome fractionation in allopolyploids, including different TE contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Woodhouse et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wendel et al., 2018</xref>), the epigenetic difference of subgenomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2014</xref>), different strength of regulatory elements, as a result of enhancer runaway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fyon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bottani et al., 2018</xref>). It was also suggested that the initial HEB may be reinforced in long-term evolution, as the homoeolog with a lower initial expression level is subject to weaker purifying selection, and has a larger chance of degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Woodhouse et al., 2014</xref>). However, in resynthesized <italic>Capsella</italic> allotetraploids, homoeologous synapsis played an important role in generating HEB variation, possibly overshadowing the influence of other mechanisms. This result does not conflict with the observed association between TE content in parental species and genome dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Woodhouse et al., 2014</xref>). While TE contents may have only a minor effect in directly generating HEB variation, they could still be informative in predicting HEB in established allopolyploids, as the presence of TEs in the flanking regions may affect the fitness effect of HEB variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hollister and Gaut, 2009</xref>). In other words, TEs may not function as a strong mutagenic mechanism of HEB variation, but affect the selection on HEB variation, as a form of genetic load.</p><p>For established natural allotetraploids, occasional homoeologous synapsis may still be an important source of genetic variation, even long after the allopolyploidization event. Although an earlier allozymic study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hurka et al., 1989</xref>) and an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) with high throughput sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Roux and Pannell, 2015</xref>) suggest that natural <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic> exhibits disomic inheritance, neither analysis could reject homoeologous synapsis at a lower rate. A very small proportion of homoeologous synapsis may be negligible for inferring the dominant mode of inheritance, but in terms of causing homoeologous gene loss and creating genetic variation, homoeologous synapsis can still be more influential than point mutations. Due to the inevitable technical variation of RNA-seq and expression variation across genes, we were unable to confidently resolve smaller blocks of unbalanced homoeolog content. Despite the small sample size and the low resolution of RNA-seq data, we noticed that some small genomic blocks with homoeolog replacement were shared by the individuals of the same population but varied among populations of natural <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>)<italic>,</italic> suggesting that homoeologous synapsis still contribute to expressional variation in natural <italic>C. bursa-pastoris</italic>. Apart from homoeolog synapsis in a single-origin allopolyploid species, unbalanced content of homoeologs could also arise from secondary introgression from diploid parental species. Detailed demographic modeling would be needed for distinguishing the two scenarios.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, together with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duan et al., 2023</xref>, the present study shows that both short- and long-term mechanisms contributed to transcriptomic and phenotypic changes in natural allotetraploids.

The number of pollen grains per flower (pollen counts) was calculated by counting 1/60 (Co2, Sd, Sh, and Cbp groups) or 1/120 (Cg2 group) of the total pollen grains of a flower using a hemocytometer. Pollen viability was measured with an aceto-carmine staining method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duan et al., 2023</xref>), by examining at least 300 pollen grains per flower. Pollen counts and pollen viability were measured on two flowers of each individual. Seeds from the 11th to 20th fruits were counted and were used to measure the proportion of normal seeds. In the case of the Cg2 and Cg4 groups, seeds were obtained through hand pollination. The first ten fruits were used when not all of these flowers set fruits.

GO terms with less than 10 annotated genes were excluded from the analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Tray ID of each <italic>Capsella</italic> plant and the position of eight plants within each tray.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-88398-supp1-v1.csv" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="octet-stream"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>RNA-sequencing information.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-88398-supp2-v1.csv" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="octet-stream"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Gene ontology (GO) terms that were overrepresented in differentially expressed genes (FC &gt;1.5 and FDR &lt;0.05) between resynthesized and natural allopolyploids.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-88398-supp3-v1.csv" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="octet-stream"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-88398-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The RNA-sequencing data of natural C. bursa-pastoris generated by this article are available in NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and can be accessed with BioProject number PRJNA848625.

To do this, they compared five categories of plant: the two progenitors of the allopolyploid, hybrids resynthesized from the progenitors with a whole-genome duplication either before or after the hybridization event, and the naturally occurring allopolyploid.</p><p>Two lines of evidence were used: phenotypic data from the plants grown in a common environment, and RNAseq data from a subset of the plants.</p><p>The phenotypic data indicate that the selfing syndrome of C. bursa-pastoris likely evolved after the initial allopolyploidization event, and that pollen and seed viability recovered following the allopolyploidization event. The results are compelling but would benefit from small clarifications to the methods and statistics to account for possible positional effects in the growth chamber. Using a linear mixed model rather than a simple ANOVA would solve this problem.</p><p>The RNAseq data are used to explore overall expression patterns (using multi-dimensional scaling), patterns of differential expression (additive, dominant, or transgressive), and homeolog expression bias, and to determine the relative contributions of the original allopolyploidization event and subsequent evolution. Statistical cutoffs were used to categorize gene expression patterns, but the description and categorization of these patterns appears to have been largely qualitative, and might be strengthened by including more statistical detail in questions like whether homeologous expression bias did indeed show more variation in resynthesized and evolved allopolyploids.</p><p>The study includes evidence that homeolog expression bias (overrepresentation of an allele from one species) results in part from homeologous synapsis (uneven inheritance of chromosome segments). These deviations from patterns consistent with 2:2 inheritance of genomic regions are highly variable between individuals in resynthesized allopolyploids but appeared to be mostly consistent within (but not between) populations in natural C. bursa-pastoris. This is intriguing evidence that segregation can be an important source of variation in allopolyploids. However, it was limited by the difficulty of inferring homeologous recombination breakpoints with RNAseq data because of the scale of recombination in wild populations (rather than resynthesized allopolyploids). In future identifying such breakpoints will be an interesting direction for this and other allopolyploid systems.</p><p>This research suggests many follow-up questions. In particular, it may be possible to identify evidence about the mechanism of the original hybridization event. How frequently do unreduced gametes occur in these species, and is it likely that C. bursa-pastoris evolved via a triploid bridge? Exploring the viability, fertility, and phenotypes of triploids produced in both directions could be a valuable future direction.</p><p>Future research, or the current study, could also valuably explore what kinds of genes experienced what forms of expression evolution. A brief description of GO terms frequently represented in genes which showed strong patterns of expression evolution might be suggestive of which selective pressures led to the changes in expression in the C. bursa-pastoris lineage, and to what extent they related to adaptation to polyploidization (e.g. cell-cycle regulators), compensating for the initial pollen and seed inviability or adapting to selfing (endosperm- or pollen-specific genes), or adaptation to abiotic conditions.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting and valuable contribution to the field's understanding of how expression evolves in interaction with hybridization and polyploidy. Particularly in combination with the team's previous study on these lines, this experimental design is effective for separating the contributions of hybridization, WGD, and evolution over time.</p><p>Update: the authors have thoughtfully and thoroughly updated the manuscript to address all the questions I raised. I appreciate the chance to review this valuable contribution to the scientific literature.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88398.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The flowering plant Capsella bursa-pastoris is an allotetraploid formed from the genomes of Capsella orientalis and Capsella grandiflora. An outstanding question in the evolution of allotetraploids is the relative contribution of immediate consequences of allopolyploidization vs. long-term evolution after the event. The authors address this question by re-synthesizing the allotetraploid in the lab using the two progenitor species, and comparing its phenotypic and gene expression variation to naturally occurring C. bursa-pastoris. They find evidence primarily for long-term phenotypic evolution towards a selfing syndrome in C. bursa-pastoris, and a combination of short and long-term changes to gene expression.</p><p>The manuscript is thorough and provides lots of new insights into the mechanisms driving evolution in allopolyploids. I especially appreciated the detailed examination of different mechanisms driving gene expression variation. There are some important limitations of the experimental design related to independent evolution of the progenitor species and effects of the colchicine treatment used to induce polyploidy, but these are well-addressed in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88398.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Duan</surname><given-names>Tianlin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Uppsala University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Uppsala</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sicard</surname><given-names>Adrien</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Uppsala</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Glémin</surname><given-names>Sylvain</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Université Rennes 1, CNRS</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rennes</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lascoux</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Uppsala University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Uppsala</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p>The study could also valuably explore what kinds of genes experienced what forms of expression evolution.

Even if we only consider adaptive changes, the modifications could occur in various aspects, such as stabilizing meiosis, adapting to the new cell size, reducing hybrid incompatibility and adapting to self-fertilization. And each of these modifications involves numerous biological processes and molecular functions. As we could make post-hoc stories for too many GO terms, extrapolating at this stage have limited implications and could be misleading.</p><p>Nonetheless, we are not the only study that compared newly resynthesized and established allopolyploids. GO terms that were repeatedly revealed by this type of exploratory analysis may give a hint for future studies. For this reason, now we have reported the results of a simple GO analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations for the authors: please note that you control which, if any, revisions, to undertake</p><p>The majority of concerns from reviewers and the reviewing editor are in regards to the presentation of the manuscript; that the framing of the manuscript does not help the general reader understand how this work advances our knowledge of allopolyploid evolution in the broad sense. The manuscript may be challenging to read for those who aren't familiar with the study system or the genetic basis of polyploidy/gene expression regulation. Further, it is difficult to understand from the introduction how this work is novel compared to the recently published work from Duan et al and compared to other systems. Because eLife is a journal that caters to a broad readership, re-writing the introduction to bring home the novelty for the reader will be key.</p><p>Additionally, the writing is quite technical and contains many short-hands and acronyms that can be difficult to keep straight.

Even though writing out &quot;homoeolog expression bias&quot; or &quot;hybridization-first&quot; every time would add length, I would find it easier to follow and suspect others would too.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. Indeed, using less uncommon acronyms or short-hands should increase the readability of the text for broader audience. Now in most places, we refer to “Sd/Sh” and “Cbp” as “resynthesized allotetraploids” and “natural allotetraploids”, respectively. We have also replaced the most occurrences of the acronyms for transcriptional phenomena (ELD, HEB and TRE) with full phrases, unless there are extra attributes before them (such as “Cg-/Co-ELD” and “relic/Cbp-specific ELD”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful to include complete sample sizes to either a slightly modified Figure 1 or the beginning of the methods, just to reduce mental arithmetic (&quot;Each of the five groups was represented by six &quot;lines&quot;, and each line had six individuals&quot; so there were 180 total plants, of which 167 were phenotyped - presumably the other 13 died? - and 30 were sequenced).</p></disp-quote><p>The number 167 only applied to floral morphorlogical traits (“Floral morphological traits were measured for all five groups on 167 plants…”), but the exact total sample size for other traits differed. Now the total sample sizes of other traits have also been added to beginning of the second paragraph of the methods.</p><p>For this study 180 seedings have been transplanted from Petri dishes to soil, but 8 seedlings died right after transplanting, seemingly caused by mechanical damage and insufficient moistening. Later phenotyping (2020.02-2020.05) was also disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and some individuals were not measured as we missed the right life stages. Specifically, 5 individuals were missing for floral morphological traits (sepal width, sepal length, petal width, petal length, pistil width, pistil length, and stamen length), 30 for pollen traits, 1 for stem length, and 2 for flowering time. As for seed traits, we only measured individuals with more than ten fruits, so apart from the reasons mentioned above, individuals that were self-incompatible and had insufficient hand-pollination were also excluded. We spotted another mistake during the revision: two individuals with floral morphological measurements had no positional information (tray ID). These measurements were likely mis-sampled or mislabeled, and were therefore excluded from analysis. We assumed most of these missing values resulted from random technical mistakes and were not directly related to the measured traits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, the methods did a thorough job of describing the genomics approaches but could have used more detail for the plant growth (were plants randomized in the growth chamber, can you rule out block/position effects) and basic statistics (what statistical software was used to perform which tests comparing groups in each section, after the categories were identified).</p><p>When describing the methods, mention whether the plants; this should be straightforward as a linear model with position as a covariate.</p></disp-quote><p>Data used in the present study and a previously published work (Duan et al., 2023) were different subsets of a single experiment. For this reason, we spent fewer words in describing shared methods in this manuscript but tried to summarize some methods that were essential for understanding the current paper. But as you have pointed out, we did miss many important details that should have been kept. Now we have added some description and a table (Supplementary file 1) in the “Plant material” section for explaining randomization, and added more information of the software used for performing statistic tests in the “Phenotyping” section.</p><p>Although we did not mention in the present manuscript, we used a randomized block design for the experiment (Author response image 1).</p><p><bold>Author response image 1.</bold></p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Plant positions inside the growth chamber.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88398-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Plants used in the present study and Duan et al. (2023) were different subsets of a single experiment. The entire experiment had eight plant groups, including the five plant groups used in the present study diploid C. orientalis (Co2), diploid C. grandiflora (Cg2), “whole-genome-duplication-first” (Sd) and “hybridization-first”(Sh) resynthesized allotetraploids, and natural allotetraploids, C. bursa pastoris (Cbp), as well as three plant groups that were only used in Duan et al. (2023; tetraploid C. orientalis (Co4), tetraploid C. grandiflora (Cg4) and diploid hybrids (F)). Each of the eight plant groups had six lines and each line represented by six plants, resulting in 288 plants (8 groups x 6 lines x 6 individuals = 288 plants). The 288 plants were grown in 36 trays placed on six shelves inside the same growth chamber. Each tray had exactly one plant from each of the eight groups, and the position of the eight plants within each tray (A-H) were randomized with random.shuffle() method in Python (Supplementary file 1). The position of the 36 trays inside the growth room (1-36) was also random and the positions of all trays were shuffled once again 28 days after germination (randomized with RAND() and sorting in Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet). (a) Plant distribution; (b) An example of one tray; (c) A view inside the growth chamber, showing the six benches.</p><p>With the randomized block design and one round of shuffling, positional effect is very unlikely to bias the comparison among the five plant groups. The main risk of not adding positions to the statistical model is increasing error variance and decreasing the statistical power for detecting group effect. As we had already observed significant among-group variation in all phenotypic traits (p-value &lt;2.2e-16 for group effect in most tests), further increasing statistical power is not our primary concern. In addition, during the experiment we did not notice obvious difference in plant growth related to positions. Although we could have added more variables to account for potential positional effects (tray ID, shelf ID, positions in a tray etc.), adding variables with little effect may reduce statistical power due to the loss of degree of freedom.</p><p>Due to one round of random shuffling, positions cannot be easily added as a single continuous variable. Now we have redone all the statistical tests on phenotypic traits and included tray ID as a categorical factor (Figure 2-Source Data 1). In general, the results were similar to the models without tray ID. The F-values of group effect was only slightly changed, and p-values were almost unchanged in most cases (still &lt; 2.2e-16). The tray effect (df=35) was not significant in most tests and was only significant in petal length (p-value=0.0111), sepal length (p-value=0.0242) and the number of seeds in ten fruits (p-value=0.0367). As expected, positions (tray ID) had limited effect on phenotypic traits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 - I assume the numbers at the top indicate sample sizes but perhaps add this to the figure caption.</p></disp-quote><p>Statistical power depends on both the total sample size and the sample size of each group, especially the group with the fewest observations. We lost different number of measurements in each phenotypic trait, and for pollen traits we did have a notable loss, so we chose to show sample sizes above each group to increase transparency. Since we had five different sets of sample sizes (for floral morphological traits, stem length, days to flowering, pollen traits and seed traits, respectively), it would be cumbersome to introduce all 25 numbers in figure caption and could be hard for readers to match the sample sizes with results. For this reason, we would like to keep the sample sizes in the figure, and now we have modified the legend to clarify that the numbers above groups are sample sizes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>’The trend has been observed in a wide range of organisms, including ...’ - perhaps group Brassica and Raphanobrassica into one clause in the sentence, since separating them out undermines the diversity somewhat.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, it is very strange to put “cotton” between two representatives from Brassicaceae.

But this is an implication, rather than an observation, so the sentence is better rewritten as “Natural allotetraploids had less pollen grains per flower.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>‘The percentage of genes showing complete ELD was altogether limited but doubled between resynthesized allotetraploid groups and natural allotetraploids’ for clarity, I would suggest revising this to something like &quot;doubled in natural allotetraploids relative to resynthesized allotetraploids</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion.

It seems to me like the former falls under the umbrella of the latter.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Expression-level dominance and homeolog expression bias are easily confused, but they are conceptually independent. One gene could have expression-level dominance without any homeolog expression bias, or strong homeolog expression bias without any expression-level dominance. The concepts were well explained in Grover et al., (2012) with nice figures.</p><p>Expression level dominance compares the total expression level of both homoeologs in allopolyploids with the expression of the same gene in parental species, and judges whether the total expression level in allopolyploids is only similar to one of the parental species. The contributions from different homoeologs are not distinguished.</p><p>While homoeolog expression bias compares the relative expression level of each homoeologs in allopolyploids, with no implication on the total expression of both homoeologs.</p><p>Let the expression level of one gene in parental species X and Y be e(X) and e(Y), respectively. And let the expression level of x homoeolog (from species X) and y homoeolog (from species Y) in allopolyploids be e(x) and e(y), respectively.</p><p>Then a (complete) expression level dominance toward species X means:e(x)+e(y)=e(X) and e(x)+e(y)≠e(Y);</p><p>While a homoeolog expression bias toward species X means:e(x) &gt; e(y), or e(x)/e(y) &gt; e(X)/e(Y), depending on the definition of studies.</p><p>Both expression-level dominance and homeolog expression bias have been widely studied in allopolyploids (Combes et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014; Yoo et al., 2014; Hu &amp; Wendel, 2019). As the two phenomena could be in opposite directions, and may be caused by different mechanisms, we think adopting the definitions in Grover et al., (2012) and distinguishing the two concepts would facilitate communication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Is it possible to split up the results in Figure 7 to show which of the two homeologs was lost (i.e. orientalis vs. grandiflora)?

Figure 7a,c showed the loss of C. orientalis-homoeolog (“co-expession loss”), and Figure 7b,d showed the loss of C. grandiflora-homoeolog (“cg-expession loss”). Now the legends have been modified to explain the Figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The paragraph starting with &quot;The extant diploid species&quot; is too long, should probably be split into two paragraphs and edited for clarity.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>The whole paragraph was used to explain why the resynthesized allotetraploids could be a realistic approximation of the early stage of C. bursa-pastoris with two arguments:</p><p>1.
