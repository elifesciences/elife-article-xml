To study dynamic interactions during such decisions, we developed a setup where two agents seated face-to-face to engage in game-theoretical tasks on a shared transparent touchscreen display (‘transparent games’). We compared human and macaque pairs in a transparent version of the coordination game ‘Bach-or-Stravinsky’, which entails a conflict about which of two individually-preferred opposing options to choose to achieve coordination. Most human pairs developed coordinated behavior and adopted dynamic turn-taking to equalize the payoffs. All macaque pairs converged on simpler, static coordination. Remarkably, two animals learned to coordinate dynamically after training with a human confederate. This pair selected the faster agent’s preferred option, exhibiting turn-taking behavior that was captured by modeling the visibility of the partner’s action before one’s own movement. Such competitive turn-taking was unlike the prosocial turn-taking in humans, who equally often initiated switches to and from their preferred option. Thus, the dynamic coordination is not restricted to humans but can occur on the background of different social attitudes and cognitive capacities in rhesus monkeys. Overall, our results illustrate how action visibility promotes the emergence and maintenance of coordination when agents can observe and time their mutual actions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>To live with others is to make concessions. You may want to go to the movies tonight, but your partner may prefer the theatre: reaching a mutually desirable goal – that is, spending time together – requires adjusting your preferences to theirs. Many other social species also make such decisions, in particular monkeys that live in large groups.</p><p>Conceptually, these interactions are known as coordination games. In such scenarios, two players must coordinate their actions to attain a coveted reward, but they must also resolve a conflict about who gets the larger share. This makes the joint strategy non-trivial, and different pairs of players might resort to different strategies. In the laboratory, coordination games are often tested in settings which do not allow participants to monitor each other’s behaviors as they make these complex choices. In real life, however, individuals making a joint decision can often observe each other and receive immediate feedback.</p><p>In response, Moeller et al. developed a new way to test coordination games that allows more realistic social interactions. In their setup, two participants face each other and use a shared see-through touchscreen to perform a task. This new design was used to test how humans and macaque monkeys solved a simplified version of the ‘Bach or Stravinsky’ coordination game, which involves choosing between a red and blue target on the screen. Players in a pair had been trained to ‘prefer’ opposite colors. In this game, collaboration is beneficial (both individuals get a better prize if they choose the same color) but also creates unfairness (the reward is higher for the participant whose ‘favorite’ color is selected).</p><p>When paired up, both humans and monkeys learned to collaborate and to go for the same color (or, in some monkey pairs, the same side of the screen). However, only humans took turns selecting red or blue so that players could alternate getting the highest reward. Monkeys usually settled on one color throughout the game, unless they had learned the ‘turn-taking’ strategy from a human partner; in that case, the color chosen in each trial was typically determined by the monkey who was the faster to move.</p><p>These experiments show how monkeys and humans use visual information about their partner’s actions to coordinate their choices, paving the way for further decision-making studies that accurately reflect how interactions unfold in real life. Moeller et al. expect that this will help to understand how cooperation and competition emerge in these two species, including how direct face-to-face contact, or lack thereof in some aspects of our modern world, shapes our social behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>decision-making</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>dynamic coordination</kwd><kwd>game theory</kwd><kwd>cooperation</kwd><kwd>competition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011937</institution-id><institution>Lower Saxony Ministry of Science and Culture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Niedersächsisches Vorab</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name><name><surname>Gail</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Treue</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name><name><surname>Kagan</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001664</institution-id><institution>Leibniz Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Leibniz ScienceCampus Primate Cognition</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name><name><surname>Gail</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Treue</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name><name><surname>Kagan</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001664</institution-id><institution>Leibniz Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Leibniz Collaborative Excellence grant &quot;Neurophysiological mechanisms of primate interactions in dynamic sensorimotor settings&quot;, K265/2019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gail</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Treue</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name><name><surname>Kagan</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1528 Cognition of Interaction, project Z01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gail</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Kagan</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Using novel approach to study real-time social interactions shows that mutual action visibility facilitates static and dynamic coordination in both species, but whereas humans employ dynamic turn-taking to equalize rewards, macaques, after training with a human, compete between themselves.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The majority of primate species live in complex social groups, in which interactions range from intense competition to cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Byrne and Bates, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jaeggi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Joly et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Platt et al., 2016</xref>). To adjust behavior optimally, individuals need to assess their own actions and goals, and those of other group members, while taking into account the history of interactions with and between these individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Frith and Frith, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Platt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Waal, 2007</xref>). Coordination is essential for maintaining cohesion between group members, avoiding conflicts, and achieving individual and joint action goals. Here, we focus on understanding how such coordination can be achieved and maintained in a dyadic ‘transparent’ setting in which agents can observe each other’s ongoing actions and social cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Unakafov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Unakafov et al., 2019</xref>), like in many natural situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conty et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fruteau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rizzolatti et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Silk, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Game theory, developed to study strategic interactions in rational decision-makers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944</xref>), offers a powerful framework to investigate dyadic social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rilling and Sanfey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sanfey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tremblay et al., 2017</xref>) and the evolution of coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brosnan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Santos and Rosati, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smith, 1979</xref>). In 2×2 games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rapoport et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rapoport, 1973</xref>), each of the two agents chooses one of two actions and the outcome depends on the combination of their choices. Non-zero-sum 2×2 games that have both cooperative and competitive elements with aligned and opposing interests are particularly interesting for understanding many realistic scenarios. Here, the agents need to coordinate their choices to maximize individual and/or joint rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rapoport, 1967</xref>). For example, in the Stag Hunt (or Assurance) game, agents choose between maximizing the individual as well as joint reward and minimizing the individual risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Skyrms, 2003</xref>). Humans (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>), chimpanzees (<italic>Pan troglodytes</italic>), rhesus macaques (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>), and capuchin monkeys (<italic>Cebus apella</italic>) coordinate at the above chance level on mutually beneficial high-reward/high-risk choices in the iterated Stag Hunt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brosnan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brosnan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bullinger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duguid et al., 2014</xref>). Similar to Stag Hunt, in Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) two agents maximize their <italic>joint</italic> reward if they both choose to cooperate. Yet, an individual agent obtains the highest reward when defecting while the partner cooperates (and receives the lowest reward), creating a dilemma between the selfish temptation to defect and a riskier cooperation that requires trust. Humans often show a bias towards cooperative behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Camerer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rilling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wedekind and Milinski, 1996</xref>). Remarkably, it was demonstrated that macaques, while mostly defecting, chose mutual cooperation significantly more and mutual defection significantly less than expected by chance, especially after preceding cooperation, in an iterated PD game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haroush and Williams, 2015</xref>). This finding suggests that macaques can at least partially overcome the selfish motives and reciprocate cooperation.</p><p>Another type of conflict that contrasts selfish and prosocial preferences is implemented in the Conflict game (also known as Hawk-Dove, or game of Chicken) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brosnan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smith, 1979</xref>). These anti-coordination games model a competition over a shared resource that can be monopolized by one agent, while an actual clash is highly detrimental to both. Humans, capuchins, and macaques often converge on anti-coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brosnan et al., 2017</xref>), but importantly, only humans alternate between the two individually-optimal anti-coordinated choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brosnan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grueneisen and Tomasello, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Helbing et al., 2005</xref>). Such alternating behavior results in the maximal and equal payoff for both agents and is called ‘cooperative turn-taking’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bornstein et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colman and Browning, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noë, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In the above games, reward-optimizing rational agents should coordinate on one option (Stag Hunt and Prisoner’s Dilemma) or anti-coordinate on opposite options (Conflict game). A third, less studied type of game that emphasizes the coordination of <italic>either of two options</italic> is known as Battle of the Sexes, or Bach-or-Stravinsky game (BoS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kilgour and Fraser, 1988</xref>). Each agent has an individually preferred option, but coordinating on either one of these options adds the same bonus to both agents. This renders any coordinated choice better than no coordination for both agents, but one coordinated choice is better for the first agent and the other better for the second agent. The rational choice is to coordinate, but unlike the conceptually simpler optimal convergence on one option in Stag Hunt and PD, BoS includes an inherent conflict about who profits the most. This combination of cooperation and conflict offers an interesting opportunity for studying social interactions in nonhuman primates. As in the Conflict game, games of the BoS type revealed that humans often take turns, switching between the two coordinated options to ensure fairness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ioannou and Romero, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sonsino and Sirota, 2003</xref>). Interestingly, in a rope-pulling task that requires cooperation but rewards only one agent at a time, trial-by-trial turn-taking frequently took place in 5-year-old children, but neither in 3-year-old children nor in chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Melis et al., 2016</xref>). This result begs the question whether turn-taking requires special social or cognitive abilities that are unique to humans. We therefore compared the behavior of (adult) humans and rhesus macaques in the BoS economic game.</p><p>Traditionally, economic games are played either ‘<italic>simultaneously’</italic> (neither agent knows the choice of the other before making its own decision) or <italic>sequentially</italic> in a predetermined order. Yet, real dyadic interactions often play out with the partner’s actions in direct sight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dugatkin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Doorn et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the timing of one’s own and the other’s actions becomes part of the strategy space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McDonald et al., 2019</xref>). Such a ‘transparent’ continuous time setting can change choice strategies as compared to the classic simultaneous and sequential settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noë, 2006</xref>).</p><p>To account for changes in strategies during action visibility compared to ‘opaque’ (simultaneous) choices, we recently developed the concept of ‘transparent games’ that extends the classical evolutionary game-theoretic analysis to real-time interactions in which the visibility of partners’ actions depends on their relative action times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Unakafov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Unakafov et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we use the theoretical insights from that work and analyze short- and long-term dynamics of choices, mutual information, and action times in humans and rhesus monkeys playing a transparent version of an iterated movement-based BoS game. To this end, we designed a novel dyadic interaction platform where two human or monkey agents face each other and act on the same visual objects on a vertical touch-sensitive transparent display between them. This configuration provides action visibility, i.e. it allows agents to monitor and react to each other’s actions in real-time, emulating naturalistic interactions under well-controlled laboratory conditions.</p><p>To facilitate inter-species comparability, we paired human or macaque agents without explicit task instructions. We expected that the transparency and instantaneous coaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Doorn et al., 2014</xref>) would facilitate efficient coordination in both species. Based on their cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Proto et al., 2019</xref>), propensity for fairness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peysakhovich et al., 2014</xref>), and perspective-taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Devaine et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Herrmann et al., 2007</xref>), we predicted humans to engage in pro-social turn-taking, where the reward maximization is alternated between partners. We predicted that macaques would also utilize the information about the partner’s actions, but would be less likely to grant an advantage to the other player. Instead, we expected that the monkeys would coordinate to increase individual (and joint) rewards, but without turn-taking to balance rewards between players.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Two human or macaque agents sat face-to-face and performed a task on a dyadic interaction platform using a shared transparent vertical workspace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Agents could simultaneously see the stimuli and each other’s actions. In our variant of the Bach-or-Stravinsky (BoS) paradigm (Materials and methods), each agent could choose one of two simultaneously presented color targets (red and blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The left/right position of each color was randomized across trials (50% left, 50% right). The rewards followed the payoff matrix shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and depended on the choices of both agents. Prior to the first dyadic session, each human or macaque agent in a pair was individually trained to associate one of the two color targets with a larger reward, so that the two agents preferred different colors. In the dyadic trials, selecting the same target resulted in an additional reward on top of the individually trained values - such that choosing the same target was always better than choosing different targets, for both agents individually, and as a group. But in such coordinated trials, the agent whose individually preferred (‘own’) color was selected receives a larger reward. Therefore, agents may attempt to behave selfishly/competitively in order to gain more by insisting on their own target color – which pays off as long as the partner accommodates. This paradigm probes the ability to coordinate in order to obtain higher rewards, and the capacity to deal with the unfairness introduced in each coordinated trial.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental setup.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Photos of the dyadic interaction platform showing humans and macaques reaching to targets in a shared transparent workspace.

Pairs/sessions near the y-axis hence indicate static selection of one of the two target colors (i.e. either coordinating on A’s or B’s preferred option, or only selecting their own preferred color; dark gray underlays), while pairs/sessions near the x-axis indicate static coordination on a side.

To test if macaques can actively monitor and adjust to dynamic choice behavior, we trained two monkeys in the dyadic condition with a human confederate who followed a strict pattern of alternating between the two colors in blocks of approximately 20 trials (‘confederate training’).

Both animals reached close to 0.8 DCR units, similar to the values reached by humans employing turn-taking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results indicate that macaques can take information from their partner into consideration when making decisions in the BoS paradigm. Action time dynamics suggested that the macaques started to actively monitor the confederate’s actions and only selected their non-preferred color if the partner started to reach there first.</p><p>Due to the repeating block strategy employed by the human confederate, it is not immediately clear whether the monkeys made use of the action visibility and based their decision on the action observed within a trial, or rather on the reward history. We therefore performed a control experiment in which we placed an opaque barrier on the confederate’s side of the display for roughly the middle third of a session. The barrier blocked the monkey’s view of the confederate hand, while keeping the face visible. In both monkeys, the ‘following’ behavior ceased and they reverted to selecting their own preferred colors irrespective of the confederate’s choices, who – by design – continued the block strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In line with this observation, there was a significant difference in the monkey’s action times when selecting the monkey’s preferred (blue) and the non-preferred (red) color in the transparent condition, but no difference in the opaque condition. In other words, monkeys failed to coordinate when they could not see the confederate’s actions. Note that reverting to mostly own choices in combination with a block-switching confederate resulted in a reward alternating between two and four units, clearly different from the constant reward of two units in solo trials. Hence, the experienced reward schedule and the visible presence of a confederate render the opaque condition distinct from the solo trials. These results imply that the immediate visual information about partner’s actions and not merely monitoring reward history drove and maintained the macaques’ ‘following’ behavior in transparent settings.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Confederate-trained macaque pair shows dynamic coordination</title><p>After two macaques had learned to monitor and follow a partner’s actions, we tested how these animals would perform when paired with each other again.

In several sessions (FC-1, FC-2, FC-3, and FC-6), one of the two agents became more selfishly insistent on his preferred color towards the end of the session – while the other accommodated. Interestingly, the roles reversed in different sessions: in FC-1 C is the leader, while in FC-3 and FC-6 F is the leader.

Thus, the dynamic coordination arose within a competitive interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Comparison of dynamic coordination between species</title><p>At first glance, the turn-taking in the confederate-trained macaques resembled the long turn-taking observed in some human pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Yet, the analysis of action time distributions suggests that macaques employed a competitive version of turn-taking in which the faster agent selects its own color (insists) while the slower agent follows (accommodates). Such behavior would be in line with theoretical predictions derived from our evolutionary simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Unakafov et al., 2020</xref>), showing that competitive turn-taking provides the most effective strategy for a BoS type game when players have a high probability to observe partner’s choices. To further test the hypothesis that this macaque pair developed a competitive Leader-Follower strategy, we performed a correlation analysis between the modeled visibility of the faster agent’s action by the slower agent and the observed likelihood of following to the faster agent’s color (the faster animal nearly always selected his own color). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> shows macaque agent A’s probability to select his non-preferred color, the ‘fraction of choosing other’s’ (the inverted fraction of choosing own) and the modeled probability for A to see B’s choice before A made own choice, and the same for macaque agent B (see Materials and methods for details on modeling). In both monkeys, there was a strong correlation between the model and the observation, ranging from 0.92 for smoothed data to 0.64 for unsmoothed data, all significant at p&lt;0.001. This analysis further supports the notion that the confederate-trained macaque pair had developed a competitive turn-taking (alternating Leader-Follower) strategy. Strong positive correlations between action visibility and ‘following’ behavior were present in all six post-confederate-trained sessions, indicating bouts of dynamic coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Confederate-trained macaque turn-taking is driven by action visibility.</title><p>The inset on the right shows the logistic mapping function from the action time difference to the probability to see the partner’s choice before acting.

Even in the pair with the strongest positive correlations (pair 12, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), the ‘following’ behavior was weak and resulted from a gradual transition from B initially following A (to both colors) to A following B (predominately to B’s color) later in the session, rather than from alternating competitive turn-taking. The lack of such a correlation does not mean that action times and action visibility played no role in human choices. Indeed, in 47% (9 of 19) of human pairs, the absolute difference in action times between the agents significantly differed in coordinated trials compared to uncoordinated trials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Furthermore, turn-taking dyads had a larger absolute action time difference (102.7 ± 38.7 ms, N 10) than non-turn-taking dyads (61.3 ± 21.6 ms, N 9; t-test correcting for unequal variance t(14.4) 2.918; p=0.011); this difference was mostly driven by the coordinated trials (105.0 ± 41.5 ms, N 10 versus 64.7±24.1 ms, N 7; t(14.7) 2.523; p=0.024), while a similar trend in trials without coordination did not reach significance (93.8 ± 29.2 ms, N 10 versus 69.5 ± 39.7 ms, N 9; t(14.6) 1.512; p=0.152). This implies that turn-takers tended to pay more attention to partner’s actions and wait more for each other during the coordination. Hence, similarly to macaques, seeing the faster agent’s choice can help the slower agent to coordinate. But unlike the confederate-trained macaque pair, dynamic human coordination was not driven by the faster agents striving to select only the own preferred color (except human pair 12 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>): for instance, in the turn-taking pairs 3 and 17, the faster agent B led both to own and A’s preferred colors, while A followed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>The action time analyses show that for the confederate-trained macaques, the visibility of the other’s action before making one’s own decision correlated with the probability to follow the choice of the other, with the faster monkey ‘selfishly’ selecting its own preference. Turn-taking in humans, however, did not rely on temporal competition. To highlight this difference further, we asked how the two species maintained the coordination. Macaques transitioned between periods of coordination using short periods of non-coordination, while turn-taking humans tended to switch seamlessly between the two coordination options without verbal communication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

All macaque pairs were below the unity diagonal, indicating a selfish preference for own color. In the confederate-trained macaques, the coordination epochs were separated by epochs of non-coordination that looked like each agent ‘challenged’ the other to accommodate. Indeed, during challenge initiations and resolutions, the faster macaques tended to act selfishly, while turn-taking humans showed balanced switching behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). The analysis of action times in confederate-trained macaques showed that the faster agent slowed down and the slower agent sped up when transiting to non-coordination, and conversely, the insisting agent sped up to initiate the coordination on the own color and the accommodating agent slowed down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In sum, there were no indications of competitive turn-taking in humans, as the faster agents showed a balanced selection of both coordination options.

This means that such an agent initiated switches to and from the own color; while being able to see the faster agent’s action likely helped the slower agent to maintain coordination and to accomplish seamless switches. In contrast, the confederate-trained macaques showed no seamless switches, but displayed temporal competition in which the faster agent led to his own color.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We studied macaque and human pairs in a coordination game, which offered higher rewards for selecting the same option but entailed an inherent conflict about which of the two coordinated options to select. Both species largely converged on coordinated behavior but in a markedly different fashion. Half of the human pairs achieved nearly optimal coordination and fair (cooperative) turn-taking that equalized the rewards of the two partners, without explicit communication. Macaques, instead, exploited simpler strategies that maximized reward without the need to track the actions of the partner in real-time. That is, they used static instead of dynamic coordination. After two macaques were trained to observe and attend to the partner’s choice with a human confederate, their behavior shifted to competitive turn-taking. In post-confederate-training sessions, the choice behavior was strongly correlated with trial-by-trial differences in the reach action times: the faster monkey chose his preferred option and the slower one followed. Our results show that both humans and macaques make use of action visibility by taking information about the other’s action into account before making their own decisions. There was, however, a fundamental difference: when coordinating dynamically, monkeys showed competitive turn-taking while in humans the faster agent often ‘offered’ switching to the partner’s preferred option, exhibiting a form of benevolent and fair turn-taking.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Coordination in humans and macaques</title><p>Ten of the 19 human pairs converged on dynamic coordination that balanced the reward, developing fair, cooperative turn-taking, while another five pairs coordinated on the same fixed color throughout the session.

The observed turn-taking frequency was close to other variants of BoS games with explicit instructions of the payoff matrix, where approximately 50–60% of human subjects developed turn-taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arifovic and Ledyard, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ioannou and Romero, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Melis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sonsino and Sirota, 2003</xref>).</p><p>What sets the turn-takers apart from the dyads that coordinated on a fixed color, or did not coordinate well? Based on their debriefing responses, turn-takers displayed a much better understanding of the implicit reward rules such as the value of coordination and unfairness. The non-turn-taker group was more diverse: some subjects did not understand the game or only understood some aspects; other subjects had a better understanding but were selecting selfishly or could only follow the partner. Furthermore, the turn-taking dyads utilized action visibility driven by action time differences more extensively, although some non-turn-taking dyads overall also exploited action visibility to coordinate on a fixed color.</p><p>In contrast to humans, macaque pairs converged on simpler strategies, either selecting the same color (56%) or selecting the same side (44%). These two strategies require less cognitive resources and trial-by-trial coordination effort than turn-taking, because they allow each agent to make decisions without paying attention to the trial-specific actions of the partner. Although we found that all macaque pairs that exhibited a significant difference in action times between the agents (8 of 9 pairs) converged on the faster agent’s preferred choice, it seems that initially, macaques did not rely on trial-by-trial action visibility. This is suggested by the fact that it required relatively long training before macaques started to follow a human confederate dynamically. Instead, we speculate that slower macaques adapted to their partner’s static choice by maximizing their reward over the remaining options.</p><p>However, all but one animal coordinated both via fixed color or fixed side selection depending on the specific partner, and no animal persisted on the own color with all tested partners. For instance, monkey F insisted on his preferred color when playing with monkey C, accommodated to the other’s color when playing with monkey T, and converged on his right side when playing with monkey M (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This result indicates that macaques took the partner’s actions and reward outcomes into account, albeit not necessarily in a strict trial-by-trial or within-trial fashion, resembling the formation of stable color selection conventions in Guinea baboons in a simple sequential coordination task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Formaux et al., 2022</xref>). For instance, after a few sessions of selecting mainly own color, one agent changed either to selecting their non-preferred color (increasing his reward to 3 and the other’s to 4 drops) or to selecting one side (increasing his reward to an average of 2.5 and the other’s to 3 drops). If the other monkey also started favoring the same side, this increased both agents’ reward to 3.5. This sequence of steps illustrates how macaque pairs can develop their strategy over the course of several sessions.</p><p>While our study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first implementation of a BoS paradigm in macaques, other 2×2 games have been investigated in several primate species (humans, chimpanzees, macaques, and capuchins). So far, the data suggest that monkeys, unlike humans, do not spontaneously adopt turn-taking, despite coordinated reciprocity being a successful evolutionary strategy in simulated non-communicating agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colman and Browning, 2009</xref>). For instance, in the anti-coordination Conflict game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brosnan et al., 2017</xref>), capuchins and macaques converged on only one of the two possible asymmetric equilibria, much like 4 of our 9 macaque pairs (while many human pairs balanced payoffs by alternating between the two equilibria). One can argue that turn-taking is not expected in macaques, since it has been suggested that even apes don’t exhibit it. In an exceptionally stringent variant of a BoS-type game, in which coordinated rope pulls were required to deliver a reward only to one of the two agents (payoff matrix zero except 0/1 or 1/0 at the coordinated diagonal), chimpanzees, unlike human children aged 5, did not converge on trial-by-trial alternation/turn-taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Melis et al., 2016</xref>). This difference was interpreted as a species difference in the strategic capability to maintain longer-term cooperation (e.g. by motivating the other to reciprocate). Nevertheless, apes cooperated in 64% of trials, and in the examples of ape dyad data, one can see some switching between the agents’ choices, albeit not trial-by-trial but in longer blocks. Given that even humans often balance the fairness over longer time frames, as we observed in several human dyads (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), it was important to test if also macaques might exhibit a similar block-wise turn-taking under conditions of more trials than ape experiments and less conflict (i.e. when both agents get increased reward for coordination).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Action visibility and dynamic coordination</title><p>The lack of spontaneous dynamic coordination such as turn-taking in naïve macaques in our experiment cannot be attributed to their inability to infer the upcoming choices of the partner, because they could observe the partner’s actions through the transparent display. Especially for nonhuman species, coordinating based on mutual choice history might be more demanding than coordinating using the immediately observable behavior of others. Coordination (or anti-coordination) typically is improved with increasing information about the other’s choice by shifting from the strictly simultaneous to the sequential mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brocas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rapoport, 1997</xref>). The transparent game approach we adopted here differs from those two classical modes in that each subject can decide independently when to act (within a certain time window). Under such conditions, the coordination in chimpanzees is facilitated if one of the agents consistently acts faster than the partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bullinger et al., 2011</xref>). Compared to an opaque simultaneous setting, visual feedback about the partner’s choices improved macaques’ and capuchins’ coordination in a transparent (called asynchronous) versions of a Stag Hunt game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brosnan et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, there were substantial differences in capuchins’ and rhesus’ behavior in the Conflict/Chicken game when they had access to the current choice of a partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brosnan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ong et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In the studies of Brosnan and colleagues, subjects looked at the same split monitor while sitting next to each other, and could observe each other’s decisions as cursor movements. In our setup, agents sat opposite to each other and saw actual eye, head and hand movements, combining face-to-face and action visibility. In humans, face-to-face visibility in a simultaneous iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (iPD) and in the Ultimatum game significantly improves mutual cooperation, even without action visibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jahng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). These findings support the idea that non-verbal social signals and, more generally, the observable presence of others influence decision-making. The ongoing action visibility per se also had a profound effect on mutual cooperation in iPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Friedman and Oprea, 2012</xref>) and in a web interface-based anti-coordination game conceptually similar to BoS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hawkins and Goldstone, 2016</xref>). In a competitive reaching task, a face-to-face transparency allowed human subjects to glean useful information from observing the relevant hand effector and from seeing the face and the full body of an opponent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vaziri-Pashkam et al., 2017</xref>). In our study, action visibility facilitated sensorimotor coordination, as demonstrated by action time differences in transparent vs. opaque conditions, convergence to a faster agent’s preference during static coordination, a tight relationship between action visibility and choice behavior in turn-taking macaques, and inter-agent action time differences in coordinated vs. non-coordinated trials. Seeing actual movements rather than relying on abstract representations of others such as cursor motions might be especially crucial in nonhuman experiments. But beyond immediate sensorimotor aspects, acting face-to-face on the same targets in close proximity likely influenced social cognition on a more general level.</p><p>The importance of action visibility is also supported by computational modeling. In the continuous-time cooperation games such as iPD and Stag Hunt where agents could observe and respond to each other’s actions in real-time, cooperation by coaction is more easily obtained and stabilized against exploitation than the cooperation that relies on delayed reciprocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Doorn et al., 2014</xref>). For the iPD and BoS transparent games, we showed that different coordination strategies are preferable for different probabilities of seeing partner’s choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Unakafov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Unakafov et al., 2019</xref>). When these probabilities are low (or when agents do not utilize the action visibility), simple strategies like ‘win-stay, lose-shift’ are most effective. For higher probabilities of seeing partner’s choice more complex strategies emerge, such as coordinated turn-taking and temporal Leader-Follower, where the faster agent determines the choice of the slower agent. For the selfish agents, this means that the faster one insists on its individually-preferred own target and the slower accommodates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Unakafov et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Given that many human pairs exhibited spontaneous dynamic coordination, while naïve macaques did not, we can ask if and how these two species utilized the action visibility. Both species exploited action visibility to achieve and/or maintain the turn-taking, emphasizing the importance of the ‘transparency’ of interactive behavior as an important determinant of emerging strategies. Humans relied on action visibility for seamless switches from one color to another, and for maintaining coordination within a block of trials. But besides one pair, there was no indication that humans employed the competitive variant of a Leader-Follower strategy. Instead, faster agents were as likely to switch from their own to the other’s preferred color, indicating benevolent turn-taking. These results add to the body of literature indicating that humans in a social setting might base their decisions not only on pure reward maximization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clavien and Chapuisat, 2016</xref>). Such normative behavior can also reflect prospective planning to avoid conflict and maintain stable individually-beneficial cooperation in subsequent trials.</p><p>Very different dynamics transpired in additional experiments with macaques. Pairing them with a human confederate who consistently alternated between colors in short blocks but did not intentionally provide any additional social cues demonstrated that macaques are capable of closely follow partner’s actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nougaret et al., 2019</xref>), and adopt the imposed ‘turn-taking’ to maximize their reward. Moreover, temporarily blocking the view of the confederate’s hand abruptly changed macaque behavior, disrupting the coordination. The macaques’ coordination was thus driven by action visibility and not by strategies like ‘win-stay, lose-shift’ or trial counting. In line with the Leader-Follower strategy, macaques were faster than the confederate when selecting own color, but waited for the confederate when selecting the confederate’s color. Intriguingly, pairing the two macaques that completed the training with a human confederate resulted in behavior different from both naïve macaque behavior and from the ‘following behavior’ with the confederate. These macaques established competitive dynamics, with the faster agent selecting his preferred color and the slower agent following, as predicted by our evolutionary simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Unakafov et al., 2020</xref>). Such competition resulted in either sustained coordination on one fixed color or in turn-taking. Comparing the temporal signatures of the action time differences in trials around a switch to or from coordinating on a specific color further indicated that macaque turn-taking was competitive and dynamic in nature. The break of coordination was triggered by the faster agent slowing down and the slower one speeding up and selecting his preferred color; conversely, the transition to coordination was associated with the speeding up agent selecting his preferred color and the slowing down agent accommodating.</p><p>Notably, we considered the interactions in the pairs where one monkey underwent the confederate training, and other did not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In all four instances, static strategies prevailed, suggesting that turn-taking as a joint strategy behavior requires active participation of both agents. We note, however, that in all three cases of fixed color strategy, the confederate-trained monkeys accommodated the selfish choice of their partners, perhaps because they had learned to monitor and follow partner’s actions.</p><p>Species differences in general cooperative behavior may explain both the reluctance of naïve macaques to coordinate dynamically, as well as the competitive nature of dynamic interactions when they occur. The transparent BoS game requires the agents to cooperate in close proximity in the pursuit of an immediate reward, which necessitates some degree of social tolerance by both partners. If we take natural food-sharing behavior as a proxy for social tolerance, it is not equally prevalent among primate species. Humans, apes, some baboon species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goffe and Fischer, 2016</xref>), and some New World monkey species including capuchins share food between adults, while rhesus macaques do not even share food with their offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jaeggi and Gurven, 2013</xref>). In line with these patterns, mutually beneficial alternating task performance and turn-taking have been observed in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brosnan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grueneisen and Tomasello, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Helbing et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rapoport et al., 1976</xref>), apes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Waal, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martin et al., 2017</xref>), and capuchins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parrish et al., 2015</xref>), but not in more despotic, less tolerant rhesus macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Joly et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Beyond social attitudes, the lack of the cooperative turn-taking in nonhuman primates might reflect cognitive limitations in long-term planning and perspective-taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stevens and Hauser, 2004</xref>). In humans, performance/level of coordination in BoS and other iterative games was shown to depend to a larger degree on intelligence (to form good strategies) than on personality or social predispositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Proto et al., 2019</xref>). While the action transparency decreases the reliance of coordination on mental representations, the differences between strategies in macaques compared to humans might still be driven by more limited cognitive capacities.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>There are several limitations in our study that have to be considered and possibly addressed in future experiments. First, we only tested six macaques (and nine pairs), all males, and only 1 pair was housed together (others were from neighboring but separate enclosures). Therefore, we cannot say much about the influence of social rank. Anecdotally, however, it did not seem that the more dominant agent always prevailed. For instance, one animal (monkey T), the smallest and likely to be subordinate to all other partners, successfully ‘insisted’ on his own color in two out of three cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Massen et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, we only tested two confederate-trained macaques so far. While the results are exciting and show that macaques can engage in dynamic competitive turn-taking, future experiments will need to test how generalizable this pattern is.</p><p>Second, due to the task target color/side randomization, selecting targets on the same side of the display resulted in low effort, efficient and fair coordination. We cannot say if fairness was a contributing factor in convergence of the four macaque pairs to this strategy, although we deem it highly unlikely. A new experiment where the probability of a specific color to appear on the same side is parametrically modulated is needed to evaluate the conditions under which this strategy emerges (or what level of unfairness is accepted). Furthermore, we prompted the human participants to pay attention to the partner’s choices, to facilitate the emergence of coordination within a single session. It would be interesting to test human pairs in several sessions and without any instructions, similar to macaques, to see if humans might also converge on the fixed side strategy as means of fair and seamless coordination. It requires preventing the human participants from any verbal contact after and between the sessions, however.</p><p>Third, it would be important to vary the ratio and the range of reward magnitude (‘stakes’), as it has been shown that stakes may strongly affect the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schultz, 2015</xref>) and social (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hawkins and Goldstone, 2016</xref>) decisions. Inherently, the nature of reward differed between the species: humans received monetary compensation while macaques worked for a liquid reward. Note, however, that in each session macaques were offered an opportunity to work and obtain more liquid in a solo regime after the dyadic experiment (Materials and methods), so the participation in a dyadic interaction was not forced, and the end of the dyadic sessions was not associated with a fully waning motivation. We also did not observe that variations in satiation level in the course of each session played a substantial role in shaping macaque strategies. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge differences between primary and secondary rewards, and potential divergence in the underlying motivations and learning, beyond the species differences in socialization and cognitive capacities considered above.</p><p>Finally, it would be very interesting to relate diverse in-game behavioral strategies observed in the human pairs to individual differences in cognitive and socio-economic personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rollwage et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhao and Smillie, 2015</xref>), and link them to stable behavioral phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peysakhovich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poncela-Casasnovas et al., 2016</xref>). This, however, will require a much larger sample and personality-oriented study design.</p><p>In summary, we show that both, humans and nonhuman primates, dynamically coordinate in real-time transparent interactions, but macaques compete while humans strive for fairness by prosocial turn-taking. Enabling action visibility with our transparent setup provides novel comparative insights into social decision processes as they unfold in real-time during transparent interactions, and offers a new route to behavioral and neural investigations of dynamic decision-making in cooperative and competitive contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferrari-Toniolo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Isoda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yoo et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Humans</title><p>38 right-handed subjects (23 females, mean age: 26.1 ± 4.1 SD, range 20–41 years) participated in the study as paid volunteers.

Joint dyadic tasks have been previously implemented in a side-by-side or 90° angle setting with a shared or separate workspaces for each subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brosnan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dal Monte et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Falcone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferrari-Toniolo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fujii et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haroush and Williams, 2015</xref>), using back-to-back nontransparent monitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jahng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tang et al., 2016</xref>), or in a table-like setting with opposing subjects acting in a horizontal workspace that is not in the line of sight between the subjects’ faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Báez-Mendoza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yoshida et al., 2011</xref>). Only a few studies utilized transparent face-to-face arrangement of the subjects, using a video projector and two semitransparent mirrors virtually placing the stimuli into the shared plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballesta and Duhamel, 2015</xref>), or incorporating physical targets into transparent Plexiglas screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vaziri-Pashkam et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, with our design, we aimed for maximal availability of mutual social signaling in a face-to-face setting, a shared vertical workspace with computer-controlled stimuli in the direct line of sight, without risk of injuries due to physical contact, and suitability across species. We achieved this using a novel transparent display (1920 × 1080 pixels, 121 × 68 cm, 60 Hz, EYE-TOLED-5500, Eyevis, Reutlingen, Germany), amended for dual-side touch sensitivity (PQLabs, G5S, Freemont, CA, USA) with a custom-built ‘sandwich’ construction. Sitting on either side of the display, subjects saw each other and the same stimuli. Two proximity sensors (Carlo Gavazzi CA18-CA30CAF16NA, Lainate, Italy) per subject for the left and right hand, respectively, mounted below the display (‘home’ buttons) and the two touch panels mounted on either side of the display registered hand positions of both agents, at 240 Hz temporal resolution. Experimental control and stimulus presentation were implemented using the EventIDE software package (Okazolab, Delft, The Netherlands). Liquid reward for monkeys was delivered via computer-controlled peristaltic fluid pumps, for every correctly performed trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Dyadic decision-making task</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Bach-or-Stravinsky game</title><p>Since we are interested in the effect of mutual action visibility on coordination behavior, we implemented a transparent version of a Bach-or-Stravinsky (BoS) game, in which each player’s time-continuous visuomotor behavior can be seen by the other player. Conceptually, in the BoS game two agents are choosing between going to Bach or Stravinsky concerts. Agent A prefers Bach, agent B prefers Stravinsky; yet, both prefer going to the concert together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Osborne and Rubinstein, 1994</xref>). Thus, agents wish to coordinate their behavior but have conflicting interests. This is a classic 2×2 non-zero-sum game (also known as the Battle of the Sexes) with two pure strategy Nash equilibria (Bach-Bach, or Stravinsky-Stravinsky), and one less efficient mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, where the agents go to their preferred event more often than the other, but the reward per player is below the reward of even the less rewarded player in the two pure Nash equilibria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kilgour and Fraser, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rapoport, 1967</xref>).</p><p>In our implementation, the agents were choosing between two options represented by two differently colored targets placed on the left and the right side of the display. Each target color was associated with a higher reward for one of the agents resulting in individually preferred targets. This reward schedule, 2 reward units for one color and 1 unit for the other color, was trained in ‘solo’ trials to establish an ‘own’ color preference in each subject. In dyadic trials, an agent selecting own preferred target was assured to get at least 2 reward units, while selecting the other’s target (individually non-preferred target) yielded at least 1 unit. Additionally, when both agents selected the same target, a bonus of 2 reward units was added to the payoff of each agent. Thus, the maximum average joint reward (3.5 units) was obtained on coordinated trials when one agent selected own preferred color (getting 4 units) while the other agent chose non-preferred color (getting 3 units). Note that on any given coordinated trial, i.e., when agents selected the same target, this payoff matrix resulted in an unequal (i.e., unfair) reward distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Hence, the BoS paradigm probes both the ability to realize that coordinated target selection results in higher rewards than uncoordinated target selection, as well as the ability to perceive and counteract the unfairness/conflict situation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>The task mechanics</title><p>On every trial, each subject chose between the individually-preferred and non-preferred target on the touchscreen. Targets were light blue circles of 35 mm diameter with either a red (individually-preferred target for agent A) or a yellow (individually-preferred target for agent B) rings (for better visualization, we replaced yellow and red rings with blue and red solid targets in the figures and the text).</p><p>Subjects had to place both hands on the two home buttons for 500 ms to start a trial after the inter-trial interval (ITI). This allowed us to control which effector (acting hand) was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Then an initial fixation target without a colored ring appeared on the display (10 cm below eye level). Subjects had 1500 ms to touch this initial fixation target with the instructed hand. After both subjects touched the fixation target they had to hold it for 500 ms. Then two choice targets appeared at 1 of 3 different pairs of positions (140 mm to the left and right of the central fixation target and either at the same height as the central fixation target or 35 mm below or 35 mm above it). We randomized the ‘red’ location equally over all six positions, balanced in sets of 18 trials with each of the six ‘red’ positions appearing three times, and vertically mirrored the opposite location. Simultaneously with targets’ appearance the initial fixation target disappeared, serving as a go signal. Subjects had 1500 ms to make their choice and touch one of the targets. After both subjects acquired their chosen target, selected target(s) brightened, and subjects needed to hold the hand on the target for another 500 ms. At that point, the choices were evaluated and rewards were dispensed according to the payoff matrix. The amount of reward earned by each subject was signaled by two sequential series of auditory pulses (always first for the subject on side B then on side A), with a different pitch for each subject. Each pulse was constructed as a harmonic series with 12 overtones and a fundamental frequency of 443 Hz for side A and 733 Hz for side B to provide distinct sounds for each agent. For the monkeys, we delivered liquid as a reward (approximately 0.14 ml per pulse) concurrently with the auditory pulses directed towards the respective monkey’s side; humans were instructed to expect ‘a few’ cents per pulse, and the accumulated earnings were paid out as a lump sum after the experiment. After the reward period, subjects had to wait for an inter-trial interval of 1500 ms before they could initiate the next trial.</p><p>The side of the targets was randomized on each trial, i.e., in ~50% the red target was on the right, the blue on the left, and vice versa.

All but one subject who was trained on 100 solo trials and converged to &gt;75% own color selection did so already in the trials 26–50. Subjects were positioned ~50 cm from the display with the height of the chairs adjusted such that both subjects’ eyes were ~121 cm above the ground. Subjects were instructed to use the right hand. After the solo training, both subjects entered the setup for the main dyadic task which lasted for 300 or 400 trials. Subjects were not informed about the number of trials in a session. Each session lasted approximately 1.5 hr. After the experiment, we conducted an individual debriefing (see Appendix 1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) and paid the earned reward separately to each subject (10.5–26 Euro, mean 19 Euro, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Macaque procedure</title><p>Macaques were brought to the set up in their individual primate chairs. The chairs were positioned such that the eyes were 30 cm from the display. The monkeys had previously been trained to perform the basic task structure (hands on proximity sensors, reach to the initial fixation target with the instructed hand, and select one of the presented choice targets by reaching to it). Dyads containing monkeys (monkey-monkey, and monkey-human confederate) were instructed to use the left hand. The animals performed the solo version of the task with differential rewards to develop a preference for one of the color targets and were only paired with a conspecific after selecting a higher rewarded target in ≥75% of the trials. Thereafter, pairs of macaques worked together in the dyadic version of the task, for 11 ± 7 sessions (range 4–25). After the dyadic task, we offered monkeys the opportunity to obtain additional liquid in the solo version of the task for as long as they continued to work (mean 169 trials, median 73, range 0–1163), essentially making participation in the dyadic trials optional.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>We computed the following six <italic>aggregate measures of choice behavior and coordination,</italic> explained below: fraction of choosing own color, fraction of choosing (objective) left side, mutual information for color choice, mutual information for side choice, average reward, and DCR. Unless noted otherwise, we report these measures for the last 200 trials of each session in order to assess the ‘steady-state’ behavior after allowing for an initial period of exploration.</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Fraction of choosing own/left</title><p>The FCO (fraction of choosing own) is the fraction of trials (within a certain window) where an agent has selected the individually preferred color (red for agent A and blue for agent B). Similarly, the FCL (fraction of choosing left) is a fraction of trials where an agent has selected the target on the ‘objective’ left side of the display (which is the left side for agent A and right side for agent B). Fractions range from 0 to 1. For figures showing FCO/FCL over the course of a session, we also calculated both measures for the session as a whole, and in running windows of <italic>w</italic>=8 trials. In the latter case, FCO and FCL can take the values of 0, 1/8, 2/8, …, 1. For instance, FCO = 0 means that an agent has selected individually non-preferred target for eight trials in a row.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Mutual information</title><p>Mutual information (MI) represents the reduction of uncertainty regarding the values of one time series provided by knowing the values of the other time series. Here, we consider mutual information for the color of the target (MI color) and side (MI side) choices of the two agents, showing how much information the target/side choices of one agent provide about the respective choices of the other. Mutual information is measured in bits. Since both target and side choices are binary (in each trial an agent selects either the preferred or non-preferred target and either the left or right side), both MI color and MI side range from 0 bit (the choices of one agent provide no information about the choices of the other) to 1 bit (the choices of one agent can be inferred precisely from the choices of the other agent).</p><p>For instance, if both agents select the objective left target in every odd trial and the objective right target in every even trial, both MI color = MI side = 1, since for every trial the target and the side selected by one agent entirely describe the target/side selected by the other. At the same time, the choices of each agent individually are highly uncertain: both sides and both targets are selected with the same probability of 0.5. If both agents constantly select the objective left side, this would result in MI color = 1 due to side-randomization of target color, but MI side = 0, since there is no uncertainty regarding the side selection and thus no additional knowledge about the other’s choice can reduce the uncertainty.</p><p>Formally, mutual information of time series <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> is given by,<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munder><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> is the probability of the value <italic>x</italic> in time series <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> is the probability of the value <italic>y</italic> in time series <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> is the joint probability to simultaneously have values x and y in time series <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic>, respectively, and <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> can be either 0 or 1, so that the sum is over all four combinations.

Note that the reward of an individual agent can be in the range of 1–4 units, while the joint reward of a pair ([reward A+reward B]/2) cannot exceed 3.5 (since when one agent gets payoff of four, the other agent gets three). The average reward for completely random independent choices of two agents with 50% probability for either target is 2.5 (but note that an achieved reward of 2.5 is not a positive proof of independent choices).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-4"><title>Dynamic coordination reward (DCR)</title><p>DCR is the surplus reward of the two agents compared to the reward they would get by playing randomly. By <italic>playing randomly</italic> we mean that the choices of the agents in each round are independent of the history and of the current choices of the partner. The ‘random reward’ is computed by selecting the two color targets with the same probabilities as actually observed in the two agents, but randomly permuting the choices over trials. For our payoff matrix, the range of DCR is [–1,1], with –1 corresponding to very inefficient playing (alternating selection of the two anti-coordination options), while 1 corresponds to very efficient playing with explicit coordination (for instance, turn-taking). DCR is hence a measure of dynamic (reciprocal) coordination.

time at which the trajectory of each subject’s reach movement should be evident for the other agent. Typical movement time values (mean ± SD across trials) in our experiment ranged from 314 ±104 ms for humans, 171 ± 77 ms for macaques, and 180 ± 64 ms for the confederate-trained macaque pair.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-6"><title>Action time difference analysis</title><p>To compare action times (AT) between agents we performed three tests. First, we compared the action times over all trials between both agents of a pair to assess stable differences that might indicate temporal leader-follower relations. Second, we compared per-trial difference in action times of the two agents (AT A – AT B) between coordinated trials on A’s preferred color and coordinated trials on B’s preferred color. Third, we compared the absolute per-trial difference in action times of the two agents between coordinated and uncoordinated trials. The absolute per-trial difference is equivalent to subtracting for each individual trial the action time of the faster agent (in this trial) from the action time of the slower partner. All comparisons used a two-sample t-test using Satterthwaite’s approximation to allow for unequal variance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-7"><title>Estimated probability to see partner’s choice</title><p>When an agent is acting slower than the partner, there is a chance for this agent to see the partner’s choice and use this information to make the own choice. We therefore modeled the probability to see the partner’s choice as a logistic function of the difference of the agents' action times, in each trial.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Steve W C Chang (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Full comments by each of the reviewers are appended to this summary for your reference.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Some human pairs (about half) did not employ a turn-taking strategy. The authors should discuss potential reasons for these differences, for instance, whether some subjects were not as socially engaged or were less flexible when choosing different options. It would be most helpful if the authors are able to perform additional data analyses to characterize the differences between the two groups of humans (social attentional differences, reaction time differences, etc.) to examine why the turn-taking and non-turn-taking pairs differed.</p><p>2. The authors should further consider the degree to which maximizing one's own rewards could drive different strategies in the monkeys. Although cooperating maximized the group's rewards, it wasn't clear whether one monkey could do even better by behaving competitively.</p><p>3. It was felt that the manuscript would benefit from including additional information on the monkeys' interactions with the human confederate. Specifically, how did their behavior differ with humans compared to other monkeys, how long do effects of training last, and would the behavior of a trained monkey be expected to translate to an untrained monkey?</p><p>4. A notable limitation of the study's ability to compare across species is that the rewards given to the monkeys and humans differed qualitatively (primary vs. secondary rewards). Although this is touched on in the discussion, it was felt that further consideration is warranted. For instance, to what extent might motivation to obtain each outcome drive the tendency to be 'selfish' versus cooperative? Is there any evidence that monkeys would adopt different strategies if they were more sated?</p><p>5. Can the authors more precisely consider the role of action visibility? Specifically, whether visibility influences social cognition or aides sensorimotor coordination.</p><p>6. Finally, can the authors provide further discussion of the effects of learning and socialization on this task across species?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It would be helpful to know more about how the goal of maximizing reward might impact the behaviors described here. To start, how does turn-taking compare with the simpler strategies used by the monkeys in terms of reward received? Figure 2C seems to show that the average reward earned by two subjects was actually quite similar between monkeys and humans. The highest-earning human pairs (presumably those who were turn-taking) might have earned slightly more than the monkeys, but there doesn't appear to be a big advantage to turn-taking, in terms of simple reward maximization. Is this true, and if so, is it possible to interpret their behavior as arising from other advantages (e.g., placing value on a partner's reward specifically vs. perceived equity)? What about rewards received by each individual and not the average across pairs? If an agent only values rewards received by themself, is there a more or less optimal approach to this task?</p><p>2. Related to the above, it is notable that rewards given to the monkeys and humans differed qualitatively, as did their motivation to pursue them. The humans were receiving small amounts of money in a fairly abstract arrangement in which money was obtained at the end of the session, whereas the monkeys were thirsty and received fluid rewards continuously depending on trial outcomes. To what extent is the motivation to be 'selfish' versus cooperative driven by the motivation to obtain each outcome? For instance, if monkeys were not water deprived, would they be more likely to cooperate rather than compete? Is there any evidence that motivation to get the juice reward changed toward the end of the session?</p><p>3. Are there action time plots similar to those shown for the monkeys for the human pairs? Although Figure 6B is compelling, if I understand it correctly, it just shows that the humans' choices can't be predicted based on who responded first. But it's hard to understand, then, how this type of coordination would emerge if one participant didn't watch and follow the other. The results in 6B could occur if the person who responds faster also drives the shifts to the other's target from time to time, as suggested in Figure 7. Therefore, is it possible that there is a leader and follower in the human pairs (perhaps these roles switch off), but the leader just doesn't choose their own color reliably?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript is nicely organized and very thorough. However, it could be improved even further if some points can be discussed in more detail or with additional data analyses.</p><p>1. Related to Figure 2D: the authors mentioned that some human pairs (about half) were not employing the turn-taking strategy. From this figure, these pairs were actually not a small number (9 out of 19). The authors should discuss what might be the reason behind this. Is it possible that these subjects were not very socially engaged (i.e., not paying attention to others) or were less flexible when choosing different options (even in non-social situations)? It will be better if the authors could perform additional data analyses to characterize the differences between the two groups of humans (social attentional differences, reaction time differences, etc) to examine why they were different from the turn-taking pairs and more similar to the monkey pairs.</p><p>2. Related to Figure 5: It is still a little puzzling that monkeys' behaviors can be improved after being trained with humans. What was the reason for this change? Did the human subjects provide extra social cues to the monkeys in order to encourage them to pay more attention, or did the monkeys learn turn-taking simply from the diverse choice patterns of the human subjects? The authors need to have further discussion about this point.</p><p>3. It is not very clear whether the action visibility is influencing social cognition or simply aiding sensorimotor coordination. The authors should discuss this further in Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81641.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

It would be most helpful if the authors are able to perform additional data analyses to characterize the differences between the two groups of humans (social attentional differences, reaction time differences, etc.) to examine why the turn-taking and non-turn-taking pairs differed.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is related to the questions raised by Reviewer 1, Recommendations to the authors Comment 3 [R1, C3] and Reviewer 2, Recommendations to the authors Comment 1 [R2, C1].</p><p>We thank the Reviewers for bringing up this question. First, we performed additional analysis of action times as well as absolute action time differences between the two agents – i.e. mean(|ATA – ATB|) – to compare the two groups: turn-takers and non turn-takers. There was no significant difference in mean action times (t-test correcting for unequal variance: turn-takers mean (M, in ms) 577.3 SD 80.7 N 20; non turn-takers M 536.1 SD 62.9 N 18; t(35.3) 1.766; p 0.086). Therefore, both groups appear to have a similar engagement in the task. However, when comparing means of the absolute trial-by-trial action time differences between the two agents, turn-taking dyads had a larger difference than non turn-taking dyads. We added this information to Results (lines 416-422) and the revised Table S1 (Supplementary file 1) (columns 11-17):</p><p>“Furthermore, turn-taking dyads had a larger absolute action time difference (102.7 ± 38.7 ms, N 10) than non turn-taking dyads (61.3 ± 21.6 ms, N 9; t-test correcting for unequal variance t(14.4) 2.918; p = 0.011); this difference was mostly driven by the coordinated trials (105.0 ± 41.5, N 10 vs. 64.7 ± 24.1, N 7; t(14.7) 2.523; p = 0.024), while a similar trend in trials without coordination did not reach significance (93.8 ± 29.2, N 10 vs. 69.5 ± 39.7, N 9; t(14.6) 1.512; p = 0.152). This implies that turn-takers tended to pay more attention to partner’s actions and wait more for each other during the coordination.”</p><p>We emphasize however that the leader-follower dynamics also transpired in non-turn-taking dyads and in macaques statically coordinating on a fixed color or side. We now address this in lines 254-263:</p><p>“We next asked whether a difference in action times between the two agents in a pair influenced the coordination by affecting visibility of each other’s actions. Remarkably, all 5 macaque pairs coordinating on the fixed color converged on the faster monkey’s preferred color (Table S2, Supplementary file 2). Likewise, for the static side coordination, all 3 (out of 4) pairs where there was a significant difference in action times between the two agents converged on the faster monkey’s less effortful side closer to the acting arm (Table S2, Supplementary file 2). In humans, such static Leader-Follower relationship also transpired in non-turn-taking dyads coordinating on the fixed color (Table S1, Supplementary file 1), where the faster agent led to own color and the slower agent followed (e.g. pairs 10 and 14), or the faster agent led to the partner’s color and the partner followed (e.g. pair 18). This implies that the static coordination in macaques and some human dyads was shaped by the faster agent’s preferences.”</p><p>If the mutual action visibility serves as means of coordination, one may expect that the action time differences should be larger when coordination took place. Therefore, we also directly compared absolute AT differences between the two agents in coordinated vs non-coordinated trials (revised Table S1, Supplementary file 1, columns 18-26). Six of 10 turn-taker dyads showed a significant difference between coordinated and uncoordinated trials, as well as 3 of 9 non turn-taker dyads (the difference in ratios was not significant, Fisher’s exact test, p 0.3698). In 4 turn-taking dyads but also in 2 non turn-taking dyads the difference was larger for coordinated trials, further suggesting leader-follower dynamics that was not limited to turn-takers.</p><p>Since our human subjects, like macaques, learned the payoff contingencies while playing the game, we asked several debriefing questions after the experiment (see Supplemental Information). We extracted from these free form reports whether subjects explicitly understood that coordination on “same” targets was beneficial and whether they also realized that the two coordination options were more favorable for one or another player. We now discuss these additional insights in lines 145-148:</p><p>“Based on the debriefing responses (Supplementary Information), most subjects from the turn-taking dyads (17/20, 85%) realized the coordination benefit, as compared to only half of non turn-takers (9/18, 50%; Fisher’s exact test p=0.035). In addition, 14 of 20 turn-takers (70%) understood the payoff structure, compared to only 1 of 18 non turn-takers (6%; Fisher’s exact test p=0.00005).”</p><p>and lines 501-508:</p><p>“What sets the turn-takers apart from the dyads that coordinated on a fixed color, or did not coordinate well? Based on their debriefing responses, turn-takers displayed a much better understanding of the implicit reward rules such as the value of coordination and unfairness. The non turn-taker group was more diverse: some subjects did not understand the game or only understood some aspects; other subjects had a better understanding but were selecting selfishly or could only follow the partner. Furthermore, the turn-taking dyads utilized action visibility driven by action time differences more extensively, although some non-turn-taking dyads overall also exploited action visibility to coordinate on a fixed color.”</p><p>We also note that 4 subjects from non-turn-taking pairs (and no subjects from turn-taking pairs) showed &lt;25% own target color selection in the end of solo training (revised Table S1, red font, now mentioned in the legend), in line with the Reviewer’s suggestion of less flexibility in non-social situations.</p><p>Finally, the Reviewer 1 is absolutely correct that in many human dyads the faster leaders also drove the shifts to the other's target, as highlighted in Figures 7 and S8, and lines 422-426:</p><p>“Hence, similarly to macaques, seeing the faster agent’s choice can help the slower agent to coordinate. But unlike the confederate-trained macaque pair, dynamic human coordination was not driven by the faster agents striving to select only the own preferred color (except human pair 12 shown in Figure 6B): for instance, in the turn-taking pairs 3 and 17, the faster agent B led both to own and A’s preferred colors, while A followed (Table S1, Supplementary file 1).”</p><p>To sum up, as a group human turn-takers explored more, better understood the game and used action visibility more to coordinate, but the leaders did not exclusively strive to select their preferred option – either due to understanding of fairness or because they did not realize the payoff asymmetry. The non turn-taker group was diverse, where some subjects did not understand the game or only understood some aspects, whereas other subjects had a better understanding but could only follow the partner. We also note that the proportion of turn-takers in our study, in absence of explicit payoff instructions, is similar to what has been reported in the literature in similar tasks with more explicit instructions, suggesting the facilitation by direct action visibility (lines 497-500):</p><p>“The observed turn-taking frequency was close to other variants of BoS games with explicit instructions of the payoff matrix, where approximately 50-60% of human subjects developed turn-taking (Arifovic and Ledyard, 2018; Ioannou and Romero, 2014; Melis et al., 2016; Sonsino and Sirota, 2003).”</p><p>While the number of human dyads in our study is not sufficient to make a systematic link between in-game behavior to other measures such as personality traits, this should be addressed in future work in a larger sample (lines 692-696):</p><p>“Finally, it would be very interesting to relate diverse in-game behavioral strategies observed in the human pairs to individual differences in cognitive and socio-economic personality traits (Rollwage et al., 2020; Zhao and Smillie, 2015), and link them to stable behavioral phenotypes (Peysakhovich et al., 2014; Poncela-Casasnovas et al., 2016). This however will require a much larger sample and personality-oriented study design.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors should further consider the degree to which maximizing one's own rewards could drive different strategies in the monkeys. Although cooperating maximized the group's rewards, it wasn't clear whether one monkey could do even better by behaving competitively.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is related to the question raised by Reviewer 1, Recommendations to the authors Comment 1 [R1, C1].</p><p>It is an important point to clarify. To recap, the BoS paradigm is constructed such that coordination (selecting the same target) is invariably more rewarded than not coordinating (selecting different targets). This is related to the fact that converging on either of the two targets results in a game theoretic Nash equilibrium – a strategy in which no individual player can improve its payoff by changing course unilaterally. (For completeness, BoS has a third mixed Nash equilibrium in which players select the two choices with specific probabilities, but it is inefficient since the average reward per player is below the reward of even less rewarded player in the two pure – unfair – Nash equilibria). If an agent is dissatisfied with the current mode of coordination (e.g. always following partner’s color and getting only 3 units, or engaging in side-based on dynamic turn-taking and getting only 3.5 units, on average), he/she can try to force/nudge the partner to coordinate on his/her own preferred target by insisting on it, but for this to be a successful reward maximizing strategy the partner needs to follow suit – otherwise the agent initiating the change risks a reward loss if the partner does not follow. In other words (lines 118-124):</p><p>“In the dyadic trials, selecting the same target resulted in an additional reward on top of the individually trained values – such that choosing the same target was always better than choosing different targets, for both agents individually, and as a group. But in such coordinated trials, the agent whose individually preferred (“own”) color was selected receives a larger reward. Therefore, agents may attempt to behave selfishly/competitively in order to gain more by insisting on their own target color – which pays off as long as the partner accommodates.”</p><p>We indeed observed such behavior in both humans and macaques.</p><p>Concerning human dyads, as can be seen in the revised Figure 2C (where we now indicate turn-taking dyads), all 10 turn-taking dyads earned &gt;3 units average joint reward, as compared to only 4 of the 9 non turn-taker dyads (this difference was significant; Fisher’s exact test p &lt; 0.011). But as should be clearer now from the revised figure and lines 150-153:</p><p>“Note that turn-taking is not maximizing average joint reward over coordination on a fixed color (in fact, out of the three pairs reaching maximum average joint reward 3.5, only one did so by perfect turn-taking, while the other two used static coordination); it does however equalize the rewards within a pair.”</p><p>The turn-taking does optimize “fairness” (with both agents ideally getting 3.5 on average, rather than one getting 4 and other 3). For coordinating non turn-takers, the individual reward reaches maximum (4) for the selfish agent and 3 for the accommodating agent, lower than 3.5, but still higher than 2 for no coordination (e.g. dyads 10 and 18). The revised Figure 2—figure supplement 2B shows the individual rewards and now also indicates the turn-taking pairs.</p><p>For macaques, the most parsimonious explanation is that they indeed learned to maximize their own reward, either by finding one of the pure Nash equilibria (unfair to one of the two agents, but still better that no coordination), or by converging on the same side (which incidentally ensured fair distribution – we do not think that monkeys were motivated by fairness, see lines 669-672):</p><p>“Secondly, due to the task target color/side randomization, selecting targets on the same side of the display resulted in low effort, efficient and fair coordination. We cannot say if fairness was a contributing factor in convergence of the four macaque pairs to this strategy, although we deem it highly unlikely.”</p><p>As can be seen in revised Figure 2—figure supplement 2G which now indicates side strategy pairs, the individual reward is equalized in those macaque pairs but differs by ~0.7-1 units in fixed color-coordinating pairs.</p><p>To sum up, “well-coordinating” human dyads (all turn-takers and few non turn-takers) and all macaque dyads maximized their individual reward, achieving a high average reward above 3 units. The slight difference between well coordinating humans and macaques was not significant (Wilcoxon rank sum test: human dyads median 3.44 N 14; macaque dyads median 3.29 N 9, rank sum 192.5, p=0.297; we added this information to Figure 2 legend) and is likely due to more coordination lapses in macaques. For human and macaque dyads who coordinated statically on a fixed color, the difference between higher and lower individual rewards in a dyad was 0.7-1 units, but the accommodating agents still received more than they would for not coordinating and only selecting their own color.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It was felt that the manuscript would benefit from including additional information on the monkeys' interactions with the human confederate.

We answer each of these important aspects below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How did their behavior differ with humans compared to other monkeys?</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is asking which aspects of macaque experience with the human confederate could have led to a turn-taking behavior in monkeys. As we now clarify in lines 280-283 and new Table S2:</p><p>“Before confederate training, both monkeys adopted either fixed side or fixed color strategy with the macaque partners (Table S2, Supplementary file 2). When paired with the confederate, both monkeys started with a strong bias for selecting their own preferred color but over time changed to reliable coordination (cf. Figure 4A with 4B, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A with Figure 4—figure supplement 1B for another monkey).”</p><p>The human confederates did not intentionally provide additional social cues. The monkeys learned – in case of monkey F, fairly slowly, in the span of 15 sessions (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-F) – to follow the diverse choices of consistent blockwise human turn-taker in order to maximize their reward. This learning was facilitated by the direct visibility of human actions.</p><p>While our new analysis shows that 8 of 9 monkey pairs, including pairs with monkeys F and C, converged on the faster agent’s preferred choice, we speculate that this type of “static” following was indeed different from trial-by-trial monitoring and following the dynamic human actions. We clarify these points in lines 265-279:</p><p>“The absence of dynamic coordination in macaque pairs does not preclude the possibility that a slower agent could have monitored the faster partner trial-by-trial in order to coordinate. Alternatively, the faster agent might have reduced the possible outcomes for the slower agent to two options by consistently selecting a fixed side or color, and the slower agent then found the best of the remaining options without resorting to the trial-by-trial following. To test if macaques can actively monitor and adjust to dynamic choice behavior, we trained two monkeys in the dyadic condition with a human confederate who followed a strict pattern of alternating between the two colors in blocks of approximately 20 trials (“confederate training”). If the rhesus monkeys were insensitive to partner’s diverse choices, the pattern of confederate’s choices should not affect monkey’s behavior.”</p><p>in lines 512-518:</p><p>“Although we found that all macaque pairs that exhibited a significant difference in action times between the agents (8 of 9 pairs) converged on the faster agent’s preferred choice, it seems that initially macaques did not rely on trial-by-trial action visibility. This is suggested by the fact that it required relatively long training before macaques started to follow a human confederate dynamically. Instead, we speculate that slower macaques adapted to their partner’s static choice by maximizing their reward over the remaining options.”</p><p>and lines 614-618:</p><p>“Very different dynamics transpired in additional experiments with macaques. Pairing them with a human confederate who consistently alternated between colors in short blocks but did not intentionally provide any additional social cues demonstrated that macaques are capable to closely follow partner’s actions (Nougaret et al., 2019), and adopt the imposed “turn-taking” to maximize their reward.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How long do effects of training last?</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, the confederate-following behavior, once established, was persistent across multi-week/multi-month breaks in confederate training.

A notable limitation of the study's ability to compare across species is that the rewards given to the monkeys and humans differed qualitatively (primary vs. secondary rewards). Although this is touched on in the discussion, it was felt that further consideration is warranted. For instance, to what extent might motivation to obtain each outcome drive the tendency to be 'selfish' versus cooperative? Is there any evidence that monkeys would adopt different strategies if they were more sated?</p></disp-quote><p>This point is related to the question raised by Reviewer 1, Recommendations to the authors Comment 2 [R1, C2].</p><p>It is indeed an important point; we agree that the difference between primary vs secondary rewards might be crucial and it is essential to consider potential changes in motivation during macaque sessions. We considered the two aspects of this question: (i) coordination vs no coordination and (ii) selfish vs benevolent coordination.</p><p>Concerning the first aspect, in the BoS game the coordination is invariably better than no coordination (both for an individual and a dyad, please see also the point 2 above). Therefore, “selfish” tendency to select only own preferred color would result in less reward, unless a partner always accommodates. A “rational” less sated monkey should select the coordination on either color to gain more reward, so from this perspective one might expect that there would be more coordination at the start of the sessions compared to the end. We however observed the effect in the opposite direction: when the difference was significant, the coordination (as assessed by the average joint reward) was stronger in the last 200 trials of a session compared to the first 100. In fact, we see a similar effect in the human dyads, suggesting the development of coordination irrespective of the reward type (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,C,D). We now illustrate how the individual average reward, average action time, and the control measure “fraction of choosing left” (pertinent for the side coordination strategy) change between the start and the end of a session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> and 3). In line with the average joint reward, the individual rewards increased significantly in early macaque and human sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>,C), and across all sessions in confederate-monkey pairs, significantly for monkey F and marginally for monkey C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3A</xref>,B).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Changes in reward, side bias, and action time between start and end of sessions for different groups.</title><p>All panels show data for each individual subject in a pair (agent A in red, agent B in blue); the x-axis shows data from the first 100 trials, the y-axis data from the last 100 trials; rows show different groups; columns show the average reward, the fraction of choosing left, and the average action time.

But we cannot disentangle this effect from a need to (re)establish the coordination regime. We emphasize however that both prior to and during the confederate training, there was no significant difference in the coordination strength or individual rewards between the start and the end, in the late sessions – on which we base our strategy descriptions (while this difference was present in early sessions when the dyadic learning just started). In other words, the selection behavior was fairly stable in late macaque-macaque and last confederate-macaque sessions. Likewise, there was no significant increase in rewards in the macaque FC pair after the confederate training.</p><p>No change in the fraction of choosing left confirms that there was no shift in side-based strategies in the course of sessions. Finally, we checked how the action times changed in the course of each session. There was an increase from early to late trials (except in confederate-trained FC pair and in humans). This increase can be due to decreased motivation because of satiation and/or fatigue. But to re-iterate, these effects did not result in a shift of strategy.</p><p>Concerning the second aspect, selfish vs benevolent coordination, we now analyzed if the proportion of selfish vs benevolent coordinated trials might change in the course of each session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>). In the macaque dyadic late sessions, the behavior was very stable, without any change. Likewise, in the last 4 confederate-training sessions of each monkey (where both monkeys successfully followed the confederate), there was no significant change in the course of any session. Only in the dynamically-coordinating macaque FC pair after the confederate training, in several sessions one of the two agents became more selfishly insistent on his preferred color towards the end of the session – while the other accommodated. We now added a note of this effect in the legend to Figure 5—figure supplement 1:</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Fraction of coordination on B’s preferred color, in early and late trials.</title><p>Note that “fraction coordinating on B’s color” is complementary to “fraction coordinating on A’s color”; here we present data from B’s perspective because macaques were B agents when training with the confederate. Changes between early and late trials are visible as deviation from the unity diagonal. Individual sessions that exhibited a significant change are shown by filled symbols (Fisher’s exact test on counts of coordinating on B’s color vs A’s color with Bonferroni correction for the number of tested sessions). Locations in the upper right quadrant denote a bias for coordinating on B’s color, locations in the lower left quadrant a bias in coordinating on A’s preferred color. Monkeys F (orange) and C (green) in late confederate training sessions showed balanced selfish/benevolent coordination throughout each session, as well as 4 late macaque pairs that coordinated on a fixed side (center area). Macaque pairs coordinating on a fixed color (located around [0,0] or [1,1]) also did not shift their behavior in the course of a session.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81641-sa2-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>“To assess if the balance between selfish vs benevolent coordination changed in the course of each session, we analyzed the proportion of coordinating on F’s preferred color among all coordinated trials (note that this is complementary to the proportion of coordinating on C’s color) in first 100 vs last 200 trials (Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni correction for the number of tested sessions). In several sessions (FC-1, FC-2, FC-3, FC-6) one of the two agents became more selfishly insistent on his preferred color towards the end of the session – while the other accommodated. Interestingly, the roles reversed in different sessions: in FC-1 C is the leader, while in FC-3 and FC-6 F is the leader. We conclude that during the dynamic coordination, there is a tendency for this pair to gradually adopt more consistent leader-follower roles, potentially because one monkey accommodates and follows more easily in a more sated state.”</p><p>Furthermore, we added the number of solo trials monkeys performed after each dyadic session, to show that the end of dyadic sessions did not correspond to fully waning motivation (lines 864-866):</p><p>“After the dyadic task we offered monkeys the opportunity to obtain additional liquid in the solo version of the task for as long as they continued to work (mean 169 trials, median 73, range 0 to 1163), essentially making participation in the dyadic trials optional.”</p><p>To sum up, while it is indisputable that the nature of the reward and the underlying motivations differed between the two species, there is very little indication that variations in satiation level in the course of each session played a substantial role in shaping macaque strategies – further highlighted in lines 682-691:</p><p>“Inherently, the nature of reward differed between the species: humans received monetary compensation while macaques worked for a liquid reward. Note, however, that in each session macaques were offered an opportunity to work and obtain more liquid in a solo regime after the dyadic experiment (Materials and methods), so the participation in a dyadic interaction was not forced, and the end of the dyadic sessions was not associated with a fully waning motivation. We also did not observe that variations in satiation level in the course of each session played a substantial role in shaping macaque strategies. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge differences between primary and secondary rewards, and potential divergence in the underlying motivations and learning, beyond the species differences in socialization and cognitive capacities considered above.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Can the authors more precisely consider the role of action visibility? Specifically, whether visibility influences social cognition or aides sensorimotor coordination.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is related to the question raised by Reviewer 2, Recommendations to the authors Comment 3.</p><p>We thank the Reviewer for highlighting this aspect. The answer is both. Action visibility is certainly influencing the sensorimotor coordination, as demonstrated by the differences in action times between opaque and transparent conditions (Figures 4C and S4C), convergence to a faster agent’s preference during static coordination (Table S2, Supplementary file 2), a tight relationship between action visibility and choice behavior (Figures 6 and S7), and inter-agent action time differences in coordinated vs non-coordinated trials (Table S1, Supplementary file 1, see also point 1). Furthermore, anecdotally human confederates reported that macaques paid close attention to their actions and often did not even start the trial unless they saw a human doing so. At the same time, we firmly believe (but can only speculate, based on our own impressions and the informal feedback from human subjects) that also the social cognition “per se” was influenced by the direct face-to-face context and by touching the “same” targets. We expanded discussion on this in lines 582-589:</p><p>“In our study, action visibility facilitated sensorimotor coordination, as demonstrated by action time differences in transparent vs. opaque conditions, convergence to a faster agent’s preference during static coordination, a tight relationship between action visibility and choice behavior in turn-taking macaques, and inter-agent action time differences in coordinated vs. non-coordinated trials. Seeing actual movements rather than relying on abstract representations of others such as cursor motions might be especially crucial in nonhuman experiments. But beyond immediate sensorimotor aspects, acting face-to-face on the same targets in close proximity likely influenced social cognition on a more general level.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Finally, can the authors provide further discussion of the effects of learning and socialization on this task across species?</p></disp-quote><p>This point is related to the question raised by Reviewer 3. We readily acknowledge the differences between primary vs secondary rewards (please see also point 4 above) and different underlying motivations and expectations of the two species. We see within-session learning effects in both species, but only in monkeys we could study learning across multiple sessions, with the same and different partners. We extended the acknowledgment of these differences in lines 688-696:</p><p>“Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge differences between primary and secondary rewards, and potential divergence in the underlying motivations and learning, beyond the species differences in socialization and cognitive capacities considered above.</p><p>Finally, it would be very interesting to relate diverse in-game behavioral strategies observed in the human pairs to individual differences in cognitive and socio-economic personality traits (Rollwage et al., 2020; Zhao and Smillie, 2015), and link them to stable behavioral phenotypes (Peysakhovich et al., 2014; Poncela-Casasnovas et al., 2016). This however will require a much larger sample and personality-oriented study design.”</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. It would be helpful to know more about how the goal of maximizing reward might impact the behaviors described here. To start, how does turn-taking compare with the simpler strategies used by the monkeys in terms of reward received? Figure 2C seems to show that the average reward earned by two subjects was actually quite similar between monkeys and humans. The highest-earning human pairs (presumably those who were turn-taking) might have earned slightly more than the monkeys, but there doesn't appear to be a big advantage to turn-taking, in terms of simple reward maximization. Is this true, and if so, is it possible to interpret their behavior as arising from other advantages (e.g., placing value on a partner's reward specifically vs. perceived equity)? What about rewards received by each individual and not the average across pairs? If an agent only values rewards received by themself, is there a more or less optimal approach to this task?</p><p>Please see the response to the point 2 of essential revisions.</p><p>In brief, the revised Figure 2C and associated analysis indeed show that the average joint reward was similar between monkeys and humans, and the advantage of the turn-taking (or a side strategy resulting in “automatic turn-taking” adopted by 4 monkey pairs) is not in maximizing the joint reward per pair, but in simultaneously maximizing both individual rewards. We surmise that human turn-takers – but not side-coordinating macaques – were indeed at least in part motivated by equity considerations.</p><p>The individual rewards are shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2B,G. Indeed, if the agent only values own reward, the optimal approach is to force coordination on his/her preferred color, as long as the partner plays along. Clear examples of such behavior are human pairs 10, 18, 16 and macaque pairs CL, TF and TC (individual rewards ~4 and ~3). From a purely economic value perspective of a selfish agent, the turn-taking only makes sense to ensure coordination in a long term (to avoid a scenario where previously accommodating partner is fed up and starts refusing to coordinate at all on the selfish agent’s color).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Related to the above, it is notable that rewards given to the monkeys and humans differed qualitatively, as did their motivation to pursue them. The humans were receiving small amounts of money in a fairly abstract arrangement in which money was obtained at the end of the session, whereas the monkeys were thirsty and received fluid rewards continuously depending on trial outcomes. To what extent is the motivation to be 'selfish' versus cooperative driven by the motivation to obtain each outcome? For instance, if monkeys were not water deprived, would they be more likely to cooperate rather than compete? Is there any evidence that motivation to get the juice reward changed toward the end of the session?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to the point 4 of essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Are there action time plots similar to those shown for the monkeys for the human pairs? Although Figure 6B is compelling, if I understand it correctly, it just shows that the humans' choices can't be predicted based on who responded first. But it's hard to understand, then, how this type of coordination would emerge if one participant didn't watch and follow the other. The results in 6B could occur if the person who responds faster also drives the shifts to the other's target from time to time, as suggested in Figure 7. Therefore, is it possible that there is a leader and follower in the human pairs (perhaps these roles switch off), but the leader just doesn't choose their own color reliably?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to the point 1 of essential revisions.</p><p>Since the point 1 of essential revisions also deals with a different emphasis on comparing turn-takers vs non turn-takers, raised by the Reviewer 2, we briefly summarize the specific answer here. The Reviewer is absolutely correct – indeed, there were temporal leaders and followers in the human pairs, and indeed, the faster players equally often selected their own color and the color of the partner, to equalize the rewards, as suggested by Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1. We now emphasize this point more clearly in lines 422-426:</p><p>“Hence, similarly to macaques, seeing the faster agent’s choice can help the slower agent to coordinate. But unlike the confederate-trained macaque pair, dynamic human coordination was not driven by the faster agents striving to select only the own preferred color (except human pair 12 shown in Figure 6B): for instance, in the turn-taking pairs 3 and 17, the faster agent B led both to own and A’s preferred colors, while A followed (Table S1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).”</p><p>Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and Table S4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) show correlation coefficients between the visibility of other’s actions and selecting other’s color for all human dyads. The pair 12 shown in Figure 6B shows the highest correlation among the human dyads. In this pair, firstly player A led (equally often to own and to B’s color) and B followed, and then B led (more to own color) and A followed. Among all human pairs, only in this pair there was a reliable difference between AT A – AT B for coordination on A’s color vs coordination on B’s color, but even here the separation between the AT difference histograms was not as clear as in the macaque pair FC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5C</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Action visibility and action time differences.</title><p>(A) This panel repeats Figure 6B for convenience; it shows the correlation between probability of seeing the other move first (in yellow) and following to the other’s preferred target for human pair 12 (top/red for agent A; bottom/blue for agent B). (B) This panel shows the “fraction of choosing own” graph for the same pair (agent A’s in red, agent B’s in blue). The pair starts with a balanced fluctuations selecting both A’s and B’s colors and ends with mostly convergence on B’s color. (C) This panel shows the histogram of the action times for the different choice combinations (red: both choose A’s preferred color; blue: both choose B’s preferred color). The mean action time difference between agent A and agent B differed significantly when the pair coordinated on A’s color compared to B’s color (t-test: coordination on red (M: -88.15, SD: 128.96, N: 96) vs. blue (M: 12.44, SD: 109.49, N: 180), t(168.8392): -6.4951, p &lt; 0.00001). In other words, when jointly selecting red, A was on average 88 ms faster than B; when jointly selecting blue, A was on average 12 ms slower than B..</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81641-sa2-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This manuscript is nicely organized and very thorough. However, it could be improved even further if some points can be discussed in more detail or with additional data analyses.</p><p>1. Related to Figure 2D: the authors mentioned that some human pairs (about half) were not employing the turn-taking strategy. From this figure, these pairs were actually not a small number (9 out of 19). The authors should discuss what might be the reason behind this. Is it possible that these subjects were not very socially engaged (i.e., not paying attention to others) or were less flexible when choosing different options (even in non-social situations)? It will be better if the authors could perform additional data analyses to characterize the differences between the two groups of humans (social attentional differences, reaction time differences, etc) to examine why they were different from the turn-taking pairs and more similar to the monkey pairs.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to the point 1 of essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Related to Figure 5: It is still a little puzzling that monkeys' behaviors can be improved after being trained with humans. What was the reason for this change? Did the human subjects provide extra social cues to the monkeys in order to encourage them to pay more attention, or did the monkeys learn turn-taking simply from the diverse choice patterns of the human subjects? The authors need to have further discussion about this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to the point 3 of essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It is not very clear whether the action visibility is influencing social cognition or simply aiding sensorimotor coordination.
