Repurposing existing medications has accelerated the development of therapies aimed at slowing aging. In this study, using IMR90 cells and aged mice, we revealed that enalapril, a drug widely prescribed for hypertension, can improve both cellular senescence and individual health. Mechanistically, phosphorylated Smad1/5/9 act as pivotal mediators of the anti-senescence properties of enalapril. It stimulates downstream genes involved in cell cycle regulation and antioxidative defenses, facilitating cell proliferation and diminishing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus increasing the antioxidative ability of enalapril. At the organismal level, enalapril has been shown to bolster the physiological performance of various organs; it notably enhances memory capacity and renal function and relieves lipid accumulation. Our work highlights the potential of enalapril to augment antioxidative defenses and combat the effects of aging, thereby indicating its promise as a treatment strategy for aging-associated diseases and its use for healthy aging.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Enalapril</kwd><kwd>healthy aging</kwd><kwd>antioxidative defense</kwd><kwd>phosphorylated Smad1/5/9</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFA0909300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Enalapril combats the effects of senescence by activating the pSmad1/5/9–antioxidative gene axis, enhancing antioxidative defenses and promoting cell proliferation, thereby supporting healthy aging.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging is a multifaceted process influenced by numerous factors, and its intricate mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Geroscience is a burgeoning field of study in which researchers hypothesize that aging is a significant risk factor for many chronic diseases. These findings suggest that interventions targeting the mechanisms of aging might delay the onset or slow the progression of these diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kirkland, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">López-Otín et al., 2023</xref>). Cellular senescence, a pivotal indicator of aging, is characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest triggered by cellular damage or stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khosla et al., 2020</xref>). During cellular senescence, cells exhibit increased activity of the lysosomal enzyme senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), decreased proliferation marker Ki67 signals and increased senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coppé et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dimri et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Senescence is the result of a complex interplay of endogenous and exogenous signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen et al., 2022</xref>). Currently, the activation of tumor suppressor pathways, such as p16<sup>INK4a</sup>/RB, is deemed essential for senescence-related cessation of proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker et al., 2011</xref>). The disruption of signaling pathways disrupts tissue homeostasis, leading to proinflammatory responses that are increasingly recognized as fundamental aspects of senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coppé et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shah et al., 2013</xref>). Researchers have suggested that the expression of p16 is suppressed by inhibitor of DNA-binding (ID) proteins. The expression of the <italic>ID1</italic> gene is downregulated by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), while it is upregulated by BMP-mediated phosphorylated SMAD signaling in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liang et al., 2009</xref>). SMADs are crucial transcriptional effector factors responsible for transmitting TGF-β/BMP signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Urist, 1965</xref>). They convey signals from the TGF-β superfamily and homomeric serine/threonine kinases on the cell surface to the nucleus, directly regulating transcriptional programs critical for key events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miyazono et al., 2005</xref>). Numerous studies have shown that the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway can modulate genes involved in the cell cycle, which affects the balance between cell proliferation and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Genander et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>). Phosphorylated SMAD plays a crucial role in the induction and maintenance of pluripotency, helping maintain tissue homeostasis during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Orlowski, 2017</xref>). However, dysregulation of BMP signaling during aging can lead to fibrosis, impaired wound healing, or excessive tissue calcification, which are detrimental to tissue function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lyu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rahman et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Owing to increasing insights into cellular and individual aging, novel aging mechanisms and signaling pathways have been identified, leading to the development of new therapeutic interventions. Senescent cells have recently been targeted in therapy, given their substantial impact on aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Childs et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, eliminating senescent cells through pharmacological interventions, known as ‘senolytics,’ may delay the onset or slow the progression of age-related diseases and enhance physiological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Childs et al., 2017</xref>). Research has proven that specific senolytic drugs, such as dasatinib and quercetin, can eliminate senescent cells, reverse aging phenotypes, and increase the survival rate of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). However, the current senolytics are not universally effective across different cell types and display inconsistent sensitivities, thereby limiting their broad application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yousefzadeh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to senolytics, researchers have explored pharmacological interventions that aim to ameliorate or reverse aging phenotypes without the need to eliminate senescent cells. This included both the repurposing of existing medications and the development of new ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bharath et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harrison et al., 2014</xref>). However, repurposing is particularly attractive due to its cost-effectiveness; these drugs have already undergone rigorous safety evaluations, allowing for quicker implementation in new contexts. For example, drugs such as metformin, which is typically used to treat type 2 diabetes, and rapamycin, an immunosuppressant, have shown promise in reducing aging phenotypes and extending the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bharath et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>). This strategy is an innovative pharmacological intervention in which existing compounds target the aging process.</p><p>In this study, we employed a drug repurposing strategy to evaluate the anti-senescence potential of several FDA-approved drugs and identified enalapril as a promising candidate. Our investigation revealed that enalapril increases pSmad1/5/9 levels, which in turn upregulates key downstream genes involved in cell cycle regulation and antioxidative defense, thereby improving cell proliferation, reducing inflammation, and decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Our findings confirmed the anti-senescence mechanism of enalapril at both the cellular and organismal levels. Enalapril has the ability to ameliorate aging-related phenotypes of various organs, with notable effects on the brain, kidney, and liver. Furthermore, treating aged mice with enalapril improved spatial memory and anxiety behavior, alleviated lipid accumulation, and mitigated kidney aging-related phenotypes. Taken together, the potential of enalapril to extend the healthspan and ameliorate age-related diseases makes it a compelling candidate for research and development in the field of anti-aging therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Enalapril restrains cellular replicative senescence</title><p>To identify drugs that are capable of delaying cellular senescence, we established an in vitro replicative senescence model using primary human embryonic lung fibroblasts (IMR90). Compared with young cells, long-term-cultured IMR90 cells presented a characteristic senescence phenotype, characterized by increased SA-β-gal staining, increased expression of the cell cycle arrest factors p16 and p21, and reduced expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Additionally, the release of SASP factors that significantly alter the cellular microenvironment, including the well-described factors <italic>IL1β</italic>, <italic>IL6</italic>, and <italic>CXCL10,</italic> has also been reported to increase the degree of senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Employing a drug repurposing strategy, we discovered that enalapril, an antihypertensive medication, delayed senescence. Notably, enalapril treatment at various concentrations reduced SA-β-gal staining, and increased Ki67 positivity in IMR90 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B, D and E</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed a decrease in the senescence markers p16 and p21 with the optimal effect of 10 μM enalapril (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To further analyze the effects of enalapril on transcriptome dynamics upon senescence entry, RNA-seq was performed across enalapril-treated cells at different concentrations. In general, we found that the expression of SASP genes decreased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The expression of cell cycle arrest factors typically increased during senescence; however, the expression of these factors decreased after exposure to enalapril, whereas the expression of cell cycle genes related to cell proliferation increased upon treatment with enalapril at the optimal concentration of 10 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We, therefore, treated the cells with 10 μM enalapril via RT-qPCR and detected that many prominent SASP genes, such as <italic>IL1β and IL6</italic>, were significantly reduced compared with those in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Moreover, enalapril treatment increased the cell growth rate and delayed the transition to the growth arrest phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Our comprehensive analysis underscores enalapril’s potential as an anti-senescence agent, warranting further exploration for its role in combating cellular senescence.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Enalapril alleviates cellular senescence.</title><p>(<bold>A, D</bold>) Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) staining (<bold>A</bold>) and statistical analysis of SA-β-Gal ratios (<bold>D</bold>) in IMR90 cells after enalapril treatment.

We found that enalapril notably elevated the phosphorylation level of Smad1/5/9 without affecting Smad2/3 phosphorylation, effectively reversing the decline of pSmad1/5/9 levels in senescent cells, suggesting a possible role for the BMP-pSmad1/5/9 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). To validate the pathway alterations in the gene expression profile, GSEA confirmed that enalapril treatment increased BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Concurrently, the level of the Smad4 protein, which is required for pSmad1/5/9 to enter the nucleus, also increased, suggesting that enalapril might facilitate the nuclear entry of pSmad1/5/9 and modulate downstream genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guglielmi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Senft et al., 2019</xref>).

Our findings revealed that BMP4 increased pSmad5 levels, which correlated with decreased p16 and p21, reduced β-gal staining and increased Ki67 positivity, indicating a mitigated senescent phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, when cells were treated with the BMP receptor inhibitor LDN or subjected to <italic>BMPR1A</italic> knockdown, the changes in pSmad1/5/9 levels and senescence markers were completely reversed, highlighting that the suppression of pSmad1/5/9 accelerates the progression of senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Encouraged by the observed association between pSmad1/5/9 and senescence, we tested whether pSmad1/5/9 mediates the anti-senescence effects of enalapril by co-treating with enalapril and either LDN or shRNA targeting <italic>BMPR1A</italic>. RNA-seq analysis revealed that LDN upregulated SASP genes and downregulated cell cycle genes.

Furthermore, western blot results also revealed that in the presence of LDN, neither enalapril nor BMP4 restored Smad1/5/9 phosphorylation or the expression of p16 and p21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Similarly, β-gal and Ki67 staining also revealed that enalapril failed to counteract the senescence-promoting effects induced by either LDN treatment or BMPR1A knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3F, G</xref>).

This prompted us to examine ID protein expression during senescence, where we observed a decrease in ID1 and ID2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The knockdown of <italic>ID1</italic> and <italic>ID2</italic> via shRNA or an ID1 inhibitor resulted in a decreasing trend of ID1 or ID2 expression and a significant increase in p16 and p21 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, I</xref>). In addition, while β-gal increased the proportion of positively stained cells, the Ki67 proliferation signal decreased nearly fourfold after the knockdown of <italic>ID1</italic> or <italic>ID2</italic>, resembling the changes observed during senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Given that enalapril reduced SASP factors while LDN increased them, we investigated whether ID1, which acts as a transcriptional repressor downstream of pSmad1/5/9, could modulate SASP expression. Indeed, the expression of traditional SASP factors, such as <italic>IL1β</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic>, which decrease with enalapril treatment, significantly increased after <italic>ID</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). By overlapping the genes downregulated by enalapril with those upregulated upon <italic>ID</italic> knockdown, several SASP genes, as well as <italic>CDKN2A</italic> and <italic>CDKN2B,</italic> were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

Importantly, <italic>ID</italic> knockdown did not affect pSmad1/5/9 levels, confirming that ID is a downstream effector of pSmad1/5/9, influencing the expression of genes such as p16, p21, and SASP-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>).</p><p>After validating the prosenescence effects of <italic>ID</italic> through shRNA targeting <italic>ID</italic> or the use of small molecule inhibitors, we next examined whether the anti-senescence effects of enalapril are mediated by ID proteins. The continued addition of enalapril to these <italic>ID</italic>-knockdown cells did not significantly alter β-gal or Ki67 signals compared with those in the <italic>ID</italic>-knockdown group without enalapril, implying that the benefits of enalapril may be ID dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K–L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that enalapril elevates pSmad1/5/9 levels, which in turn upregulate <italic>ID1</italic> expression. This dual action has two key implications: first, it confirms that enalapril can modulate the expression of pSmad1/5/9 downstream genes. Second, by upregulating <italic>ID1</italic>, enalapril can suppress the expression of p16, p21, and SASP-related genes, thereby potentially restoring cell proliferation and reducing the expression of inflammatory factors. These findings suggest that the anti-senescence mechanism of enalapril involves the pSmad1/5/9-ID1 axis, highlighting a novel pathway for its therapeutic effects on aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Enalapril has antioxidative effects through pSmad1/5/9</title><p>Since an increase in pSmad1/5/9 after enalapril treatment was observed and pSmad1/5/9 is a transcription factor, to understand the in-depth mechanism of enalapril regulation, we further explored the downstream genes of pSmad1/5/9. Analysis of CUT&amp;Tag-upregulated peaks after enalapril treatment revealed that enalapril treatment led to enrichment of pSmad1/5/9 in the GO pathway associated with DNA replication, the cell cycle, and the oxidative stress response, all of which are crucial for cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, transcriptome analysis revealed that the genes whose expression increased after enalapril treatment were also enriched in pathways related to the response to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Notably, genes upregulated by enalapril in response to oxidative stress included antioxidative enzymes, electron transport chain components, and lipid oxidation inhibitors, with a significant increase in pSmad1/5/9 at their TSS regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>).

Similarly, shRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>BMPR1A</italic> also led to decreased expression of antioxidative genes such as <italic>PRDX5</italic> and <italic>TXN</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Collectively, these results reinforce the notion that enalapril promotes the upregulation of antioxidative genes through pSmad1/5/9, reduces ROS levels, and alleviates oxidative stress, thus playing a crucial role in delaying senescence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Enalapril upregulates pSmad1/5/9 and improves physiological function in mice</title><p>Enalapril, which is known for its anti-senescence potential, was further investigated for its impact at the organ and individual levels in 12-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

To assess the impact of enalapril on brain function, we conducted Y-maze and open field tests. The Y-maze, which is frequently employed to assess short-term memory in mice by measuring spontaneous alternation as a marker of spatial working memory, indicates notable improvements. Under normal circumstances, mice prefer to explore new maze branches rather than return to previously visited branches. Several brain regions, including the hippocampus, septum, basal forebrain, and prefrontal cortex, contribute to this task, and the age-related decline in spontaneous alternation ability in mice is associated with degeneration or lesions in brain regions such as the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Radulescu et al., 2021</xref>). Enalapril promoted a substantial increase in the rate of spontaneous alternation in the mice, indicating enhanced spatial memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). As aging progresses, anxiety-like behaviors often increase with age in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Radulescu et al., 2021</xref>). The open-field test, a valuable tool for assessing autonomous and exploratory behaviors in new environments, demonstrated that enalapril increased the number of central area crossings, suggesting a reduction in aging-related anxiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>). However, LDN treatment reversed the improvements in muscle endurance, spatial memory, and reduced anxiety behaviors conferred by enalapril (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>). In conclusion, these results suggest that enalapril has the potential to mitigate the deterioration of various behavioral aspects associated with aging through the activation of pSmad1/5/9.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Enalapril ameliorates aging-related pathological changes in aged mice</title><p>The results of these behavioral tests provided valuable insights. To further explore the effects of enalapril on pathological changes, our investigation was extended to serum analyses. This comprehensive analysis encompassed the evaluation of vital organ function, including the liver, kidneys, and heart, as well as an assessment of lipid content, specifically triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). After enalapril administration, there was no significant change in the serum alanine transaminase (ALT) level, indicating that no liver toxicity from enalapril occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Moreover, the level of creatinine (CREA), a key marker of kidney function, was significantly decreased in enalapril-treated mice, indicating potential functional recovery and improvement of renal function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). A heart health indicator, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), was also reduced, indicating a positive cardiac effect of enalapril (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). These findings underscore the multifaceted effects of enalapril on various physiological parameters, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic intervention in aging-related conditions.</p><p>The transcriptomic data from the enalapril treatment group revealed an increase in long-chain fatty acid metabolism in the liver, suggesting that enalapril may play a positive role in lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Accordingly, we analyzed serum lipid levels in enalapril-treated mice. Typically, aging leads to a decline in lipid metabolism in the serum, causing an accumulation of triglycerides (TGs) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL), contributing to oxidative stress and conditions such as hyperlipidemia and fatty liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johnson and Stolzing, 2019</xref>). Following enalapril treatment, the mice presented significant reductions in TG and LDL levels and a noticeable increase in HDL levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K–M</xref>). These results suggest that enalapril has the potential to increase lipid metabolism in aged mice, thereby mitigating the increase in blood lipid levels.</p><p>To evaluate the improvements in the aging process induced by enalapril in various organ systems, we conducted pathological examinations of mouse tissues. A decrease in β-gal staining was observed in the brain, liver, and spleen of enalapril-treated mice, suggesting an alleviation of aging-associated phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Given the effects of enalapril on brain function, we further examined pathological markers in the brain. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, which is indicative of glycogen deposition, revealed a significant reduction in glycogen near the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Congo red staining, which detects amyloid protein deposition, also revealed reduced staining in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>). In the kidney, Sirius red staining, which highlights abnormal collagen fibers or fibrosis, revealed significant red staining around blood vessels in control mice. However, this staining was noticeably reduced in the kidneys of the mice treated with enalapril (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Q</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F</xref>). These findings suggest that enalapril has a beneficial effect on fibrosis in the kidneys of aged mice, which aligns with the observed improvement in plasma creatinine levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of spleen, kidney, and liver sections from enalapril-treated mice revealed a reduction in Oil Red O staining, with the kidneys and liver showing the most significant changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6R</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2G–I</xref>). This finding aligned with the consistent decrease in lipid-related molecular content in plasma, indicating that enalapril has a role in reducing age-related lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K–M</xref>). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of the liver revealed a decrease in cavities and increased tissue density in mice treated with enalapril, suggesting its role in enhancing liver cell proliferation and regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6S</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2J</xref>).</p><p>In summary, enalapril significantly mitigated multiple pathological markers associated with aging, including lipid droplets, amyloid, glycogen deposition, and fibrosis, in the brain, kidneys, liver, heart, and spleen of aged mice.

This approach repurposes established medications for novel uses, maximizing the potential of known compounds. It has accelerated the transition of anti-aging therapies from discovery to clinical application, ensures their safety and bolsters a comprehensive anti-aging drug screening strategy.</p><p>In our study, we discovered that enalapril, a commonly prescribed ACE inhibitor for hypertension, has significant anti-senescence effects at both the cellular and organismal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Enalapril demonstrated a notable ability to attenuate aging-related physiological decline across multiple organs, including the brain, kidneys, and liver. This finding suggests its potential to reduce the risk of disease across multiple organs, slow the overall aging process, and extend both the healthspan and lifespan of mice. This observation aligns with previous reports on the lifespan-extending effects of other ACE inhibitors, such as captopril, which have been shown to increase longevity in organisms such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Egan et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Strong et al., 2022</xref>). However, our screening process revealed that enalapril outperformed captopril and other antihypertensive drugs in ameliorating senescent phenotypes, although captopril and other antihypertensive drugs also exhibited the ability to delay senescence. These findings indicate that enalapril may have unique or more potent mechanisms of action that contribute to its anti-senescence effects, warranting further mechanistic studies to better understand its molecular targets.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary schematic.</title><p>It shows pSmad1/5/9-mediated combating cellular senescence of enalapril, and improvement of organ function in mice. Specifically, enalapril increases the level of pSmad1/5/9 and Smad4, promoting the expression of downstream genes, such as antioxidative and cell cycle-related genes, thereby promoting cell proliferation and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, enalapril mitigates age-related degenerative changes, including enhanced memory, improved kidney function, increased liver metabolism, and other organ functions.

Phosphorylation of Smad1/5/9 facilitates its nuclear translocation, where it acts as a transcriptional regulator to upregulate downstream genes, such as those involved in cell cycle regulation and antioxidative responses. These findings suggest that the ability of enalapril to modulate the pSmad1/5/9 pathway contributes to its protective effects against oxidative stress, a well-established hallmark of aging. By reducing ROS levels and promoting cell proliferation, enalapril effectively delays the progression of cellular senescence and reduces organismal aging-related phenotypes. This finding not only highlights the potential of phosphorylated Smad1/5/9 as a therapeutic target for anti-senescence interventions but also reveals a novel antioxidative mechanism of enalapril action.</p><p>Several FDA-approved drugs have been repurposed for anti-aging applications, demonstrating a wide range of mechanisms and effects. These include rapamycin, metformin, and NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors. For example, rapamycin, which was originally used as an immunosuppressant to prevent organ transplant rejection, inhibits the mTOR pathway, which is associated with cell growth and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson et al., 2013</xref>). It extends the lifespan of mice and shows potential anti-aging effects across various species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>). Compared with other repurposed anti-aging drugs, enalapril offers distinct advantages because of its unique mechanism of action. As an ACE inhibitor, enalapril inherently targets the renin‒angiotensin system, providing vascular protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmieder et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamamoto and Rakugi, 2021</xref>). Compared with repurposed drugs such as rapamycin, which may have more pronounced side effects, such as immunosuppression, limiting their long-term use, enalapril has a well-established safety profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Janes and Fruman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saunders et al., 2001</xref>). This can facilitate faster clinical translation for anti-aging applications. Moreover, our study revealed that enalapril reduces ROS through the pSmad1/5/9-antioxidant axis, highlighting its potential for antioxidation, a hallmark of aging that is less directly targeted by drugs such as rapamycin or metformin. Additionally, enalapril enhances multi-organ function, particularly in the brain, kidneys, and liver. Its well-established safety profile further supports enalapril as a promising candidate for clinical anti-aging applications, with the potential to complement existing therapies by promoting both vascular health and systemic antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects.</p><p>Aging is a highly complex and multifactorial process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Campisi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jazwinski, 1996</xref>). It involves intricate interactions among various signaling pathways and crosstalk between tissues and organs, especially during individual aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jazwinski, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Muñoz-Espín and Serrano, 2014</xref>). Notably, enalapril is not uniform across all organs and tissues, as indicated by the differential improvement in aging phenotypes among various tissues. For example, enalapril significantly improved the physiological functions of the brain, muscle, and other organs, but the specific pathways and mechanisms by which these effects are mediated might differ among organs. This observation suggests that the tissue-specific effects of enalapril may be mediated by differential activation of signaling pathways, including those beyond the Smad1/5/9 axis, which are known to play crucial roles in aging. Future studies should focus on delineating these tissue-specific mechanisms to fully understand the scope of the anti-aging effects of enalapril. Moreover, improvements in metabolic function in the liver could have downstream effects on brain function, as metabolic dysregulation is known to exacerbate neurodegenerative diseases. Similarly, enhanced vascular health resulting from the antihypertensive properties of enalapril may contribute to improved brain perfusion, reducing the risk of age-related cognitive decline. Therefore, exploring the systemic effects of enalapril and how improvements in one organ system may benefit others should be a priority for future research. Furthermore, given the established role of enalapril as an antihypertensive drug, assessing its potential side effects when it is repurposed for anti-aging purposes is essential. Identifying strategies to minimize these side effects while optimizing their anti-aging effects is an important area of investigation. In conclusion, our study identified enalapril as a promising candidate for repurposing as an anti-senescence drug with antioxidative and promoting effects on cell proliferation. These findings open avenues for the development of targeted therapies aimed at mitigating aging and promoting healthy longevity in clinical settings, providing a foundation for guiding future research in the realm of anti-aging drug interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Primary human embryonic lung fibroblasts (IMR90) were obtained from ATCC (CCL-186).

For instance, studies have shown that BMP4-induced senescence involves activation of Smad1/5/8 (Smad1/5/9), leading to the upregulation of senescence markers like p16 and p21 (JBC, 2009, 284, 12153). Similarly, phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 has been shown to promote and maintain senescence in Ras-activated cells (PLOS Genetics, 2011, 7, e1002359). Could the authors provide more detailed mechanistic insights into why enalapril seems to reverse the typical pro-senescent role of Smad1/5/9 in their study?</p><p>While the authors showed that enalapril increases pSmad1/5/9 phosphorylation, what are the expression levels of other key and related factors like Smad4, pSmad2, pSmad3, BMP2, and BMP4 in both senescent and non-senescent cells? These data will help clarify the broader signaling effects.</p><p>They used BMP receptor inhibitor LDN193189 to pharmacologically inhibit BMP signaling, but it would be more convincing to also include genetic validation (e.g., knockdown or knockout of BMP2 or BMP4). This will help confirm that the observed effects are truly due to BMP-Smad signaling and not off-target effects of the pharmacological inhibitor LDN.</p><p>I don't see the results on the changes in senescence markers p16 and p21 in the mouse models treated with enalapril. Similarly, the effects of enalapril treatment on some key SASP factors, such as TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-1β, and IL-1α, are missing, particularly in serum and tissues. These are important data to evaluate the effect of enalapril on senescence.</p><p>Given that enalapril is primarily known as an antihypertensive, it would be helpful to include data on how it affects blood pressure in the aged mouse models, such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This will clarify whether the observed effects are independent of or influenced by changes in blood pressure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.104774.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lyu</surname><given-names>Wencong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Haochen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Zhehao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Ran</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Jianuo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Meng</surname><given-names>Fanju</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bi</surname><given-names>Jinlong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Lijun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Chao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kunming Institute of Zoology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kunming</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>Yiting</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Guangdong Medical University Zhanjiang Central Hospital</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zhanjiang</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors showed that enalapril was able to reduce cellular senescence and improve health status in aged mice.

We fully agree with this comment. In accordance with your suggestion, we administered LDN193189 to investigate its suppressive effects on pSmad1/5/9 signaling in vivo. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of pSmad1/5/9 resulted in upregulation of enalapril-suppressed SASP factors, while conversely leading to marked decrease of downstream antioxidant genes expression across multiple organ systems (Revised Fig. S7). These analyses and corresponding sentences have been added in the Result section of the revised MS (Revised Fig.S7, Lines 222–223, 444–448).</p><p>Additionally, aging-related behavioral phenotypes were also examined following pSmad1/5/9 inhibition, including decreased muscle strength and endurance, impaired spatial memory and increased anxiety behaviors (Revised Fig. S8). These analyses and corresponding sentences have been added in the Result section of the revised MS (Revised Fig.S8, Lines 476–480). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the anti-aging effects of enalapril in mice are mediated through the pSmad1/5/9 pathway.</p><p>In this study, we focused exclusively on assessing the improvement in the health status of aged mice, which indicates that enalapril can extend the healthspan of aged mice. While we agree that lifespan extension is an important indicator of anti-aging potential, recent studies have emphasized that healthspan, rather than lifespan alone, provides a more relevant and translational measure of aging interventions, particularly in the context of chronic disease and quality of life in aged individuals (Kennedy et al., 2014; Lopez-Otin et al., 2023). Moreover, given the strong influence of genetic background, environmental factors and stochastic events on lifespan, focusing on functional rejuvenation and delayed onset of aging-related pathologies may offer a more practical and mechanistically informative approach. Our study aims to elucidate how enalapril enhances healthy phenotypes in aged mice, however, we acknowledge the critical need for direct lifespan evaluation and intend to address this limitation in subsequent research. We sincerely hope that these explanations address your concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) If it is necessary to show that NAC is able to attenuate enalapril effects in the aging mice. In addition, it would be beneficial to test if enalapril is able to achieve similar rescue in a premature aging mouse model.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion. We apologize for any confusion that may have arisen due to the wording in the original manuscript. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is widely reported as an antioxidant that scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Huang et al., 2020; Zafarullah et al., 2003). In our study, enalapril was also observed to reduce ROS levels. Therefore, NAC is unlikely to antagonize the effects of enalapril in this context, as both compounds act in a similar direction with respect to oxidative stress mitigation. To avoid potential misunderstanding, we have carefully reviewed the relevant statements in the MS and revised the text to clarify this point.</p><p>We sincerely appreciate this valuable suggestion to evaluate enalapril in a premature aging mouse model; however, the premature aging mouse models represent a pathological form of aging, whereas the naturally aged mouse models used in our study reflect physiological aging processes. While we observed beneficial effects of enalapril in naturally aged mice, these effects may not necessarily extend to premature aging models due to fundamental differences in the underlying mechanisms and progression of aging. Natural aging is characterized by the gradual accumulation of cellular damage, driven by multifactorial processes such as inflammaging and mitochondrial dysfunction. In this context, enalapril appears effective, in part by modulating SASP factors and reducing oxidative stress through the BMP-Smad signaling axis (Revised Fig. 4, 5) (Lopez-Otin et al., 2023). In contrast, premature aging models are driven by distinct mechanisms like nuclear lamina defects, which may not respond similarly to BMP-Smad axis. Moreover, genetic background, strain variability, and specific model characteristics can significantly influence treatment outcomes (Mitchell et al., 2016). For instance, rapamycin extends lifespan in wild-type mice but shows limited effects on aging, underscoring the challenge of extrapolating findings across distinct aging models (Neff et al., 2013). We sincerely hope that these explanations address your concerns.

As stated in the MS, after we found that enalapril could improve the cellular senescence phenotype, we screened and examined key targets in important aging-related signaling pathways, such as AKT, mTOR, ERK, Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/9 (Revised Fig. S2A, Revised Fig. 2A). We found that only the phosphorylation levels of Smad1/5/9 significantly increased after enalapril treatment. Therefore, the subsequent focus of this study is on pSmad1/5/9. We sincerely hope that these explanations address your concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Furthermore, their finding that activation of Smad1/5/9 leads to a reduction of senescence appears somewhat contradictory to the established literature on Smad1/5/9 in senescence. For instance, studies have shown that BMP4-induced senescence involves the activation of Smad1/5/8 (Smad1/5/9), leading to the upregulation of senescence markers like p16 and p21 (JBC, 2009, 284, 12153). Similarly, phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 has been shown to promote and maintain senescence in Ras-activated cells (PLOS Genetics, 2011, 7, e1002359). Could the authors provide more detailed mechanistic insights into why enalapril seems to reverse the typical pro-senescent role of Smad1/5/9 in their study?</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for your helpful comments! The downstream regulatory network of BMP-pSmad1/5/9 is highly complex. The BMP-SMAD-ID axis has been mentioned in many studies, and its downstream signaling inhibits the expression of p16 and p21 (Hayashi et al., 2016; Ying et al., 2003). Additionally, studies have also found that the Smad1-Stat1-P21 axis inhibits osteoblast senescence (Xu et al., 2022). In our study, enalapril was found to increase the expression of ID1, which is a classic downstream target of pSmad1/5/9 (Genander et al., 2014). Therefore, pSmad1/5/9 inhibits cellular senescence markers such as p16, p21 and SASP through ID1, thereby promoting cell proliferation (Revised Fig. 3). Furthermore, we also found that pSmad1/5/9 increases the expression of antioxidant genes and reduces ROS levels, exerting antioxidant effects (Revised Fig. 4). Together, ID1 and antioxidant genes enable pSmad1/5/9 to exert its anti-senescence effects. We sincerely hope that these explanations address your concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) While the authors showed that enalapril increases pSmad1/5/9 phosphorylation, what are the expression levels of other key and related factors like Smad4, pSmad2, pSmad3, BMP2, and BMP4 in both senescent and non-senescent cells? These data will help clarify the broader signaling effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your insightful suggestions. We observed an increase in pSmad1/5/9 and Smad4 expression, while the levels of pSmad2 and pSmad3 remained unchanged after enalapril treatment (Revised Fig. 2A). Consistently, we found that the levels of pSmad1/5/9 and Smad4 were markedly reduced in senescent cells, aligning with the upregulation of these proteins by enalapril (Revised Fig. S2B). In contrast, pSmad2 and pSmad3 showed a slight increase during senescence, while BMP2 and BMP4 were slightly decreased, though these changes were not statistically significant (Revised Fig. S2B). These findings suggest that enalapril primarily exerts its effects by enhancing pSmad1/5/9 and Smad4 levels, thereby regulating downstream target genes and contributing to the restoration of a more youthful cellular state. These analyses and corresponding sentences have been added in the Result section of the revised MS (Revised Fig.S2B, Lines 303–306, 311–313).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) They used BMP receptor inhibitor LDN193189 to pharmacologically inhibit BMP signaling, but it would be more convincing to also include genetic validation (e.g., knockdown or knockout of BMP2 or BMP4). This will help confirm that the observed effects are truly due to BMP-Smad signaling and not off-target effects of the pharmacological inhibitor LDN.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for your careful reading and valuable comments! We used shRNA to knockdown the BMP receptor BMPR1A, which led to a reduction in Smad1/5/9 phosphorylation (Revised Fig. S4D, E). This was accompanied by senescence-associated phenotypes, including increased expression of p16 and SA-β-gal and decreased Ki67 staining (Revised Fig. S4F, G). Notably, the addition of enalapril failed to reverse these senescence phenotypes under BMPR1A knockdown conditions, mirroring the results observed with the BMP receptor inhibitor LDN193189 (Revised Fig. S4F, G, Revised Fig. 2F, G). Furthermore, knockdown of BMPR1A also resulted in a marked decrease in the expression of downstream targets, such as ID1 and antioxidative genes (Revised Fig. S4D). These findings strongly support the notion that enalapril exerts its anti-senescence effects through BMP-Smad signaling. These analyses and corresponding sentences have been added in the Result section of the revised MS (Revised Fig.S4D–G, Lines 323–329, 335–337, 348–351, 416–418).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) I don't see the results on the changes in senescence markers p16 and p21 in the mouse models treated with enalapril. Similarly, the effects of enalapril treatment on some key SASP factors, such as TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-1β, and IL-1α, are missing, particularly in serum and tissues. These are important data to evaluate the effect of enalapril on senescence.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. As for the markers p16 and p21, we observed no change in p16, while the changes in p21 varied across different organs and tissues. Nevertheless, behavioral experiments and physiological and biochemical indicators at the individual level consistently demonstrated the significant anti-aging effects of enalapril (Revised Fig. 6).</p><p>We also examined the changes in SASP factors in the serum of mice after enalapril treatment. Notably, SASP factors such as CCL (MCP), CXCL and TNFRS11B showed significant decreases (Revised Fig. 5C). The expression changes of SASP factors varied across different organs. In the liver, kidneys and spleen, the expression of IL1a and IL1b decreased, while TNFRS11B expression decreased in both the liver and muscles (Revised Fig. 5B). Additionally, CCL (MCP) levels decreased in all organs (Revised Fig. 5B). We sincerely hope that these explanations address your concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Given that enalapril is primarily known as an antihypertensive, it would be helpful to include data on how it affects blood pressure in the aged mouse models, such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This will clarify whether the observed effects are independent of or influenced by changes in blood pressure.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments. While enalapril is primarily recognized for its antihypertensive properties, in our experimental setting involving aged, normotensive mice, we did not observe notable changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure following enalapril administration. This observation aligns with previous reports indicating that enalapril does not significantly affect blood pressure in similar non-hypertensive aging models (Keller et al., 2019). Based on these findings, we cautiously interpret that the beneficial effects of enalapril observed in our study are unlikely to be driven by changes in blood pressure. We sincerely hope that these explanations address your concerns. Again, thank you for the constructive comments to advance the understanding of our work!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>This is an interesting study that reveals enalapril is able to elevate the pSmad1/5/9 pathway to reduce ROS and inflammation to improve the health status in vitro and in vivo. While the pathway is clearly shown in cells to be involved in the enalarpril-mediated mitigation of aging, little was done to demonstrate this pathway is responsible for the in vivo effects in the physiological improvements. This can be done by ROS-reduction chemicals such as NAC and also the use of BMP receptor inhibitor LDN193189 (LDN). It is critical to show the lifespan extension in enalapril-treated animals given that the significantly improved physiological functions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks very much for your constructive recommendations. This part has already been addressed in our response to the public review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The term &quot;anti-aging&quot; appears frequently throughout the manuscript, including in the title. However, the study doesn't directly address lifespan or a comprehensive range of aging symptoms, which are also difficult to define and measure. Many of the observed effects appeared to be driven by senescence. To be more accurate, I recommend avoiding terms like &quot;anti-aging&quot; and &quot;mitigates aging&quot;, and instead replacing them with more specific phrases such as &quot;anti-senescence&quot;, &quot;senescence reduction/suppression&quot;, or &quot;mitigates age-related symptoms&quot; to better reflect the scope of the study and avoid overstating the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks very much for your constructive recommendations.
