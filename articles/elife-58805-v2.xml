<italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,</italic> the presence of <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated proteins on the surface of two flagella is crucial for both cell-cell interaction during mating and flagellar surface adhesion. However, it is not known whether only the presence or also the composition of <italic>N</italic>-glycans attached to respective proteins is important for these processes. To this end, we tested several <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> insertional mutants and a CRISPR/Cas9 knockout mutant of xylosyltransferase 1A, all possessing altered <italic>N</italic>-glycan compositions. Taking advantage of atomic force microscopy and micropipette force measurements, our data revealed that reduction in N-glycan complexity impedes the adhesion force required for binding the flagella to surfaces. This results in impaired polystyrene bead binding and transport but not gliding of cells on solid surfaces. Notably, assembly, intraflagellar transport, and protein import into flagella are not affected by altered <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation. Thus, we conclude that proper <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation of flagellar proteins is crucial for adhering <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cells onto surfaces, indicating that <italic>N</italic>-glycans mediate surface adhesion via direct surface contact.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>N-glycosylation</kwd><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>atomic

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>N</italic>-glycosylation, as one of the major post-translational modifications, takes place along the ER/Golgi secretion route and consequently most <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans are found on proteins facing the extracellular space. Initial steps of <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation in the ER are highly conserved among most eukaryotes and consist of the synthesis of a common prebuilt <italic>N</italic>-glycan precursor onto a dolichol phosphate. Following the transfer of the glycan precursor onto the asparagine of the consensus sequence N-X-S/T of a nascent protein (where X can be any amino acid except proline), the glycoprotein is folded by the glycan recognizing chaperones Calnexin and Calreticulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stanley and Taniguchi, 2017</xref>). Subsequent <italic>N</italic>-glycan maturation steps in the Golgi are species dependent and give rise to a high variety of <italic>N</italic>-glycan structures. In land plants, Golgi maturation leads to <italic>N</italic>-glycans modified with β1,2-core xylose and α1,3-core fucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strasser, 2016</xref>). In <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, a unicellular biflagellate green alga, <italic>N</italic>-glycans can be decorated with core xylose and -fucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oltmanns et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schulze et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, <italic>6O</italic>-methylation of mannose and addition of a terminally linked β1,4-xylose were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mathieu-Rivet et al., 2013</xref>). While the functional advantage of <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans to mature proteins is hardly understood, it is known that blocking the synthesis of a full <italic>N</italic>-glycan precursor results in hypoglycosylated proteins that cannot be folded properly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>). Instead, they are degraded via the ER-associated degradation pathway (ERAD) and are consequently not targeted correctly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cherepanova et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, impairment of glycosylation at such early stage is lethal in both uni- and multi-cellular organisms and only when inhibition of glycosylation is carefully dosed (e.g. by tunicamycin), immediate physiological effects caused by hypoglycosylation can be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kukuruzinska et al., 1987</xref>). Looking at <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, treatment of vegetative cells with tunicamycin lead to an impaired flagellar adhesiveness, indicating that glycoproteins are crucial for adhesion and the subsequent onset of gliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloodgood et al., 1987</xref>). However, whether this phenotype is linked to mistargeting of proteins due to hypoglycosylation and/or the lack of <italic>N</italic>-glycans on the flagella surface is unclear.</p><p>Whole-cell gliding is one of two flagella-based motilities in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> besides swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishikawa and Marshall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kozminski et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Snell et al., 2004</xref>). In principle, the cell adheres to a surface via its flagella, positioning them in a 180° angle and initiates gliding along the solid or semisolid surface into the direction in which one flagellum is pointing (designating it as leading flagellum) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloodgood, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, flagella not only bind to large solid surfaces, but they also bind to small, inert objects (e.g. polystyrene microbeads) that are moved along the flagellar membrane. While the two events, summarized as flagellar membrane motility, are believed to underly the same molecular machinery, it is assumed that they start with an adhesion of flagella membrane components to the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloodgood and Salomonsky, 1998</xref>). A micropipette force measurement approach recently showed that the flagella adhesion forces on different model surfaces with tailored properties lie in the range of 1 to 4 nN and that only positive surface charge diminished the adhesion force significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Backholm and Bäumchen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kreis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kreis et al., 2018</xref>). These findings imply that the adhesion system of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> has developed toward great flexibility instead of high specificity, in line with the high diversity of solid surfaces dwelled by the microalga in nature, ranging from soil and sand to wet leaves, moss, and bark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris, 2009</xref>). Remarkably, surface iodination experiments in the early 1980s revealed a single protein called flagellar membrane glycoprotein 1B (FMG-1B) as the main player mediating surface contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bloodgood and Workman, 1984</xref>). FMG-1B is exclusively located in the flagellar membrane and has a remarkable size of around 350 kDa (4389 amino acids) with a large extra-flagellar part (4340 amino acids) anchored in the membrane via a single predicted trans membrane helix of 22 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloodgood et al., 2019</xref>). As the name indicates, it is heavily <italic>N</italic>- and <italic>O</italic>-glycosylated. A recent knock down study showed, that it is the main constituent of the glycocalyx surrounding the flagellum. Additionally, a <italic>fmg-1B</italic> mutant showed a drastically reduced ability to glide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloodgood et al., 2019</xref>). Strikingly, FMG-1B is present at a high copy number and turns over rapidly within approximately 1 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloodgood, 2009</xref>). The rapid turnover is probably attributed to the fact that flagellar membrane components are constantly shed into the medium as flagellar ectosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloodgood, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wood et al., 2013</xref>). FMG-1B and another <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated membrane component, FAP113, have been shown to be eventually torn out of the membrane once bound to microbeads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kamiya et al., 2018</xref>). Whether FAP113 is only involved in microbead binding or also in whole-cell gliding is unknown.</p><p>Recently, it was found that flagellar adhesion to surfaces is switchable by light, indicating that a blue-light photoreceptor signal is governing this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kreis et al., 2018</xref>). Following adhesion to the surface, a transmembrane signal mediates translation of the adhesion event into a calcium transient and protein phosphorylation cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloodgood, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collingridge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kreis et al., 2018</xref>). According to the current model, an interaction of the short cytoplasmic part of FMG-1B with intraflagellar transport (IFT) may occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laib et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shih et al., 2013</xref>). IFT moves bidirectionally along the flagellar microtubules, the anterograde transport is driven by kinesin 2 and retrograde transport is driven by cytoplasmic dynein-1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cole et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huangfu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kozminski et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lechtreck, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pedersen and Rosenbaum JLBT-CT in DB, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Porter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002</xref>). Since retrograde IFT trains pause relative to the adhesion site while FMG-1B tethers to the solid surface through its large extracellular carbohydrate domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloodgood, 2009</xref>), the force generated by retrograde motor protein dynein-1b will push the microtubule into the opposite direction, dragging the cell body and the second flagellum behind; the gliding process is initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shih et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Due to the high N-glycosylation level of the extraflagellar domain of FMG1-B, interacting with the solid surface, it was suggested that N-glycosylation could be crucial for adhesion, beyond proper glycoprotein folding. Therefore, we compared flagellar membrane motility of different mutant strains impaired in <italic>N</italic>-glycan maturation (characterized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schulze et al., 2018</xref>).

The insertional mutagenesis giving rise to these mutants was performed in the parental strain CC-4375 (a <italic>ift46</italic> mutant backcrossed with CC-124) complemented with IFT-46::YFP, referred to as WT-Ins throughout the current study. The first mutant, deficient in xylosyltransferase 1A (IM<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic>), produces <italic>N</italic>-glycans devoid of core xylose while simultaneously having a reduced length. Second mutant IM<italic><sub>Man1A</sub></italic>, a knock down mutant of mannosidase 1A, is mainly characterized by a lack of 6<italic>O</italic>-methylation of mannose residues while the <italic>N</italic>-glycan length is slightly greater than in WT-Ins. Furthermore, <italic>N</italic>-glycans of IM<italic><sub>Man1A</sub></italic> are slightly reduced in terminal xylose and core fucose. Finally, a double mutant of the above two single mutants (IM<italic><sub>Man1A</sub></italic>xIM<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic>, obtained by genetic crossing) produces <italic>N</italic>-glycans devoid of 6<italic>O</italic>- methylation but of WT-Ins length and carrying core xylose and fucose residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The whole-cell extracts or isolated flagella from IM<italic><sub>Man1A</sub></italic>, IM<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic>, and their double mutant IM<italic><sub>Man1A</sub></italic>xIM<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic> were probed separately with the glycan epitope recognizing antibody or the antibody against the protein backbone of FMG-1B. FMG-1B was found in whole cells and flagella of WT-Ins and all three mutants. Hereby, the protein amount was similar in all four strains as indicated by the use of the FMG-1B protein-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Contrarily, the antibody raised against FMG-1B glycan epitopes barely detected whole-cell or flagella probes of IM<italic><sub>Man1A</sub></italic> and IM<italic><sub>Man1A</sub></italic>xIM<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic>. Also, the FMG-1B glycan signal decreased in the mutant IM<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic>, particularly in the whole-cell sample. Taken together, these immuno-blots confirm that the <italic>N</italic>-glycan pattern of FMG-1B is altered in the mutants, while the protein localization is not affected by this alteration. In addition, label-free mass spectrometric quantification confirmed that FMG-1B is correctly targeted to the flagella in all mutants analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The same is true for FAP113, another protein shown to be involved in flagella surface motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To compare the localization of glycan and protein of FMG1-B in WT-Ins and mutants, the cells were immuno-stained with the two FMG-1B-specific antibodies described above. A uniform signal of the glycan-specific antibody was found in the flagella and the cell wall of WT-Ins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left panel). It should be noted, that such cross reaction with cell wall localized glycosylated proteins has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloodgood et al., 1986</xref>). In line with the immuno-blotting experiment, no glycan signal was observed in the flagella or cell wall of IM<italic><sub>Man1A</sub></italic> and the double mutant, while signal intensity was low in the flagella of mutant IM<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left panel and). The faint FMG-1B signal in IM<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic> compared to the WT-Ins was clearly observed when WT-Ins and IM<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic> were mixed prior to immuno-staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). When the FMG-1B peptide antibody was used, a uniform signal is found in the flagella of WT-ins, M<italic><sub>Man1A</sub></italic>, IM<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic>, and the mutant IM<italic><sub>Man1A</sub></italic>xIM<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right panel). In summary, these data show that altered <italic>N</italic>-glycan maturation did not affect the flagellar localization of FMG-1B. This is in line with early findings by Bloodgood et al., reporting proper FMG-1B targeting to the flagella in a <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation mutant termed L23 showing increased ConA-affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloodgood et al., 1987</xref>). Although FMG-1B is the most prominent and best studied flagella membrane glycoprotein, there might be other glycoproteins involved in flagellar adhesion. Nevertheless, no protein was found consistently and significantly changed in abundance in flagella of the IM strains analyzed when compared to WT-Ins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>), also indicating that flagellar assembly is not considerably altered in the mutants versus WT.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Altered <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans attenuate bead attachment to and movement along the flagellar membrane</title><p>In <italic>C. reinhardtii,</italic> polystyrene microspheres adhere to and move bidirectionally along the flagellar surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bloodgood, 1981</xref>).

Taken together, these results suggested that active dynein-1b might reduce surface adhesion forces. On the other hand, it implied that IFT might be hampered via altered <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation as surface adhesion forces were smaller in the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation mutants. Therefore, IFT velocity and gliding ability of IFT46::YFP expressing WT-Ins and IM<italic><sub>Man1A</sub></italic>xIM<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic> in absence of ciliobrevin D were assessed by using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Videos of adhered cells generated by TIRF microscopy were evaluated manually with help of kymographs in Fiji software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Obtained data revealed that neither the proportion of gliding events (gliding velocity higher 0.3 µm*s<sup>−1</sup>), nor gliding speed distribution was significantly diminished when comparing WT-Ins and the double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Likewise, anterograde and retrograde IFT velocities were found at WT-Ins values when comparing WT-Ins and the double mutant of adherent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), implying no significant impact of altered <italic>N</italic>-glycan maturation on IFT. Source data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>. Lastly, to rule out the possibility that ciliobrevin D might result in elevated adhesion forces due to a toxic side effect, we generated the triple mutant dynein-1b<sup>ts</sup><sub>X</sub> IM<italic><sub>Man1A</sub></italic> <sub>X</sub> IM<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic><sub>-4-13#</sub> by crossing IM<italic><sub>Man1A</sub></italic>xIM<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic> with CC-4423 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). CC-4423 is characterized by the expression of a temperature sensitive transcript of dynein-1b leading to a depletion of dynein-1b at restrictive temperatures followed by an attenuation of retrograde IFT and flagella disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Engel et al., 2012</xref>). Subsequently, adhesion forces were measured via AFM at restrictive temperatures, that is, under conditions mimicking the ciliobrevin D dependent inactivity of dynein-1b. As it cannot be excluded that flagella shortening, as induced upon temperature shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), might impact flagellar adhesion forces, the triple mutant treated with 20 mM NaPPi was assessed by AFM as control. Indeed, it was found that adhesion forces differed when measured at a defined flagella length of about 6.5 μm: while control cells showed an average adhesion force of 0.48 nN, cells depleted from dynein-1b showed a significantly elevated adhesion force of 1.64 N. Importantly, NaPPi only induces flagellar shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>) but does not affect dynein-1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dentler, 2005</xref>), therefore, differences observed are directly correlated to the action of dynein-1b. Thus we suggest, that the action of dynein-1b reduces flagellar adhesion forces due to a destabilization of surface adhered protein clusters.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>IFT and gliding are unaffected in IM<italic><sub>Man1</sub></italic><sub>A</sub>xIM<sub>X<italic>ylT1A</italic></sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Adhesion forces acquired for WT-Ins and the double mutant IM<italic><sub>Man1</sub></italic><sub>A</sub>xIM<sub>X<italic>ylT1A</italic></sub> in the absence or presence of ciliobrevin D via AFM, respectively.

In line with this, their surface adhesion forces were significantly reduced compared to WT-Ins. The AFM data were confirmed by assessing another XylT1A mutant created via CRISPR/Cas9, using micropipette force measurements. It should be noted that <italic>N</italic>-glycan patterns of IM<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic> and CRISPR<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic> were comparable and thereby strengthen the proposed role of XylT1A as core xylosyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schulze et al., 2018</xref>). Forces measured for WT strains and <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation mutants with AFM and micropipette force measurement confirmed that differential <italic>N</italic>-glycan maturation, i.e. altered <italic>N</italic>-glycan structures attached to mature proteins, lowers the adhesion force of flagella to a surface. These changes in adhesion forces were not accompanied by consistent drastic changes in the flagellar proteomes. For example, FMG-1B and FAP113, to date the only two known proteins involved in surface adhesion, were found in comparable amounts in WT-Ins and mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloodgood et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kamiya et al., 2018</xref>). Of note, also FMG-1A is localized in flagella and its abundance was unaltered between WT and mutants in vegetative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). This contrasts the current assumption that FMG-1A is solely expressed in reproductive cells and opens the question whether it might have a similar role as FMG-1B, given the high similarity of the two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloodgood, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, gliding of mutant strains on solid surface was not affected. The current model for flagella-mediated cell adhesion and subsequent gliding proposes that the extracellular part of certain glycoproteins such as FMG-1B adheres to the surface, cytoplasmic moieties of these proteins are bound to ongoing retrograde IFT directly or indirectly upon calcium- and light dependent stimulus which is followed by an onset of gliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kreis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shih et al., 2013</xref>). Assuming that altered <italic>N</italic>-glycan maturation does not impact initial protein folding in the ER (as those steps are spatially and temporally separated), our data revealed that changed <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation, did not alter targeting of respective glycoproteins to flagella nor the velocity of IFT. Thus, changes in surface adhesion are likely linked to <italic>N</italic>-glycoprotein epitopes and their direct interaction with the solid or semisolid surface. How specific <italic>N</italic>-glycan moieties modulate adhesion force is subject of future research, particularly considering the finding that flagella-mediated adhesion of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> has been shown to be largely unaffected by different substrate surface properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kreis et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Notably, IFT and gliding were not changed between double mutant and WT-Ins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The fact that altered <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation diminished the force of cells to adhere to surfaces but did not affect IFT, strongly suggests that adhesion to surfaces and IFT are not necessarily coupled. As discussed below, adhesion probably evolved independently of the necessity to enable cell gliding.</p><p>Moreover, it can be concluded that <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation does not significantly impact differences in light perception, as the adhesion forces for WT-SAG and CRISPR<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic> were significantly stronger under blue than under red light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>In summary, taking advantage of single-cell adhesion force measurements, our data revealed that cell adhesion was significantly impaired in <italic>C. reinhardtii N</italic>-glycosylation mutant strains. Our data further suggested that flagellar assembly, IFT and FMG-1B transport into flagella were not affected by altered N-glycosylation implicating no role of N-glycosylation in these processes. Instead, proper N-glycosylation of flagellar proteins is crucial for adhering C. reinhardtii cells onto surfaces. Our observations further suggest that the remaining adhesion force, although diminished in N-glycan mutants, is still sufficient for gliding. Given the response of flagellar adhesion to blue light, it could potentially link adhesion to photo-protection which is also blue-light mediated, as adhesion might result in photoprotection via biofilm formation, which in turn would enable mutual cell shading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kreis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petroutsos et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Culture growth</title><p>Cells were grown photoheterotrophically in tris-acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium under constant illumination at 50 µmol photons*s<sup>−1</sup>*cm<sup>−2</sup> unless stated otherwise.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Measurement of flagellar length and flagellated cells</title><p>The cells were fixed with 0.5% Lugol’s solution for 1 hr at room temperature.

Following, cells were incubated in the presence of ciliobrevin D for 1 hr (500 µL M1 supplemented with 200 µM ciliobrevin D). For AFM measurements, only adhered cells in gliding conformation having approximately similar appearance were analyzed. The MLCT-O10 AFM probe (Spring Const.: 0.03 N m<sup>−1</sup>, length: 215 µm, width: 20 µm, resonant freq.: 15 kHz, Bruker) was soaked in acetone for 5 min, then subjected to UV illumination (distance to lamp: 3–5 mm) for 15 min. Then, the probe was immersed in 0.01% poly-l-lysine for 1 hr and afterwards rinsed with MQ water. Following, the probe was immersed with 2% glutaraldehyde for 1 hr and rinsed with MQ water before use. The AFM measurement was performed in Force Spectroscopy Mode in liquid at room temperature using a NanoWizard 3 AFM (JPK) equipped with a CellHesion stage (Z range: 100 µm) NanoWizard three head. The spring constant of the cantilever was routinely calibrated using the contact-based thermal noise method. The AFM tip, modified as described, was lowered onto the cell surface at a rate of 10 μm s<sup>−1</sup> with a z scale of 25 μm. After contact, the applied force was maintained at 3 nN for 15 s. Then, the cell-attached probe was upraised at a rate of 1 μm s<sup>−1</sup>. Force curves were processed with JPK SPM Data Processing (JPK). The forces and energy were determined as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2011</xref>).

In brief, <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> strains WT-SAG and CRISPR<italic><sub>XylT1A_1</sub></italic> grew axenically in tris-acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a Memmert IPP 100Plus incubator on a 12 h day / 12 hr night cycle. The experimental approach is based on the use of a homemade micropipette force sensor, which allows for grasping a living cell by suction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Backholm and Bäumchen, 2019</xref>). The micropipette is calibrated by measuring the deflection induced by the weight of an evaporating water droplet at tip of the pipette. The adhesion force is obtained by bringing the flagella into contact with a piece of a silicon wafer (unilateral polished, Si-Mat) cleaned by sonication in ethanol, and by measuring the micropipette deflection during iterative approach and retraction of the substrate moving at 1 µm*s<sup>−1</sup>. The substrate approach consists of pushing the cell such that the micropipette is deflected by 10 µm from the cell/substrate contact position, which is then followed by a dwell period of 10 s. The substrate is then retracted by 30 µm from the cell/substrate contact position at the same speed. The overall contact time between the flagella and the substrate is about 30 s. The illumination wavelength for blue and red light was 470 nm and 671 nm respectively, and realized by using narrow band pass interference filters (FWHM: 10 nm) added on top of the condenser of an inverted microscope (Olympus IX-73 and IX-83). During the adhesion force measurements, the cells were illuminated with a constant photon flux of 1019 photons*m<sup>−2</sup>* s<sup>−1</sup> for both light conditions. For each cell, 10 adhesion force measurements were performed for each wavelength, whereby the order of red and blue light was varied randomly after five consecutive measurements.</p><p>In order to evaluate the influence of ciliobrevin D on the adhesiveness, a 200 μM stock solution of ciliobrevin D (Merck) was prepared in a 9:1 water: dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, Purity: 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich,) mixture. Then, 1.08 mL of this stock solution was added to 30 mL of culture to achieve a final concentration of 7 μM of ciliobrevin D in the cell suspension. The <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> suspension containing ciliobrevin D was next incubated for 30 min and then centrifuged at 100 g for ten minutes, followed-up by a minimum of 30 min rest in the incubator. Finally, about 15 mL of the cell suspension was used to fill the liquid chamber. In parallel, a second suspension of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cells was incubated using the same fraction of DMSO (but without ciliobrevin D), followed by the exact same experimental procedure to serve as a control group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>TIRF imaging</title><p>Total internal reflection microscopy (TIRF) was applied to assess IFT and gliding behavior of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> strains expressing YFP-coupled IFT46.

Samples were loaded to a glass bottom microscopy chamber (µ-Slide 8 Well Glass Bottom) and refreshed every 20 min while imaging. TIRF microscopy was performed at room temperature with a Nikon Eclipse Ti and a 100x objective. IFT46::YFP was excited at 488 nm and fluorescence was recorded with an iXon Ultra EMCCD camera (Andor). For analysis, images were captured with NIS-Elements software over 30 s at 10 fps and a pixel size of 0.158 µm*pixel<sup>−1</sup>.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This article examines the basis for the adhesion of the bi-flagellate cell <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> to substrates. Substrate adhesion in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> is due to the flagellar surface. FMG-1B constitutes most of the protein of the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagellar membrane and is the major surface-exposed flagellar membrane protein and the only flagellar membrane protein that contacts a planar substrate during whole-cell gliding motility or a polystyrene microsphere during the other manifestation of surface motility associated with the flagellum. The authors are asking the rather straight forward question of whether alterations in the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation of the flagellar membrane glycoproteins affects the strength of cell adhesion of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> with a substrate. The study uses two previously characterized insertional mutants, IM<italic><sub>Man1A</sub></italic> ( in mannosidase) and IM<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic> (in xylosyltransferase 1A), a corresponding double mutant and a novel CRISPR mutant (CRISPR<italic><sub>XylT1A_1</sub></italic> also in xylosyltransferase 1A) to analyze how changes in protein <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation affect flagellar adhesion to surfaces using <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>.</p><p>The results show that altered <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation of FMG-1B does not change its abundance and flagellar localization, or the IFT and gliding velocity of the cells. However, it affects the binding of polystyrene microbeads to the flagella, as well as its transport. Moreover, AFM measurements show a decrease of both the forces and average energy in the mutants in comparison to the WT strain. Besides, micropipette force measurements performed on strains whose <italic>N</italic>-glycan composition was altered using the CRISPR approach showed also a decrease of the adhesion force on mutant cells under blue light (known to enhance adhesion of the WT reference). Finally, measurements done with and without ciliobrevin D show that ciliobrevin D is not increasing the adhesion forces of mutant cells contrary to what is observed for WT cells.</p><p>While the reviewers agreed that perturbations in the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation pattern affect the level of cell adhesion and can be an interesting result worthy of being reported in <italic>eLife</italic>, they also noted major weaknesses and raised serious concerns about the validity of the conclusions made in the manuscript and the advance the manuscript makes in the field. Specifically, the key AFM and micropipette experiments, while very elegant and of great potential, as shown in a previous publication, were performed in the presence of a drug, which appears to kill and damage many cells. It remains unclear whether the changes in glycosylation directly impact adhesion or change protein folding or cilia protein composition. Also, the mutations do not eliminate <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation, but alter the composition and size, raising the question of how these changes would interfere with adhesion, considering that the double mutant shows subtle changes in anti-HRP staining. Thus, the panel recommended that the work in its present form is too preliminary to be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, and the manuscript could benefit greatly by a major revision. The major points listed below provide clear guidance as to how to improve the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It appears that the difference in &quot;Adhesion Force&quot; between control and the <italic><sub>xylT1A</sub></italic>mutant are different in Figure 4A and 3C – this might be due to the differences in the method. However, since different strains were used, it is also possible that there might be a large strain-specific difference in the adhesion phenotype (two distinct wild-type strains were used) that are not necessarily related to the mutations of interest. Since no rescue experiments are presented, the correlation between the genotype and the quite variable phenotypes is somewhat uncertain.</p><p>2) The pattern obtained by staining of flagella extracts of the double mutant with anti-HRP is quite similar to that of wild-type flagella. How does that fit with the observation that adhesion forces are most affected in the double mutant? Concerning protein glycosylation, the double mutant is better off than the two single mutants (e.g. binding of anti-HRP is reduced in the single mutant but returned to normal in the double) but no explanation is offered why that is the case. Schulze et al. state that loss of mannosidase suppresses the XlyT1A mutation but – since it is called a knock-down mutant -it appears that the Man1A mutant is not null?</p><p>3) The authors observe that Ciliobrevin D (an inhibitor of IFT dynein) treatment increases the adhesion force. However, as stated in the Materials and methods section, many cells died during the treatment of cells with ciliobrevin D. Thus, it is unclear whether the effect observed here is really to the inhibition of dynein or due to some toxicity of the drug.</p><p>&quot;The impact of ciliobrevin D on the adhesion force suggested that IFT might contribute to surface adhesion forces.&quot; But differences in IFT were not observed. So, how do the authors explain the effect of ciliobrevin? Does active gliding make adhesion less strong?</p><p>Since ciliobrevin D is believed to inhibit IFT dynein, the panel recommends using strains that abolish IFT by a temperature shift such as fla10ts to further explore whether active IFT lowers cell adhesion.</p><p>4) The authors should discuss the nature and the relevance of these binding measurements. What is the natural surface of binding for this organism in real life? While polystyrene (beads), glass (AFM) and silicon (micropipette) present all similar surface charges, what kind of interaction is reported in this work? It would be useful to provide a plausible description of the interaction between glycans and the surfaces.</p><p>5) The manuscript is complicated, difficult to read and the authors could do better with explaining the logic behind some of their experiments. To guide the reader through the numerous variations, some details should be more explicitly set out. In particular, the last part of the discussion, regarding the impact of ciliobrevin D and its link with gliding, can probably be explained more clearly and further discussed. Some details are currently lacking to give a clear overview.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Altered <italic>N</italic>-glycan composition impacts flagella mediated adhesion in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> &quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Instead, the authors could point out in the Introduction that <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> species often grow on solid surfaces (and then might move by gliding) rather than living in aquatic habitats.

Specifically, the key AFM and micropipette experiments, while very elegant and of great potential, as shown in a previous publication, were performed in the presence of a drug, which appears to kill and damage many cells. It remains unclear whether the changes in glycosylation directly impact adhesion or change protein folding or cilia protein composition. Also, the mutations do not eliminate N-glycosylation, but alter the composition and size, raising the question of how these changes would interfere with adhesion, considering that the double mutant shows subtle changes in anti-HRP staining. Thus, the panel recommended that the work in its present form is too preliminary to be considered for publication in eLife, and the manuscript could benefit greatly by a major revision. The major points listed below provide clear guidance as to how to improve the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The HRP blot has been repeated, revealing clearer differences between WT and <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation mutants. Additionally, Concanavalin A affino blotting has been performed illustrating increased Concanavalin A affinity for all <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation mutants, supporting altered <italic>N</italic>-glycan maturation in all mutants as compared to WT as already observed by mass spectrometry. Immuno-fluorescence images have further been repeated in a simplified approach to allow better comprehension. To address the important issue of comparability of adhesion forces measured via the two different approaches (AFM and micropipette force measurement) adhesion forces have now also been assessed in presence of ciliobrevin D in the micropipette approach. Finally, we present experimental evidence that ciliobrevin D acts on dynein and that the forces measured are not inflicted by its putative toxicity. To do so, a temperature sensitive mutation of cytoplasmic dynein was introduced in the double mutant IM<italic><sub>Man1A</sub></italic>XIM<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic> and consequently, the adhesion force of this mutant was measured at permissive and restrictive temperatures via AFM as suggested by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It appears that the difference in &quot;Adhesion Force&quot; between control and the xylT1A mutant are different in Figure 4A and 3C – this might be due to the differences in the method. However, since different strains were used, it is also possible that there might be a large strain-specific difference in the adhesion phenotype (two distinct wild-type strains were used) that are not necessarily related to the mutations of interest. Since no rescue experiments are presented, the correlation between the genotype and the quite variable phenotypes is somewhat uncertain.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the measured adhesion force possesses a strain specific component. This is an interesting finding, yet beyond the scope of our manuscript. To further support the finding that ciliobrevin D impacts the adhesion forces measured and to allow a better comparison of both methods used for adhesion force determination, micropipette force measurements have been additionally performed in presence of ciliobrevin D as employed for AFM measurements (new Figure 4). These measurements confirmed that the effect of ciliobrevin D can be observed in both measurements. Thus, independent of genetic wildtype background and type of adhesion force measurement, we observed that changes in <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation composition impact adhesion to surface. In our eyes, this underpins the robustness of our results (despite varying strains and methods) and even strengthens the universality of our finding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The pattern obtained by staining of flagella extracts of the double mutant with anti-HRP is quite similar to that of wild-type flagella. How does that fit with the observation that adhesion forces are most affected in the double mutant? Concerning protein glycosylation, the double mutant is better off than the two single mutants (e.g. binding of anti-HRP is reduced in the single mutant but returned to normal in the double) but no explanation is offered why that is the case. Schulze et al. state that loss of mannosidase suppresses the XlyT1A mutation but – since it is called a knock-down mutant -it appears that the Man1A mutant is not null?</p></disp-quote><p>For now, we do not have molecular insights of how altered <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation impacts surface adhesion, i.e. which <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated proteins are involved and which <italic>N</italic>-glycan components are crucial for “WT-like” action. This question will be very interesting to address in future research. To avoid extensive, not data-supported speculations, we omitted the discussion on why the double mutant is affected most. We see that we did not state this clearly enough in the previous version of the manuscript and now included a respective paragraph in the revised version. Further, to show clearly that all mutants analysed in this manuscript show specific alterations in their <italic>N</italic>-glycan patterns, the HRP-blot has been repeated and a Concanavalin A affino blotting has been performed in addition. The HRP-blot now clearly revealed increased binding of HRP in both IM<italic><sub>Man1A</sub></italic> and double mutant as well as reduced binding in IM<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic> compared to WT-Ins (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Additionally, the Con-A affino blot shows increased affinity of Con-A in all mutants analyzed (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). These results now clearly provide evidence that also the double mutant shows altered <italic>N</italic>-glycan maturation and is not “better off” regarding <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors observe that Ciliobrevin D (an inhibitor of IFT dynein) treatment increases the adhesion force. However, as stated in the Materials and methods section, many cells died during the treatment of cells with ciliobrevin D. Thus, it is unclear whether the effect observed here is really to the inhibition of dynein or due to some toxicity of the drug.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that our wording in the previous version of the manuscript was not clear causing a misunderstanding. We do not observe any toxicity effect of the drug (ciliobrevin D) during preparation. Our intention of this technical remark was to highlight the effect of centrifugation during preparation to separate alive from dead or deflagellated cells. To pipette only the swimming cells, only the upper part of the treated cell suspension (about 15 mL) was used for these experiments. No dead cells are observed in the liquid chamber during experiments. The observed effect is truly related to the inhibition of dynein. We have thus revised the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;The impact of ciliobrevin D on the adhesion force suggested that IFT might contribute to surface adhesion forces.&quot; But differences in IFT were not observed. So, how do the authors explain the effect of ciliobrevin? Does active gliding make adhesion less strong?</p><p>Since ciliobrevin D is believed to inhibit IFT dynein, the panel recommends using strains that abolish IFT by a temperature shift such as fla10ts to further explore whether active IFT lowers cell adhesion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviewer’s insightful comments. To rule out the toxicity of ciliobrevin D, we generated the triple mutant dynein-1b<sup>ts</sup> XIM<italic><sub>Man1A</sub></italic>XIM<sub><italic>XylT1A</italic>-4-13#</sub> (double mutant crossed with CC-4423, a dynein-1b<sup>ts</sup> mutant, in which the retrograde IFT stop and flagella disassemble at restrictive temperature) (Engel, Ishikawa et al., 2012). We added these data in Figure 5—figure supplement 1. In order to exclude the effect of flagellar length to adhesion force, we compared the force measured for dynein-1b<sup>ts</sup>XIM<italic><sub>Man1A</sub></italic>XIM<sub><italic>XylT1A</italic>-4-13#</sub> at restrictive temperature with the double mutant IM<italic><sub>Man1A</sub></italic>XIM<italic><sub>XylT1A</sub></italic> treated with NaPPi. The treatment of NaPPi has no effect on the IFT (Dentler, 2005). In line with elevated adhesion forces in the presence of ciliobrevin D, the new triple mutant showed elevated adhesion forces at restrictive temperature (as compared to the NaPPi control sample). These results demonstrated on one hand, that the effect assessed in the presence of ciliobrevin D is not attributed to toxicity and on the other, it indicates that active dynein-1b decreases flagellar adhesion forces (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Of course, this is an interesting finding opening a variety of questions to be answered in the future, however, showing how exactly IFT or dynein 1-b are involved in adhesion is not the intention of this manuscript which instead focuses on the question if glycosylation impacts adhesion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should discuss the nature and the relevance of these binding measurements. What is the natural surface of binding for this organism in real life? While polystyrene (beads), glass (AFM) and silicon (micropipette) present all similar surface charges, what kind of interaction is reported in this work? It would be useful to provide a plausible description of the interaction between glycans and the surfaces.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it will be very interesting to analyze the precise interaction of <italic>N</italic>-glycan and surface. As described in Kreis et al., 2019, flagella-mediated adhesion is largely independent of substrate properties. It is therefore at the moment not possible to define the interaction of glycans and surface observed in this study. Statements regarding this question would be purely speculative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The manuscript is complicated, difficult to read and the authors could do better with explaining the logic behind some of their experiments. To guide the reader through the numerous variations, some details should be more explicitly set out. In particular, the last part of the discussion, regarding the impact of ciliobrevin D and its link with gliding, can probably be explained more clearly and further discussed. Some details are currently lacking to give a clear overview.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks.

Since we, however, cannot exclude that there might be a dependency, we decided to analyze cells via AFM with a similar flagella length of about 6.5 μm. Therefore, we used NaPPi to shorten the flagella to 6.5 μm in the tripe mutant at non-restrictive temperature (after 20 min of treatment), a length that was observed at restrictive temperatures in the triple mutant. This has been now clarified in manuscript and the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) &quot;It could be speculated, that the action of dynein-1b reduces flagellar adhesion forces due to its opposite direction of action with respect to the flagellar adhesion force.&quot;</p><p>It is unclear what the authors mean by &quot;opposite direction of action&quot;.

So far very little is known on the role of FMG-1A, often only referred to as minor (unimportant) form of FMG-1. It has been proposed to be mainly expressed in reproductive cells. In our mass spectrometry data, however, FMG1-A is highly abundant also in flagella of vegetative cells indicating that it might be more important than suggested until now.</p><p>We have revised the paragraph as follows:</p><p>“Of note, also FMG-1A is localized in flagella and its abundance was unaltered between WT and mutants in vegetative cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 4).
