anti-viral immunity, but often impair protective immune responses during bacterial infections. An important question is how type I IFNs are strongly induced during viral infections, and yet are appropriately restrained during bacterial infections. The <italic>Super susceptibility to tuberculosis 1</italic> (<italic>Sst1</italic>) locus in mice confers resistance to diverse bacterial infections. Here we provide evidence that <italic>Sp140</italic> is a gene encoded within the <italic>Sst1</italic> locus that represses type I IFN transcription during bacterial infections. We generated <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice and found that they are susceptible to infection by <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. Susceptibility of <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice to bacterial infection was rescued by crosses to mice lacking the type I IFN receptor (<italic>Ifnar</italic><sup>–/–</sup>). Our results implicate <italic>Sp140</italic> as an important negative regulator of type I IFNs that is essential for resistance to bacterial infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mycobacterium tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>legionella pneumophila</kwd><kwd>type i interferon</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37AI075039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vance</surname><given-names>Russell E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI155634</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vance</surname><given-names>Russell E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vance</surname><given-names>Russell E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01AI066302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Portnoy</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name><name><surname>Vance</surname><given-names>Russell E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL134183</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishimura</surname><given-names>Stephen L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vance</surname><given-names>Russell E</given-names></name><name><surname>Darwin</surname><given-names>K Heran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Repression of type I interferons by SP140 is essential for resistance to <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Type I interferons (IFNs) comprise a group of cytokines, including interferon-β and multiple interferon-α isoforms, that are essential for immune defense against most viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006</xref>). Type I IFNs signal through a cell surface receptor, the interferon alpha and beta receptor (IFNAR), to induce an ‘anti-viral state’ that is characterized by the transcriptional induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>). Many ISGs encode proteins with direct anti-viral activities. Type I IFNs also promote anti-viral responses by cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells. Accordingly, <italic>Ifnar</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice are highly susceptible to most viral infections.</p><p>Many ISGs are also induced by IFN-γ (also called type II IFN). However, type I and type II IFNs appear to be specialized for the control of different classes of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crisler and Lenz, 2018</xref>). Whereas type I IFNs are predominantly anti-viral, the ISGs induced by IFN-γ appear to be especially important for the control of diverse intracellular pathogens, including parasites and bacteria. In contrast, type I IFNs play complex roles during bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boxx and Cheng, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donovan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McNab et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moreira-Teixeira et al., 2018</xref>). Some ISGs induced by type I IFN, most notably certain guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs), have anti-bacterial activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pilla-Moffett et al., 2016</xref>). At the same time, other proteins induced by type I IFNs, including interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), impair anti-bacterial immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boxx and Cheng, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ji et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mayer-Barber et al., 2014</xref>). As a result, the net effect of type I IFN is often to increase susceptibility to bacterial infections. For example, <italic>Ifnar</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice exhibit enhanced resistance to <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auerbuch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrero et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Connell et al., 2004</xref>) and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donovan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dorhoi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ji et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mayer-Barber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moreira-Teixeira et al., 2018</xref>). Multiple mechanisms appear to explain resistance of <italic>Ifnar</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, including a negative effect of type I IFNs on protective IFN-γ signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rayamajhi et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, diverse mechanisms underlie the negative effects of type I IFNs during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, including alterations of eicosanoid production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mayer-Barber et al., 2014</xref>) and the induction of IL-1Ra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ji et al., 2019</xref>), both of which impair protective IL-1 responses.</p><p>As an experimental model for dissecting the mechanisms by which inappropriate type I IFN responses are restrained during bacterial infections, we have compared mice harboring different haplotypes of the <italic>Super susceptibility to tuberculosis 1</italic> (<italic>Sst1</italic>) locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pichugin et al., 2009</xref>). The <italic>Sst1</italic> locus encompasses about 10M base pairs of mouse chromosome 1, a region that contains approximately 50 genes. Mice harboring the susceptible (S) haplotype of <italic>Sst1</italic>, derived from the C3H/HeBFeJ mouse strain, succumb relatively rapidly to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection as compared to isogenic mice harboring the resistant (R) <italic>Sst1</italic> haplotype (derived from C57BL/6 mice). Likewise, <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> mice also exhibit enhanced susceptibility to <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyartchuk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pan et al., 2005</xref>) and <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2013</xref>). The susceptibility of <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> mice to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> was reversed by crossing to <italic>Ifnar</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ji et al., 2019</xref>), thereby demonstrating the causative role of type I IFNs in driving the susceptibility phenotype. Although multiple type I IFN-induced genes are likely responsible for the detrimental effects of type I IFNs during bacterial infections, heterozygous deficiency of a single type I IFN-induced gene, <italic>Il1rn</italic> (encoding IL-1 receptor antagonist), was sufficient to almost entirely reverse the susceptibility of <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> mice to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ji et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Sst1<sup>R</sup></italic> haplotype is dominant over the <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> haplotype, suggesting that <italic>Sst1<sup>R</sup></italic> encodes a protective factor that is absent from <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pichugin et al., 2009</xref>). By comparing gene expression in <italic>Sst1<sup>R</sup></italic> versus <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> mice, <italic>Sp110</italic> (also known as <italic>Ipr1</italic>) was discovered as an <italic>Sst1</italic>-encoded gene that is transcribed selectively in <italic>Sst1<sup>R</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pan et al., 2005</xref>). Transgenic expression of <italic>Sp110</italic> in <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> mice partially restored resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pan et al., 2005</xref>). However, the causative role of <italic>Sp110</italic> in conferring resistance to bacterial infections was not confirmed by the generation of <italic>Sp110</italic>-deficient B6 mice. Null mutations of human <italic>SP110</italic> are associated with VODI (hepatic veno-occlusive disease with immunodeficiency syndrome, OMIM 235550), but not mycobacterial diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roscioli et al., 2006</xref>). Some studies have found polymorphisms in <italic>SP110</italic> to be associated with susceptibility to TB, though not consistently so across different ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fox et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lei et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Png et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thye et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tosh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In humans and mice, SP110 is a part of the speckled protein (SP) family of nuclear proteins, consisting of SP100, SP110, and SP140 (and SP140L in humans only) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fraschilla and Jeffrey, 2020</xref>). The SP family members also exhibit a high degree of similarity to AIRE, a transcriptional regulator that promotes tolerance to self-antigens by inducing their expression in thymic epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson and Su, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fraschilla and Jeffrey, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perniola and Musco, 2014</xref>). All members of the SP-AIRE family in both mice and humans have an N-terminal SP100 domain that appears to function as a homotypic protein-protein interaction domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fraschilla and Jeffrey, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huoh et al., 2020</xref>). The SP100 domain is closely related to the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), though SP family members are not believed to activate caspases. SP-AIRE proteins also contain a DNA-binding SAND domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bottomley et al., 2001</xref>). Certain SP isoforms, including all human full-length SP family members and mouse SP140, also include a plant homeobox domain (PHD) and a bromodomain (BRD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fraschilla and Jeffrey, 2020</xref>). The genes encoding SP family proteins are linked in a small cluster in both mouse and human genomes and are inducible by IFN-γ in a variety of cell lines. The mouse <italic>Sp100/110/140</italic> gene cluster is adjacent to a highly repetitive ‘homogenously staining region’ (HSR) of chromosome 1 that remains poorly assembled in the most recent genome assembly due to the presence of as many as 40 near-identical repeats of <italic>Sp110</italic>-like sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weichenhan et al., 2001</xref>). Most of these repeated <italic>Sp110</italic>-like sequences in the HSR appear to be either incomplete copies of <italic>Sp110</italic> or pseudogenes that are not believed to be translated, but their presence has nevertheless complicated genetic targeting and analysis of the SP gene family.</p><p>With the advent of CRISPR/Cas9-based methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), we were able to generate <italic>Sp110<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice on the B6 background. Surprisingly, we found that <italic>Sp110<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice do not phenocopy the susceptibility of <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> mice to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in vivo. Upon analysis of additional candidate genes in the <italic>Sst1</italic> locus, we found that B6.<italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> mice also lack expression of <italic>Sp140</italic>. To test whether loss of <italic>Sp140</italic> might account for the susceptibility of <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> mice to bacterial infections, we generated <italic>Sp140<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice. We found that these mice are as susceptible as B6.<italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> mice to the intracellular bacterial pathogens <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>. Similar to B6.<italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> mice, <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice exhibit an exacerbated type I IFN response after bacterial infection, and the susceptibility of <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice is rescued by crosses to <italic>Ifnar</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice. Our results suggest that loss of <italic>Sp140</italic> explains the susceptibility to bacterial infections associated with the <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> haplotype.

Both of the independent lines of <italic>Sp140<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice were similarly susceptible to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

It is possible that the guide RNA we used to disrupt exon 3 of <italic>Sp140</italic> also disrupted these uncharacterized <italic>Sp140</italic>-like genes, though it is not clear if these uncharacterized <italic>Sp140</italic>-like genes give rise to functional proteins. Nevertheless, to identify potential mutated off-target genes in our <italic>Sp140<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice, we amplified exons 2/3 of <italic>Sp140</italic> and any potential paralogs from genomic DNA and from cDNA derived from <italic>M. tuberculosis-</italic>infected lungs, and subjected the amplicons to deep sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Although we found evidence for several edited <italic>Sp140</italic>-like exons in our <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice, only one of these edited off-target genes was found to be detectably expressed from analysis of RNA-seq data from <italic>M. tuberculosis-</italic>infected lungs, and this off-target appeared to be edited in only one of our founder lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

At the time point analyzed (28 dpi), both <italic>Sp140<sup>–/–</sup></italic> and B6.<italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> mice exhibit higher bacterial burdens than B6 and <italic>Sp110<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, the similarity of the gene expression profile of B6.<italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> and <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> lungs may merely reflect increased inflammation in these lungs. Alternatively, the increased bacterial burdens may be due to a similarly enhanced type I IFN response in these mice, which leads to secondary bacterial outgrowth and inflammation. Therefore, we specifically compared the change in expression of two subsets of genes: (1) hallmark inflammatory response pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and (2) type I interferon response genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This analysis revealed that B6.<italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> and <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice not only show a similarly increased inflammatory gene signature, as expected, but in addition showed a similarly increased type I IFN gene signature. We validated the elevated expression of the ISG <italic>Il1rn</italic> in both B6.<italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> and <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Therefore, deficiency in <italic>Sp140</italic> is likely the primary driver of susceptibility in <italic>Sp140<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice, while the resistance of <italic>Sp110<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice likely derives from normal expression of <italic>Sp140</italic> rather than aberrant changes in the expression of other SP family members.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Global gene expression analysis of <italic>Sp110<sup>–/–</sup>, Sp140<sup>–/–</sup></italic>, and B6.<italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> lungs after <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PCA or (<bold>B</bold>) Euclidean distance analysis of all the samples.

Alternatively, the minor differences in gene expression between B6.<italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> and B6.<italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice could arise from additional genetic background or microbiota differences between B6.<italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> and <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice.

In response, vertebrate immune systems have evolved stereotypical responses appropriate for distinct pathogen types. For example, type I IFN-driven immunity is generally critical for defense against viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006</xref>), whereas type II IFN (IFN-γ)-driven immunity mediates resistance to intracellular pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crisler and Lenz, 2018</xref>). Additionally, IL-1 is important for inducing neutrophil and other responses against extracellular pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mantovani et al., 2019</xref>), and IL-4/–13 (type 2 immunity) orchestrates responses to helminths and other parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Locksley, 1994</xref>). Thus, an important question is how the immune system generates responses that are appropriate for resistance to a specific pathogen while repressing inappropriate responses. The alternative strategy of making all types of responses to all pathogens appears not to be employed, possibly because it would be too energetically costly, or incur too much inflammatory damage to the host. Although there is still much to be learned, it appears that negative feedback is essential to enforce choices between possible types of immune responses. For example, IL-4 and IFN-γ have long been appreciated to act as reciprocal negative antagonists of each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Locksley, 1994</xref>). In addition, anti-viral type I IFNs negatively regulate IFN-γ and IL-1-driven anti-bacterial responses via diverse mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donovan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moreira-Teixeira et al., 2018</xref>). Although negative regulation of IFN-γ/IL-1 by type I IFN is likely beneficial to limit immunopathology during viral infections, <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> mice provide an example of how excessive or inappropriate negative regulation by type I IFN can also be detrimental during bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ji et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we therefore sought to understand the molecular basis by which wild-type (<italic>Sst1<sup>R</sup></italic>) mice are able to restrain type I IFNs appropriately during bacterial infections.</p><p>Although the <italic>Sst1</italic> locus was first described in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pan et al., 2005</xref>), further genetic analysis of the locus has been hindered by its extreme repetitiveness and the concomitant difficulty in generating specific loss-of-function mutations in <italic>Sst1</italic>-linked genes. In particular, the loss of <italic>Sp110 (Ipr1)</italic> has long been proposed to explain the susceptibility of <italic>Sst1</italic> mice to bacterial infections. However, while we could confirm the loss of <italic>Sp110</italic> expression in <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> mice, specific <italic>Sp110</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice were never generated and thus its essential role in host defense has been unclear. The advent of CRISPR/Cas9-based methods of genome engineering allowed us to generate <italic>Sp110</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice. Unexpectedly, we found that <italic>Sp110</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice were fully resistant to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, and we thus conclude that lack of <italic>Sp110</italic> is not sufficient to explain the <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> phenotype. An important caveat of genetic studies of the <italic>Sst1</italic> locus is that generating specific gene knockouts is still nearly impossible in this genetic region, even with CRISPR/Cas9. Indeed, the guide sequence used to target exon 3 of <italic>Sp110</italic> also targets an unknown number of pseudogene copies of <italic>Sp110</italic>-like genes located within the unassembled adjacent ‘homogenously staining region’ of mouse chromosome 1. Thus, we expect that additional off-target mutations are likely present in our <italic>Sp110</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mutant mice. However, given that the <italic>Sp110</italic> pseudogenes are not known to be expressed, we consider it unlikely that collateral mutations would affect our conclusions. Moreover, any off-target mutations should differ among the three founder mice we analyzed and are thus unlikely to explain the consistent resistant phenotype we observed in all three founders. Additionally, we did not observe major changes in gene expression for other SP family members (<italic>Sp100</italic> and <italic>Sp140</italic>) in <italic>Sp110</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, since we were able to establish that all the founders at a minimum lack SP110 protein, additional mutations would not affect our conclusion that <italic>Sp110</italic> is not essential for resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p><p>Given that loss of <italic>Sp110</italic> was not sufficient to explain the susceptibility of <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> mice to bacterial infections, we considered other explanations. We found that <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> mice also lack expression of <italic>Sp140</italic>, an <italic>Sst1</italic>-linked homolog of <italic>Sp110</italic>. Our data suggest that deletion of <italic>Sp140</italic> is sufficient to recapitulate the full <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> phenotype including broad susceptibility to multiple bacterial infections, including <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>. From the analysis of RNA-seq data generated from <italic>M tuberculosis-</italic>infected lungs, we found that the transcriptomes of <italic>Sp140<sup>–/–</sup></italic> and B6.<italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> greatly overlap and display an elevated ISG signature. The elevated production of <italic>Ifnb</italic> mRNA and <italic>Il1rn</italic> mRNA seen by RNAseq was validated by RT-qPCR. Enhanced <italic>Ifnb</italic> production and <italic>Ifnar</italic>-dependent cell death were also observed during in vitro experiments with BMMs. A causative role for type I IFNs in the phenotype of <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> and <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> mice was seen in the reduced susceptibility of <italic>Sp140<sup>–/– </sup>Ifnar<sup>–/–</sup></italic> and B6.<italic>Sst1<sup>S </sup>Ifnar<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice to bacterial infection. Overall, we therefore conclude that loss of <italic>Sp140</italic> likely explains the <italic>Sst1</italic>-linked hyper type I IFN-driven susceptibility to bacterial infections. It remains possible that the additional loss of <italic>Sp110</italic> in <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> mice further exacerbates the <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> susceptibility phenotype as compared to <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice. However, in our studies, we did not observe a consistent difference in susceptibility between <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> (i.e., <italic>Sp110</italic><sup>–/– </sup><italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup>) mice as compared to our <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice.</p><p>Another important caveat to our study is that it remains possible that our <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice carry additional mutations that contribute to, or even fully explain, their observed phenotype. This concern is somewhat ameliorated by our analysis of two independent <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> founders, both of which exhibited susceptibility to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We confirmed there is normal SP110 protein levels in bone marrow macrophages from <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and normal levels of <italic>Sp110</italic> and <italic>Sp100</italic> mRNA in the lungs of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, collateral loss of SP100 or SP110 is unlikely to explain the phenotype of our <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice. To address the possibility of mutations in unannotated SP-like genes, we used deep amplicon sequencing of genomic DNA and cDNA from <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice. We confirmed that both founder lines harbored distinct off-target mutations. Most of the identified off-target mutations are in previously unidentified sequences that likely originate from <italic>Sp140</italic> paralogs within the unmapped HSR. Most HSR-linked paralogs are believed to be pseudogenes, and indeed, the off-target mutated genes appear to be expressed at a far lower level than <italic>Sp140</italic> in lungs during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. In one of our <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> lines, we identified an off-target mutated <italic>Sp140</italic>-like paralog that was expressed at detectable levels in the lungs of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice. This paralog was 100% identical to <italic>Sp140</italic> in the sequenced region and was only distinguished from <italic>Sp140</italic> itself because it lacked the deletion that was introduced into the edited <italic>Sp140</italic> gene. Importantly, this previously undescribed <italic>Sp140</italic>-like expressed sequence was not mutated in our second <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> line and is thus unlikely to explain resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. As an alternative approach to confirm the phenotype of <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice is due to loss of <italic>Sp140</italic>, we overexpressed <italic>Sp140</italic> in <italic>Sp140<sup>–/–</sup></italic> BMMs. Crucially, we found <italic>Sp140</italic> complements aberrant elevated <italic>Ifnb</italic> transcription exhibited by <italic>Sp140<sup>–/–</sup></italic> BMMs upon TNFα stimulation. Finally, <italic>Sp110</italic> and <italic>Sp140</italic> are the only two <italic>Sst1</italic>-linked genes that we were able to find to be differentially expressed between B6 and B6.<italic>Sst1</italic><sup>S</sup> mice, and as discussed above, our genetic studies suggest little role for the loss of <italic>Sp110</italic>. Thus, while it is formally possible that an edited <italic>Sp140</italic> homolog that was not identified by our amplicon sequencing contributes to the susceptibility to bacterial infection and elevated type I IFN in <italic>Sp140</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice, the most parsimonious explanation of our data is that deficiency in <italic>Sp140</italic> accounts for the <italic>Sst1<sup>S</sup></italic> phenotype. We expect that future mechanistic studies will be critical to further confirm this conclusion.</p><p>Because <italic>Sp140</italic> is inducible by IFN-γ, our results suggest the existence of a novel feedback loop by which IFN-γ acts to repress the transcription of type I IFNs via SP140. This feedback loop appears to be essential for host defense against diverse bacterial pathogens. A major question that remains is how SP140 acts to repress the type I IFN response. SP140 contains DNA/chromatin-binding domains, such as SAND, PHD, and BRDs, which suggest the hypothesis that SP140 functions as a direct transcriptional repressor of type I IFN genes. However, much more indirect mechanisms are also possible. Recent studies suggest that hyper type I IFN responses in TNF-stimulated B6.<italic>Sst1<bold><sup>S</sup></bold></italic> BMMs derive from aberrant oxidative stress that activates the kinase JNK and ultimately results in a non-resolving stress response that promotes necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhattacharya et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brownhill et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, mouse SP140 localizes to nuclear structures called PML bodies. PML bodies are implicated in a variety of cell processes, such as apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA damage response, senescence, and cell-intrinsic anti-viral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scherer and Stamminger, 2016</xref>). Whether or not the repressive effects of SP140 on type I IFN expression occur via the activity of PML bodies is an important outstanding question. Another major question is whether or how the repression of type I IFNs by SP140 is specific for bacterial infections and, if not, whether the presence of SP140 impairs anti-viral immunity.

Mice were aerosol infected using an inhalation exposure system (Glas-Col, Terre Haute, IN). A total of 9 ml of diluted culture was loaded into the nebulizer calibrated to deliver ~20–50 bacteria per mouse as confirmed by measurement of CFUs in the lungs 1 day following infection. Mice were sacrificed at various days post-infection (as described in figure legends) to measure CFUs and RNA levels. All but one lung lobe was homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 0.05% Tween-80, and serial dilutions were plated on 7H11 plates supplemented with 10% oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, and catalase and 0.5% glycerol.

The authors have previously shown that this susceptibility is attributed to higher levels of type I IFN signaling and in particular, the ISG IL-1Ra. The sst1 locus contains many genes that could be contributing to the differential susceptibility in C3HeB/Fej mice, and the model in the field was that differences in Sp110 expression was a likely candidate to explain the susceptibility. However, in this manuscript, the authors show that it is not lower expression of Sp110, but instead decreased expression of another gene in the sst1 locus, Sp140, that contributes to the increased susceptibility of mice carrying the sst1S sequence to bacterial infections. This is a very significant and surprising finding, supported by very clear and convincing data from experiments performed with a high level of rigor. Although identification of the gene responsible for differences in susceptibility and outcomes during bacterial infections is an advance for the field, the manuscript stops there in terms of new insight and falls short of providing any additional information beyond what has already been published regarding how this gene or lucus is functioning to regulate immune responses to infection. This limited scope embodies the major concern for this otherwise strong manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have suggested the importance of SP140 for resistance to Mtb, Legionella infections in mice. They also provide evidence for IFNaR signalling in mediating the increased susceptibility of SP140-/- mice.

Surprisingly, mice deficient in the original candidate gene within this locus, SP110, showed no change in susceptibility to infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. In contrast, the authors found that loss of a second gene in this locus, SP140, recapitulated many phenotypes seen in the SST1 mouse, including increased Type I IFN. SP140 susceptibility was reversed by blocking these exacerbated type I IFNs, similar to SST1 mice. RNAseq analysis identify changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs. The strengths of this paper are the careful and controlled experiments to target and analyze mouse mutants within a notoriously challenging region with homopolymers. Their results are robust, convincing and will be of broad interest to the field of immunology and host-pathogen interactions. Convincingly identifying a single gene within this region that recapitulates many aspects of the SST1 mouse is very important. While a minor weakness is the lack of any mechanistic understanding of how SP140 functions, this is overcome by the impact of the other findings and it is anticipated that this mouse will now be a key resource to dissect the mechanisms of susceptibility in much greater detail.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67290.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers all agree that this is an important manuscript that would benefit from more thorough comparisons between Sp110-/-, Sp140-/-, and Sst1S mice.

Are any of the lesions hypoxic?</p></disp-quote><p>The lesions observed in our histology samples are not hypoxic, since these samples are taken at a timepoint before hypoxia develops (Harper et al. (2012) PMC3266133). Importantly, we do not believe that hypoxia is the key to the susceptibility phenotype of these mice since we can see increased bacterial burdens before the mice reach the point at which the lesions become hypoxic. Our focus has been on the early immunological phenotypes that contribute to elevated CFU burdens. Others in the field may be interested in pursuing the hypoxia phenotype but this is not the focus of our paper. Hypoxia is also technically challenging to pursue since it only emerges at late timepoints. Similarly, we are not convinced that the cell death exhibited by B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> BMMs is driving the susceptibility of the mice. Indeed, we do not know how to specifically eliminate the cell death response in order to study its importance. For this reason, any discussion of the role of cell death would be purely speculative and thus our manuscript focuses on the hyper type I IFN production seen in both the B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> and Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice. Because Ifnar deficiency rescues the susceptibility/CFU burdens of the mice, it is clear that type I IFNs are driving the disease phenotypes, and thus this is the focus of our manuscript. Nevertheless, to satisfy the reviewers, we have now included data in the revised manuscript showing that both B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> and Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> BMMs die upon treatment with polyI:C (Figure 3 <bold>−</bold> figure supplement 1, lines 209-216). Importantly, this cell death response is reduced or eliminated by crosses to Ifnar<sup>–/–</sup> mice, again emphasizing the primary importance of type I IFNs to the phenotype(s) of these mice.</p><p>We emphasize that we have fully compared CFUs and susceptibility for multiple bacterial infections in vivo, as well as transcriptional changes during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infections in vivo, for both B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> and Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice. These mice are essentially indistinguishable in terms of susceptibility to bacterial infection in vivo, and exhibit highly similar transcriptional responses to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. As elaborated below, we have also expanded our comparison of lung pathology for B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> and Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice. We feel that our studies establish the main claim of the manuscript, which is not that B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> and Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice are identical, but rather, that loss of Sp140 is responsible for the susceptibility of Sst1<sup>S</sup> mice to bacterial infections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The pathology comparisons seem relatively superficial and could be quantified and examined more in depth to convincingly claim the effects of the Sst1S mice are recapitulated. In general, a more thorough histological analysis with more sections throughout the manuscript would be beneficial and aid in quantification. Particularly since this is a key feature of the Sst1S mice.</p></disp-quote><p>As argued above, we don’t necessarily believe that the histopathology seen in Sst1<sup>S</sup> mice is the key to understanding the Sst1<sup>S</sup> phenotype. Again, CFU burdens are clearly elevated in Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice prior to the development of the highly organized/necrotic/hypoxic lesions, so we tend to think that the advanced features of these lesions are a late downstream consequence of a loss of bacterial control and is not therefore something we decided to focus on. Nevertheless, the point about better characterizing the histology is well taken. We have included a more in-depth analysis of the histology performed by a trained pathologist (newly added author Stephen Nishimura) and included scoring of macrophage, lymphoid, and granulocyte infiltration as well as extent of necrosis, in Figure 2 − figure supplement 2. We have also expanded our discussion of the histology in the paper (lines 165-173). As discussed above, at the relatively early timepoint analyzed (day 25), we do not observe dramatic differences in histology, but we do observe a trend of increased granulocyte infiltration for both B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> and Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> lungs. Disease does appear to be more severe in the Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> lungs as compared to Sst1<sup>S</sup> lungs, but we do not wish to overemphasize this, as the differences are not statistically significant, and may be due to a small amount of residual Sp140 function in Sst1<sup>S</sup> mice, or alternatively, due to microbiota differences between the strains. We have expanded our discussion to make these points. Again, our genetic data suggest that type I IFNs are the main driver of the Sst1<sup>S</sup> phenotype and so we have focused our comparison to Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice on this aspect of the phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 3A, the Sp140-/- mice appear to drive even more type I IFN than Sst1 animals. Is this difference significant? How do the authors interpret these findings?</p></disp-quote><p>This difference is significant and is now clearly marked in the figure and discussed further in the text (lines 219-224). As the reviewers have suggested, this difference could potentially derive from the partial low expression of Sp140 in B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup>, or possibly due to other differences (e.g., expression of Sp110, or microbiota differences) between the strains. We do not believe this difference is of major functional importance as the CFU at this timepoint is indistinguishable for B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> vs. Sp140<sup>–/–</sup>, there are no significant differences in weight loss or survival upon <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection between B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> and Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice, and the transcriptomes of both B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> and Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> both show an elevated ISG signature upon <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. Furthermore, the differentially expressed genes between B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> and Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> are not annotated as type 1 interferon stimulated genes, and we did not see statistically significant differences in expression for the interferon stimulated gene Il1rn genes between B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> and Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (Figure 4 − figure supplement 1). We hypothesize that above a certain threshold, a moderate increase in type I IFN that we observe in Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice as compared to B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> mice does not necessarily translate to further increased susceptibility to bacterial infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 2, the figure could be better labeled to distinguish A and B with RNA vs Protein.

However, despite this limitation, our replicates show very similar patterns of gene expression and are sufficient to establish the broad claims we make in the manuscript. We were also able to observe significant differences in expression of numerous ISGs between B6, B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup>, and Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice. Elevated type I interferon levels in Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection were confirmed by RT-qPCR (Figure 3A), and we confirmed the hypothesis that elevated type I interferon drove susceptibility of Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice by infecting Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> Ifnar<sup>–/–</sup> mice. To further address the reviewer’s concern, we have also included new RT-qPCR data that confirms the elevated levels of the type 1 interferon stimulated gene Il1rn in our RNA-seq data for B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> and Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice (Figure 4 − figure supplement 1). Because of batch effects, and experiment-to-experiment variability in in vivo lung infections, adding an additional replicate is not straightforward. We do not believe that additional RNAseq replicates would change the conclusions of our paper or even provide further significant insights into the phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors mention that they did not observe a consistent difference between the Sp140-/- and Sst1S mice, however, these strains are not completely overlapping in the expression profiling analysis. This could be because Sst1S has some expression of Sp140, whereas the KO has none, but this should be discussed. It would also be helpful to include WT B6 in the heatmaps in 4C and D.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and have expanded our discussion of the transcriptional differences between B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> and Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice in the text (lines 263-268). We do not expect B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> and Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice to be transcriptionally identical, due to the loss of expression of Sp110 in B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> mice and possibly additional background or microbiota differences. However, as we state in our paper, our analysis shows that these mice show highly similar transcriptional responses to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. The B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> and Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> samples clearly cluster together along the PC1 axis in Figure 4A, which account for 77% of the variance in our RNA-seq data, and only separate for PC2, which accounts for only 9% of the variance in our data (lines 234-235). These samples also cluster together in Figure 4B, and in Figure 4E we show that differentially expressed genes between B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> and Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection are of relatively moderate significance, with the expected exception of Sp110. Again, our conclusion is not that Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice are identical to B6.Sst1<sup>s</sup> mice, but rather that Sp140 deficiency is responsible for the type I IFN-driven susceptibility to bacterial infection in B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> mice. The heatmaps in 4C and 4D display fold change relative to infected WT B6, which is now clarified in the figure legend, so showing this condition would not be informative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 2, the levels of Sp140 protein in the Sp110-/- mice should be included in panel B to show that protein expression is intact (not just transcript) to rule out epistatic effects of missing both Sp140 and Sp110.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we agree that understanding the relative contributions of Sp110 and Sp140 is important, we do not understand the reasoning behind the experiment the reviewers suggest or what potential &quot;epistatic effects&quot; the reviewers have in mind. Note that we find that Sp110<sup>–/–</sup> exhibit wild-type resistance to infection. If Sp140 protein expression is ablated in Sp110<sup>–/–</sup> mice, we would predict the mice would phenocopy the susceptibility of B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> mice, which lack both Sp140 and Sp110. In other words, we fail to understand how Sp140 would be epistatic to Sp110 (i.e., how would loss of Sp140 obscure the phenotype of Sp110 deficiency?) since we know that loss of Sp140 alone (or in combination with loss of Sp110) results in susceptibility to infection. One interesting possibility might be that upregulation of Sp140 in Sp110<sup>–/–</sup> mice could explain their resistance to bacterial infection. However, from our RNA-seq analysis, we observe very minor changes in transcript levels of Sp140 in our Sp110<sup>–/–</sup> mice during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection relative to B6. We have added an additional supplement showing the expression of SP family members (Sp100, Sp110, Sp140) in both Sp110<sup>–/–</sup> and Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice (Figure 4—figure supplement 2; lines 249-258). We found that there is no significant difference in the levels of Sp100 in Sp110<sup>–/–</sup> mice compared to B6 or B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup>. If anything, we observed a small decrease (rather than increase) in the expression of Sp140 in Sp110<sup>–/–</sup> mice relative to B6 mice, but this change in Sp110<sup>–/–</sup> mice is less than 2-fold and has a relatively high adjusted p-value (0.0343). Conversely, Sp140 is significantly upregulated in Sp110<sup>–/–</sup> mice compared to B6.Sst1<sup>S</sup> mice (fold change = 3.3849, adjusted p-value =1.49E-14 ). Overall, we do not observe major changes in the expression of other SP family members in Sp110<sup>–/–</sup> and Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice. Therefore, we believe that the targeting of these genes had specific rather than unanticipated epistatic effects.</p><p>In our view, however, the key experiment is to ensure that SP110 protein is present in Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice, which are susceptible to bacterial infection. This experiment is important to rule out any effects of the loss of Sp140 on Sp110 expression, and to demonstrate that Sp110 is not sufficient to protect against bacterial infection. We show normal SP110 expression in Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> macrophages in Figure 2—figure supplement 1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors build off their previous data where they have identified differences in the sst1 locus as responsible for differences in susceptibility of B6 and C3HeB/Fej mice to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.

Our generation of Sp140 deficient mice allows us to demonstrate, for the first time, that Sp140 is a negative regulator of type I IFNs. By generating crosses between Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> and Ifnar<sup>–/–</sup> mice, we further demonstrate that type I IFNs mediate the susceptibility of Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and Legionella. The reviewer appears to believe that because IFNs were previously shown to mediate the phenotype of Sst1<sup>S</sup> mice that somehow the function of Sp140 was already known. By contrast, we feel that in fact the function of Sp140 was not at all clear prior to our work, and that our work does indeed provide important mechanistic insight into the function of Sp140 as a regulator of type I IFNs. Sst1<sup>S</sup> mice contain many genetic differences compared to B6 mice. It is only because of our work that we can now go back and reinterpret the prior work on Sst1<sup>S</sup> mice, but this would not be possible without the work we have reported in this paper. Of course we would love to be able to describe more about the molecular mechanism by which Sp140 represses interferon transcription. This is indeed something we are working on. However, our preliminary experiments indicate this is not likely to be straightforward and will require considerable effort that is certainly beyond the scope of this current paper. It should be noted, for example, that Sp140 is in the same protein family as the well-known transcriptional regulator Aire. The mechanism by which Aire regulates gene expression has been studied for almost two decades and is still not entirely clear (and was certainly not clear in the initial foundational paper on Aire function published by Anderson et al. in Science in 2002). We expect the mechanism of Sp140 to be similarly complex. Importantly, we now know for the first time which protein to study mechanistically, i.e., SP140 instead of SP110.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:The authors have suggested the importance of SP140 for resistance to Mtb, Legionella infections in mice.

While we would agree that there is more to learn about the mechanism of SP140 function, it is not entirely clear to us what the reviewer means when they say that more “direct” evidence is needed for our claim that Sp140 regulates the IFN response during bacterial infection. We feel that the genetic experiments we provide are clear on this point. The reviewer may be thinking that we are proposing a specific mechanism, e.g., that our model is that Sp140 regulates IFN production by binding to the IFN β gene; although that is an appealing possibility, we agree that is not shown in our manuscript, and indeed, we are careful not to make any such claim. Indeed, we explicitly state that a more indirect mechanism is possible (line 390). What is clear, though, is that loss of Sp140 mediates susceptibility to infection via (direct or indirect) increases in type I IFN. We observe increased type I IFN responses in Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice in vivo, and moreover, we find that a cross of Sp140<sup>–/–</sup> mice to Ifnar<sup>–/–</sup> mice reverses susceptibility to infection. These results demonstrate that the dysregulation of type 1 IFN in the absence of Sp140 is not merely correlative, but in fact drives susceptibility to bacterial infection in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript Ji et al. carefully examine candidate genes driving a previously described susceptibility within the severe susceptibility to tuberculosis (sst1). Surprisingly, mice deficient in the original candidate gene within this locus, SP110, showed no change in susceptibility to infection with M. tuberculosis. In contrast, the authors found that loss of a second gene in this locus, SP140, recapitulated many phenotypes seen in the SST1 mouse, including increased Type I IFN. SP140 susceptibility was reversed by blocking these exacerbated type I IFNs, similar to SST1 mice. RNAseq analysis identify changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs. The strengths of this paper are the careful and controlled experiments to target and analyze mouse mutants within a notoriously challenging region with homopolymers. Their results are robust, convincing and will be of broad interest to the field of immunology and host-pathogen interactions. Convincingly identifying a single gene within this region that recapitulates many aspects of the SST1 mouse is very important. While a minor weakness is the lack of any mechanistic understanding of how SP140 functions, this is overcome by the impact of the other findings and it is anticipated that this mouse will now be a key resource to dissect the mechanisms of susceptibility in much greater detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their generous evaluation. Mechanistically, we do show that Sp140 affects resistance to bacterial infection via regulation of the interferon response, which we think is an important and technically non-trivial advance that provides insight into the function of Sp140. However, we agree that the mechanism for how Sp140 regulates type I IFN is not shown (nor is it claimed to be shown) and addressing this mechanism is now an important and exciting question for future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
