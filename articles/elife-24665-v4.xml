These phosphoproteins have extremely strong affinities for the holoenzymes they target with IC<sub>50</sub> values in the nanomolar/ subnanomolar range. Given that the binding of phosphatase and phosphorylated inhibitor is so tight, how can the enzyme’s activity be restored quickly when the phosphatase needs to be reactivated?</p><p>Current models assume that the phosphorylated inhibitors act as pseudosubstrates that bind to the phosphatase’s active site, blocking access of genuine substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Desdouits et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wakula et al., 2003</xref>). Either the enzyme cannot dephosphorylate the pseudosubstrate, or the dephosphorylation is too slow to contribute meaningfully to the system’s reboot. Thus, in these models, the inhibition can only be relieved by dissociation of the phosphorylated inhibitor from the enzyme and its subsequent dephosphorylation by other phosphatases. We argue that this scenario is incompatible with rapid changes of cellular state, because the very tight binding of the inhibitor to the phosphatase protects the inhibitor from other enzymes. Instead, the inhibited enzyme itself must dephosphorylate the inhibitor at a carefully calibrated rate that is slow enough to maintain inhibition but fast enough to permit speedy physiological responses.</p><p>We examine here whether this idea, which we call <italic>inhibition by unfair competition,</italic> might contribute to the rapidity of smooth muscle relaxation that occurs after treatment with vasodilators. We focus on the regulation of myosin light-chain phosphatase (MLCP), an enzyme comprised of a PP1 catalytic subunit and regulatory subunit MYPT1. MLCP targets the myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) and other proteins including ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) to affect cytoskeletal organization in smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grassie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hartshorne et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ito et al., 2004</xref>)]. Because dephosphorylation of MRLC deactivates myosin motor activity, MLCP is also a critical determinant of smooth muscle force: Agonist-mediated MLCP inhibition augments force development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hartshorne et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Isotani et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ito et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Somlyo and Somlyo, 2003</xref>), while nitric oxide simulation causes rapid MLCP re-activation concurrent with smooth muscle relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Etter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lubomirov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Somlyo and Somlyo, 2003</xref>). Genetic experiments have validated the indispensability of MLCP: Ablation of MYPT1 in mice causes embryonic lethality, while conditional knockout of MYPT1 in smooth muscles slows vasodilation and elevates blood pressure [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grassie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hartshorne et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ito et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>)].</p><p>Smooth muscle, neurons, and other cells contain a small endogenous regulatory protein specific to MLCP, named CPI-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eto et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">1997</xref>). This 17 kDa polypeptide becomes an MLCP inhibitor when it is phosphorylated at Thr<sup>38</sup> by any of several kinases, including PKC and ROCK, that are activated when smooth muscle is exposed to agonists [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eto, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eto and Brautigan, 2012</xref>)]. pCPI-17 binds tightly to MLCP with pThr<sup>38</sup> occupying the enzyme’s active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eto, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hayashi et al., 2001</xref>), thereby inactivating MLCP and increasing both MRLC phosphorylation and tissue contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 1998</xref>). CPI-17 Thr<sup>38</sup> and MRLC phosphorylation levels coordinately correspond with smooth muscle contraction during many physiological processes within smooth muscles and other cell types [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Niiro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Watanabe et al., 2001</xref>)].</p><p>Our concern here is the dephosphorylation of CPI-17 and reactivation of MLCP, which occur in parallel with rapid relaxation of smooth muscles within seconds of nitric oxide stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Etter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kitazawa et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">2009</xref>). Previous investigators have assumed that hydrolysis of pCPI-17 by MLCP is negligible and therefore envision that pCPI-17 must first dissociate from MLCP to allow other enzymes (hereafter called ‘PPU’ for ‘Protein Phosphatase Unknown’) to then rapidly dephosphorylate the freed inhibitor. Some investigators believe that these PPUs are PP1-containing holoenzymes different from MLCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eto and Brautigan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kitazawa, 2010</xref>), but others concluded that the CPI-17 dephosphorylating enzymes are PP2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hersch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Obara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takizawa et al., 2002</xref>) and/or PP2C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Takizawa et al., 2002</xref>). However, regardless of the identity of PPU, these previous models do not adequately consider the consequences of the very tight binding of pCPI-17 to MLCP, which some experiments suggest is subnanomolar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eto et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2000</xref>). This binding could protect pCPI-17 from any PPU enzymes, implying that MLCP reactivation must depend on its own dephosphorylation of its own inhibitor by the unfair competition principle.</p><p>Evaluating this possibility requires careful quantitative analysis. To this end, we have measured the key parameters including the pCPI-17/MLCP and pCPI-17/PPU dephosphorylation kinetic constants, the effective PPU concentration (which we resolve into two separate components), and the effect of competing substrates on the dephosphorylation of pCPI-17 by PPU and MLCP. We use these and prior experimental values to model quantitatively the time-courses of pCPI-17 dephosphorylation and MLCP reactivation during vasodilation. We show that, because MLCP effectively protects pCPI-17 against other phosphatases, only models that include MLCP’s dominating dephosphorylation of pCPI-17 can explain the experimental physiological measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitazawa et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that a similar unfair competition mechanism is important for the release of PP2A-B55 from inhibition by phosphorylated Endosulfine (pEndos) during exit from mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). The fact that this mechanism operates to control two different phosphatases of the PPP family [PP2A-B55 and PP1-MYPT1 (MLCP)] suggests that it is ancient and evolved prior to the duplication and divergence of PPP phosphatase genes in early eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Current models for pCPI-17 inactivation are unlikely to account for the rapidity of smooth muscle relaxation</title><p>Adding the vasodilator sodium nitroprusside to contracted rabbit femoral artery leads to maximal dephosphorylation of pCPI-17 with a half-life <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> ~ 10 s, resulting in near-simultaneous phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain and a decrease in contractile force soon thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitazawa et al., 2009</xref>).

Reported measurements for the IC<sub>50</sub> of the inhibition of MLCP by thiophosphorylated CPI-17 [thio(p)CPI-17], which cannot be dephosphorylated, fall within the range of 0.12–6 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erdődi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eto et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hayashi et al., 2001</xref>). Because, for tight-binding inhibitors, the <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> is lower than the IC<sub>50</sub> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), we can estimate that <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> (= <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>/<italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic>) is minimally 1.2 × 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and would need to be more than 6 × 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> if the <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> were as low as 0.12 nM. Such association rates are very fast: In a recent tabulation of the kinetic parameters of 144 protein complexes, only two had <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> values in excess of 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Archakov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moal and Bates, 2012</xref>). In contrast, the corresponding association constants for the potential PPU enzymes are probably less than 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McWhirter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Price and Mumby, 2000</xref>). Therefore, unless the concentration of accessible PPU is orders of magnitude greater than the concentration of unbound MLCP, rebinding will strongly retard dephosphorylation by PPU.</p><p>Fast rebinding would also sequester pCPI-17 regenerated from CPI-17 by kinases such as PKC and ROCK, which likely retain residual activity during smooth muscle relaxation. Such residual kinase activity is particularly likely when vasodilators are added in the presence of agonists such as histamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Etter et al., 2001</xref>) or phenylephrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitazawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shibata et al., 2015</xref>). As one example, two indicators of ROCK activity (pRhoA Ser<sup>188</sup> and pMYPT1 Thr<sup>853</sup>) remained almost unchanged after vasodilator administration even when pCPI-17 decreased to a minimum level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitazawa et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> presents a more realistic model that accounts for these counteracting processes. We show below that the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> for pCPI-17 lies at the lower end of the reported thio(p)CPI-17 IC<sub>50</sub> range and is ~0.5 nM. Thus, even in this model, <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic> cannot be much higher than 0.07 s<sup>−1</sup> because the requisite <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic> [= (<italic>k<sub>off</sub> + k<sub>cat</sub>)/K<sub>m</sub></italic>] would be unrealistically high. The net rates at which pCPI-17 is dephosphorylated and free MLCP is created therefore must be slower than for the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> to a degree that depends on the relative concentrations and kinetic properties of all the players (CPI-17, MLCP, PPU, and PKC/ROCK). We present below a mathematical treatment of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> model using values for these parameters determined from the literature and from our own experiments. For the time being, we emphasize simply that the actual rate of MLCP reactivation observed experimentally [<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> ≈ 10 s; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitazawa et al., 2009</xref>)] is approximately 10-fold faster than the rate achievable in cells through the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> model.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MLCP can dephosphorylate pCPI-17 at a physiologically relevant rate</title><p>The discussion above suggests that the rapid reactivation of MLCP requires some method to rid the enzyme of the pCPI-17 inhibitor other than simple dissociation. The obvious strategy would be for MLCP itself to dephosphorylate pCPI-17, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. This idea is plausible because pThr<sup>38</sup> of MLCP- bound pCPI-17 is located at the enzyme’s active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eto, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eto et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>However, because it is small, it has been difficult to measure the rate of MLCP-mediated pCPI-17 dephosphorylation, and previous reports have only been able to place an upper bound (&lt;0.1 s<sup>−1</sup>) on its value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hayashi et al., 2001</xref>). A <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> toward the upper limit of this range would be consistent with the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, but a significantly smaller value would not. Therefore, it was important to determine if MLCP can dephosphorylate pCPI-17 at a rate fast enough to account for its dephosphorylation during muscle relaxation.</p><p>To this end, we prepared MLCP by transiently transfecting HEK-293 CRL-1573 cells with a construct overexpressing FLAG-tagged MYPT1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that a complex containing PP1β/δ (PPP1CB) and MYPT1 was obtained. This preparation lacks a small M20 subunit that is found in MLCP purified from tissues but whose role has never been clarified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ito et al., 2004</xref>), so we performed multiple tests of the enzyme’s functional authenticity. Consistent with the known activities of MLCP, we found that the complex we purified is able to dephosphorylate the myosin regulatory light chain (pMRLC); the C terminal domain (pC-ERMAD) of ERM proteins, which are physiological MLCP substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eto et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fukata et al., 1998</xref>)]; and the nonspecific substrate myelin basic protein (pMyBP). The assays with all three substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) were linear with respect to time and enzyme concentrations under the experimental conditions used [notably, in the absence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, which can induce artifactual activities of PPP phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Watanabe et al., 2003</xref>)]. Moreover, as shown below, dephosphorylation of all three substrates was inhibited by the drugs okadaic acid and calyculin A, with IC<sub>50</sub> values in the identical range of published studies. The purified recombinant complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) thus has properties very similar to those of authentic MLCP.

For this reason, an accurate measure of the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> for the dephosphorylation of pCPI-17 by MLCP is critically important. We estimated this value first from classical Michaelis-Menten experiments determining the initial velocity as a function of pCPI-17 concentration; this method indicated the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> to be ~3 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, this value is likely a considerable overestimate because, in samples with the requisite low concentrations of pCPI-17, substantial proportions of the substrate were depleted during the reaction.</p><p>We therefore refined this estimate using a variant of a more accurate method developed for tight-binding reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Takai et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Williams et al., 2014</xref>) — by measuring the ability of the pCPI-17 dephosphorylation reaction to compete with inhibition by okadaic acid (OA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) or by calyculin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) for the active site of MLCP. The first step was to measure accurately the <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic>s of these inhibitors for MLCP using pMRLC, pC-ERMAD, and pMyBP substrates (blue, green, and black lines, respectively in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic>s can be calculated from, and are close to, the IC<sub>50</sub>s because these substrates have large <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic>s, and thus cannot compete with the inhibitors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The experiments gave an OA <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> of 20 ± 2 nM (<italic>n</italic> = 7), which is comparable with many published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alessi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ishihara et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mitsui et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shirazi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Swingle et al., 2007</xref>); and a calyculin A <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> range of 0.13–0.22 nM (<italic>n</italic> = 4), which is slightly lower than the value previously reported for inhibition of the catalytic subunit of PP1 by this drug [0.4 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Swingle et al., 2007</xref>)]. The second step was to determine the OA and calyculin A IC<sub>50</sub>s for the dephosphorylation of pCPI-17 by MLCP (red lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which were found to be more than one order-of-magnitude higher than those for the other substrates. The reason is that the very high affinity of pCPI-17 for MLCP allows pCPI-17 to compete effectively with the small molecule inhibitors; therefore, higher concentrations of the drugs are needed to inhibit pCPI-17 dephosphorylation. Analysis of the combined results, as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, gave <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> = 0.48 ± 0.03 nM [<italic>n</italic> = 8 (OA); <italic>n</italic> = 3 (calyculin A)] for the pCPI-17/MLCP reaction.

In contrast, in the presence of pCPI-17, the rate of pC-ERMAD dephosphorylation stayed low at early time points, when pCPI-17 is in excess of MLCP, but it then began to increase, presumably when the concentration of pCPI-17 was reduced to the concentration of MLCP.

In this situation, essentially all pCPI-17 dephosphorylation must be catalyzed by MLCP. Only when pCPI-17 is in excess of MLCP will any appreciable amount of the substrate be available to other phosphatases.</p><p>We tested this inference using concentrated mouse uterus extracts that more closely approximate the intracellular situation. These experiments compared the kinetic properties of the phosphatases responsible for pCPI-17 dephosphorylation and their sensitivities to OA-inhibition when the pCPI-17 concentration was either much greater than, or much smaller than, the MLCP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Based on previous measurements of the physiological MLCP concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alessi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shirazi et al., 1994</xref>) and accounting for extract dilution, the MLCP concentration in these extracts was ~0.08 μM. We expect that when the pCPI-17 concentration is in great excess (i.e., 1.35 μM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), almost all its dephosphorylation will be due to PP2A-like enzymes rather than MLCP, given their much greater <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic>s. Because OA inhibits these PPU phosphatases with subnanomolar <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic>s, the IC<sub>50</sub> is determined by, and allows us to compute, the PP2A-like PPU concentration in the extract [and by extension, the concentration of these enzymes in smooth muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>)]. In contrast, when the pCPI-17 concentration is commensurate with, or lower than, the MLCP concentration (i.e. [pCPI-17]=0.09 μM or 0.01 μM, respectively), unfair competition predicts that most pCPI-17 will be sequestered by MLCP and that the IC<sub>50</sub> will be large because a high OA concentration is needed to compete with the tight pCPI-17/MLCP binding. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> conform to these predictions. In particular, note that the IC<sub>50</sub> for OA increases roughly 10× as the pCPI-17 concentration decreases from 1.35 μM to 0.01 μM because the identity of the relevant pCPI-17 phosphatase changes from PPU to MLCP.</p><p>The dephosphorylation of pC-ERMAD serves as a control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. In the concentrated extracts, more than 75% of the activity against this substrate is due to PP1-containing enzymes [mostly, but not exclusively, MLCP; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fukata et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2015</xref>)]. Because the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> for the dephosphorylation of pC-ERMAD by MLCP (&gt;2.5 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) is much higher than the <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> for OA (~20 nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), pC-ERMAD cannot compete effectively with OA for the active site of MLCP and other PP1-containing holoenzymes. We therefore anticipated that the OA IC<sub>50</sub> for the dephosphorylation of pC-ERMAD in concentrated uterus extracts should be unaffected by varying the substrate concentration.

The half-life for pCPI-17 dephosphorylation in the absence of MLCP activity (column A, top) is ~10× longer than the experimental ~10 s. As a result, the reactivation of MLCP is very slow (column B, top), as is the consequent dephosphorylation of MRLC (column C, top). The fit of this PPU-alone model to the published results is poor. On the other hand, an unfair competition system in which MLCP dephosphorylates pCPI-17 with the kinetic parameters we determined provides a good fit to the published data (bottom row). Interestingly, the rapidity of these events is virtually unaffected whether the system has no PPU activity or the substantial PPU activity indicated by our measurements (compare the middle and bottom rows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This outcome emerges because the contracted muscle starts out with MLCP in small excess of pCPI-17, so essentially all pCPI-17 is bound to MLCP, and the half-lives for pCPI-17 and MRLC dephosphorylations are determined almost exclusively by the <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> for the dephosphorylation of pCPI-17 by MLCP. That is, even though the tissue is well provisioned with PPU enzymes, they cannot access the MLCP-bound pCPI-17. We conclude that MLCP dephosphorylation of pCPI-17 is both necessary and sufficient for its reactivation during vasodilation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>pCPI-17 dephosphorylation by MLCP is not importantly affected by physiological levels of MYPT1 inhibitory phosphorylation</title><p>The MYPT1 subunit of MLCP is subject to inhibitory phosphorylations at Thr<sup>696</sup> and Thr<sup>853</sup>.

Because the amounts of MLCP used were too small to obtain reliable direct measurements of its thiophosphorylation level, we confirmed that our treatment inhibited its activity to at least the physiological extent using pC-ERMAD as a control substrate. ROCK phosphorylation of MLCP reduced MLCP’s dephosphorylation of pC-ERMAD by ~70%, which is essentially the same as the maximum decrease in MLCP phosphatase activity observed in previous in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Feng et al., 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ichikawa et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Khasnis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Murányi et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Murányi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wooldridge et al., 2004</xref>).

When the rate of phosphorylation decreases during relaxation (due to downregulation of PKC and other kinases targeting the pThr<sup>38</sup> site of CPI-17), MLCP is able to restart its own action against its normal substrates by dephosphorylating pCPI-17.</p><p>We demonstrated the various facets of this hypothesis in vitro using purified components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), using crude extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), and by in silico modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). We showed that unfair competition is necessary for timely reactivation of myosin phosphatase because mechanisms that depend solely on the dissociation of pCPI-17 from MLCP would be far too slow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In fact, the modeling in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> substantially underestimates the importance of unfair competition for the rapidity of smooth muscle relaxation because the MYPT1 regulatory subunit tethers the phosphatase to myosin filaments [reviewed by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Khasnis et al., 2014</xref>)]. In the vicinity of these filaments, the ratio of MLCP relative to PPU enzymes would be much higher than the cellular average used in the calculations.</p><p>The total CPI-17 concentration is large [~7 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kitazawa and Kitazawa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Woodsome et al., 2001</xref>)], but our calculations using the data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitazawa et al.

This conclusion is supported by recent experimental studies. First, only a fraction of total CPI-17 is phosphorylated even in contracted arteries; the amount of pCPI-17 roughly corresponds to the concentration of MLCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kitazawa and Kitazawa, 2012</xref>). Second, in mice whose arteries contain a conditional knockout of MYPT1, the levels of pCPI-17 present after norepinephrine stimulation are considerably lower than those in stimulated wild-type animals, even though the total concentration of CPI-17 is unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Qiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>). Our interpretation of this latter result is that the MYPT1 knockout exposed pCPI-17 to other phosphatases (PPUs) that dephosphorylated it rapidly.</p><p>We therefore envision that the role of PPU phosphatases in this mode of MLCP regulation is simply to ensure that cells always have little free pCPI-17 that is not bound by MLCP. The contractile apparatus thus can respond quickly and efficiently to reduction in the activities of CPI-17-targeting kinases such as PKC because, upon addition of a vasodilator, each MLCP molecule needs only to dephosphorylate the pCPI-17 molecule with which it is already associated. This idea explains why the speeds of pCPI-17 dephosphorylation and MLCP reactivation predicted by our model are virtually unaffected by PPU activity during the transition to vasodilation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, middle and bottom rows). A curious corollary of this concept is that MLCP, the enzyme inhibited by pCPI-17, is ultimately responsible for protecting its inhibitor from the action of other phosphatases. If MLCP did not have this protective function, the intracellular concentration of pCPI-17 even during contraction would likely be too low to be of much significance in determining muscle tension.</p><p>If only the small fraction of CPI-17 that is phosphorylated is of relevance to MLCP inhibition, why do smooth muscle cells have such high levels of total CPI-17 [~7 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kitazawa and Kitazawa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Woodsome et al., 2001</xref>)]? We suggest that high total CPI-17 may be needed to maintain even the small amount of pCPI-17 needed for inhibition. The CPI-17 kinases (e.g. PKC and ROCK) need to generate pCPI-17 at a rate sufficient to counteract the pCPI-17 phosphatases (MLCP and PPU). A requirement for high total CPI-17 may be particularly acute because most CPI-17 is cytosolic, while activated PKC and ROCK go to the plasma membrane upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gong et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haller et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Woodsome et al., 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Downregulation of CPI-17-directed kinases is likely sufficient to explain the rapid phase of vasodilation</title><p>The unfair competition model quantitatively explains SNP’s near-term (within 30 s) experimentally measured effects on CPI-17 and MRLC phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitazawa et al., 2009</xref>) as consequences of a single event: an approximately 50% decrease in the activity of the kinases targeting CPI-17 Thr<sup>38</sup>. Although we do not know of studies directly measuring the activities of these enzymes in response to vasodilator administration, the same report established the importance of their downregulation under the conditions employed, because pCPI-17 levels did not decrease after SNP addition in the presence of phorbol esters that artificially ‘clamp’ the activities of these kinases at high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitazawa et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The major kinases responsible for Thr<sup>38</sup> phosphorylation are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PKC, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eto et al., 2001</xref>), and Rho-associated kinase [ROCK; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kitazawa et al., 2000</xref>)]. We believe that inactivation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PKC is of greatest consequence here because a straightforward mechanism could cut its activity significantly within a few seconds [reviewed by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitazawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Somlyo and Somlyo, 2003</xref>)]. Nitric oxide (NO) released from SNP stimulates guanylyl cyclase to synthesize cGMP, which activates Protein kinase G (PKG). Phosphorylation of various PKG targets indirectly lowers levels of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a cofactor for several forms of PKC. Because Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds PKC cooperatively (the Hill coefficient is between 2 and more than 8, depending on conditions), small decreases in the levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> can potentially be amplified into much larger decreases of PKC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egea-Jiménez et al., 2013</xref>). PKG can also downregulate ROCK, the other major CPI-17 Thr<sup>38</sup> kinase, by phosphorylating and thus inactivating RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sauzeau et al., 2000</xref>), although these changes in ROCK appear to be too slow to contribute much to the near-term events studied here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitazawa et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Some previous studies [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonnevier and Arner, 2004</xref>)] have posited that the addition of vasodilators such as SNP not only rapidly downregulates the kinases targeting CPI-17, but also upregulates one or more countering PPU phosphatases. Our identification of MLCP as the key physiological phosphatase for pCPI-17 brings this supposition into question. First, as discussed above, a PPU phosphatase would need to have a <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> in the nanomolar or lower range to be able to compete with MLCP. Second, our quantitative analysis shows that a two-fold downregulation of CPI-17-targeting kinases following SNP addition is sufficient to explain the rapid loss of CPI-17 phosphorylation due to dephosphorylation by MLCP (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> for details). The predicted half-life of this process is <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = log 2/<italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> ≈ 12 s, which is in excellent agreement with experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitazawa et al., 2009</xref>). Any additional processes that significantly increased this rate of CPI-17 dephosphorylation would not be consistent with the physiological observations.</p><p>Although we doubt that NO-induced vasodilation involves significant increases in PPU enzyme activities, we cannot exclude that events other than pCPI-17 dephosphorylation might help upregulate MLCP. One candidate is the phosphorylation of MYPT1 by PKG, which has been observed to increase considerably during the first minute after exposure to SNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitazawa et al., 2009</xref>). PKG can phosphorylate MYPT1 at several sites, including Ser<sup>668</sup>, Ser<sup>692</sup>, Ser<sup>695</sup>, and Ser<sup>852</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wooldridge et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yuen et al., 2011</xref>). The phosphorylations of two of these sites (Ser<sup>695</sup> and Ser<sup>852</sup>) appear not to affect MLCP activity directly, but instead prevent inhibitory Rho kinase-mediated phosphorylations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nakamura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wooldridge et al., 2004</xref>). However, after SNP treatment, these Rho kinase-mediated phosphorylations are removed too slowly to contribute to rapid MLCP activation within 15 s of SNP addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitazawa et al., 2009</xref>). It remains possible that PKG-mediated phosphorylations of certain isoforms of MYPT1 at the other two sites (Ser<sup>668</sup> and/or Ser<sup>852</sup>) might participate in MLCP activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yuen et al., 2014</xref>), but our results suggest that any such contributions are relatively modest. On its own, the observed change in pCPI-17 levels after SNP administration can account for the increase in MLCP activity during vasodilation.</p><p>Concomitant with the rapid decrease in pCPI-17 levels and the rapid activation of MLCP after vasodilator addition is the key downstream physiological readout: the rapid decrease in myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitazawa et al., 2009</xref>). In theory, lower levels of pMRLC could be achieved not only by upregulating MLCP, as detailed in this study, but also by inactivating myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Given that SNP treatment reduces Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and thus potentially can downregulate MLCK, it is perhaps surprising that the simulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> was successful even though it assumed MLCK function was constant. Perhaps, in the experimental system of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitazawa et al. (2009)</xref> analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, the SNP-induced decreases in the activity of CPI-17-targeting kinases were more important than any decrease in MLCK activity, which was likely at a very low basal level prior to SNP addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dimopoulos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Isotani et al., 2004</xref>). We note that even if MLCK inactivation plays a more significant role in determining MRLC phosphorylation during vasodilation than assumed by our model, no known pathway exists through which MLCK downregulation could impact the pCPI-17 levels or MLCP activities analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Unfair competition may provide a general mechanism for the regulation of PPP phosphatases by AGC kinases</title><p>We previously showed that unfair competition is central to another important physiological situation: cell cycle transitions into and out of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). During M phase, the PP2A-B55 phosphatase is inactivated by a mechanism involving small proteins of the Endosulfine/ARPP19 family (hereafter, Endos); these become PP2A-B55 inhibitors after their phosphorylation by the Greatwall kinase (Gwl) following the latter’s activation by Cdk1-Cyclin B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blake-Hodek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castilho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gharbi-Ayachi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mochida, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mochida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Williams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yu et al., 2006</xref>). Following inactivation of Cdk1-Cycliin B and Gwl at M phase exit, PP2A-B55 rapidly dephosphorylates pEndos and thus reactivates itself to attack mitosis-specific phosphosites. The dephosphorylation of pEndos by PP2A-B55 is both required and sufficient to account for the rapidity of pEndos dephosphorylation and of PP2A-B55 reactivation during M phase exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Williams et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Unfair competition requires that the inhibitor/substrate bind very tightly to the active site and be dephosphorylated there only slowly. These requirements hold for the dephosphorylations both of pCPI-17 by MLCP (during muscle relaxation) and of pEndos by PP2A-B55 (during M phase exit); in fact, the kinetic constants are nearly identical in the two cases (<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> = 0.48 ± 0.03 nM and 0.47 ± 0.014 nM, respectively; <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> = 0.06 ± 0.01 s<sup>−1</sup> and 0.02–0.07 s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively). Of greatest interest, the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic>s are both subnanomolar; that is, lower by 2–3 orders of magnitude than that for any previously described dephosphorylation reaction.</p><p>Unfair competition provides an economical regulatory mechanism during changing cellular conditions: Only the upstream kinase that phosphorylates the inhibitor needs to be controlled; the sequel is an automatic consequence of the kinetic properties of the phosphatase to which the inhibitor is bound. No other steps that would introduce complexity to the system, such as allosteric control of a putative PPU enzyme, are needed.</p><p>Moreover, if such additional complexity is to be avoided, then unfair competition is likely the inevitable consequence of the well-known fact that PPP catalytic subunits can target a wide variety of substrates. Thus, in the cell, many molecules are competing for the catalytic sites, and we can estimate experimentally the magnitude of this competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary f</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">ile 1</xref>). To inhibit an enzyme’s ability to dephosphorylate a large number of potential substrates, which will have a large aggregate concentration, a competitive inhibitor (e.g. pCPI-17 or pEndos) <italic>must</italic> have an extremely low <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> for its target phosphatase (e.g. MLCP or PP2A-B55). Given the necessity for such very strong affinity between enzyme and inhibitor, inactivation of the inhibitor by the same enzyme provides the only pathway that allows cells and tissues to reset their state rapidly (e.g. during muscle relaxation or M phase exit).</p><p>These two examples of unfair competition involve processes with different fundamental requirements. Cell cycle transitions must operate much like on-off switches: Cells can be either in interphase or M phase, but cannot remain in an intermediate state. On the other hand, smooth muscle contractility must be regulated like a rheostat: Arteries often must be able to respond in a graded fashion to changing mixtures of agonists and vasodilators. How can phosphatase modules, both governed by unfair competition, participate in processes with such disparate needs? We suggest that the explanation lies in the presence (Endos, M phase) or absence (CPI-17, vasoconstriction) of positive feedback mechanisms that can convert a modest change in the activity of an upstream regulatory kinase into a discrete ‘on-off’ signal.</p><p>At the beginning of M phase, positive feedback increases Gwl activity by two pathways. The first mechanism is direct: Partially phosphorylated Gwl phosphorylates some pEndos which partially inhibits PP2A-B55; this further increases Gwl activity, presumably by decreasing the rate of Gwl dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mochida et al., 2016</xref>). The other mechanism is indirect: pEndos inhibition of PP2A-B55 decreases the dephosphorylation of Cdc25 and Myt1/Wee1 by PP2A-B55, promoting the Cdk1 autoregulatory loop and consequently the activation of Gwl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blake-Hodek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Williams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yu et al., 2006</xref>) by raising the Gwl phosphorylation rate. Positive feedback also probably occurs at the end of M phase, when Gwl becomes dephosphorylated and turned ‘off’. Although PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mochida, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rogers et al., 2016</xref>) and perhaps other enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Della Monica et al., 2015</xref>) initiate Gwl inactivation, PP2A-B55 also likely plays a role in completing and then maintaining Gwl dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mochida et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yamamoto et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, we know of no data indicating that pCPI-17 influences the activity of PKC or other upstream kinases that govern CPI-17 phosphorylation. Therefore, no feedback exists, consistent with our analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> indicating that CPI-17 kinases are not turned off completely even in the presence of vasodilators. Our calculations instead indicate that, under the experimental conditions, SNP-treated smooth muscles retain a basal CPI-17 kinase activity that is about one-half that of the contracted state (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In other words, regulation of these kinases is graded rather than discontinuous.</p><p>It is striking that the kinases most likely to be involved in the phosphorylation of CPI-17 (PKC and ROCK) and Endos (Gwl) are all members of the AGC kinase family [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arencibia et al., 2013</xref>)]. This fact suggests that early in the evolution of the eukaryotic lineage, a prototypic AGC kinase phosphorylated an inhibitor of a prototypic PPP phosphatase and that the inhibitor and phosphatase interacted according to the logic of unfair competition. An intriguing speculation is that many of the other PPP holoenzymes that exist in eukaryotic cells eventually will be found to be regulated in similar ways by other AGC kinase family members.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>HEK293 CRL-1573 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jonathan Cooper (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Béla Novák (Reviewer #2) and Matthieu Bollen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Protein phosphatase PP1-MYPT1 is inhibited by a phosphorylated form of CPI-17 which has previously been proposed by various groups to act as a pseudosubstrate. In this manuscript it is demonstrated that pCPI-17 is actually a real substrate of PP1-MYPT1 that binds with an extremely high affinity but is dephosphorylated very slowly. This prevents the phosphatase from dephosphorylating other substrates as long as stoichiometric amounts of pCPI-17 are present, but also protects pCPI-17 from dephosphorylation by other phosphatases. The described regulation of PP1-MYPT1 by pCPI-17 through 'unfair competition' is similar to that of PP2A-B55 by p-endosulfine, which was previously reported by the same group. The data are interesting and convincing. However, as detailed below, the manuscript lacks some key information. Also, repetitive elements (both illustrations and text) should be removed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript is too long. In particular, the Introduction and Discussion sections are repetitive and not entirely to the point, and can improved by substantially reduced length.</p><p>2) The beginning of the manuscript Introduction should provide basic information concerning the biology of muscle relaxation and the role of protein phosphorylation for the non-expert.</p><p>3) The generality of &quot;unfair competition&quot; stated in the Abstract makes the current study appear to be an incremental advance. This is a good discussion point, but the inclusion of this information in the Abstract diminishes the study.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A and 3B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A and 7B</xref> show basically the same.

One of the two panels of each figure could be shown as a supplement.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers felt that the manuscript was too long (#1) and lost focus by raising the issue of the generality of unfair competition in the Abstract (#3). They also requested that we add: information to the Introduction concerning the biology of muscle relaxation and the role of protein phosphorylation in this process (#2); a new section of the Discussion providing a molecular explanation for the unusual kinetics of the pCPI-17/MLCP interaction (#6); and a new section of the Discussion explaining the need for a 7-fold molar excess of total CPI-17 to MLCP (#7). The reviewers asked us to split out panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> as supplementary figures (#4).</p><p>In response, we cut roughly 20% of the material from the original Introduction and Discussion. After addition of the new information requested, the revised Introduction is ~8% shorter than the original, and the revised Discussion is ~12% shorter. We removed mention of the generality of unfair competition from the Abstract and also split out the two figures as requested. We feel that these changes strengthened the paper and thank the reviewers for their suggestions.</p><p><italic>5) Figure 10 is difficult to interpret since C-ERMAD was used at a concentration far below its Km while CPI-17 was used at a concentration far above its K<sub>m</sub>. This experiment should be repeated at different concentrations of each substrate so that the effect of ROCK on the kinetic parameters can be deduced.</italic> </p><p>Here, the reviewers asked us to repeat and extend the experiments that had been reported in Figure 10 of the original submission so as to deduce the kinetic parameters of the interaction between pCPI-17 and ROCK-thiophosphorylated MLCP. Although this issue was not a central component of our work, it was indeed a weakness of the previous manuscript, and the reviewers’ comment impelled us to review the literature and our assumptions about the effects of the inhibitory phosphorylations on MLCP.</p><p>Our interpretation of our original data was that the Thr<sup>696</sup> phosphosite on MYPT1 (a subunit of MLCP) occupies the enzyme’s active site and thus works as a competitive inhibitor; thus, pCPI-17 with its extraordinarily low <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> would be less susceptible to this kind of inhibition than other substrates. An alternative explanation is that the MYPT1 phosphorylation is allosteric in a manner that affects the interaction of the phosphatase with pCPI-17 less than with other substrates. In fact, the literature on this point is confusing, with some evidence for both points of view.</p><p>After extensive consideration, we feel that we can in fact contribute very little to this topic because the amounts of MLCP we can purify are too small to quantitate the degree of MYPT1 phosphorylation; this would be essential to discriminating between models. And ultimately, this issue is beside the point of our manuscript. What we wanted most to do here was to determine whether this MYPT1 phosphorylation would negate our modeling in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> by slowing down substantially the action of MLCP on pCPI-17. We are confident that our results show that this is not the case. Our controls show that we are disrupting ~70% of the enzyme’s function (for whatever reason), which is a higher degree of inhibition than has ever been seen in vivo. Yet the dephosphorylation of pCPI-17 is inhibited only by 20%, making this an upper limit on the degree to which this mechanism would slow up the dephosphorylation of pCPI-17 by MLCP. Our models would be virtually unaffected by this small effect.</p><p>Therefore, we have not performed the requested experiment but instead changed our presentation of the results already obtained. We no longer use our data to distinguish the molecular mechanisms by which phosphorylations of MYPT1 affect MLCP activity, but instead mention only that these experiments show this phosphorylation can influence pCPI-17 dephosphorylation by MLCP only marginally. Much discussion has been removed and the figure has been downgraded to a supplement.</p><p><italic>6) A molecular explanation for the slow dephosphorylation rate of CPI-17 by PP1-MYPT1 is lacking and not discussed.</italic> </p><p>See response to comments #1-4.</p><p><italic>7) CPI-17 exists in a 7-fold molar excess to PP1-MYPT1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).
