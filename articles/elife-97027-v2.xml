Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, both pivotal in maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CISD1, a homodimeric mitochondrial iron-sulfur-binding protein, is a major target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination. We here discovered a heightened propensity of CISD1 to form dimers in Pink1 mutant flies and in dopaminergic neurons from PINK1 mutation patients. The dimer consists of two monomers that are covalently linked by a disulfide bridge. In this conformation CISD1 cannot coordinate the iron-sulfur cofactor. Overexpressing Cisd, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of CISD1, and a mutant Cisd incapable of binding the iron-sulfur cluster in <italic>Drosophila</italic> reduced climbing ability and lifespan. This was more pronounced with mutant Cisd and aggravated in Pink1 mutant flies. Complete loss of Cisd, in contrast, rescued all detrimental effects of Pink1 mutation on climbing ability, wing posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure. Our results suggest that Cisd, probably iron-depleted Cisd, operates downstream of Pink1 shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CISD1 as a potential therapeutic target.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Parkinson’s disease affects millions of people worldwide, causing progressively worse symptoms like stiffness, tremors and difficulty moving. These issues result from the death of neurons in the brain that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine. While most cases have no known cause, 10 to 15 per cent are due to inherited gene mutations. This includes mutations in the genes that code for the proteins PINK1 and Parkin which are essential for maintaining healthy mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell.</p><p>Mutations in this quality control system affect a protein called CISD1, which sits within the outer surface of the mitochondria. CISD1 contains a cluster of iron and sulfur ions, and is involved in regulating iron levels and mitochondrial energy production. However, its role in inherited cases of Parkinson’s disease, particularly those related to mutations in PINK1 and Parkin, is poorly understood.</p><p>To understand the impact of CISD1, Bitar et al. studied genetically modified fruit flies and dopamine-producing neurons from Parkinson’s patients with PINK1 mutations. This revealed that losing PINK1 activity led to higher levels of CISD1 proteins which lacked the iron-sulfur cluster due to a bond forming between two CISD1 molecules.</p><p>Reducing levels of the CISD1-equivalent protein in the flies helped to alleviate most of the symptoms caused by PINK1 and Parkin gene mutations, such as difficulties climbing and impaired wing posture. These findings suggest that iron-depleted CISD1 contributes to the symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease, underscoring its potential as a drug target.</p><p>Drugs that target CISD1 already exist, which could ease the way for further research. Recent studies have shown that cases of Parkinson’s related to mutations in PINK-1 share features with some non-inherited instances of the disease, suggesting that this approach could potentially benefit many patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>dopaminergic neurons</kwd><kwd>oxidative distress</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>iron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>445683311</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Methner</surname><given-names>Axel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>461705066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Venkataramani</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name><name><surname>Methner</surname><given-names>Axel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001866</institution-id><institution>Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C21/BM/15850547/PINK1-DiaPDs</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arena</surname><given-names>Giuseppe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PINK1 deficiency in Parkinson's disease models causes toxic oxidized and iron-depleted CISD1 yet CISD1 removal benefits PINK1 mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic> indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the fastest growing neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by rigor, tremor, and bradykinesia. These motor symptoms stem from the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain’s substantia nigra pars compacta (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pickrell and Youle, 2015</xref>). While most cases are sporadic, familial forms of PD are linked to mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in mitochondrial quality control like PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and Parkin (PRKN), providing valuable insights into the pathophysiology of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shulman et al., 2011</xref>). In healthy cells, PINK1 is continuously imported into mitochondria, where it is rapidly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Narendra et al., 2008</xref>). However, in unfit mitochondria with a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ<sub>m</sub>), PINK1 import stalls. When PINK1 accumulates on damaged mitochondria, it phosphorylates various proteins, including the E3 ubiquitin ligase PRKN. This phosphorylation activates PRKN, enabling it to attach ubiquitin to mitochondrial proteins. This ubiquitination acts as a signal for damaged mitochondria to be identified and engulfed by autophagosomes, initiating their degradation through mitophagy. This selective elimination of compromised mitochondria safeguards overall mitochondrial health and function (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Youle and Narendra, 2011</xref>). Much of this mechanistic understanding has been elucidated in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> where <italic>Pink1</italic> and <italic>Prkn</italic> loss of function results in profound changes of the mitochondrial ultrastructure causing mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired flight and climbing ability, and a shortened lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In addition to disturbances in mitochondrial quality control, disruptions in iron metabolism contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). PD patients exhibit elevated iron levels within the substantia nigra pars compacta, and this iron accumulation correlates with the severity of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dexter et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirsch et al., 1991</xref>). Notably, this iron dysregulation is apparent even in asymptomatic carriers of <italic>PRKN</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pyatigorskaya et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that it is an early event and correlates with mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, human dopaminergic neurons lacking PINK1 display inhibition of the iron-dependent mitochondrial aconitase, leading to accumulation of NAD<sup>+</sup> and depletion of essential metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bus et al., 2020</xref>). In flies, <italic>Pink1</italic> deficiency similarly results in inactivation of mitochondrial aconitase by impairing its labile iron-sulfur cluster, leading to oxidative distress and mitochondrial swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esposito et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wan et al., 2020</xref>). These findings highlight the relevance of iron dysregulation in the PD development and progression.</p><p>An important target protein of PINK1/PRKN crucial for iron homeostasis and redox homeostasis is CISD1, also known as mitoNEET (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mittler et al., 2019</xref>). CISD1 is a homodimeric protein N-terminally inserted into the outer mitochondrial membrane facing the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wiley et al., 2007a</xref>). CISD1 is ubiquitinated by PRKN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sarraf et al., 2013</xref>) and its levels are reduced upon dissipation of Δψ<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cunningham et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lazarou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McWilliams et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Narendra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Okatsu et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, CISD1 forms a complex with PRKN, and this interaction is markedly increased by activation of PINK1 and ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Narendra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sarraf et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the homolog of CISD1 is the most strongly ubiquitinated protein in response to Prkn overexpression in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martinez et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Functionally, CISD1 exists as a homodimer, and each monomer of CISD1 harbors an 2Fe/2S (2 iron/2 sulfur) cluster coordinated by three cysteines (Cys72,74,83) and one histidine (His87). In contrast, most conventional 2Fe/2S clusters are coordinated by four cysteines or two cysteines and two histidines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wiley et al., 2007b</xref>). This peculiarity renders the CISD1 2Fe/2S cluster more susceptible to oxidation. It was thus proposed that the transfer of the iron-sulfur cluster from CISD1 to stress-sensitive Fe/S proteins constitutes a cellular adaptive response that helps recovery from oxidative injury (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mittler et al., 2019</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, it has been demonstrated that the oxidized 2Fe/2S cluster of CISD1 can be transferred to iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferecatu et al., 2014</xref>), a bifunctional protein that can switch between two distinct enzymatic activities based on the availability of iron. When iron levels are sufficient, IRP1 binds an 2Fe/2S cluster, converting it into a functional aconitase enzyme. When iron levels are low, IRP1 loses its 2Fe/2S cluster and undergoes a conformational change. In this state, known as the ‘apo’ form, IRP1 functions as an RNA-binding protein and binds to specific RNA sequences called iron-responsive elements (IREs) located in the untranslated regions of target mRNAs (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rouault and Maio, 2017</xref>). CISD1 is capable of recycling the cytosolic apo-IRP1 to holo-aconitase by donating its 2Fe/2S cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Camponeschi et al., 2017</xref>). The fate of the remaining apo-CISD1 is unknown. In addition to its role in iron metabolism and defense against oxidative distress, CISD1 is also involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics and in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology. Cardiac myocytes from <italic>Cisd1</italic> knockout (KO) mice exhibit a reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wiley et al., 2007a</xref>), akin to KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) where this dysfunction is attributed to a reduction in the total cellular mitochondrial volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vernay et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there is a single ortholog of CISD1 initially named Cisd2 because it is slightly more similar to the mammalian CISD2 than to CISD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones et al., 2014</xref>) protein. Human CISD2 is located at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Overexpression of Cisd2 (this publication used the alternative name Dosmit) in fly muscles is detrimental and results in mitochondrial enlargement and the formation of double-membraned vesicles containing cytosolic proteins within mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), implicating Cisd2 in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology. Similar to human CISD1, fly Cisd2 is an Fe/S protein and all amino acids linked to cluster coordination are conserved. In addition, fly Cisd2 (this publication used the alternative name MitoNEET) interacts with IRP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huynh et al., 2019</xref>) further linking Cisd2 to iron homeostasis. Together these findings suggest that fly Cisd2 rather resembles the human mitochondrial homolog CISD1 and to avoid confusion, we will henceforth use Cisd for the fly ortholog. Based on the involvement of mammalian CISD1 in mitochondrial bioenergetics and quality control, iron metabolism and defense against oxidative distress – all hallmarks of PD – we aimed to investigate CISD1’s role in PD using both fly and mammalian model systems.</p><p>In our study, we identified CISD1, particularly its iron-depleted apo form, as a downstream mediator of the PD pathology induced by the loss of Pink1 and Prkn function. Apo-CISD1 accumulates in PINK1 patient-derived human dopaminergic neurons and apo-Cisd in mutant <italic>Pink1</italic> flies. Complete loss of <italic>Cisd</italic> rescues all detrimental effects of <italic>Pink1</italic> loss of function on climbing ability, wing posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure. In <italic>Prkn</italic> mutant flies, <italic>Cisd</italic> deficiency ameliorates climbing ability and wing posture impairments, but does not mitigate the reduction in lifespan. These findings strongly suggest that the buildup of iron-depleted CISD1 may contribute to the pathophysiology of both familial and sporadic PD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increased CISD1 dimer formation in human dopaminergic neurons from PD patients with a PINK1 Q456X mutation</title><p>To investigate a possible involvement of CISD1 and its homolog CISD2 in familial PD, we studied their expression levels in differentiated dopaminergic neurons from two distinct patients afflicted with autosomal-recessive PD caused by <italic>PINK1</italic> Q456X mutation.

We fused CISD1 with the two small subunits of NanoLuc luciferase, enabling us to quantify dimerization by measuring luminescence. Given the labile nature of CISD1’s iron-sulfur cluster due to its unconventional coordination by one histidine and three cysteines, we hypothesized that the presence or absence of this cluster might influence dimerization. We therefore mutated histidine 87 to cysteine (H87C) which results in a more stable 2Fe/2S complex coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conlan et al., 2011</xref>). Conversely, the mutation of cysteine 83 to serine (C83S) completely abolishes the ability of CISD1 to bind the 2Fe/2S complex. By comparing the dimerization patterns of the CISD1 variants, we observed a significant increase in dimerization for C83S CISD1, the mutant incapable of binding the iron-sulfur cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This finding suggested that iron-depleted CISD1 has a higher propensity for dimerization. To further validate these findings, we next employed an in silico approach to calculate the molecular hydrophobicity potential and the angle of rotation between two CISD1 WT models or two CISD1 C83S models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Polyansky et al., 2014</xref>).

To investigate this, we conducted our dimerization assay in cells subjected to a 2 hr treatment with the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide-<italic>p</italic>-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), a combination of the complex V inhibitor oligomycin and the complex III inhibitor antimycin A (A/O), or the iron chelator deferiprone, which triggers a distinct form of mitophagy independent of PINK1 and PRKN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2013</xref>). The 2 hr treatment was chosen to exclude alterations caused by degradation of CISD1. Remarkably, our results demonstrated that under these conditions only iron chelation resulted in increased dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) that mirrored the increased dimerization seen in the C83S mutant, which is unable to coordinate the 2Fe/2S complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To corroborate this, we expanded our analysis to WT MEF cells treated with deferiprone. Immunoblotting revealed increased dimer formation and even the presence of a CISD1 multimer under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Consequently, we conclude that the increased dimer formation in the <italic>PINK1</italic> mutant neurons likely represents the presence of apo-CISD1, a form of CISD1 devoid of its iron-sulfur cluster, and that this is caused by changes in the iron homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Increased Cisd dimer levels in <italic>Pink1</italic> mutant flies reflect an increased intermolecular disulfide bond between two Cisd molecules</title><p>We next investigated whether Pink1 loss of function in flies mirrors the human situation and impacts Cisd dimerization or possibly abundance.

We quantified total Cisd protein levels, i.e., monomer plus dimer and normalized them to actin. Additionally, we assessed the dimer/monomer ratio. This analysis unveiled reduced total Cisd protein levels in young Pink1 mutant flies compared to WT flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We were unable to replicate the previously reported age-dependent increase in Cisd abundance in WT flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2020</xref>) and Pink1<sup>B9</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martinez et al., 2024</xref>) flies although this was evident in many but not all samples indicating additional factors. When assessing the dimer/monomer ratio, we observed a significant increase in dimer levels in old Pink1<sup>B9</sup> flies compared to young Pink1<sup>B9</sup> flies and to old WT flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Age had no effect on dimerization of WT flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, Pink1 mutant flies manifest analogous alterations to those observed in dopaminergic neurons from patients afflicted by familial PD due to PINK1 Q456X mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To elucidate the nature of the dimer, we next used extremely reducing conditions of prolonged incubation with higher concentrations of DTT and tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine as a disulfide-bond breaking agent followed by boiling. This resulted in the loss of dimeric and an increase of monomeric Cisd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We also added the thiol alkylating agent <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide (NEM) during lysis and performed non-reducing immunoblotting in old Pink1<sup>B9</sup> flies compared to old WT flies.

Given the unavailability of functional antibodies against fly Pink1, we quantified <italic>Pink1</italic> mRNA levels to verify the loss of <italic>Pink1</italic> expression in <italic>Pink1<sup>B9</sup></italic> flies and to investigate potential dysregulations in <italic>Cisd</italic> KO flies. <italic>Pink1</italic> levels were reduced in <italic>Pink1<sup>B9</sup></italic> but unchanged in <italic>Cisd</italic> KO flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

The presence of this slow migrating form of CISD1/Cisd was age-dependent in flies and apparent in human dopaminergic neurons after 28 days of differentiation. We did not assess whether this increased even more in older cultures but such an age-dependent increase would be in line with the fact that PD usually becomes symptomatic at an older age. The slower-migrating form likely does not represent a ubiquitinated form, as treatment with the deubiquitinase USP2 had no effect on fly Cisd dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martinez et al., 2024</xref>). Additionally, it is improbable that the slower-migrating Cisd form is an unrelated protein, as under non-reducing conditions, fly Cisd shifted to the dimeric form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martinez et al., 2024</xref>) while harsh reducing conditions shifted Cisd to the monomeric form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Based on our experiments, we conclude that the slower-migrating form of CISD1/Cisd corresponds to a dimer caused by the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond between two molecules of CISD1/Cisd. The dimeric form has been described before even in recombinant CISD1. Under non-reducing conditions, recombinant CISD1 ran as a monomeric and a dimeric band while under reducing conditions using beta-mercaptoethanol only the monomeric band was detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>). Using proteomic analysis, it was determined that the disulfide bond forms between cysteine C83 and either C72 or C74 of CISD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>). Formation of the disulfide bond therefore results in loss of the Fe/S cluster because the residues involved in bond formation also coordinate the Fe/S cluster of CISD1. It is unclear what comes first, loss of the Fe/S cluster followed by disulfide bond formation or vice versa disulfide bond formation followed by loss of the Fe/S cluster. However, CISD1 C83S, a genetically engineered CISD1 incapable of binding the iron-sulfur cluster and probably also incapable of forming a disulfide bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>), has a higher propensity for dimer formation when analyzed in a cellular assay based on complementation of split luciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This suggests that Fe/S cluster loss comes first and results in an altered structure that facilitates the formation of the disulfide bond. The iron-sulfur cluster of CISD1 is easily lost because it is coordinated in an unconventional manner by one histidine (H) and three cysteines (C) instead of the more common 2H/2C or 4C coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wiley et al., 2007b</xref>). This serves to transfer the iron-sulfur cluster to other proteins as part of a cellular adaptive response that helps recovery from oxidative injury (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mittler et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>One protein that can accept the Fe/S cluster from holo-CISD1 is IRP1, as previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferecatu et al., 2014</xref>). Also in flies, Cisd physically interacts with holo-IRP1, and its deficiency renders flies more susceptible to iron depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huynh et al., 2019</xref>), as also observed by us for <italic>Pink1</italic> mutant flies. How apo-CISD1 is then reconstituted is rather unclear. A recent report suggested that CISD1 can receive its Fe/S cluster from its homolog CISD3 (aka MiNT) in the mitochondrial matrix via the porin VDAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karmi et al., 2022</xref>). So it appears possible that either this transfer is inhibited/attenuated or that the apo-CISD1/Cisd observed in <italic>PINK1</italic> mutant dopaminergic neurons and <italic>Pink1</italic> mutant flies constitutes a permanently fixed apo-CISD1/Cisd that cannot be reconstituted. This disruption could result in a defective recycling of cytosolic apo-IRP1 into holo-IRP1, leading on the one hand to a deficiency in cytosolic aconitase activity. Knockdown of CISD1 in cells indeed significantly reduces the cytosolic aconitase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tan et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, apo-IRP1 not only lacks aconitase activity but also binds to IREs in the mRNA of iron-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haile et al., 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haile et al., 1992b</xref>). Association with IREs in the 5’ untranslated region of ferritin mRNA inhibits ferritin translation resulting in less bound iron and an increase in free iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1997</xref>) while association with IREs in the 3’ untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the iron importers transferrin receptor 1 and SLC11A2 stabilizes the mRNAs and facilitates their translation resulting in increased iron import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Galy et al., 2010</xref>). Together the transcriptional changes caused by the presence of apo-IRP1 result in iron overload which is an important factor in the pathology associated with PD (recently reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). Our study also revealed increased total iron levels in Pink1 mutant flies. Notably, KO of PINK1 in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esposito et al., 2013</xref>), in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gautier et al., 2008</xref>), and in human dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bus et al., 2020</xref>) also results in a reduced aconitase activity in mitochondria. Mitochondrial aconitase contains an IRE in its 5’ untranslated region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 1996</xref>), making its expression subject to repression by apo-IRP1. The inactivation of mitochondrial aconitase caused by Pink1 loss of function triggers increased superoxide production, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esposito et al., 2013</xref>). Others reproduced these findings and reported that overexpression of mitoferrin, a mitochondrial iron transporter, mitigates the reduced mitochondrial aconitase activity, abnormal wing posture, flight deficits, and mitochondrial morphology defects associated with Pink1 loss of function by elevating mitochondrial bioavailable iron levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wan et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, KO of IRP2, a protein highly homologous to IRP1 but lacking aconitase activity, results in iron accumulation and Parkinsonism in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LaVaute et al., 2001</xref>). An interaction of CISD1 with IRP2 has not been reported so far but appears likely. In summary, these results strongly implicate altered mitochondrial iron homeostasis and redox dysregulation in fly and human models of PD and link it to CISD1 dysfunction. The accumulation of apo-CISD1/Cisd and the subsequent inability to repair defective IRP1/2 would place CISD1 upstream of the changes in iron homeostasis observed in PD and models of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our results also suggest that apo-CISD1 exhibits a toxic gain of function possibly independent of the effects on iron homeostasis. Ubiquitous overexpression of Cisd and apo-Cisd in flies aggravated known phenotypes of <italic>Pink1</italic> mutation as a reduced climbing ability and lifespan. This was evident in WT and <italic>Pink1</italic> mutant flies and overexpression of apo-Cisd was associated with a more profound reduction in climbing speed and resulted in an inability to completely inflate their wings. Interestingly, prolonged exposure of MEFs to the iron-depleting agent 2,2′-bipyridine results in downregulation of Cisd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Key et al., 2020</xref>) possibly as a compensatory mechanism to limit the abundance of such a toxic iron-depleted CISD1. In line with a toxic function of Cisd and apo-Cisd, removing fly Cisd by KO of the coding sequence completely protected flies against <italic>Pink1</italic> depletion-induced changes in climbing ability, abnormal wing posture, dopamine levels, and lifespan but ameliorated only the climbing ability and wing posture in Prkn mutant flies. Previous work demonstrated that ectopic overexpression of Cisd in muscle decreased the lifespan of flies and resulted in enlarged mitochondria containing numerous intramitochondrial vesicles surrounded by a double membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Our data now indicate that this process might contribute to the pathophysiology resulting from the loss of Pink1/Prkn-mediated mitochondrial quality control.</p><p>Very recent work, published during the revision of this manuscript, discovered that both genetic and pharmacological suppression of CISD1 and Cisd restored increased calcium release from the ER conferred by <italic>PINK1</italic> and <italic>Parkin</italic> mutation in mammalian cells and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ham et al., 2023</xref>). However, the specific role of apo-Cisd in this remains to be fully elucidated. Also Martinez et al. very recently reported that <italic>Cisd</italic> depletion using RNAi protects against <italic>Pink1</italic> and <italic>Prkn</italic> loss of function in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martinez et al., 2024</xref>), suggesting that a reduction, instead of a complete KO, of <italic>Cisd</italic> as used by us is more beneficial in <italic>Park<sup>25</sup></italic> flies and equally beneficial in <italic>Pink1<sup>B9</sup></italic> flies. In their hands, Cisd levels increased in <italic>Pink1</italic> and <italic>Prkn</italic> mutant flies which was not evident in our study. Cisd overexpression was neurotoxic, disrupted mitochondrial morphology, and led to an accumulation of phospho-ubiquitin which they speculate also blocks mitophagy, resulting in the accumulation of more defective mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martinez et al., 2024</xref>). All three papers propose distinct mechanisms for the toxic effects of CISD1 in PD. While our study suggests a role in redox imbalance and iron dysregulation, particularly implicating the iron-depleted form of CISD1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ham et al., 2023</xref>, describe its impact on ER calcium release, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martinez et al., 2024</xref>, propose interference with autophagy/mitophagy. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, as they often intersect. Both studies support our findings, replicating key results, but also underscore the need for further research to fully elucidate the interplay of these proposed mechanisms.</p><p>In summary, our results suggest that the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster protein Cisd is downstream of the pathophysiological cascade initiated by Pink1 and partially Prkn loss of function in flies and probably also in humans. This sheds light on the pathophysiology of PD and implicates CISD1 as a therapeutic target protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human dopaminergic neurons</title><p>iPSCs from two PD patients carrying the p.Q456X mutation in PINK1 were obtained from the University of Lübeck. Both participants signed a written informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval for conducting iPSC studies in Krüger’s lab was granted by the National Committee for Ethics in Research, Luxembourg (Comité National d'Ethique de Recherche; CNER #201411/05). For both mutant lines, isogenic gene-corrected controls have been successfully generated and characterized previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jarazo et al., 2022</xref>). Both PINK1-mutant and isogenic iPSCs were first converted into NESCs, based on the protocol previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reinhardt et al., 2013</xref>). NESCs were cultivated in N2B27 medium (DMEM-F12/Neurobasal 50:50, supplemented with 1:200 N2, 1:100 B27 without vitamin A, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin), containing 3 µM CHIR-99021, 0.5 µM purmorphamine (PMA), and 150 µM ascorbic acid. For the generation of midbrain-specific neurons, NESC maintenance medium was replaced by N2B27 containing 1 µM PMA, 200 µM ascorbic acid, 10 ng/mL BDNF, 10 ng/mL GDNF, 1 ng/mL TGF-b3, and 500 µM dbcAMP. After 6 days, differentiating NESCs were shifted to the same medium but without PMA (replaced every 2 days) and kept until day 28.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris•HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cells were then centrifuged at maximum speed for 30 min at 4°C and the supernatant containing the whole-cell proteins was collected. Flies were isolated in the same buffer but were mechanically smashed with a dounce, centrifuged and the supernatant was collected. For regular immunoblots, protein samples were denatured in 1× loading Laemmli sample buffer (Tris-HCl, SDS, glycerol, bromophenol blue) already containing 50 mM DTT, samples for non-reducing blots were denatured in 1× loading Laemmli sample buffer without DTT. Samples were then boiled at 95°C for 5 min. Harsher reducing conditions were generated by treating the samples with 100 mM DTT or the combination of 100 mM DTT and 50 mM TCEP, incubation for 30 min at RT, and boiling for 10 min at 95°C. The Cisd redox blot was used to quantify the ratio between monomeric and dimeric Cisd following the alkylation of reduced thiols. Here, 100 mM NEM was added to the lysis buffer to preserve the in vivo redox state of Cisd and to prevent redox changes during sample preparation. Proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry blotting system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Membranes were blocked with 3% milk or 5% BSA in TBST for 1 hr at RT. Membranes were incubated with the respective antibodies overnight at 4°C, rotating. Antibodies used were rabbit anti-CISD1 (Proteintech, 1:1000), mouse anti-actin (Merck Chemicals, 1:1000), rabbit anti-HA (Abcam, 1:1000), rabbit anti-TH (Millipore, AB152, 1:1000), mouse anti-TUBB3 (Bio-Legend, 801201, 1:20,000), and mouse anti-β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, 3700, 1:30,000). Fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies were used at a 1:10,000 dilution, and the signal was detected using a Li-Cor Odyssey imaging system and quantified with the Image Studio Lite software. This imaging system is linear and oversaturation is indicated. The intensity was normalized to the loading control and the mean per blot.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Dimerization assay</title><p>Split nanoluc fragments LgBit and SmBit (Promega) were cloned N-terminally to human CISD1 and point mutations introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (NEB).

Heads were immediately put in a solution containing 200 µL 5% TCA, 300 µL RIPA buffer, and 10 µL dopamine standards at 4°C. Ceramic beads were added and lysis was performed by gently shaking for 5 min. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm twice. 200 µL of the supernatant was put in a fresh vial. Dopamine was determined via HPLC/MS/MS. 100 µL of 100 mM ammonium formate buffer (adjusted to pH 2.5 with formic acid) were added to 100 µL of the prepared extracts from fly heads in order to adjust pH in an HPLC vial with insert. 50 µL of this solution were injected into the LC/MS/MS system consisting of an Agilent 1260 Infinity II Series HPLC pump (G7112B) with integrated degasser and an Agilent 1260 Autosampler (G7167A) connected to an AB Sciex 4500 tandem mass spectrometer. Chromatography was performed on a Phenomenex Kinetex F5 column (2.6 µM, 150 mm × 4.6 mm) using water (adjusted to pH 2.5) and acetonitrile as solvents A and B, respectively. Starting conditions were 5% solvent B for 1 min, raised to 100% B at 10 min, kept at 100% B until 14 min and set back to 5% B until 19 min and kept for another 5 min until 24 min. Flow rate was 0.3 mL/min. Tandem mass spectrometric determination was performed in ESI-negative mode using the specific ion transition 154.0→&gt;137.0 for dopamine and 158.0→140.9 for D4 dopamine as internal standard. We used an electrospray needle voltage of – 4500 V and nitrogen as a nebulizer and turbo heater gas (450°C) was set to a pressure of 65 psi. Nitrogen as curtain gas and collision gas was set to 10 instrument units, respectively. Calibration was performed in a mixture of 300 µL RIPA buffer and 200 µL 5% trichloroacetic acid in water, spiked with dopamine concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 µg/L in HPLC vials. 10 µL of the working solution of the internal standard (D<sub>4</sub>-dopamine, 1 mg/L in MeOH/HCl) were added to the standards, the vials were vortexed and centrifuged at 4.000 U/min (~3000×<italic>g</italic>). 100 µL of the supernatant was pipetted in a new HPLC vial with insert and 100 µL of 100 mM ammonium formate buffer (pH 2.5) were added. 50 µL of this solution was injected into the LC/MS/MS system as described. As dopamine is not stable under neutral/basic conditions, the spiking solutions of dopamine (1 mg/L and 100 µg/L) were freshly prepared daily from the stock solution (1 g/L in MeOH/HCl) in 0.1% HCl<sub>konz.</sub> in water.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Iron quantification</title><p>Iron redox speciation in fly lysates was carried out using CE-ICP-MS. To ensure interference-free monitoring of iron isotopes, dynamic reaction cell (DRC) technology employing NH<sub>3</sub> as the DRC gas was utilized. A ‘PrinCe 706’ CE system (PrinCe Technologies B.V., Emmen, Netherlands) was employed for the separation process, applying a voltage of +20 kV. The temperature settings for both the sample/buffer tray and capillary were maintained at 20°C. An uncoated capillary (100 cm×50 µm ID; CS-Chromatographie Service GmbH, Langerwehe, Germany) was used for interfacing with ICP-DRC-MS. The CE-ICP-MS interface enabled electrical connection while preventing suction flow by operating in self-aspiration mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Michalke et al., 2019</xref>). The electrolytes used included 10% HCl as the leading electrolyte, 0.05 mM HCl as the terminating electrolyte, and 50 mM HCl as the background electrolyte. The Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> ratio was determined based on quantified concentrations of Fe species. An uncoated capillary (CS-Chromatographie Service GmbH, Langerwehe, Germany) measuring 85 cm in length with a 50 µm internal diameter was employed, connecting the CE system to the ICP-MS, served as the element-selective detector. A ‘NexIon 300-D’ ICP-DRC-MS system (Perkin Elmer, Rodgau-Jügesheim, Germany) served as the element-selective detector for iron electropherograms. Isotopes <sup>56</sup>Fe and <sup>57</sup>Fe were measured in DRC mode using ammonia as the DRC gas (0.58 mL NH<sub>3</sub>/min). The radio frequency (RF) power was set to 1250 W, and the plasma gas flow was 16 L Ar/min. The nebulizer gas flow rate at the CE-ICP-DRC-MS interface was optimized to 0.98 L Ar/min. Electropherograms were analyzed using Peakfit software (Systat, Inpixon GmbH Office, Düsseldorf, Germany). To assess iron recovery accuracy, total iron content was determined using ICP-sector field mass spectrometry (ICP-sf-MS). The ICP-sf-MS (‘ELEMENT 2’, Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) settings included an RF power of 1260 W, a plasma gas flow of 16 L Ar/min, an auxiliary gas flow of 0.85 L Ar/min, a nebulizer gas flow of 1.085 L Ar/min, and a dwell time of 300 ms. Quantified iron species from CE-ICP-DRC-MS were compared to total iron content (set at 100%), yielding values ranging between 92% and 110%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Transmission electron microscopy</title><p>Fly thoraxes were isolated and fixed in a buffer containing Caco-buffer (0.2 M), 25% glutaraldehyde, and 15% paraformaldehyde.

We are very content that reviewer #1 considered our work to be “novel, interesting and important for understanding the mitochondrial biology of PD”. This reviewer also valued our work as “a significant advancement” and suggested further study of the relationship of CISD1 (dimerization) to general mitophagy/autophagy. We already addressed this in the first revision (version 1, v1).</p><p>Also reviewer #2 considered our work to be “an exciting and well-executed piece of research focusing on the defects in iron homeostasis observed in Parkinson's disease which a wide audience will appreciate”. This reviewer had a very specific suggestion on how to improve our manuscript which makes a lot of sense and is feasible. As the suggested experiments include fly breeding and behavioral analysis, these experiments took some time and are now included in the second revision (version 2, v2).</p><p>Finally, reviewer #3 gathered that parts of our results “are confirmatory to recently published work” but also appreciated that our results established that iron-depleted apo-Cisd is an important determinant of toxicity which has not been shown before. I would like to comment here, that in contrast to the paper mentioned by this reviewer, our contribution includes data from dopaminergic neurons obtained from human patients suffering from familial Parkinson’s disease that demonstrate the same increase in apo-CISD1 levels as the flies.</p><p>We also made additional changes in v2 not requested by the reviewers. New Figure 3E/F now demonstrates that the CISD1 dimer consists of two monomers that are covalently linked by a disulfide bridge. This is important because in this conformation CISD1 cannot coordinate the iron-sulfur cofactor. This work was done by an additional author, Eva-Maria Hanschmann (University of Essen, Germany), who is an expert in the field of redox modifications. We also decided to remove former Figure 3 showing the effect of apoCISD1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts for clarity and brevity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript focuses on mitochondrial CISD1 and its relationship to two Parkinson's disease (PD) proteins PINK1 and Parkin. Interestingly, CISD1 is a mitochondrial iron sulfur binding protein and an target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitinylation. Disruption of iron metabolism and accumulation of iron in the brain has long since been reported in PD but the involvement of iron sulfur binding is little studied both in vivo and in human stem cell models of PD. This work addresses the relationship between CISD1 and two mitochondrial models of PD (PINK1 and Parkin) making use of in vivo models (<italic>Drosophila</italic>), PINK1 patient models (iPSC derived neurons) and Mouse fibroblasts. The authors report a complex relationship between CISD1, PINK1 and Parkin, where iron-depleted CISD1 may illicit a toxic gain of function downstream of PINK1 and Parkin.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The conclusions are overall modest and supported by the data. One question remains unaddressed. Is mitochondrial CISD1 a downstream target that specifically mediates PINK1 and Parkin loss of function phenotypes or are the phenotypes being mediated because CISD1 is downstream of mitophagy in general?</p><p>It would be interesting to know what happens to CISD1 (dimerization?) upon initiation of mitophagy in wild type cells? Would dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential be sufficient to induce changes to CISD1 in wild type cells or PINK1 deficient cells? Since iron chelation is a potent inducer of mitophagy (Loss of iron triggers PINK1/Parkin-independent mitophagy. George F G Allen, Rachel Toth, John James, Ian G Ganley. EMBO Reports (2013)14:1127-1135) it would be useful to show one experiment addressing the role of CISD1 dimerization under mitochondrial depolarizing and non-depolarizing conditions in cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the overall assumption of the reviewer that our work is “novel, interesting and important for understanding the mitochondrial biology of PD” and “a significant advancement” we understand the word “modest” here as meaning “not exaggerated”. To address this question, we studied CISD1 dimerization in response to more classical activators of mitophagy namely FCCP and antimycin/oligomycin which had no significant effect on dimerization suggesting that this phenotype is more pronounced under iron depletion. These data are shown in the new Figure 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, the authors should discuss the topic of mitophagy (including PINK1-parkin independent mitophagy), the limitation of the present study not being able to rule out a general mitophagy effect and previous work on the role of iron depletion on mitophagy induction in the manuscript.</p><p>The data and the methods are presented in such a way that they can be reproduced.</p><p>The experiments are adequately replicated and statistical analysis is adequate.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Show p values even when not significant (ns) since even some of the significant findings are borderline &lt; p0.05.</p></disp-quote><p>Here, I decided to leave it as it is, because the figures became very cluttered and less easy to understand. Borderline findings are however indicated and mentioned in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Because the situation for CISD1 is complicated (overexpression, different models etc.) it would be helpful if in the abstract the authors could summarize the role. E.g. as in the discussion that iron-depleted CISD1 could represent a toxic function.</p></disp-quote><p>The abstract has been completely rewritten and now mentions the potential toxic function of iron-depleted CISD1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If there is sufficient iron (accumulation in PD) why would CISD1 be deactivated? Perhaps that could be postulated or discussed in a simplified way?</p></disp-quote><p>We actually think that apo-CISD1 without its iron/sulfur cluster is incapable of transferring its Fe/S cluster to IRP1 and IRP2. This then results in increased levels of apo-IRP1/2 and subsequent changes that lead to iron overload. Such a sequence of events would place CISD1 upstream of the changes in iron homeostasis observed in PD and models of PD. This is now discussed in more detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the methods section both reducing and non-reducing gel/Western blotting is mentioned but the manuscript only describes data from blots under reducing conditions. Are there blots under non-reducing conditions that could be shown to see how CISD1 and dimerized CISD1 resolve?</p></disp-quote><p>We now show blots where we used extremely reducing conditions of prolonged incubation with higher concentrations of DTT and tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine as a disulfide-bond breaking agent followed by boiling. This resulted in loss of dimeric and an increase of monomeric Cisd (new Figure 3E). We also added the thiol alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) prior and during lysis and performed non-reducing immunoblotting in old Pink1B9 flies compared to old wildtype flies. NEM blocks all reduced sulfhydryl (-SH) groups of cysteine residues and thereby prevents the formation of disulfide bonds due to non-specific oxidation during the lysis process (new Figure 3F). We also observed the increased dimer formation in old Pink1B9 flies under these conditions (new Figure 3F). Together these experiments indicate that the increased dimerization in old Pink1B9 flies is most probably caused by the formation of an intermolecular disulfide linking two Cisd molecules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Results section, PINK1 mutant flies, it is said that the alterations to CISD1 (dimerization) are analogous to the PINK1 mutation patient neurons. The effect is seen in old but not young flies. Since iPSC-derived neurons are relatively young in the dish, would one not expect that young flies and iPSC-derived neurons have similar CISD1 phenotypes? Could the authors modify the text to reflect that? or discuss the finding in further context.</p></disp-quote><p>We only studied one time point in PINK1 mutation patient neurons and controls. It would indeed be interesting whether neuronal aging (as far as this can be studied in the dish) would result in increased CISD1 dimerization. This is now discussed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The strengths of this work are in the novelty of the topic and the use of several well established in vivo and cell models including patient-derived neurons. The findings discussed in the text are honest and avoid over-interpretation. The findings are novel, interesting and important for understanding the mitochondrial biology of PD.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their kind words.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Limitations include the lack of strong phenotypes in the CISD1 models and the lack of robust, sustained and consistent increase in CISD1 dimers in the patient and fly models (just significant because of variability). The relationship of CISD1 (dimerization) to general mitophagy/autophagy is not shown here.</p></disp-quote><p>The lack of a strong phenotype in Cisd-deficient flies could actually hint to a potential compensatory mechanism that could also protect the Pink1 mutant x Cisd-deficient double-knockout flies. It is correct that the increase in CISD1/Cisd dimers in the PD models are not overwhelming but – as also mentioned by the reviewer – this could be increased in “older” cultures. This is discussed in more detail. We have now reproduced the increased dimerization of Cisd in samples where we added the thiol alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) prior and during lysis and performed non-reducing immunoblotting in old Pink1B9 flies compared to old wildtype flies. NEM blocks all reduced sulfhydryl (-SH) groups of cysteine residues and thereby prevents the formation of disulfide bonds due to non-specific oxidation during the lysis process (new Figure 3F). We also observed the increased dimer formation in old Pink1B9 flies under these conditions (new Figure 3F). Together these experiments indicate that the increased dimerization in old Pink1B9 flies is most probably caused by the formation of an intermolecular disulfide linking two Cisd molecules. As suggested by the reviewer, we have now added experiments that study the relationship between CISD1 dimerization and conventional mitophagy as described above (new Figure 2C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is a significant advancement. So far researchers were able to describe the importance of iron metabolism in PD (For example refer to work from the group of Georg Auburger such as PMID 33023155 and discussion of therapeutic intervention such as reviewed by Ma et al. PMID: 33799121) but few papers describe involvement of iron sulfur cluster proteins specifically (such as Aconitase) in relation to PINK1 and parkin (these are cited). The fact that CISD1 is a protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane makes it particularly interesting and further studies looking more closely at the interaction of CISD1 with mitochondrial proteins associated with PD will be of interest.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these excellent publications. Key et al. present an enormous wealth of data on protein dysregulation of wildtype and Pink1-/- fibroblast cell lines upon perturbation of the iron homeostasis (Key <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020). Both cell lines exhibit a downregulation of CISD1 levels upon iron deprivation with the agent 2,2′ -Bipyridine possibly as a compensatory mechanism to limit the toxic gain of function of iron-depleted CISD1. The other paper, Ma et al. is a recent review on changes in iron homeostasis in PD and PD models (Ma <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021). Both papers are now cited in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the paper entitled 'Mitochondrial CISD1 is a downstream target that mediates PINK1 and Parkin loss-of-function phenotypes', Bitar and co-workers investigate the interaction between CISD1 and the PINK1/Parkin pathway. Mutations in PINK1 and PARKIN cause early onset Parkinson's disease and CISD1 is a homodimeric mitochondrial iron-sulphur binding protein. They observed an increase in CISD1 dimer formation in dopaminergic neurons derived from Parkinson's disease patients carrying a PINK1 mutation. Immuno-blots of cells expressing CISD1 mutants that affects the iron sulphur cluster binding and as well as cells treated with iron chelators, showed that the tendency of CISD1 to form dimers is dependent on its binding to iron-sulphur clusters. Moreover, the Iron-depleted apo-CISD1 does not rescue mitochondrial phenotypes observed in CISD1 KO mouse cells. Finally, in vivo studies showed that overexpression of Cisd and mutant apo-Cisd in <italic>Drosophila</italic> shortened fly life span and, using a different overexpression model, apo-Cisd caused a delay in eclosion. Similar as patient derived neurons, they observed an increase in Cisd dimer levels in Pink1 mutant flies. Additionally, the authors showed that double mutants of Cisd and Pink1 alleviated all Pink1 mutant phenotypes, while double mutants of Prkn and Cisd rescued most Prkn mutant phenotypes.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The authors observed an increase in the levels of Cisd dimers in Pink1 mutant flies and removing Cisd in Pink1 mutant background rescues all the mutant phenotypes observed in Pink1 mutant flies, suggesting that the Cisd dimers are part and partial of the Pink1 mutant phenotype. The authors also generated a UAS_C111S_Cisd fly which can overexpress apo-Cisd. Overexpression of the C111S_Cisd construct with Tub-Gal4 showed a developmental delay. Since apo-Cisd forms more dimeric Cisd, my question is: does the strong overexpression (e.g. with Tub-Gal4) of the C111S_Cisd in wild type flies shows any of the Pink1 mutant phenotypes? If not, the authors should mention this and elaborate on it.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. We have exchanged these data with completely new data where we compared the effects of mild ubiquitous overexpression of mitochondrially targeted GFP with wildtype and mutant Cisd in wildtype and Pink1 mutant flies. We chose negative geotaxis (the ability to climb) and lifespan – known hallmarks of the <italic>Pink1<sup>B9</sup></italic> phenotype – as readouts and found that <italic>Pink1<sup>B9</sup></italic> flies have reduced negative geotaxis and lifespan as expected. Ubiquitous overexpression of Cisd and apo-Cisd aggravated these phenotypes in wildtype and Pink1 mutant flies (new Figure 4A). <italic>Cisd C111S</italic> overexpression was, however, associated with a more profound reduction in climbing speed compared to wildtype Cisd, while the effects on lifespan were similarly detrimental (new Figure 4A). Additionally, the vast majority of all <italic>Cisd C111S</italic>-overexpressing flies were not capable of inflating their wings (new Figure 4B), a rather non-specific phenotype which can result from genetic mutations, environmental conditions, and developmental defects. This phenotype did not occur in wildtype <italic>Cisd</italic> or <italic>mitoGFP</italic>-overexpressing flies (new Figure 4B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6g: Shows the TEM pictures of the indirect flight muscles of Pink1 mutant flies and Pink1, Cisd double mutants. To me, the Picture of Pink1 mutant mitochondria is not very convincing. We expect swollen (enlarged) mitochondria with disrupted mitochondrial matrix. However, this is not clear in the picture. Moreover, in my opinion, Figure6 g, is missing an EM Picture of the Cisd mutant indirect flight muscles.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show exemplary pictures from Pink1 mutant and DKO in a higher magnification which better demonstrate the rounded Pink1 mutant mitochondria and the disrupted cristae structure.

If this statement is correct, we can hypothesize that increasing apo-Cisd in Pink1 mutant background should worsen the pink1 mutant defects.</p><p>Therefore, I suggest overexpressing Cisd1 wild type (and/or C111S Cisd) in pink1 mutant flies, as pink1 is on the X chromosome, and mild overexpression of Cisd1 with da is not lethal, these experiments could be done in 3-4 fly crosses and hence within 1.5 – 2 months.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now done this experiment as mentioned above (new Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since Pink1 mutant flies contain higher levels of endogenous Cisd dimers, we can expect that overexpression of wild type Cisd will result in an even stronger increase of dimers. If these dimers indeed contribute to Pink1 mutant phenotypes we can expect that overexpression of Cisd will result in a worsening of the Pink1 mutant phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now done this experiment as mentioned above and observed what the reviewer suspected (new Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>In the Introduction (Background) there are some parts without references:</p><p>E.g., there is not a single reference in the following part between</p><p>'However, in unfit mitochondria with a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential …&amp;… compromised mitochondria safeguards overall mitochondrial health and function.'</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this flaw.

This is now explained better in the revised manuscript.</p><p>The authors mention in material and methods that T2A sites are used at the C-terminus of CISD1 to avoid tagging of CISD1. However, this is not entirely true as T2A will leave some amino acids (around 20) after the self-cleaving and therefore CISD1 will be tagged.</p><p>This is indeed true and we have now changed the wording in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In figure 5 P1 is used to abbreviate Pink1 mutants, however P1, to me, refers to pink1 wild type. It would be clearer to abbreviate Pink1 mutants as P1B9 in the graphs as B9 is the name of the mutant pink1 allele.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this flaw.

Recently an article (Ham et al., 2023 PMID: 37626046) was published showing similar genetic interactions between Pink1/Prkn and Cisd.

Very recently, a similar genetic interaction between Cisd and Pink1/Prkn in flies was published (Ham et al., 2023 PMID: 37626046) however, from a different angle. While, Ham et al. focused on the role of Pink1/Prkn and Cisd in IP3R related ER calcium release, this manuscript approaches the Pink1/Prkn – Cisd interaction from an iron homeostasis point of view. Since, iron dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, the observations in this manuscript are relevant for the disease. Hence, the work is sufficiently novel and deserves publication. However, additional experiments are suggested to strengthen the authors' conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their kind words.

While iron has been implicated in Parkinson's disease, it is an overstatement to say that disruption in iron metabolism contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of the disease.</p></disp-quote><p>There is certainly a plethora of data implicating perturbed iron homeostasis in PD as also pointed out by reviewer #1.

The discussion of the various names for Cisd2 is important, but confusing as written.

It would be preferable to use heterozygous driver lines or a more similar genetic control rather than w-1118.</p></disp-quote><p>We have exchanged these data with completely new data where we compared the effects of mild ubiquitous overexpression of mitochondrially targeted GFP with wildtype and mutant Cisd in wildtype and Pink1 mutant flies. We chose negative geotaxis (the ability to climb) and lifespan – known hallmarks of the <italic>Pink1<sup>B9</sup></italic> phenotype – as readouts and found that <italic>Pink1<sup>B9</sup></italic> flies have reduced negative geotaxis and lifespan as expected. Ubiquitous overexpression of Cisd and apo-Cisd aggravated these phenotypes in wildtype and Pink1 mutant flies (new Figure 4A). <italic>Cisd C111S</italic> overexpression was, however, associated with a more profound reduction in climbing speed compared to wildtype Cisd, while the effects on lifespan were similarly detrimental (new Figure 4A). Additionally, the vast majority of all <italic>Cisd C111S</italic>-overexpressing flies were not capable of inflating their wings (new Figure 4B), a rather non-specific phenotype which can result from genetic mutations, environmental conditions, and developmental defects. This phenotype did not occur in wildtype <italic>Cisd</italic> or <italic>mitoGFP</italic>-overexpressing flies (new Figure 4B).</p><p>The data shown in Figure 5, 6, and 7 all used <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> as control because all other fly strains are on the same genetic background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 10.

The original paper did not quantify the PINK1 mRNA levels shown in Figure 1a.

The striking change seems to be the decrease in dimers in young Pink1 mutant animals, not the small increase in dimers in the older Pink1 mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>It is always difficult to find a “typical” picture that reflects all changes observed in quantitative data. This Figure actually shows a decrease of total Cisd levels in young flies in Figure 5c but no difference of the dimer/monomer ratio in Figure 5d. These data are now shown in Figure 3.

The data are hard to interpret. The number of animals is very small for a viability study and the strains are apparently in different genetic backgrounds, though this is not clearly specified.
