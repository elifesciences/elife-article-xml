<italic>C. elegans</italic> germ granule components that interact with the intrinsically disordered MEG-3 protein. These proteins promote P granule condensation, form granules independently of MEG-3 in the postembryonic germ line, and balance each other in regulating P granule growth and localization. MIP-1 and MIP-2 each contain two LOTUS domains and intrinsically disordered regions and form homo- and heterodimers. They bind and anchor the Vasa homolog GLH-1 within P granules and are jointly required for coalescence of MEG-3, GLH-1, and PGL proteins. Animals lacking MIP-1 and MIP-2 show temperature-sensitive embryonic lethality, sterility, and mortal germ lines. Germline phenotypes include defects in stem cell self-renewal, meiotic progression, and gamete differentiation. We propose that these proteins serve as scaffolds and organizing centers for ribonucleoprotein networks within P granules that help recruit and balance essential RNA processing machinery to regulate key developmental transitions in the germ line.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>P granules</kwd><kwd>germ granules</kwd><kwd>IDR</kwd><kwd>LOTUS</kwd><kwd>vasa</kwd><kwd>phase separation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012025</institution-id><institution>New York University Abu Dhabi</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ADPHG CGSB</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cipriani</surname><given-names>Patricia Giselle</given-names></name><name><surname>Fahs</surname><given-names>Hala</given-names></name><name><surname>Piano</surname><given-names>Fabio</given-names></name><name><surname>Gunsalus</surname><given-names>Kristin C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012025</institution-id><institution>New York University Abu Dhabi</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cipriani</surname><given-names>Patricia Giselle</given-names></name><name><surname>Bay</surname><given-names>Olivia</given-names></name><name><surname>Zinno</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name><name><surname>Gutwein</surname><given-names>Michelle</given-names></name><name><surname>Gan</surname><given-names>Hin Hark</given-names></name><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>George</given-names></name><name><surname>Piano</surname><given-names>Fabio</given-names></name><name><surname>Gunsalus</surname><given-names>Kristin C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP 123352</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mayya</surname><given-names>Vinay K</given-names></name><name><surname>Duchaine</surname><given-names>Thomas F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008582</institution-id><institution>McGill University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ph.D. Fellowship Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mayya</surname><given-names>Vinay K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0315362</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jia-Xuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P40 OD010440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>George</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two novel LOTUS-domain proteins are core germ granule components that directly recruit <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> Vasa, regulate germ granule size and localization, and provide an organizational framework for ribonucleoprotein complexes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The germ line is essential to the propagation of sexually reproducing multicellular organisms. A common feature of germ cells is the presence of germ granules, membraneless cytoplasmic compartments with liquid-like properties that form by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) from the bulk cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>). Rich in both RNA and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), germ granules contain a large number of molecules with roles in post-transcriptional RNA regulation and the preservation of genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mayya and Duchaine, 2019</xref>). These complex ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assemblies are important for the specification, maintenance, and normal development of the germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knutson et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic> adults, germ cells develop along an assembly line within a syncytium, migrating away from the stem cell niche as they proliferate through several rounds of mitosis, enter meiosis, and differentiate into gametes; mature oocytes are then fertilized as they pass through a sperm storage organ called the spermatheca. Polarization of the embryo upon fertilization triggers differential anterior-posterior phosphorylation of multiple regulatory proteins, resulting in concentration gradients that provide a permissive environment for germ granule condensation only in the posterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seydoux, 2018</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ granules are called P granules because during embryogenesis they segregate uniquely to the posterior cell lineage (P0-P4 and Z2/Z3), those cells that will give rise to the future germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Updike and Strome, 2010</xref>). P granules are cytoplasmic in very early embryos, begin to coalesce around the nuclear periphery at the four-cell stage, and thereafter form perinuclear foci in all germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Updike and Strome, 2010</xref>). Although many P granule components are known, their regulation, organizational principles, and mechanisms through which they influence germline development are still not completely understood.</p><p>Nucleation of P granules in the zygote requires the intrinsically disordered, serine-rich protein MEG-3 (previously known as GEI-12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). A putative null allele of <italic>meg-3</italic> is not sterile on its own, but does show sterility when combined with mutations in its paralog <italic>meg-4</italic> (30%), <italic>meg-1</italic> (40%), or both (100%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Transgenerational RNAi of <italic>meg-3</italic> gives rise to progressive loss of fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), presumably due to additional off-target knock-down of <italic>meg-4</italic>, which encodes a protein that is 71% identical to MEG-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). MEG-3 binds RNA non-specifically and recruits numerous mRNAs into P granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2020</xref>), while a MEX-5 gradient suppresses granule formation in the anterior by competing with MEG-3 for binding to RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). In vitro, MEG-3 also forms gel-like condensates that are enhanced by the presence of RNA and antagonized by MEX-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Putnam et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, MEG-3 is part of a regulatory network that controls P granule formation in early embryos.</p><p>Phase separation of proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) is a hallmark of germ granules and other non-membranous organelles that carry out diverse core cellular processes, including gene transcription, ribosome biogenesis, cytoskeletal organization, stress responses, and synaptic activity, and many others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberti and Hyman, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Strom and Brangwynne, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wiegand and Hyman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhao and Zhang, 2020</xref>). Many IDRs can drive phase separation in vitro and in vivo and make nonspecific, low-affinity, multivalent contacts with RNAs and other proteins that synergize with high-affinity interaction domains to form extended interaction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peran and Mittag, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Protter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>). These ‘biomolecular condensates’ are complex coacervates that are governed by principles of polymer physics and can undergo phase transitions between liquid-like, gel-like, and more solid, semi-crystalline states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brangwynne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>). Whereas condensed liquid droplets undergo rapid local motions, hydrogels contain fibrils of stacked beta-sheets that can harden into irreversible amyloids that are linked to the etiology of various diseases, most notably neurological and age-related pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberti and Hyman, 2021</xref>). In vivo, ‘dissolvases’ such as protein kinases and ATP-driven RNA helicases are engaged to maintain fluidity, and these active processes prevent solidification as condensates age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hubstenberger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rai et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To gain further insight into the mechanisms underlying P granule biology, we sought to identify novel P granule proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with known regulators of P granule assembly. Here we describe the characterization of two novel paralogs discovered by co-immunoprecipitation with MEG-3, which we have named ‘<bold>M</bold>EG-3 <bold>i</bold>nteracting <bold>p</bold>roteins’ MIP-1 and MIP-2. Both MIPs contain OST-HTH or LOTUS domains (named for their presence in <bold>L</bold>imkain B1/MARF1, <bold>O</bold>skar, and <bold>Tu</bold>dor domain-containing protein<bold>s</bold> TDRD5 and TDRD7) and are the first proteins of this class to be characterized in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Oskar is the key initiator of germ plasm assembly in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and recruits the Vasa DEAD-box RNA helicase to germ granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lehmann, 2016</xref>). Here we show that the MIPs likewise recruit a <italic>C. elegans</italic> Vasa homolog, can form multivalent protein-protein interactions, and are essential for proper granule assembly and many aspects of germline development. We propose that the MIPs form extended interaction networks that scaffold and help nucleate, organize, and regulate macromolecular assemblies essential to core germ granule processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Novel LOTUS-domain proteins interact with MEG-3 in vivo</title><p>In a previous study, we found that MEG-3 and MEG-4 co-immunoprecipitate from <italic>C. elegans</italic> early embryo extracts with MBK-2, a master regulator of the oocyte-to-embryo transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2016</xref>).

Two LOTUS variants have been distinguished: the minimal LOTUS (mLOTUS) and the extended LOTUS (eLOTUS), whose defining feature is an additional C-terminal alpha-helix in a region that appears disordered in minimal LOTUS domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jeske et al., 2017</xref>). A recent study has identified binding of RNA G-quadruplex secondary structures as an ancient conserved function of mLOTUS domains across kingdoms, and suggests that protein binding by eLOTUS domains may be a more recent evolutionary innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Superpositions of LOTUS domain models from worm, fly, and human display clear structural similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b,c</xref>). Although multiple alignments of LOTUS domains from diverse species show very low sequence identity (10–16%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the ten most conserved residues are predicted to form part of the hydrophobic core and thus would be expected to help stabilize the tertiary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

FRAP assays of GFP-tagged proteins showed that PGL-3 recovered more rapidly than GLH-1, MIP-1, MIP-2, and MEG-3 in the P1 cell of two-cell embryos, when granules are very mobile and free floating in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, left). In contrast, all five proteins recovered at similar rates in the P3 cell in 8- to 12-cell embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, right), when granules are mostly attached to the nuclear membrane. Thus, PGL proteins are more dynamic than other core P granule components in the cytoplasmic P granule condensates of very early embryos but these differences largely disappear over time, indicating that the physical properties of these condensates evolve as they begin to coalesce around the nuclear periphery. Notably, all proteins tested appear to be fully exchangeable with a cytoplasmic pool in early embryos, as normalized intensity in FRAP experiments returns to baseline levels within around 60 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ishikawa-Ankerhold et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Biophysical properties of P granule components.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dissected MIP-1::GFP, MIP-2::GFP, and GLH-1::GFP adult germ lines treated with 5% 1,6-hexanediol (HD) or egg buffer as a control (EB), imaged at the last experimental time point (190 s post-treatment).

The novel paralogs MIP-1 and MIP-2 are required to maintain fertility across generations, and their depletion gives rise to pleiotropic germline phenotypes, including defects in germline stem cell maintenance, meiotic progression, and oocyte development. We show that the MIPs are core P granule components that promote germ granule condensation at all stages of development and function at an early step in P granule assembly. The MIPs directly bind and are co-dependent with the embryo-specific protein MEG-3 for granule condensation in the early embryo, and they balance each other’s function in regulating P granule size and distribution. The MIPs can form multivalent interactions and also directly bind and anchor the Vasa homolog GLH-1 within P granules, a property they share with other germline LOTUS proteins including Oskar, the key initiator of germ granule assembly in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>MIP molecular structure and function</title><p>Our combined data strongly suggest that the MIPs form higher order complexes in vivo through a combination of homotypic and heterotypic dimerization, LOTUS-helicase interactions, and low-specificity IDR contacts with other proteins and/or RNAs. MIP-1 and MIP-2 can self-associate and form heterodimers through their LOTUS domains, and MIP-2 also interacts with MIP-1 through its largely disordered C-terminal region. Although we do not know if MIPs bind RNAs directly, this is a distinct possibility given the tendency of many IDRs to bind RNA and the evolutionary conservation of G-quadruplex binding among LOTUS domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Several observations lead us to conclude that MIP-1 and MIP-2 are not completely redundant paralogs. First, phenotypic analysis shows that the MIPs have opposing effects on P granule size and localization in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first example of pair of paralogs that balance each other’s function in this way, in germ granules or other types of biomolecular condensates. In addition, Y2H results, although not quantitative, suggest that MIP-1 could bind GLH-1 more strongly than MIP-2, and only MIP-1 LOTUS1 is predicted to bind GLH-1 with high affinity based on structural modeling. While it remains to be determined if MIP-1 and MIP-2 bind other germline helicases and whether they stimulate helicase activity in a manner similar to Oskar and Vasa, our data suggest that they could regulate P granule dynamics in part by engaging helicases to provide reaction centers for a range of RNP regulatory complexes.</p><p>The MIP LOTUS domains show high predicted 3D structural similarity but little overall sequence conservation with LOTUS domains from other organisms, except in the hydrophobic core.

Taken together, our structure-function analyses support the idea that MIP-1 and MIP-2 act as hubs in an RNP interaction network that serve as a scaffold and recruitment platform to help organize molecular machinery within P granules. Since LOTUS domains and IDRs variously interact with other proteins or RNAs, further structure-function studies into how these contribute to phase separation and to the overall function of processes that occur within germ granules will be important to better understand their roles in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Embryonic lethality and sterility</title><p>The <italic>mip-1;mip-2</italic> double null mutant gives rise to both embryonic lethality and progressive sterility that approaches 100% after only two generations at 25°C and elicits a mortal germ line (Mrt) phenotype within a few generations at 20°C.

Regulation of RNA helicase activity can either lock RNP complexes or remodel them by promoting RNA transfer between complexes, release, and turnover – all of which influence the composition, organization, and biophysical properties of condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marnik et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the dissolution of P granules upon loss of MIPs function is expected to have broad-ranging consequences on RNA metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Germline development</title><p>Increasing sterility in <italic>mip-1;mip-2</italic> animals over successive generations is accompanied by a spectrum of progressively more severe phenotypes in the adult germ line, involving all stages of germline development: germline stem cell maintenance, meiotic progression, the sperm/oocyte switch, and gametogenesis. Specific phenotypes include germ lines that are nearly devoid of germ cells; pachytene arrest and failure to produce any mature gametes; production of sperm but no oocytes; or small and disorganized oocytes, indicating a failure of apoptosis and/or oocyte growth.</p><p>Spatiotemporal protein expression in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line is primarily driven by post-transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Merritt et al., 2008</xref>), and P granules positioned over nuclear pores facilitate this by surveilling mRNAs as they exit germline nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sheth et al., 2010</xref>). Given that P granules are severely compromised in <italic>mip-1;mip-2</italic> mutants, their highly pleiotropic phenotypes likely reflect disruption of key post-transcriptional regulatory events. A complex network of RBPs, some of which localize to P granules, work together with the strongly conserved Notch and Ras-MAPK/ERK signaling cascades in a complex web of interactions to maintain totipotency and to coordinate developmental progression in the germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hubstenberger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kisielnicka et al., 2018</xref>). Mutations in different members of this network give rise to the full spectrum of phenotypes we observe upon loss of MIPs function, including defects in mitotic proliferation, meiotic progression, and sperm production, as well as feminization of the germ line and disorganized and aberrantly sized oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kimble and Crittenden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vaid et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Occasionally, the <italic>mip-1;mip-2</italic> null strain gives rise to distal oocytes, resulting in apparent duplication of the oogenic program. This Gogo phenotype has also been observed in association with mutations in the <italic>rpoa-2</italic> gene, encoding RNA Polymerase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eberhard et al., 2013</xref>), and in <italic>mina-1</italic>, which encodes an RNA-binding protein present exclusively in the pachytene zone of the germ line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sendoel et al., 2019</xref>). The <italic>rpoa-2(op259)</italic> mutation results in altered ribosomal RNA synthesis and confers resistance to germ cell apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage. MINA-1 is implicated in germline differentiation, physiological apoptosis and RNAi, and its absence also causes enlargement and disorganization of germline P granules. The second wave of oocyte differentiation in the distal gonad suggests that early meiotic cells begin to lose meiotic checkpoints sometime after a fully developed germ line has already been established in the adult hermaphrodite. While the proximal cause in <italic>mip</italic> mutants remains to be determined, the Gogo phenotype has been linked to alterations in the Ras/MAPK pathway, which directs developmental transitions in the germ line and is involved in regulating both physiological and DNA-damage-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eberhard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sendoel et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The most extreme <italic>mip-1;mip-2</italic> phenotype is a greatly reduced germ line, containing only a few germ cells with abnormally large nuclei in close proximity to the somatic distal tip cell (DTC). The few remaining cells in atrophied <italic>mip-1;mip-2</italic> germ lines thus appear to have exhausted their capacity for self-renewal and mitotic proliferation. We do not yet know if they fail in asymmetric GSC divisions, have simply arrested the mitotic cell cycle and become quiescent, or if they degenerate after attempting meiosis. Since we never see distal tumors, these cells are not simply blocked at the point of meiotic entry. Enlarged nuclei can be caused by a variety of factors, including DNA damage; further analysis of this phenotype awaits future studies.</p><p>The broad range of <italic>mip-1;mip-2</italic> phenotypes we see suggests that cells in the germ line cannot properly maintain their state or manage state transitions upon prolonged absence of MIPs function. The precise timing of a misregulated developmental switch would determine whether cells become terminally arrested or make a decision to differentiate into sperm or oocytes. Further work will be needed to elucidate the mechanisms through which the MIPs influence specific developmental events in the germ line, whether these primarily involve post-transcriptional regulation and/or small RNA pathways, and whether the MIPs also interact directly with Notch and Ras/MAPK signaling cascades.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>P granule dynamics</title><p>MEG-3 nonspecifically recruits numerous mRNAs into P granules in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2020</xref>), and in vitro it forms molecular condensates with RNA, which lowers its saturation concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Putnam et al., 2019</xref>). Antagonistic regulation of MEG-3 by PP2A phosphatase and MBK-2 kinase, a master regulator of the oocyte-to-embryo transition, and competition for RNA with anteriorly localized MEX-5, create a permissive environment for P granule assembly only in the posterior of the zygote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). We do not yet know if the serine-rich MIPs are also directly targeted by MBK-2 and/or by other kinases.</p><p>The MIPs and MEG-3 have a synergistic relationship in P granule formation in the early embryo: when either MEG-3 or <italic>mip-1</italic>/<italic>mip-2</italic> are absent, other P granule components are mostly diffuse in the zygote. Therefore, the MIPs appear to work together with MEG-3 to decrease the critical concentration for P granule condensation. One model could be that MEG-3 initiates P granule formation after fertilization by recruiting RNAs from the bulk cytoplasm, and the MIPs promote their consolidation and growth by recruiting additional P granule components (proteins and potentially RNAs) to these nascent structures. It remains to be determined precisely how the interplay between the MIPs, MEG-3, and other factors works to regulate the nucleation and growth of these complex coacervates.</p><p>P granules are dynamic structures that are variously cytoplasmic or perinuclear and which dissolve and reappear in a developmentally controlled manner. We found that PGL-3 was significantly more mobile than MEG-3, MIP-1, MIP-2, and GLH-1 in two-cell embryos, and that between the 2- and 12-cell stage its diffusivity slowed to match that of the other four proteins. PGL-3 therefore seems to become more firmly tethered within P granules in conjunction with their transition from free-floating to perinuclear structures, leading us to conclude that the biophysical properties of P granules in the embryo evolve over time.</p><p>MEG-3 has been described to form a ribbon-like structure surrounding and penetrating PGL granules in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) and to form an outer layer encasing a mobile PGL phase in reconstituted assemblies in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Putnam et al., 2019</xref>). As visualized here by super-resolution imaging, MEG-3 appears to permeate the full volume of cytoplasmic P granules and is fully interspersed with MIP-2 at least through the eight-cell stage, suggesting that the higher mobility of PGL-3 in very early embryos occurs in the absence of spatially distinct, immiscible phases. Since multi-phasic compartmentalization is highly sensitive to valency and stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Peran and Mittag, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Protter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>), it is possible that technical differences between studies – such as imaging techniques and in vitro vs. in vivo analyses – could lead to different conclusions about their architecture due to compositional heterogeneity under different conditions. Deconstructing the nature of these interactions will be an important focus for future study.</p><p>The MIPs play a central role in maintaining P granule integrity at all developmental stages. In contrast, embryos depleted of <italic>meg-3</italic> do eventually form P granules, since <italic>meg-3</italic> mutant larvae and adults show normal expression and localization of the MIPs and other P granule proteins in the germ line. Therefore, at least two distinct mechanisms exist to drive P granule assembly in vivo: nucleation and growth in the early embryo that depends on both MEG-3 and MIPs; and a MIP-dependent, MEG-3-independent process that nucleates and maintains P granules at the nuclear periphery later in germline development. This is consistent with the finding that phase separation of P granule components in the early embryo is not strictly required when other developmental determinants such as MEX-5 remain asymmetrically distributed in the zygote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gallo et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In WT embryos, P granules begin attaching to the nuclear periphery in the P2 cell, when the P lineage is thought to be transcriptionally silent, and form caps over nuclear pores throughout the rest of germline development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pitt et al., 2000</xref>). In the adult germ line, perinuclear granules assemble around RNA as it exits the nucleus, and transcription and mRNA export are required for their proper morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sheth et al., 2010</xref>). Association with membranes can reduce the saturation concentration for condensation by localized recruitment of components and restricting diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Snead and Gladfelter, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Söding et al., 2020</xref>). If the primary role of MEG-3 is to recruit RNAs from the bulk cytoplasm, this would provide a plausible mechanism for MEG-3-independent assembly.</p><p>The perinuclear localization of MIP-1 and MIP-2 in the germ line, independent of other P granule components, raises the possibility that they nucleate the formation of P granules at the nuclear periphery. P granules likely attach directly to nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), as knockdown of some nuclear pore proteins causes them to detach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Updike and Strome, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Voronina and Seydoux, 2010</xref>). Since MIP-1 typically appears closer to the base of perinuclear P granules than MIP-2 and is required for perinuclear localization of P granules, it is an obvious candidate for tethering granules to NPCs. The MIPs may work together with GLH-1 to maintain perinuclear association, since the FG repeats of GLH-1 are also necessary (but not sufficient) for its perinuclear localization in the embryo or when expressed ectopically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marnik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Updike et al., 2011</xref>). The FG repeats are thought to help tether GLH-1 to nuclear pores through hydrophobic interactions with FG repeat proteins in the NPC matrix. In support of this idea, GLH-1 and PGL-1 readily diffuse upon treatment with 1,6-hexanediol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Updike et al., 2011</xref> and this study). In contrast, The MIPs are partially resistant to this treatment and therefore must employ additional interaction forces to engage other P granule and/or nuclear pore components. GLH-1 also depends on MIP-1 in addition to its FG repeats to help anchor it within P granules, since its mobility increases when MIP-1 is depleted. Future experiments will be needed to fully understand the mechanistic basis of perinuclear P granule association.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Regulation of membraneless compartments</title><p>P granules and other biomolecular condensates are dynamic, non-equilibrium structures whose nucleation and growth are driven by a combination of high-affinity protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and weak multivalent interactions between IDRs and with RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mittag and Parker, 2018</xref>). Their biophysical properties are underpinned by a variety of molecular forces, including charge-charge, dipole-dipole, cation-pi, and pi-pi stacking interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brangwynne et al., 2015</xref>). These interactions are influenced by solvent properties like pH and ionic strength, environmental factors such as temperature, and by the concentration, composition, and stoichiometry of their components. In vivo, the formation and organization of biomolecular condensates are regulated by cellular and developmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Söding et al., 2020</xref>). High concentrations of free RNA and translational repressors tend to promote phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Langdon and Gladfelter, 2018</xref>), whereas a wide variety of post-translational modifications (PTMs) – including Arg/Lys methylation, Lys acetylation, Arg citrullination, Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphorylation, Ser/Thr glycosylation, and SUMOylation – can either promote or antagonize LLPS by altering electrostatics and binding valency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brangwynne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Snead and Gladfelter, 2019</xref>). By changing the nature and strength of molecular interactions, PTMs thus provide a mechanism for rapid and reversible control of material properties that allow tunable dynamic responses to changing conditions.</p><p>RNA helicases also play active roles in remodeling biomolecular condensates by regulating RNP dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Linder and Jankowsky, 2011</xref>). ATP-binding promotes condensation, and ATPase-coupled RNA duplex unwinding and release of ssRNA promote fluidity and RNA flux through phase-separated compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hondele et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hubstenberger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marnik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nott et al., 2015</xref>). ATP-dependent Vasa helicases have long been associated with essential functions in the germ line, where they engage a variety of RNP complexes involved in translational regulation and small RNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dallaire et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lasko, 2013</xref>). Vasa helicases such as GLH-1 therefore play a central role in coordinating numerous dynamic RNA regulatory processes within germ granules, where their activity would be expected to tune both biophysical properties and information flow. Since the MIPs directly bind and recruit the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Vasa homolog GLH-1 to P granules, many of the defects elicited in the absence of MIPs function could reflect a failure to properly organize different types of RNP reaction centers that require RNA helicase activity within them.</p><p>The broad spectrum of germline phenotypes we observe may be viewed in light of recent findings that biomolecular condensates enhance the robustness of switch-like cellular decisions and can also act as rheostats to tune outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Klosin et al., 2020</xref>). This is because phase separation selectively increases the efficiency of molecular reactions, both by concentrating specific molecular machinery and by excluding antagonistic regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Snead and Gladfelter, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Söding et al., 2020</xref>). P granules provide a protected compartment for mRNA surveillance by small RNA pathways and translational regulators. Storage and regulation of transcripts encoding developmental determinants are promoted by a combination of mRNA stabilization and translational repression, as well as exclusion of assembled ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marnik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Parker et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, while phase separation may not be absolutely required for the activity of individual P granule components, it generates a sequestered environment that helps buffer regulatory processes that contribute to the proper timing and execution of developmental transitions. The gradual appearance of wide-ranging developmental defects and consequent loss of reproductive potential in the absence of key germ granule components are therefore entirely consistent with the current view of how molecular condensates contribute to cellular robustness.</p><p>Membraneless organelles are complex dynamic assemblies with numerous constituents. To date, work on biomolecular condensates has primarily focused on the properties and roles of one or a small number of components in their assembly and dynamics. The identification of LOTUS-domain proteins that may organize and scaffold various RNP assemblies by recruiting a core Vasa helicase is a step forward toward understanding deeply conserved architectural principles of germ granules. Understanding their full range of molecular interactions, how their composition and dynamics are governed in vivo, and how these contribute to the regulation of essential cellular and developmental processes will be the next major challenge.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were maintained on NGM agar plates seeded with <italic>E. coli</italic> OP-50 as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

Iterative titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments suggest that the LOTUS-Vasa-CTD association has a K<sub>D</sub>~10 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jeske et al., 2017</xref>), whereas gel experiments imply that LOTUS-LOTUS has a K<sub>D</sub> in the range of nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeske et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, both experiment and modeling suggest the Oskar LOTUS-LOTUS dimer likely binds with a greater affinity than the Oskar LOTUS-Vasa-CTD complex, although a precise comparison requires more accurate measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Embryo affinity pull-down assays</title><p>Embryo affinity pull-down assays were performed using a modified protocol based on our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2016</xref>).

Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was chosen as fixed modification. Oxidation of methionine and acetylation of the protein N-terminus were considered as variable modifications. Minimum peptide length was seven amino acids. At least one unique peptide was required for each protein group. ‘Second peptides’ option was activated. ‘Match between runs’ function was sued to transfer identifications between measurement runs within a maximum retention time window of 1 min. False discovery rate (FDR) was set to 1% for both peptide and protein identifications. For protein quantification, both the unique and razor peptides were included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nesvizhskii and Aebersold, 2005</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Michael Buszczak as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Cipriani et al. present the identification of two LOTUS domain proteins that immunoprecipitate and co-localize with the P-granule component MEG-3. These phase-separating molecules affect the localization of a subset of other P granule components and physically interact with the GLH-1 helicase by Y2H and pull-down. The combination of genetic, biochemical, and modeling studies of novel P granule components make this a potentially attractive manuscript. However, there are substantial concerns about the figures and interpretation and clarity of writing that would need to be addressed for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Most critically, the paper is based on the premise that the IPs identify new P granule components, however the data to support this claim are buried in in Suppl Figure S3A and S4. These need to be moved to main figures in the manuscript. It should be noted that the image in Figure S3A shows partial colocalization, at best, with PGL-1 – instead, they appear as mostly adjacent, rather than overlapping, proteins. Furthermore, how do the authors explain the subset of particles that do not include PGL-1? Colocalization in the adult germ line also needs to be shown. Lastly, several images throughout the paper (i.e. panels in Figure 5 and 8) appear dim and difficult to evaluate. Brighter and higher magnification images should be to shown and/or the authors should consider using pseudo coloring that offers better contrast. Appropriate controls should also be included in the figures (see specific comments below for details)..</p><p>2) Unless more substantively validated, the modeling experiments should be moved to the supplement (or removed) and text describing their predictive value should be softened. For example, the modeling of the Lotus domain in Figure S1B-C seems unnecessary and the reviewers are concerned about the rigor of comparing the predicted <italic>C. elegans</italic> Lotus structures to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Oskar and other solved structures. Especially when this data is used to make the conclusion that the differences between the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Lotus domain &quot;structures&quot; suggests they perform separable functions.</p><p>3) While the authors describe the phenotypic consequence of loss of MIP-1/2, they do not connect these phenotypes to known defects in other P granule components. The authors' conclusions about the dependence of known P granule components on mip-1 and mip-2 appear overstated as the images clearly show granular components in some of these mutants. Could it be that MIP-1/2 are required for the posterior localization or retention of the granules, not the formation per se? The section on the interdependence of known P granule components and the MIPs is poorly organized and therefore difficult to read. They would be better addressing the localization of all other components in the mip-1/mip-2 backgrounds all together and then MIP-1/2 proteins in all of those backgrounds together.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60833.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Most critically, the paper is based on the premise that the IPs identify new P granule components, however the data to support this claim are buried in in Suppl Figure S3A and S4.

The image of an embryo previously shown in the original Figure S3 appeared to the reviewer to show adjacent localization due to the level of resolution of the image. The new main Figure 4 includes newer, higher-magnification panels showing more clearly the colocalization between the MIPs and PGL and between MIPs and MEG-3, in both the embryo as well as the adult germ line.</p><p>As previously shown for MEG-3 in Wang et al. 2014, some granules in the embryo (see Figure 4A) do not include PGL-1. These granules are generally localized toward the anterior, where it has been previously hypothesized that PGL granules are disassembled faster than other components like MEG-3 (Wang et al., 2014). We now include these observations in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Unless more substantively validated, the modeling experiments should be moved to the supplement (or removed) and text describing their predictive value should be softened. For example, the modeling of the Lotus domain in Figure S1B-C seems unnecessary and the reviewers are concerned about the rigor of comparing the predicted <italic>C. elegans</italic> Lotus structures to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Oskar and other solved structures. Especially when this data is used to make the conclusion that the differences between the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Lotus domain &quot;structures&quot; suggests they perform separable functions.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we have had very good success in the past modeling protein complexes with high predictive ability and good agreement with experimental data (Gan and Gunsalus, NAR 2013; Gan and Gunsalus, NAR 2015; Flamand et al., NAR 2017; Chahal et al., NAR 2019; Gan et al., JMB 2021), we agree that homology models provide only a preliminary analysis of potential 3D structures and complexes and have revised and softened the related text in the Results accordingly. To avoid placing too much emphasis on specific RMSDs, we have also removed the rest of the paragraph describing the structural comparisons and now say simply, “Superpositions of LOTUS domain models from worm, fly, and human display clear structural similarity (Supplementary File 1b,1c).”</p><p>Regarding Figure S1 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), the basic message that we want to convey is that the combination of multiple sequence alignments, secondary structural predictions, and tertiary structural models provides clear evidence that the overall structural similarity between the MIP and Oskar LOTUS domains is remarkably high, despite the fact that the overall sequence conservation is very low. The models in Figure S1B and C (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C) provide visual aids to understand the basis of this similarity, and we therefore believe there is value in retaining them. Specifically, Figure S1B (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B) illustrates that the pattern of sequence conservation shown in Figure S1A (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A) maps to the hydrophobic core of the domain and thus reveals the likely reason why these specific residues are so strongly conserved. The model comparisons in Figure S1C (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C) illustrate that we are able to identify the α 5 helix in all four different LOTUS domains, which is a distinctive feature of the extended LOTUS (eLOTUS) sub-class of this domain family. While a definitive determination will require solving the structures of these domains directly, the models provide additional support, beyond secondary structural predictions, for classifying these as eLOTUS domains instead of mLOTUS domains and will help direct future studies on their function. We believe that sharing all of the evidence we gathered on the potential functions of these domains will be useful for the community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While the authors describe the phenotypic consequence of loss of MIP-1/2, they do not connect these phenotypes to known defects in other P granule components. The authors' conclusions about the dependence of known P granule components on mip-1 and mip-2 appear overstated as the images clearly show granular components in some of these mutants. Could it be that MIP-1/2 are required for the posterior localization or retention of the granules, not the formation per se?</p></disp-quote><p>We now point out in the manuscript that the granule phenotypes observed upon depletion of both MIPs in early embryos, as revealed by localization defects in other P granule components, are very similar to those previously described as a consequence of the depletion of MEG-3 and -4 (Wang et al. 2014; Ouyang et al. 2020).</p><p>Regarding the presence of residual granules, please note that since the double <italic>mip</italic> deletion lines rapidly become sterile, we were not able to maintain fluorescently tagged versions of other P granule proteins in this genetic background. Therefore, these experiments were performed using double <italic>mip-1;mip-2</italic> RNAi, which results in some variability in the amount of residual protein detected (and likely a weaker effect on P granule formation). To better illustrate our observations, we have replaced many of the micrographs obtained by epifluorescence with new images obtained with the Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope (Figure 5A). The improved sensitivity and resolution of this instrument allowed us to better detect and visualize the localization of residual condensates in the embryo. These experiments confirmed that P granule assembly is indeed compromised, particularly at the earliest stages.</p><p>We have also added new time-lapse videos taken with this instrument showing examples of how these residual granules behave through the first two cell divisions upon <italic>mip-1(RNAi);mip2(RNAi)</italic> (Videos 1-3). In the course of repeating these experiments, we noticed that the intensity and apparent size of the residual granules can vary considerably depending on the brightness of the fluorophores in different strains, even for the same tagged protein. This is illustrated by Video 2, which was acquired using a brighter GLH-1::GFP strain in which residual granules are more prominent than those we observed previously.</p><p>Prompted by the reviewer’s comment regarding posterior retention of granules, we also examined this question more closely. This reanalysis showed that PGL-3, but not GLH-1 or MEG-3, additionally fails to concentrate in the posterior region of P lineage cells prior to mitosis and thus becomes mis-segregated to the sister cell. Therefore, the posterior localization of some, but not all, P granule components does not occur normally in the absence of the MIPs.</p><p>Finally, we have not found a previous report in the literature of another pair of paralogs that show opposing effects on the size and perinuclear attachment of granules in the germ line, as we describe for the MIPs in this manuscript. As requested, to better demonstrate this effect we have quantified the size and spatial distribution of granules in different genetic backgrounds. These data are now presented in a new main figure (Figure 9, MIP granules) and in additional panels added to a previous figure (Figure 10, GLH-1 granules).</p><p>We have revised the text in the manuscript to include all of the new observations resulting from these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The section on the interdependence of known P granule components and the MIPs is poorly organized and therefore difficult to read. They would be better addressing the localization of all other components in the mip-1/mip-2 backgrounds all together and then MIP-1/2 proteins in all of those backgrounds together.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rearranged the description of this section to make it clearer and revised the associated figure accordingly (Figure 5).</p></body></sub-article></article>
