Little is understood about biofilm dispersal. Here, we show that MbaA, a periplasmic polyamine sensor, and PotD1, a polyamine importer, regulate <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm dispersal. Spermidine, a commonly produced polyamine, drives <italic>V. cholerae</italic> dispersal, whereas norspermidine, an uncommon polyamine produced by vibrios, inhibits dispersal. Spermidine and norspermidine differ by one methylene group. Both polyamines control dispersal via MbaA detection in the periplasm and subsequent signal relay. Our results suggest that dispersal fails in the absence of PotD1 because endogenously produced norspermidine is not reimported, periplasmic norspermidine accumulates, and it stimulates MbaA signaling. These results suggest that <italic>V. cholerae</italic> uses MbaA to monitor environmental polyamines, blends of which potentially provide information about numbers of ‘self’ and ‘other’. This information is used to dictate whether or not to disperse from biofilms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic></kwd><kwd>biofilms</kwd><kwd>signal transudction</kwd><kwd>polyamine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bassler</surname><given-names>Bonnie L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R37GM065859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bassler</surname><given-names>Bonnie L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1713731</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bassler</surname><given-names>Bonnie L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck - Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bassler</surname><given-names>Bonnie L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG-2302-17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bridges</surname><given-names>Andrew A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The global pathogen <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> monitors environmental polyamines to garner information about numbers of ‘self’ versus ‘other’ in the vicinity, and in response, to remain or disperse from biofilms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacteria frequently colonize environmental habitats and infection sites by forming surface-attached multicellular communities called biofilms. Participating in the biofilm lifestyle allows bacteria to collectively acquire nutrients and resist threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flemming et al., 2016</xref>). By contrast, the individual free-swimming state allows bacteria to roam. The global pathogen <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> undergoes repeated rounds of clonal biofilm formation and disassembly, and both biofilm formation and biofilm exit are central to disease transmission as <italic>V. cholerae</italic> alternates between the marine niche and the human host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallego-Hernandez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tamayo et al., 2010</xref>). The <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm lifecycle occurs in three stages. First, a founder cell attaches to a substate; second, through cycles of growth, division, and extracellular matrix secretion, the biofilm matures; and finally, when the appropriate environmental conditions are detected, cells leave the biofilm through a process termed dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bridges et al., 2020</xref>). Bacterial cells liberated through dispersal can depart their current environment and repeat the lifecycle in a new niche, such as in a new host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guilhen et al., 2017</xref>). In general, the initial stages of the biofilm lifecycle, from attachment through maturation, have been well studied in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and other bacterial species, whereas the dispersal phase remains underexplored. Components underlying biofilm dispersal are beginning to be revealed. For example, in many bacterial species, the Lap system that is responsible for cell attachments during biofilm formation is also involved in dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christensen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gjermansen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kitts et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Newell et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To uncover mechanisms controlling <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm dispersal, we recently developed a brightfield microscopy assay that allows us to follow the entire biofilm lifecycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bridges and Bassler, 2019</xref>). We combined this assay with mutagenesis and high-content imaging to identify mutants that failed to properly disperse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bridges et al., 2020</xref>). Our screen revealed genes encoding proteins that fall into three functional groups: signal transduction, matrix degradation, and cell motility. Our hypothesis is that these classes of components act in sequence to drive biofilm dispersal. First, the cues that induce dispersal are detected by the signal transduction proteins. Second, activation of matrix digestion components occurs. Finally, cell motility engages and permits cells to swim away from the disassembling biofilm. The majority of the genes identified in the screen encoded signal transduction proteins. Elsewhere, we characterized one of the signaling systems identified in the screen, a new two-component phospho-relay that we named DbfS-DbfR (for Dispersal of Biofilm Sensor and Dispersal of Biofilm Regulator) that controls biofilm dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bridges et al., 2020</xref>). Of the remaining signaling proteins identified in the screen, four are proteins involved in regulating production/degradation of, or responding to, the second messenger molecule cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP).</p><p>c-di-GMP regulates biofilm formation in many bacteria including <italic>V. cholerae</italic> in which low c-di-GMP levels correlate with motility and high c-di-GMP levels promote surface attachment and matrix production, and thus, biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conner et al., 2017</xref>). c-di-GMP is synthesized by enzymes that contain catalytic GGDEF domains that have diguanylate cyclase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conner et al., 2017</xref>). c-di-GMP is degraded by proteins with EAL or HD-GYP domains that possess phosphodiesterase activity. <italic>V. cholerae</italic> encodes &gt;50 proteins harboring one or both of these domains, underscoring the global nature of c-di-GMP signaling in this pathogen. The activities of these enzymes are often regulated by environmental stimuli through ligand binding sensory domains; however, in most cases, the identities of ligands for GGDEF- and EAL-containing enzymes are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Römling et al., 2013</xref>). Of the c-di-GMP regulatory proteins identified in our dispersal screen, only one, the hybrid GGDEF/EAL protein, MbaA, which has previously been shown to regulate <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bomchil et al., 2003</xref>), has a defined environmental stimulus: MbaA responds to the ubiquitous family of small molecules called polyamines, aliphatic cations containing two or more amine groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miller-Fleming et al., 2015</xref>). Our dispersal screen also identified PotD1, a periplasmic binding protein that mediates polyamine import and that has also been shown to control <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cockerell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McGinnis et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, identification of these two genes in our screen suggested that beyond roles in biofilm formation, polyamine detection could be central to biofilm dispersal. In the present work, we explore this new possibility.</p><p>Polyamines are essential small molecules derived from amino acids and were likely produced by the last universal common ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Michael, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miller-Fleming et al., 2015</xref>). Different organisms make distinct blends of polyamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Michael, 2018</xref>), and they are involved in biological processes ranging from stress responses to signal transduction to protein synthesis to siderophore production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karatan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McGinnis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Michael, 2018</xref>). In some cases, mechanisms underlying polyamine function are known. For example, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A is modified with hypusine that is derived from the polyamine spermidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Puleston et al., 2019</xref>). In most cases, however, the mechanisms by which polyamines control physiology remain mysterious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miller-Fleming et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Polyamines are known to be involved in biofilm development in many bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hobley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karatan and Michael, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Michael, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nesse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patel et al., 2006</xref>). Intriguingly, the biofilm alterations that occur in response to a given polyamine vary among species. In <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, norspermidine, a rare polyamine produced by Vibrionaceae and select other organisms, promotes biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karatan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, the nearly ubiquitous polyamine spermidine, which differs from norspermidine only by a single methylene group, is not produced at substantial levels by <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and it represses <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karatan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McGinnis et al., 2009</xref>). Likewise, the polyamine spermine, typically made by eukaryotes, also represses <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sobe et al., 2017</xref>). Both spermidine and spermine are abundant in the human intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benamouzig et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McEvoy and Hartley, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Osborne and Seidel, 1990</xref>). These results have led to the hypothesis that <italic>V. cholerae</italic> detects norspermidine as a measure of ‘self’ and spermidine and spermine as measures of ‘other’ to assess the species composition of the vicinal community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sobe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wotanis et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>V. cholerae</italic> funnels that information internally to determine whether or not to make a biofilm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sobe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wotanis et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>V. cholerae</italic> produces intracellular norspermidine; however, norspermidine has not been detected in cell-free culture fluids of laboratory-grown strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parker et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, if norspermidine does indeed enable <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to take a census of ‘self,’ it is apparently not via a canonical quorum-sensing-type mechanism.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Polyamine sensing in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>.</title><p>Schematic showing the previously proposed polyamine detection and import mechanisms in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. Norspermidine (Nspd, triangles) promotes biofilm formation and spermidine (Spd, circles) represses biofilm formation. The primarily eukaryotic polyamine spermine (not pictured) also signals through the NspS-MbaA pathway. See text for details. OM: outer membrane; IM: inner membrane.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65487-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>As mentioned above, information contained in extracellular polyamines is transduced internally by MbaA, which is embedded in the inner membrane. MbaA contains a periplasmic domain that interacts with the periplasmic binding protein NspS. <italic>nspS</italic> is located immediately upstream of <italic>mbaA</italic> in the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cockerell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karatan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Young et al., 2021</xref>). MbaA also possesses cytoplasmic GGDEF (SGDEF in MbaA) and EAL (EVL in MbaA) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Genetic evidence suggests that when NspS is bound to norspermidine, the complex associates with MbaA and biofilm formation is promoted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cockerell et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, NspS interaction with MbaA inhibits MbaA phosphodiesterase activity, leading to increased c-di-GMP levels, and in turn, elevated biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, left panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cockerell et al., 2014</xref>). It is proposed that Apo-NspS and NspS bound to spermidine or spermine do not bind to MbaA, and thus, under this condition, biofilm formation is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cockerell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sobe et al., 2017</xref>). In this case, MbaA phosphodiesterase activity is not inhibited, which leads to decreased c-di-GMP levels and repression of biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, right panel). Currently, it is not known whether or not MbaA has diguanylate cyclase activity. The purified MbaA cytoplasmic domain functions as a phosphodiesterase in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cockerell et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In a proposed second regulatory mechanism, norspermidine and spermidine are thought to control biofilm formation via import through the inner membrane ABC transporter, PotABCD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McGinnis et al., 2009</xref>). Following internalization, via an undefined cytoplasmic mechanism, polyamines are proposed to modulate biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McGinnis et al., 2009</xref>). This hypothesis was based on the finding that elimination of PotD1, which is required for import of norspermidine and spermidine, resulted in elevated biofilm formation. Importantly, the studies reporting the MbaA and PotD1 findings used quorum-sensing-deficient <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Joelsson et al., 2006</xref>) that likely cannot disperse from biofilms. Furthermore, the end-point biofilm assays used could not differentiate between enhanced biofilm formation and the failure to disperse.</p><p>Here, we combine real-time biofilm lifecycle measurements, mutagenesis, a reporter of cytoplasmic c-di-GMP levels, and measurements of intra- and extracellular polyamine concentrations to define the roles that norspermidine and spermidine play in controlling the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm lifecycle. In wildtype <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, exogenous norspermidine and spermidine inversely alter cytoplasmic c-di-GMP levels and they exert their effects through the NspS-MbaA circuit. Norspermidine promotes biofilm formation and suppresses biofilm dispersal. Spermidine represses biofilm formation and promotes biofilm dispersal. Both the MbaA SGDEF and EVL domains are required for polyamine control of the biofilm lifecycle. We provide evidence that MbaA synthesizes c-di-GMP in the presence of norspermidine and degrades c-di-GMP in the presence of spermidine and that is what drives <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to form and disperse from biofilms, respectively. When MbaA is absent, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is unable to alter the biofilm lifecycle in response to extracellular polyamines. We demonstrate that polyamine internalization via PotD1 is not required to promote <italic>V. cholerae</italic> entrance or exit from biofilms, but rather, periplasmic detection of polyamines by MbaA is the key regulatory step. Specifically, our results suggest that the Δ<italic>potD1</italic> mutant fails to disperse because it is unable to reimport self-secreted norspermidine. The consequence is that excess periplasmic norspermidine accumulates, is detected by MbaA, and leads to production of c-di-GMP and suppression of biofilm dispersal. Collectively, our work reveals the mechanisms by which <italic>V. cholerae</italic> detects and transduces the information contained in polyamine signals into modulation of its biofilm lifecycle. We propose that the polyamine sensing mechanisms revealed in this study allow <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to distinguish relatives from competitors and potentially the presence of predators in the vicinity and, in response, modify its biofilm lifecycle to appropriately colonize territory or disperse from an existing community.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The polyamine signaling proteins MbaA and PotD1 regulate biofilm dispersal by changing c-di-GMP levels</title><p>Our combined mutagenesis-imaging screen identified the inner membrane polyamine sensor, MbaA, and the periplasmic polyamine binding protein PotD1 as essential for proper <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm dispersal, motivating us to explore the mechanisms underlying these effects. To probe polyamine signaling across the full biofilm lifecycle, we used our established brightfield imaging assay. In the case of WT <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, peak biofilm biomass is reached at ~8–9 hr of growth, and subsequently, dispersal occurs, and is completed by ~12 hr post inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Deletion of <italic>mbaA</italic> caused a mild biofilm dispersal defect with no detectable difference in peak biofilm biomass compared to WT, a less than 1 hr delay in the onset of dispersal, and 27% biomass remaining at 16 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Expression of <italic>mbaA</italic> from an ectopic locus in the Δ<italic>mbaA</italic> mutant complemented the biofilm dispersal defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, MbaA is required for WT <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm dispersal. The Δ<italic>potD1</italic> mutant exhibited a 60% greater peak biofilm biomass than WT and nearly all of the biomass remained at 16 hr, indicating that PotD1 both represses biofilm formation and promotes biofilm dispersal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Introduction of <italic>potD1</italic> at an ectopic locus in the Δ<italic>potD1</italic> mutant drove premature biofilm dispersal and reduced overall biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

As far as we are aware, no connection has yet been made between PotD1 and cytoplasmic c-di-GMP levels. To determine if the observed biofilm dispersal defects in the Δ<italic>mbaA</italic> and Δ<italic>potD1</italic> mutants track with altered c-di-GMP levels, we compared the relative cytoplasmic c-di-GMP levels in the WT, Δ<italic>mbaA</italic>, and Δ<italic>potD1</italic> strains. To do this, we employed a fluorescent reporter construct in which expression of <italic>turboRFP</italic> is controlled by two c-di-GMP-responsive riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). The TurboRFP signal is normalized to constitutively produced AmCyan encoded on the same plasmid. Previous studies have demonstrated a linear relationship between reporter output and c-di-GMP levels measured by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, the reporter showed that deletion of <italic>mbaA</italic> caused only a moderate increase in cytoplasmic c-di-GMP (8% higher than WT), while the Δ<italic>potD1</italic> mutant produced 39% more signal than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Using a <italic>P<sub>vpsL</sub>-lux</italic> promoter fusion that reports on the major matrix biosynthetic operon, we previously showed that matrix gene expression decreases as cells transition from the biofilm to the planktonic state, suggesting that repression of matrix production genes correlates with biofilm dispersal.

Using the <italic>vpsL-lux</italic> reporter, we found that the light production patterns mirrored the severities of the dispersal phenotypes and the magnitudes of changes in cytoplasmic c-di-GMP levels: the Δ<italic>mbaA</italic> mutant had a light production profile similar to WT, while the Δ<italic>potD1</italic> mutant produced 10-fold more light than WT throughout growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

We reasoned that MbaA and/or PotD1-mediated changes in cytoplasmic c-di-GMP levels could be responsible. To test this possibility, we assessed how changes in cytoplasmic c-di-GMP levels tracked with changes in extracellular polyamine levels by measuring the c-di-GMP reporter output in response to supplied mixtures of norspermidine and spermidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In the heatmaps, teal and purple represent the lowest and highest values of reporter output, respectively. When provided alone and above a concentration of 10 µM, norspermidine and spermidine strongly increased and decreased, respectively, c-di-GMP reporter activity. At the limit, relative to the WT, norspermidine increased the c-di-GMP reporter output by ~60% while spermidine reduced reporter output by ~25%. Notably, consistent with previous end-point biofilm assays, when norspermidine was present above 50 µM, it overrode the effect of exogenous addition of spermidine, irrespective of spermidine concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McGinnis et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cytoplasmic c-di-GMP levels are responsive to extracellular blends of polyamines. When norspermidine is abundant, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> produces high levels of c-di-GMP, matrix expression is increased, and biofilms do not disperse. In contrast, when spermidine is abundant and norspermidine is absent or present below a threshold concentration, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> c-di-GMP levels drop, matrix production is repressed, and biofilm dispersal occurs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MbaA transduces external polyamine information internally to control biofilm dispersal</title><p>Our data show that both the MbaA periplasmic polyamine sensor and the PotD1 polyamine importer are required for biofilm dispersal. Our next goal was to distinguish the contribution of periplasmic detection from cytoplasmic import of polyamines to the biofilm lifecycle. We began with periplasmic polyamine detection, mediated by NspS together with MbaA. We supplied norspermidine or spermidine to the Δ<italic>mbaA</italic> mutant and monitored biofilm biomass over time. To our surprise, the Δ<italic>mbaA</italic> mutant was impervious to the addition of either polyamine as both polyamines caused only a very modest reduction in overall biofilm biomass, and dispersal timing resembled the untreated Δ<italic>mbaA</italic> control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Consistent with this result, titration of the polyamines alone and in combination onto the Δ<italic>mbaA</italic> strain carrying the c-di-GMP reporter did not substantially alter reporter output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results show that the dynamic response of WT to polyamines requires MbaA. We suspect that the minor reduction in biofilm production that occurred in the Δ<italic>mbaA</italic> mutant when supplied polyamines is due to non-specific effects, perhaps via interaction of polyamines with negatively charged matrix components. We next investigated the role of the polyamine periplasmic binding protein NspS that transmits polyamine information to MbaA. In the absence of its partner polyamine binding protein, NspS, MbaA is thought to function as a constitutive phosphodiesterase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cockerell et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this model, deletion of <italic>nspS</italic> in an otherwise WT strain reduced overall peak biofilm biomass by 65% and dispersal initiated 4 hr prior to when dispersal begins in the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the Δ<italic>nspS</italic> mutant, c-di-GMP levels were lower than in the WT as judged by the c-di-GMP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), showing that MbaA is locked as a constitutive phosphodiesterase. Exogenous addition of polyamines had no effect on c-di-GMP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Together, these findings demonstrate that the WT <italic>V. cholerae</italic> response to polyamines is controlled by the NspS-MbaA polyamine sensing circuit.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Both the MbaA EVL and SGDEF domains are required for MbaA to detect polyamines</title><p>We wondered how the putative MbaA phosphodiesterase and diguanylate cyclase enzymatic activities contribute to the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> responses to norspermidine and spermidine. The cytoplasmic domain of MbaA exhibits phosphodiesterase but not diguanylate cyclase activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cockerell et al., 2014</xref>). We reasoned that, when an intact regulatory domain is present, MbaA could possess both enzymatic activities, with the activity of each domain inversely controlled by NspS binding. To probe the role of each domain, we introduced inactivating point mutations in the catalytic motifs. To ensure that our mutations did not destabilize MbaA, we first fused MbaA to 3xFLAG and introduced the gene encoding the fusion onto the chromosome at the <italic>mbaA</italic> locus. Tagging did not alter MbaA control over the biofilm lifecycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). To inactivate the MbaA phosphodiesterase activity, we substituted the conserved catalytic residue E553 with alanine, converting EVL to AVL (referred to as EVL* henceforth). This change did not alter MbaA-3xFLAG abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). <italic>V. cholerae</italic> harboring MbaA<sup>EVL*</sup> exhibited an increase in biofilm biomass and a strong biofilm dispersal defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and only a modest response to exogenous polyamines, with norspermidine eliciting some inhibition of biofilm dispersal and spermidine driving a small reduction in overall biofilm biomass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Treatment with norspermidine did increase c-di-GMP levels in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> carrying MbaA<sup>EVL*</sup> as judged by the reporter output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), albeit not to the level of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that the <italic>V. cholerae mbaA<sup>EVL</sup></italic><sup>*</sup> mutant, which is incapable of c-di-GMP degradation, retains the capacity to synthesize some c-di-GMP via the MbaA SGDEF domain. In contrast, the <italic>V. cholerae mbaA<sup>EVL</sup></italic><sup>*</sup> strain displayed little reduction in c-di-GMP levels in response to spermidine, presumably because it lacks the phosphodiesterase activity required to degrade c-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, despite the fact that the purified cytoplasmic domain functioned only as a phosphodiesterase in vitro, our results suggest that, in vivo, MbaA is capable of synthesizing c-di-GMP in the presence of norspermidine. To validate this prediction, we altered the conserved catalytic residues D426 and E427 to alanine residues, yielding the inactive MbaA SGAAF variant (referred to as SGDEF*). These substitutions did not affect protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

We propose a model in which elevated periplasmic norspermidine levels drive NspS to bind to MbaA. Consequently, MbaA phosphodiesterase activity is suppressed and the diguanylate cyclase activity dominates, which leads to c-di-GMP accumulation and commitment to the biofilm lifestyle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In contrast, when spermidine is detected, or when periplasmic polyamine concentrations are low, NspS dissociates from MbaA. Consequently, MbaA diguanylate cyclase activity is suppressed and its phosphodiesterase activity dominates, which leads to a reduction in cytoplasmic c-di-GMP and favors biofilm dispersal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Polyamines control the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm lifecycle via periplasmic detection, not via import into the cytoplasm</title><p>Here, we investigate the role of PotD1 in controlling biofilm dispersal. Addition of norspermidine did not alter the non-dispersing phenotype of the Δ<italic>potD1</italic> mutant, whereas spermidine treatment drove premature biofilm dispersal and a reduction in peak biofilm biomass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Consistent with these findings, addition of norspermidine to the Δ<italic>potD1</italic> strain did not alter the c-di-GMP reporter output, whereas addition of spermidine reduced output signal, but only at the highest concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These biofilm lifecycle and reporter results show that PotD1-mediated import is not required for spermidine to modulate the biofilm lifecycle. Thus, we considered an alternative mechanism to underlie the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> Δ<italic>potD1</italic> phenotype. We hypothesized that endogenously produced norspermidine is secreted into the periplasm. In the case of WT <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, the equilibrium between norspermidine release and PotD1-mediated reuptake places MbaA into a partially liganded state, and as a consequence, MbaA exhibits modest net phosphodiesterase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> Δ<italic>potD1</italic> mutant that cannot reimport norspermidine, we predict that periplasmic norspermidine levels become elevated, NspS detects norspermidine, binds to MbaA, and promotes the MbaA diguanylate cyclase active state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Hence, c-di-GMP is synthesized and biofilm dispersal is prevented. This hypothesis is consistent with our result showing that addition of norspermidine to the Δ<italic>potD1</italic> mutant does not cause any change in biofilm dispersal. Presumably, in the Δ<italic>potD1</italic> mutant, the NspS protein is already saturated due to elevated periplasmic levels of endogenously produced norspermidine. If this hypothesis is correct, norspermidine biosynthesis would be a requirement for biofilm formation because in the absence of norspermidine production, NspS would remain unliganded and MbaA would function as a constitutive phosphodiesterase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Indeed, and consistent with previous results, the Δ<italic>nspC</italic> mutant that lacks the carboxynorspermidine decarboxylase enzyme NspC that is required for norspermidine synthesis failed to form biofilms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McGinnis et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the Δ<italic>nspC</italic> Δ<italic>potD1</italic> double mutant also failed to form biofilms, showing that endogenous norspermidine biosynthesis is required for the Δ<italic>potD1</italic> mutation to exert its effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Consistent with these interpretations, the Δ<italic>mbaA</italic> mutation is epistatic to the Δ<italic>potD1</italic> mutation as the Δ<italic>mbaA</italic> Δ<italic>potD1</italic> double mutant exhibited a dispersal phenotype indistinguishable from the single Δ<italic>mbaA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Administration of exogenous norspermidine or spermidine to the Δ<italic>mbaA</italic> Δ<italic>potD1</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) mimicked what occurred following addition to the single Δ<italic>mbaA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>): that is, essentially no response. Thus, information from externally supplied polyamines is transduced internally by MbaA and not via PotD1-mediated import.

Unfortunately, we were unable to reliably obtain periplasmic compartment material. We reasoned, however, that some periplasmic norspermidine would diffuse into the extracellular environment, where it could be isolated and quantified, providing us a means to evaluate differences in periplasmic norspermidine levels between the WT and the Δ<italic>potD1</italic> mutant. At high cell density, approximately 25-fold more norspermidine was present in cell-free culture fluids collected from the Δ<italic>potD1</italic> mutant (average 2.3 µM) than in those prepared from the WT (average 90 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Norspermidine was nearly undetectable in culture fluids from the Δ<italic>nspC</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). There was no difference in norspermidine levels in whole-cell extracts prepared from WT (average 0.6 µmol/g) and the Δ<italic>potD1</italic> mutant (average 0.5 µmol/g) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Thus, the difference we measured in norspermidine concentrations in the two extracellular fractions cannot be due to variations in norspermidine biosynthesis between the two strains. As expected, both the cell-free fluid and the whole-cell extract from the Δ<italic>nspC</italic> mutant were devoid of norspermidine and spermidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), and consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>), only trace spermidine could be detected in the WT intra- and extracellular preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). For reference, we also measured the intra- and extracellular levels of additional polyamines from the same samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, our results argue against a cytoplasmic role for norspermidine in the biofilm lifecycle. Rather, our results indicate that the non-dispersing phenotype of the Δ<italic>potD1</italic> strain is due to elevated accumulation of periplasmic norspermidine stemming from the failure of the mutant to reuptake self-made norspermidine. The consequence is that, compared to WT <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, in the Δ<italic>potD1</italic> mutant, MbaA is biased in favor of c-di-GMP production and commitment to the biofilm lifestyle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>MbaA and polyamine levels remain constant throughout the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm lifecycle</title><p>Our results demonstrate that WT <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is poised to respond to exogenous polyamines through the NspS-MbaA signaling circuit, presumably allowing <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to adapt to the species composition of its environment. We wondered if, under the conditions of our biofilm assay, MbaA receptor abundance or endogenously produced norspermidine/spermidine levels change over the course of the biofilm lifecycle, either or both of which could influence the normal biofilm growth to dispersal transition. To test these possibilities, we measured MbaA-3xFLAG protein levels and the concentrations of intra- and extracellular polyamines during biofilm formation (T = 5 hr) and after dispersal (T = 10 hr) in WT <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. MbaA abundance and the intracellular concentrations of norspermidine and spermidine did not fluctuate between the 5 hr and 10 hr timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). The concentration of extracellular norspermidine did increase between 5 hr and 10 hr, from &lt;10 nM to ~75 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>); however, this range is far below the NspS-MbaA detection threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Norspermidine and spermidine, which differ in structure only by one methylene group, mediate starkly opposing effects on the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm lifecycle: norspermidine inhibits and spermidine promotes biofilm dispersal. Both function through the NspS-MbaA circuit. Thus, the polyamine binding protein NspS must harbor the exquisite capability to assess the presence or absence of a single chemical moiety as norspermidine binding drives NspS interaction with MbaA, whereas binding to spermidine prevents this interaction. Here, we speculate on the possible biological significance of our findings. We suspect that norspermidine and spermidine act as ‘self’ and ‘other’ cues, respectively. Specifically, norspermidine is a rare polyamine in the biosphere, produced only by select organisms, namely <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and closely related marine vibrios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamana, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Michael, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamamoto et al., 1991</xref>). The observation that laboratory-grown WT <italic>V. cholerae</italic> releases little norspermidine, at least in part due to PotD1-mediated reuptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggests that this system does not behave like a canonical quorum-sensing pathway. However, it is possible that norspermidine is secreted by <italic>V. cholerae</italic> under some environmental conditions, or by other vibrios, and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> detects the released norspermidine via NspS-MbaA, and its dispersal from biofilms is prevented. Thus, when close relatives are nearby, as judged by detection of the presence of norspermidine, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> elects to remain in its current biofilm niche. More speculative is the notion that norspermidine functions as a cue for phage-, predator-, or toxin-induced cell lysis. Specifically, if <italic>V. cholerae</italic> can detect norspermidine released by neighboring lysed <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cells, in response to the perceived danger, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> would remain in the protective biofilm state. Conversely, detection of spermidine, a nearly ubiquitously produced polyamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Michael, 2018</xref>), could alert <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to the presence of competing or unrelated organisms. In this case, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> would respond by dispersing from biofilms and fleeing that locale. In a seemingly parallel scenario, we previously discovered that autoinducer AI-2, a universally produced quorum-sensing signal, also drove <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm repression and premature dispersal, while CAI-1, the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> ‘kin’ quorum-sensing autoinducer, did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bridges and Bassler, 2019</xref>). Together, our findings suggest that <italic>V. cholerae</italic> possesses two mechanisms to monitor its own numbers (norspermidine and CAI-1) and two mechanisms to take a census of unrelated organisms in the environment (spermidine and AI-2), and it responds by remaining in the biofilm state when closely related species are in the majority and by exiting the biofilm state when the density of non-related organisms is high, presumably to escape competition/danger.</p><p>We found that periplasmic polyamine detection by NspS-MbaA, but not polyamine import, controls the biofilm dispersal program and both the MbaA EVL and SGDEF domains are required for the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> response to polyamines. Despite previous work suggesting that MbaA functions exclusively as a phosphodiesterase and that its SGDEF domain, which possesses a serine substitution in the active site relative to the canonical GGDEF active site, is inert with respect to c-di-GMP synthesis, our data suggest that when norspermidine is present, MbaA does synthesize c-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), as has also been shown for other SGDEF proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pérez-Mendoza et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, MbaA is likely a bifunctional protein capable of both c-di-GMP synthesis and degradation. We wonder how such an arrangement benefits <italic>V. cholerae</italic> in its response to polyamines. We speculate that the ability of MbaA to inversely alter c-di-GMP levels in response to two discrete cues coordinates polyamine signaling and enables more rapid and greater magnitude changes in c-di-GMP levels than would be achievable if two separate receptors existed, each harboring only a single catalytic activity and each responsive to only one polyamine.</p><p>An analogous bifunctional arrangement exists for the quorum-sensing two-component receptor LuxN from <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic>. LuxN is an inner membrane receptor that harbors a periplasmic sensory domain responsible for detection of a self-made small molecule cue, a homoserine lactone agonist with a four-carbon acyl tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bassler et al., 1994</xref>). The ligand encodes species-specific information about cell population density. Competing bacterial species that co-occupy the niche in which <italic>V. harveyi</italic> resides produce similar acyl homoserine lactone signal molecules, and notably, those molecules differ only in the acyl tail length or decoration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Papenfort and Bassler, 2016</xref>). The tails of the molecules produced by the competitors usually possess more than four carbons, and they act as potent LuxN antagonists. With respect to mechanism, the self-made agonist drives LuxN into phosphatase mode while the antagonists induce LuxN to act as a kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ke et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, as in the MbaA circuit, binding of the different ligands to LuxN propels opposing enzymatic activities in the cytoplasm. We speculate that ligand-driven alternations between opposing enzymatic activities could be an underappreciated mechanism that sensors employ to transmit species-specific and species-non-specific information into discrete changes in downstream behaviors.</p><p>In addition to conveying information about the species composition of the vicinal community, the MbaA SGDEF and EVL domains could also participate in dimerization and/or allosteric binding to c-di-GMP or other metabolites to mediate feedback regulation of the opposing MbaA activities. Parallel examples exist, here we present one: <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> contains a GGDEF/EAL protein called CC3396, in which the GGDEF domain is non-catalytic but it nonetheless binds to GTP, which allosterically activates the phosphodiesterase activity in the neighboring EAL domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christen et al., 2005</xref>). A feedback mechanism could provide MbaA with the ability to integrate the information encoded in extracellular polyamine blends with cytoplasmic cues, such as the metabolic state of the cell or the current cytoplasmic c-di-GMP level. Taken together, the double ligand detection capability linked to the dual catalytic activities of the NspS-MbaA circuit allows <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to distinguish between remarkably similar ligands and, in response, have the versatility to convey distinct information into the cell to alter the biofilm lifecycle.</p><p>In summary, four signaling pathways have now been defined that feed into the regulation of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm dispersal: starvation (RpoS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Singh et al., 2017</xref>), quorum sensing (via CAI-1 and AI-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bridges and Bassler, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Singh et al., 2017</xref>), the recently identified DbfS/DbfR cascade (ligand unknown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bridges et al., 2020</xref>), and through the current work, polyamine signaling via NspS-MbaA. We propose that integrating the information contained in these different stimuli into the control of biofilm dispersal endows <italic>V. cholerae</italic> with the ability to successfully evaluate multiple features of its fluctuating environment prior to committing to the launch of this key lifestyle transition that, ultimately, impinges on its overall survival. Because <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm formation and biofilm dispersal are intimately connected to cholera disease and its transmission, we suggest that deliberately controlling the biofilm lifecycle, possibly via synthetic strategies that target polyamine signal transduction via NspS-MbaA, could be a viable therapeutic strategy to ameliorate disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains, reagents, and imaging assays</title><p>The <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strain used in this study was WT O1 El Tor biotype C6706str2.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This paper presents evidence that the polyamines spermidine and norspermidine can inversely impact the dispersal of <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> biofilms through the protein MbaA, which contains a periplasmic domain that may interface with a possibly direct polyamine sensor, NspS. The paper presents compelling data to support the notion that the cyclic-di-GMP synthetase and phosphodiesterase domains of MbaA are ultimately responsible for transducing polyamine signals in the periplasm into changes in biofilm formation. The work indicates that external polyamines may function to provide self/non-self information, similar to quorum sensing systems.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Inverse regulation of <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> biofilm dispersal by polyamine signals&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Anthony Michael (Reviewer #2); Mark Mandel (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts.

The paper is easy to follow and presents some compelling data to support the notion that the cyclic-di-GMP synthetase and phosphodiesterase domains of MbaA are ultimately responsible for transducing polyamine signals in the periplasm into changes in biofilm formation. The work indicates that external polyamines may function to provide self/non-self information, similar to quorum sensing systems. There were several major concerns raised, as summarized below. In particular, there was concern from all three reviewers about how much polyamine-based signaling contributes to the formation of biofilms by wild-type cells, especially the self-produced norspermidine. In short, there's currently confusion about whether polyamines only impact biofilms when added exogenously or whether the endogenously produced/secreted levels can and do impact biofilms. Measuring these polyamines in biofilm cultures will be essential to a revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Experimental issues:</p><p>The deletion mutants (e.g. in Figure 2) need to be complemented.</p><p>The evidence for the periplasmic sensing model in the ΔpotD1 mutant is strong, but could be further strengthened by an intervention that blocks the proposed norspermidine export. If there is a way to interrupt endogenous norspermidine synthesis and/or export to the periplasm, this would add further support for the model in Figure 5CD to explain the role of PotD1. Similarly, a PotD1 allele that is still present in the periplasm but is nonfunctional for import would provide evidence that the key issue is flux/import, and not sequestration for PotD1.</p><p>The fact that the mbaA(SGDEF)* mutant still accumulates biomass at the same rate up to 8 hr as the wild-type with the same max value suggests that this pathway doesn't become relevant until later in biofilm formation. But, spermidine at high levels can inhibit early on (Figure 3A). To me, these two findings aren't reconciled in the authors' model (Figure 4F) which would lead one to believe that CDG synthesis by MbaA is critical for biofilm formation, but it's not (see Figure 4A) – to be clear, I recognize that the paper's title and abstract focus on dispersal, but the model leads one to think that the pathway being studied here is important throughout the biofilm development process. Maybe more generally, the issue is about how spermidine and norspermidine impact the normal development of a wild-type biofilm, if at all. It's not revealed until the Discussion that norspermidine isn't likely secreted at appreciable levels (something that should definitely be noted in the Introduction), so while exogenous addition can impact biofilms, the lack of secreted norspermidine makes it sound like it's actually not so critical to our understanding of WT biofilms and the behavior of WT biofilms documented in Figure 2. Following on this point above, I have two questions that seem critical to assessing how polyamines impact biofilm development: (i) What's the level of spermidine produced and secreted? If the dispersal is normally driven by spermidine, its levels should accumulate extracellularly or periplasmically at the time biofilms being to disperse. (ii) What's the biofilm phenotype of a mutant that cannot synthesize spermidine or norspermidine or both? It could be that mutants that can't synthesize polyamines behave like the WT and that neither is detectable in the periplasm/secreted fraction – such results wouldn't negate or diminish the conclusion that these polyamines can impact biofilm formation when added exogenously (which the Discussion speculates on), but it would mean that the usual pattern of biofilm mass accumulation and then drop off noted in Figure 2B isn't driven by the polyamines. At the very least, the initial accumulation seems very unlikely to be driven by norspermidine if it can't be detected.</p><p>Following on the point above, the group of Karatan, using HPLC, has repeatedly failed to detect extracellular norspermidine in the spent growth medium of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> planktonic and biofilm cultures (refs. Wotanis et al., 2017 and uncited Parker et al., (2012) FEMS Microbiol Lett 329, 19-27). The current authors have used LC-MS/MS to determine that spent growth medium from planktonic potD1 gene deletion cultures contain 15 times more norspermidine than the parental wildtype strain. The authors need to provide a quantitative analysis of the absolute levels of norspermidine produced by biofilm cultures and assess whether it exceeds the minimum amount required to see effects when exogenously adding norspermidine.</p><p>The hypothesis of the authors – that self-produced norspermidine in the Δ-potD1 mutant accumulates in the periplasm and elicits biofilm effects due to its periplasmic concentration, is elegant but requires two suppositions: firstly, norspermidine is secreted by the cell into the periplasm, and that the periplasmic concentration of norspermidine must be above a threshold that results in elicitation of biofilm and dispersal effects. Norspermidine is presumably able to freely diffuse out of the periplasm into the external medium via porins. Given the time scales involved, the concentration of norspermidine would be likely to equilibrate either side of the outer membrane. Therefore, either the concentration of norspermidine in the external cell-free medium must be above a threshold level that elicits biofilm effects, as discussed above. Or, norspermidine must be sequestered in the periplasm. How might sequestration of the norspermidine in the periplasm occur? The Karatan group showed that the cell-free spent medium from V. cholerae biofilm cultures contained 2 mM cadaverine, whereas the sterile cell-free growth medium contained only 3 μM cadaverine. This indicates that the biofilm cells were undergoing acid stress, which induces the cadaverine-producing and exporting cadAB system (lysine decarboxylase and lysine/cadaverine antiporter) but more relevantly, endogenously-produced cadaverine has been shown to block outer membrane porin channels, even if produced under pH neutral conditions (Samartzidou and Delcour (1999) &quot;Excretion of endogenous cadaverine leads to a decrease in porin-mediated outer membrane permeability&quot;, J. Bacteriol., 181, 791-798). Production and excretion of cadaverine by CadAB during biofilm formation could prevent self-produced norspermidine diffusing out of the periplasm. In the WT cells, any periplasmic norspermidine could be reacquired by the cell through the potABCD transporter, whereas in the Δ-potD1 mutant, a cadaverine block of porins might result in accumulation of periplasmic norspermidine. Questions to the authors: (1) What was the concentration of cadaverine in the WT and Δ-potD1 cell cultures and cell-free spent medium? (2) What was the concentration of putrescine, spermidine and N-acetylnorspermidine? Presumably this data is part of the original LC-MS/MS output. (3) The authors' polyamine data was obtained with planktonic cultures containing an additional deletion of the vps1 gene that eliminates the biofilm matrix. Did the authors measure norspermidine levels in cell-free spent medium from biofilm cultures? If not, it would be very relevant to the authors' hypothesis to measure norspermidine and cadaverine in the cell-free spent medium of WT and Δ-potD1 biofilm cultures (that are +vps1) and compare with sterile, cell-free medium. The blockage of porin permeability in the Samartzidou and Delcours study occurred when external cadaverine concentration had reached only 0.2 mM, whereas the Karatan group found 2 mM cadaverine in the external medium, suggesting that in the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm cells, cadaverine-blocked porins would prevent free diffusion of norspermidine out of the periplasm. Thus, cadaverine measurements would be very relevant to the authors' conclusions.</p><p>Scholarship issues:</p><p>A more thorough scholarly analysis of what is known about NspS (versus proposed here) would bolster the role for NspS in the authors' model.

Here, we respond to them one by one for clarity:</p><p>We take the referee’s first question to be: what level of control does the MbaA signaling pathway exert over the biofilm lifecycle in WT <italic>V. cholerae</italic> in the absence of exogenously supplied polyamines? As the reviewer notes, in the case of the WT strain under conditions in which exogenous polyamines are not supplied, it appears, based on our results, that MbaA plays a minor role in driving progression of the biofilm lifecycle because the ∆<italic>mbaA</italic> mutant forms nearly WT biofilms and only exhibits a modest dispersal defect (Figure 2B). However, we have now analyzed and included results for the Δ<italic>nspC</italic> strain (discussed above) which is unable to synthesize and secrete norspermidine (Figure 5F). Due to the absence of endogenously-produced norspermidine, the Δ<italic>nspC</italic> strain does not form biofilms, as has also been demonstrated by other groups. The Δ<italic>nspC</italic> mutant phenotype shows that, in WT, when MbaA is present, periplasmic norspermidine is required to suppress the MbaA phosphodiesterase activity, which in turn, allows biofilms to form. Thus, in WT, the MbaA pathway has a major role as it is required for the normal biofilm lifecycle to take place.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It's not revealed until the Discussion that norspermidine isn't likely secreted at appreciable levels (something that should definitely be noted in the Introduction), so while exogenous addition can impact biofilms, the lack of secreted norspermidine makes it sound like it's actually not so critical to our understanding of WT biofilms and the behavior of WT biofilms documented in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have clarified this point. We have included the following text in the Introduction (lines 92-96): “<italic>V. cholerae</italic> produces intracellular norspermidine, however, norspermidine has not been detected in cell-free culture fluids of laboratory grown strains (Parker et al., 2012). Thus, if norspermidine does indeed enable <italic>V. cholerae</italic> to take a census of ‘self’, it is apparently not via a canonical quorum-sensing type mechanism.”</p><p>In the discussion, we now write (lines 395-400), “The observation that laboratory grown WT <italic>V. cholerae</italic> releases little norspermidine, at least in part due to PotD1-mediated reuptake (Figure 5C), suggests that this system does not behave like a canonical quorum sensing pathway. However, it is possible that norspermidine is secreted by <italic>V. cholerae</italic> under some environmental conditions, or by other vibrios, and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> detects the released norspermidine via NspS-MbaA, and its dispersal from biofilms is prevented.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Following on this point above, I have two questions that seem critical to assessing how polyamines impact biofilm development: (i) What's the level of spermidine produced and secreted?

We performed the requested analyses. Please see lines 367-383 and the new Figure 6B. In brief, in the revised manuscript, we now provide quantitation of intracellular and extracellular spermidine and norspermidine concentrations at two timepoints – one prior to (5 h) and one after (10 h) biofilm dispersal. We find that, consistent with previous reports, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> makes almost no spermidine under all conditions tested. Furthermore, no substantial fluctuations in norspermidine levels (intracellular or extracellular) occurred between the timepoints that could be responsible for driving biofilm dispersal. We also considered the possibility that MbaA levels could change over the biofilm lifecycle, which could alter MbaA output activity. We therefore quantified MbaA-3xFLAG levels prior to (5 h) and after (10 h) biofilm dispersal (new Figure 6A). We found that MbaA levels remained constant. Our conclusion is that MbaA is poised to regulate the biofilm lifecycle in response to exogenous polyamines. Moreover, in the WT strain in the absence of environmentally-supplied polyamines, MbaA activity is constant and biased toward phosphodiesterase function throughout the biofilm lifecycle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(ii) What's the biofilm phenotype of a mutant that cannot synthesize spermidine or norspermidine or both?

We have now assayed the biofilm lifecycle of the ∆<italic>nspC</italic> mutant that cannot synthesize norspermidine (new Figure 5F; discussed in lines 319-327). No biofilm formation occurs in this mutant demonstrating that, for normal biofilm development to occur, periplasmic norspermidine is required to suppress the MbaA phosphodiesterase activity (as discussed above in response to point 3).

To test the referee’s hypothesis that cadaverine blockage of porins causes norspermidine trapping in the periplasm, we performed several experiments. Our data are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. We find no evidence for cadaverine export in controlling extracellular norspermidine levels or in driving the biofilm lifecycle.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we now provide quantitation of cadaverine, putrescine, spermidine, and norspermidine levels in all of our polyamine measurements. Those data are provided in new Figure 5 I, J; new Figure 5—figure supplement 2; new Figure 6B; and new Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><p>Regarding cadaverine: First, in WT planktonic, shaken cultures at high cell density, cadaverine was present at 0.5 µM in cell-free culture fluids (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2B; middle panel). In biofilm cells grown under static conditions, concentrations of both intracellular and extracellular cadaverine were low at the 5 h timepoint and dramatically increased at 10 h (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1). These results are consistent with those in the Karatan manuscript that demonstrated higher cadaverine levels for statically grown biofilm cells than for cells grown in shaken culture. Both sets of results suggest that, at late times, acid stress occurs in the static cultures, <italic>cadAB</italic> is induced, and cadaverine accumulates. Our temporal results, however, are inconsistent with the referee’s hypothesis that cadaverine blockage of porin channels leads to elevated norspermidine and subsequent changes in NspS-MbaA signaling. Specifically, cadaverine is in low abundance at the 5 h timepoint, when biofilm formation is favored. Cadaverine concentration increases by 10 h, after dispersal has occurred. This timing suggests that, if cadaverine had blocked porins, norspermidine would have accumulated in the periplasm by the 10 h timepoint, promoting biofilm formation, however, that does not occur. Rather, we observe biofilm dispersal.</p><p>We further examined the relationship between cadaverine and the biofilm lifecycle by constructing a Δ<italic>cadB</italic> mutant that lacks the lysine/cadaverine antiporter responsible for cadaverine secretion. The biofilm lifecycle of the Δ<italic>cadB</italic> mutant was identical to that of WT <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), showing that periplasmic/extracellular cadaverine does not alter norspermidine signaling in WT <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. Moreover, we made the Δ<italic>cadB</italic> Δ<italic>potD1</italic> double mutant and it behaved identically to the single Δ<italic>potD1</italic> mutant. Thus, the presence or absence of cadaverine does not alter the biofilm dispersal failure phenotype of the Δ<italic>potD1</italic> mutant, so the Δ<italic>potD1</italic> mutant phenotype cannot be due to blocking of porins by cadaverine. Together, our results show that secreted cadaverine does not impinge on the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm lifecycle, and therefore, cadaverine has no effect on periplasmic norspermidine levels nor on MbaA activity.</p><p>Because our results do not support any role for cadaverine in the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm lifecycle, we want to keep the message of our manuscript streamlined.

I think a more sophisticated discussion of the issue here would be helpful, given that this is the lab that has defined the relevant QS signaling, has distinguished surface biofilms vs. liquid aggregates, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have expanded the text on the topic of polyamines as self vs non-self-signals in the Introduction, Results, and Discussion sections, with a focus on comparing the polyamine system to traditional quorum-sensing circuits. For example, see lines 391-408 for our overarching ideas concerning how the NspS-MbaA system could function to distinguish “self” vs “other.” Additionally, see lines 430-444 where we compare and contrast the opposing MbaA enzymatic activities to those of the established quorum-sensing receptor, LuxN. Beyond those new passages, at present, we hesitate to speculate on the role of MbaA signaling in disease transmission absent any data on which to hang our ideas. To our knowledge, NspS-MbaA-mediated signaling has not yet been investigated in animal models of infection.</p></body></sub-article></article>
