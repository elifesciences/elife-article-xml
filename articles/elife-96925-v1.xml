Over 90% of PDAC have oncogenic KRAS mutations, and phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are direct effectors of KRAS. Our previous study demonstrated that ablation of <italic>Pik3ca</italic> in KPC (<italic>Kras</italic><sup>G12D</sup>; <italic>Trp53</italic><sup>R172H</sup>; <italic>Pdx1-Cre</italic>) pancreatic cancer cells induced host T cells to infiltrate and completely eliminate the tumors in a syngeneic orthotopic implantation mouse model. Now, we show that implantation of <italic>Pik3ca</italic><sup>−/−</sup> KPC (named αKO) cancer cells induces clonal enrichment of cytotoxic T cells infiltrating the pancreatic tumors. To identify potential molecules that can regulate the activity of these anti-tumor T cells, we conducted an in vivo genome-wide gene-deletion screen using αKO cells implanted in the mouse pancreas. The result shows that deletion of propionyl-CoA carboxylase subunit B gene (<italic>Pccb</italic>) in αKO cells (named p-αKO) leads to immune evasion, tumor progression, and death of host mice. Surprisingly, p-αKO tumors are still infiltrated with clonally enriched CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but they are inactive against tumor cells. However, blockade of PD-L1/PD1 interaction reactivated these clonally enriched T cells infiltrating p-αKO tumors, leading to slower tumor progression and improve survival of host mice. These results indicate that <italic>Pccb</italic> can modulate the activity of cytotoxic T cells infiltrating some pancreatic cancers and this understanding may lead to improvement in immunotherapy for this difficult-to-treat cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pancreatic cancer</kwd><kwd>KPC cells</kwd><kwd>CD8 T cells</kwd><kwd>PD1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100024030</institution-id><institution>Veterans Affairs Scholarship Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BX004083</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Richard Z</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21CA274425</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Richard Z</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA129536</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zong</surname><given-names>Wei-Xing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA236246</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zong</surname><given-names>Wei-Xing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genome-wide CRISPR screen identified propionyl-CoA subunit B as a key regulator for anti-tumor T-cell activity in pancreatic cancer, which holds promise for advancing immunotherapy strategies in curing pancreatic cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive and lethal cancers, and it is expected to be the second leading cause of cancer death by 2030, with a 5-year survival rate of 12% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Siegel et al., 2023</xref>).

However, a previous study showed that a minority of PDAC patients have tumors that already exhibit higher levels of infiltrating cytotoxic T cells and this observation is associated with longer survival of these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balachandran et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>One of the most commonly dysregulated pathways in PDAC is oncogenic KRAS and G12D is the most common KRAS mutation (46%) in PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Halbrook et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moore et al., 2020</xref>). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are direct effectors of KRAS. There are four PI3K catalytic isoforms and our group have previously shown that PIK3CA isoform plays a critical role in the initiation of PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2014</xref>) and mediates immune evasion once the tumors are formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sivaram et al., 2019</xref>). Our group reported that KRAS signaling through PIK3CA can reduce the expression of MHC class I molecules, thus reducing antigen recognition and T-cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sivaram et al., 2019</xref>). We showed that genetic ablation of PIK3CA in KPC (<italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup>;Trp53<sup>R172H</sup>;Pdx1-Cre</italic>) pancreatic tumor cells led to T-cell recognition and complete elimination by the host immune system in a syngeneic orthotopic implantation mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sivaram et al., 2019</xref>). Using this well-characterized syngeneic orthotopic implantation mouse model with the αKO (<italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup>;Trp53<sup>R172H</sup>;Pdx1-Cre;Pik3ca<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) cell line and single-cell sequencing analysis, we found clonal enrichment of cytotoxic T cells infiltrating αKO tumors. To investigate potential molecules within αKO cells that affect the activity of host T cells, we performed an in vivo genome-wide CRISPR gene-deletion screen using αKO cells and found that deletion of propionyl-CoA carboxylase subunit B (PCCB) could reverse the immune-elimination phenotype. We further discovered that T cells infiltrating the p-αKO (<italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup>;Trp53<sup>R172H</sup>;Pdx1-Cre;Pik3ca<sup>−/−</sup>;Pccb<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) tumors were suppressed and could not eliminate the tumor cells.

Analysis of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells’ clonal size distribution revealed clonal enrichment in both αKO tumors, suggesting T cells in both tumors have been activated in response to tumor antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A clonotype is defined as three or more cells with identical TCR sequences. A clonal size of 3–49 is defined as small expansion, and a clonal size of 50 or more is designated as large expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> displays the TCR sequences for CD8<sup>+</sup> clones with large expansions (clonal size ≥50) in both tumors.</p><p>We next analyzed the clonality of these cells with respect to their transcriptomes. The gene expression profiles were visualized using the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To achieve this, the expression data underwent unsupervised clustering by Seurat. Cell type annotations were determined using ProjectTILs, a computational method that annotates cell types by projecting scRNA-seq data onto reference profiles constructed from well-established canonical cell markers and clinical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreatta et al., 2021</xref>). The Violin Plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> illustrates major markers used for cell type annotation by ProjectTILs. Based on the annotation, clusters are annotated as effector memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Cd8_EffectorMem), naive-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells or central memory T cells (Cd8_NaiveLike), exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Cd8_Tex), and precursor exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Cd8_Tpex). We next mapped the TCR profiling datasets to the single-cell gene expression datasets and then color coded by the size of each clonotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The degree of expansion observed among the clonotypes associated strongly with the phenotypic clusters of T cells, as large clones are mapped to the Cd8_EffectorMem and Cd8_Tex, while non-clonal T cells mapped to the Naive/centra memory T-cell group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> shows the single-cell gene profile distribution of large expansion (clonal size ≥50) clonotype from both tumors.

A schema for the CRISPR knockout screen is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Briefly, αKO cells were first infected with the genome-scale CRISPR knockout (GeCKO v2) pooled lentiviral library A, which targets the complete mouse genome of 20,611 genes with three sgRNAs for each gene, as well as four sgRNAs for each of the 1175 miRNAs and 1000 control sgRNAs. Equal portion of the mixed cell pool was implanted into the pancreas of eight immunocompetent B6 mice and tumor progression was monitored longitudinally by an IVIS Lumina III in vivo imaging system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). When implanted in B6 mice, αKO tumors completely regressed. Therefore, cells with genetically deleted molecules that can reverse the immune recognition phenotype should lead to tumor progression. Indeed, two out of eight mice 8 weeks after cell implantation exhibited tumor progression, which were labeled as tumors #1 and #2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Tumors were harvested from both mice for further analysis. The remaining mice (six out eight) exhibited complete tumor regression consistent with the phenotype we previously observed with αKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Genomic DNA was prepared from both tumors and subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) to detect the presence of incorporated sgRNA sequences.

Immunoblotting showed no changes in phosphorylation of PIK3CA’s downstream effector AKT at both Thr308 and Ser473 residues.

PTEN is a negative regulator of the PI3K–AKT pathway, and its expression was not different between the three cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In summary, the loss of PCCB did not reverse the changes in PIK3CA–AKT signaling in αKO cells.

Our previous investigations with a PDAC mouse model revealed that downregulation of PIK3CA in tumor cells enhances their recognition and elimination by T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sivaram et al., 2019</xref>). Building on this foundation, our present study demonstrates that implanting αKO cells into B6 mice induces a clonal enrichment of cytotoxic T cells within the TME.</p><p>Conducting a genome-wide in vivo CRISPR screen with αKO cells implanted in the mouse pancreas allowed us to identify key molecules governing the activity of these anti-tumor T cells. Notably, we discovered that the loss of PCCB, a subunit of the mitochondrial enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase, can entirely reverse the immune recognition phenotype resulting from PIK3CA downregulation. Deleting PCCB in pancreatic tumor cells lacking PIK3CA leads to immune evasion, tumor progression, and ultimately, the death of the host animal. Despite T cells still infiltrating p-αKO tumor sections, there is an enrichment of immune checkpoint molecules such as PD1. Intriguingly, implanting p-αKO cells into PD1-null mice significantly improved mouse survival, hinting at the partial attribution of immune evasion in p-αKO tumors to elevated PD1 expression on T cells. Furthermore, treatment of p-αKO tumors with an anti-PD1 neutralizing antibody yielded comparable results, highlighting the potential applicability of this approach in PDAC treatment, especially when coupled with a PIK3CA inhibitor. Noteworthy outcomes ensued when interfering with the PD-L1/PD1 axis, resulting in T-cell-mediated elimination of p-αKO tumor cells. Single-cell sequencing substantiates these findings by confirming that blocking the PD-L1/PD1 interaction reactivates clonal anti-tumor T cells.</p><p>Recent investigations underscore the compelling potential of combination therapy involving both PI3K and PD1 inhibitors in cancer treatment. In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Isoyama et al., 2021</xref>, improved anti-tumor effects were observed in melanoma and fibrosarcoma models upon the combination of PI3K inhibitors with PD-1 blockade. This therapeutic strategy raised the levels of tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells thus led to enhanced anti-tumor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Isoyama et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2022</xref> conducted an in vivo expression screen with a pool of known oncogenes and identified PIK3CA as a factor promoting resistance to anti-PD1 treatment in a colon carcinoma model. Notably, the resistance to immunotherapy was successfully overturned with the administration of a PI3K inhibitor. These findings offer further support to the potential benefits of combining PI3K inhibitors with PD1 blockade for cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2022</xref>). To further validate the efficacy of this drug combination, future studies can explore its application using our orthotopic implantation model and in genetically modified mouse models that spontaneously develop PDAC. This approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of the therapeutic potential in a context that closely mirrors the intricacies of PDAC progression and the TME.</p><p>Although the administration of anti-PD1 neutralizing antibody yielded promising results, the treatment alone did not achieve 100% efficacy. Indeed, our scRNA-seq result from PD1-null mice revealed that not all exhausted T cells were reactivated, potentially explaining why some of the mice still succumb to tumor progression despite PD-L1-/PD1 blockade. In addition, to improve survival rates, it is crucial to incorporate other immunotherapies targeting additional checkpoint inhibitory receptors, such as CTLA4, LAG3, and TIGIT. While anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 are standard treatments for many solid tumors, TIGIT and LAG3 have emerged as promising new targets for cancer immunotherapy. LAG3, although demonstrating limited efficacy as a monotherapy, is frequently used in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gulhati et al., 2023</xref>). Similarly, while anti-TIGIT antibodies have shown remarkable effectiveness in treating solid tumors, the dual blockade of PD-1 and TIGIT has demonstrated superior clinical benefits in cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tedelind et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Høgh et al., 2020</xref>). Our IHC data notably revealed a significant upregulation of both TIGIT and LAG3 in p-αKO tumors, suggesting that the inclusion of additional immune checkpoint inhibitors, alongside PD1 inhibition, may further improve treatment outcomes. Therefore, future studies that evaluate blocking other immune checkpoints such as TIGIT, LAG3, CTLA4, or TIM3, in combination with anti-PD1, could provide valuable insights.</p><p>While our findings highlight the involvement of PCCB in regulating T-cell activities, the precise underlying mechanism remains unclear. Previous studies primarily focused on the role of <italic>Pccb</italic> in the genetic disease propionic acidemia, caused by mutations in <italic>Pccb</italic> or <italic>Pcca</italic> subunits, which impair PCC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wongkittichote et al., 2017</xref>). Dysfunctional PCC leads to the accumulation of propionyl-CoA and other byproducts such as propionylcarnitine (C3), methylcitrate (MC), and 3-hydroxypropionate (3OHPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kurczynski et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ando et al., 1972</xref>). Intracellular metabolite analysis by LC–MS showed elevated MC and C3 levels upon <italic>Pccb</italic> deletion, although the statistical significance was not reach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Importantly, intracellular propionyl-CoA levels were similar between αKO and p-αKO cells, potentially due to its conversion to MC and C3. However, the precision of propionyl-CoA detection remains challenging due to its limited quantity. Additional intracellular metabolites assessed through non-targeted LC–MS exhibited noteworthy alterations, suggesting their possible involvement in the regulation of PD1 expression on T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, further experiments are required to obtain a better understanding of how PCCB-regulated metabolic pathways affect T-cell function.</p><p>Various studies have highlighted the anti-inflammatory properties of propionate, a byproduct of dysfunctional PCC. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2013</xref> demonstrated that propionic acid regulates colonic Treg (cTreg) homeostasis in the gut lumen. Propionic acid supplementation in the drinking water of germ-free (GF) mice increased cTreg frequency and number in the gut lumen, while Tregs in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and thymus remained unaffected. Treatment of cTregs isolated from GF mice with propionate led to increased Foxp3 and IL10 expressions, both of which play important roles in Treg-mediated immune suppression. Additionally, cTregs exhibited a higher proliferation rate when co-cultured with propionate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). Another study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tedelind et al., 2007</xref> reported that propionate suppressed the secretion of TNFα and IL8 from neutrophils, inhibited the NF-κB pathway, and downregulated immune-related genes in a colon cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tedelind et al., 2007</xref>). Recently, Hogh et al. reported that propionate upregulated the surface expression of the immune stimulatory NKG2D ligands MHC-class-I-related family (MICA/B) on several cancer cells and activated T cells, mediated by mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Høgh et al., 2020</xref>). These indirect observations suggest a link between <italic>Pccb</italic> and immune responses although the published results are somewhat conflicting.</p><p>Additionally, cytokines and other mechanisms within the TME may contribute to the upregulation of PD1 expression on T cells in p-αKO tumors. RNA sequencing of αKO and p-αKO cells revealed substantial changes in several cytokine-related signaling pathways, indicating potential cytokine involvement in regulating PD1 expression on T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, comparing cells grown in vitro to tumor growth in vivo poses challenges due to the complex TME and potential crosstalk between immune cells and the metabolic system. Future studies should conduct single-cell RNAseq analysis of in vivo tumor cells present within the TME to uncover the mechanisms of immune evasion upon deletion of <italic>Pccb</italic>.</p><p>Our study is the first to report an association between PCCB and PIK3CA. We utilized PIK3CA knockout cells (αKO) instead of conventional PIK3CA inhibitors to avoid off-target effects reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gharbi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kong and Yamori, 2008</xref>), providing a more specific and accurate assessment of PIK3CA’s role in regulating immune responses in PDAC. We employed an orthotopic mouse model for our CRISPR screen, which more closely mimics the TME of human PDAC. Our genome-wide screen study identified PCCB as a key regulator of anti-tumor T-cell activity. We showed that PCCB regulates immune evasion by promoting increased PD-L1 expression in anti-tumor cytotoxic T cells. Consequently, our findings suggest that the resistance of PDAC to PI3K inhibitors and checkpoint inhibitors could potentially be surmounted by deploying both drugs in combination. This may be a promising avenue for future pre-clinical and clinical studies to directly assess if combining these FDA-approved drugs, possibly in conjunction with other treatment modalities, will improve outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>KPC, αKO, and p-αKO were all cultured in complete DMEM media (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10% FBS (Corning 35-015-CV) and 1% P/S (penicillin/streptomycin: Gibco 15140-122), incubated at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

This work represents an extension of the authors' prior observation that PI3Ka deletion in an orthotopic KPC pancreatic tumor model confers susceptibility to immune-mediated elimination. The authors' major claims in the present manuscript are as follows:</p><p>(1) PI3Ka (Pik3ca) knockout in KPC pancreatic tumor cells induces clonal T cell expansion.</p><p>(2) Genome-wide LOF screen in aKPC cells to identify tumor-intrinsic determinants of PI3Ka-KO-enhanced T cell response identified Pccb.</p><p>(3) When Pccb is knocked out in the context of Pi3ka knockout KPC, anti-tumor T cell response is reduced as measured by</p><p>a. Increased tumor progression</p><p>b. Decreased survival</p><p>c. T cells are still clonally expanded but less functional</p><p>(4) ICB is able to &quot;reactivate&quot; clonally expanded T cells.</p><p>(5) Conclusion: Pccb modulates the activity of T cells in PDAC.</p><p>Overall, the experiments were appropriately executed and technically sound, albeit underpowered for single-cell analyses. Upon careful consideration of the data, the biggest weakness of the paper is the authors' interpretations of results, particularly for claims 1 and 4 (see below for details). Much of the data is correlative and does not delve into causation, leaving this reviewer wishing for experiments that would clearly demonstrate that Pccb in tumor cells directly impacts T cell anti-tumor activity.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) Tumor intrinsic determinants of intratumoral T cell infiltration in PDAC are less commonly evaluated as combination therapies for ICB. This is a point of conceptual innovation and importance.</p><p>(2) A sensitized CRISPR screen to identify mutations that rescue KPC/PI3Ka-KO tumors from immune-mediated killing is an elegant method to better understand the molecular mechanisms contributing to KPC immunosurveillance. Further, one screen candidate (Pccb) was experimentally validated.</p><p>(3) Single-cell clonotype analyses hold promise for identifying tumor-reactive T cells (though authors never demonstrated that specific clones were tumor antigen specific).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) &quot;Clonal expansion of cytotoxic T cells infiltrating the pancreatic αKO tumors&quot;</p><p>a. Only two tumor-bearing hosts were evaluated by single-cell TCR sequencing, thus limiting conclusions that may be drawn regarding repertoire diversity and expansion.</p><p>b. High abundance clones in the TME do not necessarily have tumor specificity, nor are they necessarily clonally expanded. They may be clones which are tissue-resident or highly chemokine-responsive and accumulate in larger numbers independent of clonal expansion. Please consider softening language to clonal enrichment or refer to clone size as clonal abundance throughout the paper.</p><p>c. The whole story would be greatly strengthened by cytotoxicity assays of abundant TCR clones to show tumor antigen specificity.</p><p>(2) &quot;A genome-wide CRISPR gene-deletion screen to identify molecules contributing to Pik3ca-mediated pancreatic tumor immune evasion&quot;</p><p>a. CRISPR mutagenesis yielded outgrowth of only 2/8 tumors. A more complete screen with an increased total number of tumors would yield much stronger gene candidates with better statistical power. It is unsurprising that candidates were observed in only one of the two tumors. Nevertheless, the authors moved forward successfully with Pccb.</p><p>(3) T cells infiltrate p-αKO tumors with increased expression of immune checkpoints</p><p>a. In Figure 4D, cell counts are not normalized to totalCD8+ T cell counts making it difficult to directly compare aKO to p-aKO tumors. Based on quantifications from Figure 4D, I suspect normalization will strengthen the conclusion that CD8+ infiltrate is more exhausted in p-aKO tumors.</p><p>b. Flow cytometric analysis to further characterize the myeloid compartment is incomplete (single replicate) and does not strengthen the argument that p-aKO TME is more immunosuppressive.</p><p>c. It could, however, strengthen the argument that TIL has less anti-tumor potential if effector molecule expression in CD8+ infiltrating cells were quantified.</p><p>(4) Inhibition of PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint leads to elimination of most p-αKO tumors</p><p>a. It is reasonable to conclude that p-aKO tumors are responsive to immune checkpoint blockade. However, there is no data presented to support the statement that checkpoint blockade reactivates an existing anti-tumor CD8+ T cell response and does not instead induce a de novo response.</p><p>b. The discussion of these data implies that anti-PD-1 would not improve aKO tumor control, but these data are not included. As such, it is difficult to compare the therapeutic response in aKO versus p-aKO. Further, these data are at best an indirect comparison of the T cell responsiveness against tumor, as the only direct comparison is infiltrating cell count in Figure 4 and there are no public TCR clones with confirmed anti-tumor specificity to follow in the aKO versus p-aKO response.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96925.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is generally considered a &quot;cold&quot; tumor type with little T cell infiltration. This group demonstrated previously that deletion of the PIK3CA isoform of PI3K in the orthotopic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma KPC mouse tumor model led to the elimination of tumors by T cells. Here they performed a genome-wide gene-deletion screen in this tumor using CRISPR to determine what was required for this T cell-mediated infiltration and tumor rejection. Deletion of Pccb in the tumors, which encodes propionyl-CoA carboxylase subunit B, allowed for the outgrowth of the PIK3CA-deleted KPC tumors. This was confirmed with the specific deletion of Pccb in the tumor cells. Demonstrating a likely role in tumor progression in human patients as well, high expression of PCCB in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma correlated with lower patient survival. T cells still infiltrated these tumors, but had much higher expression of exhaustion markers. Blockade of PD-1 signaling allowed for the rejection of these tumors. While these are intriguing data demonstrating that loss of PCCB by pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a mechanism to escape T cell immunity, the mechanism by which this occurs is not determined. In addition, there are a few issues that suggest the conclusions of the manuscript should be tempered.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>In vivo analysis of tumor CRISPR deletion screen.</p><p>The study describes a possible novel mechanism by which a tumor maintains a &quot;cold&quot; microenvironment.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) A major issue is that it seems these data are based on the use of a single tumor cell clone with PIK3CA deleted. Therefore, there could be other changes in this clone in addition to the deletion of PIK3CA that could contribute to the phenotype.</p><p>(2) The conclusion that the change in the PCCB-deficient tumor cell line is unrelated to mitochondrial metabolic changes may be incorrect based on the data provided. While it is true that in the experiments performed, there was no statistically significant change in the oxygen consumption rate or metabolite levels, this could be due to experimental error. There is a trend in the OCR being higher in the PCCB-deficient cells, although due to a high standard deviation, the change is not statistically significant. There is also a trend for there being more aKG in this cell line, but because there were only 3 samples per cell line, there is no statistically significant difference.</p><p>(3) More data are required to make the authors' conclusion that there are myeloid changes in the PCCB-deficient tumor cells. There is only flow data from shown from one tumor of each type.</p><p>(4) The previous published study demonstrated increased MHC and CD80 expression in the PIK3CA-deficient tumors and these differences were suggested to be the reason the tumors were rejected. However, no data concerning the levels of these proteins were provided in the current manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96925.2.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Han and co-authors showed that implantation of Pik3ca deficient KPC cells (aKO) induced clonal expansion of CD8 T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Using aKO cells, they conducted an in vivo genome-wide gene-deletion screen, which showed that deletion of propionyl-CoA carboxylase subunit B gene (Pccb) in αKO cells (p-aKO) leads to immune evasion and tumor progression. Eventually, mice injected with p-aKO but not aKO succumbed to their tumors. Similar to the parental aKO cell line, p-aKO tumors were still infiltrated with clonally expanded CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, as shown by the IHC. Further analyses showed that T cells infiltrating p-aKO tumors expressed high levels of exhaustion markers (PD-1, CTLA-4, TIM3, and TIGIT). Furthermore, PD-1 signaling blockade using PD-1 mAb or genetic depletion of PD-1 reactivated the infiltrated T cells, controlling tumor progression and improving the overall mice survival. Thus, the authors concluded in the abstract that &quot;Pccb can modulate the activity of cytotoxic T cells infiltrating some pancreatic cancers.&quot; Although the data clearly showed that the loss of Pccb facilitated the immune evasion of pancreatic cancer cells, there is no clear evidence provided that Pccb deletion can actually modulate the activity of CD8 T cells.

Although we acknowledge the relatively limited scope of our CRISPR-based gene-deletion screen, we successfully demonstrated the immunogenic role of Pccb in our syngenetic pancreatic cancer mouse model. Specifically, loss of PCCB in our mutant KRAS/p53 PIK3CA-null (αKO) cells blocked host T cell killing of tumor cells.</p><p>Furthermore, blocking the PD1/PD-L1 interaction reverses this anti-tumor immunogenic effect. We agree with the reviewers regarding the limitations of our study, such as the sample size in our scTCR sequencing and the lack of direct cytotoxicity assays to confirm tumor-specific T cell clones. However, our results are consistent across multiple experimental approaches that strongly suggest meaningful differences in host T cell response to the three implanted tumor types, KPC, αKO and p-αKO. We agree that future mechanistic studies will be important to determine how PCCB is involved in this immunogenic response. We also agree with the reviewers that future additional studies with other KPC cell lines will strength our conclusion regarding PCCB. Finally, we acknowledge the inherent limitations of IHC techniques to assess the involvement of other T cell checkpoints that might also be involved in this anti-tumor immunogenic effect. In summary, despite these limitations, our findings provide novel insight into the role of PCCB in pancreatic tumor immunogenicity and contribute to the ongoing discussion of how to improve therapeutic strategies for this deadly cancer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1:</bold></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Clonal expansion of cytotoxic T cells infiltrating the pancreatic αKO tumors</p><p>a. Only two tumor-bearing hosts were evaluated by single-cell TCR sequencing, thus limiting conclusions that may be drawn regarding repertoire diversity and expansion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that possible repertoire diversity and expansion could be observed by sequencing more tumor-bearing hosts. However, our current data reveal a marked consistency in the transcriptional expression within the two tumors analyzed per group. Importantly, these features are significantly divergent between the αKO and p-αKO groups. While recognizing the limited sample size, the observed within-group consistency and the clear distinction between groups strongly support the validity of the reported trends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. High abundance clones in the TME do not necessarily have tumor specificity, nor are they necessarily clonally expanded. They may be clones which are tissue-resident or highly chemokine-responsive and accumulate in larger numbers independent of clonal expansion. Please consider softening language to clonal enrichment or refer to clone size as clonal abundance throughout the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it’s possible that the high abundance clones are not necessarily tumor specific. Our previous work (N. Sivaram 2019) demonstrated the critical role of increased pancreatic CD8+ T cells in αKO tumor regression within B6 mice. Therefore, antigen specific CD8+ T cell clonal expansion within the pancreas is an anticipated observation. However, as the reviewer pointed out, a portion of this expansion may be attributable to factors independent of tumor antigens. While the low T cell infiltration observed in KPC-implanted mice argues against a purely tissue-resident explanation, further investigation is required to definitively establish the tumor specificity of individual clones. We have revised the manuscript to reflect this nuance, replacing &quot;clonal expansion&quot; with &quot;clonal enrichment&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. The whole story would be greatly strengthened by cytotoxicity assays of abundant TCR clones to show tumor antigen specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we agree with the reviewer that future studies are needed to investigate each of the specific clones. Due to the extended timeframe required, it’s beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) A genome-wide CRISPR gene-deletion screen to identify molecules contributing to Pik3camediated pancreatic tumor immune evasion&quot;</p><p>a. CRISPR mutagenesis yielded outgrowth of only 2/8 tumors. A more complete screen with an increased total number of tumors would yield much stronger gene candidates with better statistical power. It is unsurprising that candidates were observed in only one of the two tumors. Nevertheless, the authors moved forward successfully with Pccb.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that by including more mice in the CRISPR screen, it’s possible that we could have identified more candidates. Regardless, we have successfully demonstrated PCCB’s role in pancreatic tumorgenicity with our mouse model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) T cells infiltrate p-αKO tumors with increased expression of immune checkpoint</p></disp-quote><p>*a. In Figure 4D, cell counts are not normalized to totalCD8+ T cell counts making it difficult to directly compare aKO to p-aKO tumors. Based on quantifications from Figure 4D, I suspect normalization will strengthen the conclusion that CD8+ infiltrate is more exhausted in p-aKO tumors. *</p><p>Due to the use of distinct tumor sections for quantifying CD8+ cells and T cell checkpoint inhibitory receptor expression, direct normalization of these counts is challenging. However, we observed comparable CD8+ cell numbers between αKO and p-αKO tumors, with p-αKO tumors exhibiting nearly double the expression of immune checkpoint receptors. Therefore, even accounting for potential normalization discrepancies, we anticipate that p-αKO tumors would still demonstrate a significantly higher percentage of immune checkpoint receptorpositive cells compared to αKO tumors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Flow cytometric analysis to further characterize the myeloid compartment is incomplete (single replicate) and does not strengthen the argument that p-aKO TME is more immunosuppressive. It could, however, strengthen the argument that TIL has less anti-tumor potential if effector molecule expression in CD8+ infiltrating cells were quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that including more tumor samples will strengthen the argument that p-αKO TME is more immunosuppressive. Future studies need to be done to characterize CD8+ T cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Inhibition of PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint leads to elimination of most p-αKO tumors</p><p>a. It is reasonable to conclude that p-aKO tumors are responsive to immune checkpoint blockade. However, there is no data presented to support the statement that checkpoint blockade reactivates an existing anti-tumor CD8+ T cell response and does not induce a de novo response</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that future studies exploring the clonotypes of T cells infiltrating tumors in PD-1treated mice are necessary to determine whether observed T cell response represents reactivation of existing clones, a de novo response, or a combination of both.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The discussion of these data implies that anti-PD-1 would not improve aKO tumor control, but these data are not included. As such, it is difficult to compare the therapeutic response in aKO versus p-aKO. Further, these data are at best an indirect comparison of the T cell responsiveness against tumor, as the only direct comparison is infiltrating cell count in Figure 4 and there are no public TCR clones with confirmed anti-tumor specificity to follow in the aKO versus p-aKO response.</p></disp-quote><p>Since αKO tumors completely regress with 100% animal survival, we deemed anti-PD1 treatment in this group unnecessary. While we did assess anti-PD1 treatment in KPCimplanted mice, no survival benefit was observed (data not shown). The p-αKO tumor model was the only one in which anti-PD1 treatment improved survival. The complexity of the in vivo tumor microenvironment likely contributes to the lack of shared TCR clones between αKO and p-αKO tumors, even within the same tumor group. Future studies aimed at identifying tumorspecific clones may involve transferring in vivo models to in vitro assays or the generation of novel mouse strains expressing identified TCRs. However, these approaches require substantial time and resources and are beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) A major issue is that it seems these data are based on the use of a single tumor cell clone with PIK3CA deleted. Therefore, there could be other changes in this clone in addition to the deletion of PIK3CA that could contribute to the phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously tested a different KPC cell line (DT10022) with genetically downregulated PIK3CA and found mice implanted with αKO cells also showed tumor regression. However, we have not tested if deletion of Pccb in the DT10022-aKO cell line will have the same effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The conclusion that the change in the PCCB-deficient tumor cell line is unrelated to mitochondrial metabolic changes may be incorrect based on the data provided. While it is true that in the experiments performed, there was no statistically significant change in the oxygen consumption rate or metabolite levels, this could be due to experimental error. There is a trend in the OCR being higher in the PCCB-deficient cells, although due to a high standard deviation, the change is not statistically significant. There is also a trend for there being more aKG in this cell line, but because there were only 3 samples per cell line, there is no statistically significant difference.</p></disp-quote><p>Although PCCB is known to cause metabolic changes, in the context of this study, we are comparing PCCB-deficient to PCCB &amp; PIK3CA double-deficient cells. We did not address if PCCB loss alone would cause metabolic alteration. We suspect that is the case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) More data are required to make the authors' conclusion that there are myeloid changes in the PCCB-deficient tumor cells. There is only flow data from shown from one tumor of each type.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that including more tumor samples will strengthen the argument that p-αKO TME is more immunosuppressive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The previous published study demonstrated increased MHC and CD80 expression in the PIK3CA-deficient tumors and these differences were suggested to be the reason the tumors were rejected. However, no data concerning the levels of these proteins were provided in the current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Our previous hypothesis for altered MHC and CD80 levels is based on the observation that there is a dramatic increase in the number of infiltrating T cells upon Pik3ca deletion. In this study, similar levels of infiltrating T cells were observed when Pccb was deleted in αKO cells, therefore we do not expect any changes in MHC and CD80 levels since these tumors appears to be still recognized by the T cells. Indeed, we are able detect clonal enrichment in p-αKO tumors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 3:</bold></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The IHC technique that was used to stain and characterize the exhaustion status of the tumorinfiltrating T cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that incorporating multi-color IHC or flow cytometry to characterize the exhaustion status of specific T cell subtypes would provide more comprehensive information.
