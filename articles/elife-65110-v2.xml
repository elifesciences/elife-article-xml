Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) is a key cytokine in protective immunity that induces major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (MHCII) to amplify CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation and effector function. Despite its central role, the dynamic regulation of IFNγ-induced MHCII is not well understood. Using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen in murine macrophages, we identified genes that control MHCII surface expression. Mechanistic studies uncovered two parallel pathways of IFNγ-mediated MHCII control that require the multifunctional glycogen synthase kinase three beta (GSK3β) or the mediator complex subunit 16 (MED16). Both pathways control distinct aspects of the IFNγ response and are necessary for IFNγ-mediated induction of the MHCII transactivator <italic>Ciita</italic>, MHCII expression, and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation. Our results define previously unappreciated regulation of MHCII expression that is required to control CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>IFN-gamma</kwd><kwd>MHCII expression</kwd><kwd>CD4+ T cell activation</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI146504</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olive</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000199</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIFA HATCH 1019371</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olive</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI132130</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kiritsy</surname><given-names>Michael C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Med16 and GSK3b regulate interferon gamma-mediated MHCII expression in macrophages and are required for CD4+ T cell activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Activation of the host response to infection requires the coordinated interaction between antigen presenting cells (APCs) and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Elsland and Neefjes, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tubo and Jenkins, 2014</xref>). For CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, the binding of the T cell receptor (TCR) to the peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) on the surface of APCs is necessary for both CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation and their continued effector function in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tubo and Jenkins, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeSandro et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reith et al., 2005</xref>). Dysregulation of MHCII control leads to a variety of conditions including the development of autoimmunity and increased susceptibility to pathogens and cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koyama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahimi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thelemann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steimle et al., 1993</xref>). While MHCII is constitutively expressed on dendritic cells and B cells, the production of the cytokine IFNγ promotes MHCII expression broadly in other cellular populations including macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jakubzick et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Unanue et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neefjes et al., 2011</xref>). The induction of MHCII in these tissues activates a feedforward loop wherein IFNγ-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells induce myeloid MHCII expression, which in turn amplifies CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neefjes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buxadé et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ivashkiv, 2018</xref>). Thus, IFNγ-mediated MHCII expression is essential for protective immunity.</p><p>The IFNγ-dependent control of MHCII is complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Unanue et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wijdeven et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herrero et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ting and Trowsdale, 2002</xref>). Binding of IFNγ to its receptor induces cytoskeletal and membrane rearrangement that results in the activation of JAK1 and JAK2 and STAT1-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bousoik and Montazeri Aliabadi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu and Ivashkiv, 2009</xref>).

The activation of CIITA opens the chromatin environment surrounding the MHCII locus and recruits transcription factors, including CREB1 and RFX5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beresford and Boss, 2001</xref>). MHCII is also regulated post-translationally to control the trafficking, peptide loading, and stability of MHCII on the surface of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paul et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alix et al., 2020</xref>). While recent evidence points to additional regulatory mechanisms of IFNγ-mediated MHCII expression, including the response to oxidative stress, these have not been investigated directly in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wijdeven et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In non-inflammatory conditions, macrophages express low levels of MHCII that is uniquely dependent on NFAT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buxadé et al., 2018</xref>). While basal MHCII expression on macrophages plays a role in graft rejection, it is insufficient to control intracellular bacterial pathogens, which require IFNγ-activation to propagate protective CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ankley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grau et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Underhill et al., 1999</xref>). Many pathogens including <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> inhibit IFNγ-mediated MHCII induction to evade CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated control and drive pathogen persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pennini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhong et al., 1999</xref>). Overcoming these pathogen immune evasion tactics is essential to develop new treatments or immunization strategies that provide long-term protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ankley et al., 2020</xref>). Without a full understanding of the global mechanisms controlling IFNγ-mediated MHCII regulation in macrophages, it has proven difficult to dissect the mechanisms related to MHCII expression that cause disease or lead to infection susceptibility.</p><p>Here, we globally defined the regulatory networks that control IFNγ-mediated MHCII surface expression on macrophages. Using CRISPR-Cas9 to perform a forward genetic screen, we identified the major components of the IFNγ-regulatory pathway in addition to many genes with no previously known role in MHCII regulation. Follow-up studies identified two critical regulators of IFNγ-dependent <italic>Ciita</italic> expression in macrophages, MED16 and GSK3β. Loss of either MED16 or GSK3β resulted in significantly reduced MHCII expression on macrophages, unique changes in the IFNγ-transcriptional landscape, and prevented the effective activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. These results show that IFNγ-mediated MHCII expression in macrophages is finely tuned through parallel regulatory networks that interact to drive efficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optimization of CRISPR-Cas9 editing in macrophages to identify regulators of IFNγ-inducible MHCII</title><p>To better understand the regulation of IFNγ-inducible MHCII, we optimized gene-editing in immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDMs) from C57BL/6 J mice. iBMDMs were transduced with Cas9-expessing lentivirus and Cas9-mediated editing was evaluated by targeting the surface protein CD11b with two distinct single guide RNAs (sgRNA). When we compared CD11b surface expression to a non-targeting control (NTC) sgRNA by flow cytometry, we observed less than 50 % of cells targeted with either of the <italic>Cd11b</italic> sgRNA were successfully edited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We hypothesized that the polyclonal Cas9-iBMDM cells variably expressed Cas9 leading to inefficient editing. To address this, we isolated a clonal population of Cas9-iBMDMs using limiting dilution plating. Using the same <italic>Cd11b</italic> sgRNAs in a clonal population (clone L3) we found 85–99% of cells were deficient in CD11b expression by flow cytometry compared to NTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Successful editing was verified by genotyping the <italic>Cd11b</italic> locus for indels at the sgRNA targeting sequence using Tracking of Indels by Decomposition (TIDE) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brinkman et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, clone L3 Cas9<sup>+</sup> iBMDMs proved to be a robust tool for gene editing in murine macrophages.</p><p>To test the suitability of these cells to dissect IFNγ-mediated MHCII induction, we next targeted <italic>Rfx5</italic>, a known regulator of MHCII expression, with two independent sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steimle et al., 1995</xref>). Since L3 macrophages do not express IFNγ, we stimulated <italic>Rfx5 t</italic>argeted and NTC cells with IFNγ for 18 hours and quantified the surface expression of MHCII by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). In cells expressing the non-targeting sgRNA, IFNγ stimulation resulted in a 20-fold increase in MHCII. In contrast, cells transduced with either of two independent sgRNAs targeting <italic>Rfx5</italic> failed to induce the surface expression of MHCII following IFNγ stimulation. We further tested other activators that might impact MHCII expression in L3 cells. L3 cells were stimulated with IFNγ, LPS, Pam3CSK4, IFN-β, TNF and N-glycolylated muramyldipeptide (NG-MDP) and 24 hours later the surface expression of MHCII and PD-L1 was quantified. While each stimuli increased PD-L1 expression, only IFNγ significantly altered the expression of MHCII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref> ). Thus, MHCII expression in macrophages is tightly controlled by IFNγ-dependent mechanisms and L3 cells can be effectively used to interrogate IFNγ-mediated MHCII expression in macrophages.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genome-wide CRISPR Cas9 screen identifies regulators of IFNγ-dependent MHCII expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cas9+ iBMDMs (Clone L3) expressing the indicated sgRNAs were left untreated or treated with IFNγ (6.25 ng/ml) for 24 hours.

After verifying coverage and minimal skew in the initial library, we conducted a forward genetic screen to identify regulators of IFNγ-dependent MHCII expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The loss-of-function library was stimulated with IFNγ and 24 hours later, we selected MHCII<sup>high</sup> and MHCII<sup>low</sup> expressing cells by fluorescence activated cells sorting (FACS). Following genomic DNA extraction, sgRNA abundances for each sorted bin were determined by deep sequencing.</p><p>As our knockout library relied on the formation of Cas9-induced indels and was exclusive to protein-coding genes, we focused our analysis on genes expressed in macrophages under the conditions of interest, which we determined empirically in the isogenic cell line by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). We assumed that sgRNAs targeting non-transcribed genes are neutral in their effect on IFNγ-induced MHCII expression, which afforded us ~32,000 internal negative control sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hart et al., 2014</xref>). To test for statistical enrichment of sgRNAs and genes, we used the modified robust rank algorithm (α-RRA) employed by Model-based Analysis of Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 Knockout (MAGeCK), which first ranks sgRNAs by effect and then filters low ranking sgRNAs to improve gene significance testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2014</xref>). We tuned the sgRNA threshold parameter to optimize the number of significant hits without compromising the calculated q-values of known positive controls that are expected to be required for IFNγ-mediated MHCII expression. Further, by removing irrelevant sgRNAs that targeted genes not transcribed in our conditions, we removed potential false positives and improved the positive predictive value of the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> and S2B).</p><p>Guide-level analysis confirmed the ability to detect positive control sgRNAs which had robust enrichment in the MHCII<sup>low</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Using the previously determined parameters, we tested for significantly enriched genes that regulated MHCII surface levels. As expected, sgRNAs targeting known components of the IFNγ-receptor signal transduction pathway, such as <italic>Ifngr1</italic>, <italic>Ifngr2</italic>, <italic>Jak1</italic> and <italic>Stat1</italic>, as well as regulators and components of IFNγ−mediated MHCII expression, such as <italic>Ciita</italic>, <italic>Rfx5</italic>, and <italic>Rfxank</italic> were all significantly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schroder et al., 2004</xref>). These results validated our approach to identify functional regulators of IFNγ-mediated MHCII expression.</p><p>Stringent analysis revealed a significant enrichment of genes with no known involvement in interferon responses and antigen presentation. To identify functional pathways that are associated with these genes, we performed KEGG pathway analysis on the positive regulators of IFNγ-induced MHCII that met the FDR cutoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kanehisa and Goto, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kanehisa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kanehisa, 2019</xref>). However, gene membership for the 10 most enriched KEGG pathways was largely dominated by known regulators of IFNγ signaling. To circumvent this redundancy and identify novel pathways enriched from our candidate gene list, the gene list was truncated to remove the 11 known IFNγ signaling regulators. Upon reanalysis, several novel pathways emerged, including mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Thus, our genetic screen uncovered previously undescribed pathways that are critical to control IFNγ-mediated MHCII surface expression in macrophages.</p><p>The results of the genome-wide CRISPR screen highlight the sensitivity and specificity of our approach and analysis pipeline. To gain new insights into IFNγ-mediated MHCII regulation, we next validated a subset of candidates that were not previously associated with the IFNγ-signaling pathway. Using two independent sgRNAs for each of 15 candidate genes, we generated loss-of-function macrophages in the L3 clone. MHCII surface expression was quantified by flow cytometry for each cell line in the presence and absence of IFNγ activation. For all 15 candidates, we observed no changes in basal MHCII expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>) but found deficient MHCII induction following IFNγ stimulation with at least one sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>). For 9 of 15 candidate genes, we observed a significant reduction in MHCII surface expression with both gene-specific sgRNAs These results show that our screen not only identified known regulators of IFNγ-mediated MHCII induction, but also uncovered new regulatory networks required for MHCII expression on macrophages.</p><p>We were interested in better understanding the IFNγ-mediated transcriptional activation of MHCII to determine if a subset of candidates reveal new regulatory mechanisms of MHCII-expression.

Our validation results confirmed that MED16 was indeed an essential positive regulator of MHCII expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). MED16 was the sixth ranked candidate from our screen results, with robust enrichment of all four sgRNAs in the MHCII<sup>low</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As part of the mediator complex, MED16 bridges the transcription factor binding and the chromatin remodeling that are required for transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conaway and Conaway, 2011</xref>). These changes then recruit and activate RNA polymerase II to initiate transcription. While the core mediator complex function is required for many RNA polymerase II dependent transcripts, distinct sub-units of the mediator complex can also play unique roles in gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poss et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conaway and Conaway, 2011</xref>).

In contrast, targeting <italic>Gsk3a</italic> in <italic>Gsk3b</italic> KO macrophages (i.e. double knockout) led to a further reduction of MHCII surface expression, similar to what was observed with CHIR99021 treatment. This same trend was observed when we examined <italic>Ciita</italic> mRNA expression after IFNγ-activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

As observed before, the MHCII induction was dependent on IFNγ as blocking the IFNγR with antibodies or co-culturing with IFNγ-/- NK cells resulted in no change in MHCII expression compared to no co-culture controls. Therefore, both GSK3β and GSK3α have important regulatory functions that control IFNγ-mediated MHCII expression.</p><p>We next examined possible mechanisms by which GSK3α controls MHCII expression only in the absence of GSK3β.

We hypothesized that GSK3α/β inhibition with CHIR99021 would block MHCII expression only if the inhibitor was present shortly after IFNγ stimulation. To test this hypothesis, iBMDMs were stimulated with IFNγ then treated with DMSO for the length of the experiment or with CHIR99021, 2, 6, 12, and 18 hours post-stimulation. When MHCII was quantified by flow cytometry we saw a reduction in MHCII expression when CHIR99021 was added 2 or 6 hours after IFNγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). CHIR99021 addition at later time points resulted in similar MHCII expression compared to DMSO treated cells. When the expression of <italic>H2aa</italic> mRNA was quantified from a parallel experiment, a significant reduction in mRNA expression was only observed in macrophages that were treated with CHIR99021 2 hours following IFNγ-activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Thus, GSK3α/β activity is required early after IFNγ stimulation to activate the transcription of MHCII. We repeated this experiment in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages from HoxB8 conditionally immortalized progenitor cells and observed comparable results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2006</xref>).

Given this inconsistency and the previously described role of mTORC1 modulating GSK3 activity, we next examined how mTORC1 contributes to IFNγ-mediated MHCII expression. As a first step, we tested how the inhibition of mTORC1 impacts IFNγ responses in murine macrophages. NTC macrophages were treated with and without the mTORC1 inhibitor Torin2 then were left untreated or were stimulated with IFNγ. The surface expression of MHCII was then quantified by flow cytometry. While Torin2 alone had no effect on MHCII expression, blocking mTORC1 resulted in a significant reduction in surface MHCII following IFNγ activation, consistent with our screen analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To determine the specificity of mTORC1 inhibition on other IFNγ responses we also examined the induction of the immunoinhibitory molecule programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In contrast to MHCII, blockade of mTORC1 resulted in a significant increase in IFNγ-dependent PD-L1 expression compared to vehicle controls.

However, the extent to which MED16 or GSK3β controlled the overall response of macrophages to IFNγ remained unclear. To directly assess how MED16 and GSK3β regulate the general response to IFNγ, we queried IFNγ-regulated genes from our dataset that are annotated as part of the cellular response to IFNγ stimulation (GeneOntology:0071346). Hierarchical clustering found that, of the 20 most induced IFNγ-regulated transcripts, the expression of eight were unaffected by loss of either <italic>Gsk3b</italic> and <italic>Med16</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, Cluster 2). Importantly, these genes included a major regulator of the IFNγ response, <italic>Irf1</italic>, as well as canonical STAT1-target genes (<italic>Gbp2, Gbp3, Gbp5, Gbp6 and Gbp7</italic>). This suggests that neither GSK3β nor MED16 are global regulators of the IFNγ response in macrophages, but rather are likely to exert their effect on particular genes at the level of transcription or further downstream. In contrast, only two genes, out of the top 20 IFNγ-regulated genes, were similarly reduced in both <italic>Med16</italic> KO and <italic>Gsk3b</italic> KO cells (Cluster 4), one of which was <italic>H2ab1</italic>. This shows that while GSK3β and MED16 both regulate IFNγ-mediated MHCII expression, they otherwise control distinct aspects of the IFNγ-mediated response in macrophages. The remaining clusters from this analysis showed specific changes in either <italic>Med16</italic> KO or <italic>Gsk3b</italic> KO cells. Clusters 1 and 3 showed a subset of genes that were more robustly induced in <italic>Gsk3b</italic> KO cells compared to NTC and <italic>Med16</italic> KO cells. These genes included <italic>Nos2, Il12rb1</italic> and chemokines <italic>Ccl2</italic>, <italic>Ccl3, Ccl4,</italic> and <italic>Ccl7</italic>. In contrast, Cluster five showed a subset of genes that were reduced only in macrophages lacking MED16, including <italic>Irf8</italic> and <italic>Stat1</italic>; as these effects were modest, and did not reach statistical significance, they may be suggestive of an incomplete positive feedforward in which MED16 plays a role. Further stringent differential gene expression analysis (FDR &lt; 0.05, absolute LFC &gt; 1) of the IFNγ-stimulated transcriptomes identified 69 and 90 significantly different genes for MED16 and GSK3β respectively. Of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), eight non-MHCII genes were shared between MED16 and GSK3β, including five genes that are involved in controlling the extracellular matrix (<italic>Mmmp8, Mmp12, Tnn, and Clec12a</italic>). Taken together these results suggest that while MED16 and GSK3β both regulate IFNγ-mediated <italic>Ciita</italic> and MHCII expression in macrophages, they otherwise control distinct regulatory networks in response to IFNγ.</p><p>We next used the transcriptional dataset to understand what aspects of IFNγ-mediated signaling MED16 and GSK3β specifically control. To resolve the transcriptional landscape of <italic>Med16</italic> KO macrophages and to understand the specific effect that MED16 loss has on the host response to IFNγ, we analyzed the DEGs for upstream regulators whose effects would explain the observed gene expression signature. The analysis correctly predicted a relative inhibition on IFNγ signaling compared to NTC due to the muted induction of <italic>Ciita, H2-Ab1</italic> and <italic>Cd74</italic>. This analysis also identified signatures of <italic>Il10, Stat3</italic>, and <italic>Pparγ</italic> activation that included <italic>Socs3</italic> induction and <italic>Ptgs2</italic> downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref> and S5B). As the DEG analysis relied on a stringent threshold that filtered the great majority of the transcriptome from analysis, we sought to incorporate a more comprehensive analysis capable of capturing genes with more modest effects based on pathway enrichment. To this end, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using a ranked gene list derived from the differential gene expression analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). Of the ~10,000 gene sets tested, 11 sets were enriched for NTC+ IFNγ and 76 for MED16+ IFNγ (FDR &lt; 0.1). To reduce pathway redundancy and infer biological relevance from the gene sets, we consolidated the signal into pathway networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and observed a significant enrichment for genes involved in xenobiotic and steroid metabolism, including many cytochrome p450 family members and glutathione transferases. We also observed an elevated type I interferon transcriptional response in <italic>Med16</italic> KO cells stimulated with IFNγ that included components of IFNα/β signal transduction (<italic>Ifnar2</italic>), transcription factors (<italic>Stat2, Irf7</italic>) and antiviral mediators (<italic>Oas2, Ifitm1, Ifitm2, Ifitm3, Ifitm6</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>). Type I IFN production is described to have varying effects on MHCII expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jayarapu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kurche et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Simmons et al., 2012</xref>). While some studies indicate type I IFN can enhance MHCII in DCs, other studies in distinct cell types suggest type I IFN blunts IFNγ-mediated MHCII expression. We reasoned that if increased type I IFN in <italic>Med16</italic> KO cells was blocking MHCII expression the type I IFN would also inhibit MHCII expression in wild type cells in <italic>trans</italic>. To test the hypothesis that <italic>Med16</italic> KO cells produce elevated type I IFN that blocks IFNγ-mediated MHCII induction we conducted a co-culture experiment. <italic>Med16</italic> KO and GFP expressing NTC macrophages were mixed equally, and the following day stimulated with IFNγ.

While <italic>Med16</italic> KO cells were unable to robustly induce MHCII, NTC cells from the same well induced MHCII over 30-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).

In addition to known regulators, our analysis identified many new positive regulators of MHCII surface expression. While we validated only a subset of these candidates, the high rate of validation suggests many new regulatory mechanisms of IFNγ-inducible MHCII expression in macrophages.

Figure created using Biorender.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65110-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>MED16 is a subunit of the mediator complex that is critical to recruit RNA polymerase II to the transcriptional start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poss et al., 2013</xref>). While the mediator complex can contain over 20 unique subunits and globally regulate gene expression, individual mediator subunits control distinct transcriptional networks by interacting with specific transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poss et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conaway and Conaway, 2011</xref>). Our data shows that MED16 is uniquely required among the mediator complex for IFNγ-mediated MHCII expression. While we observed a strong reduction in <italic>Ciita</italic> expression in the absence of Med16, some <italic>Ciita</italic> expression remained driving reduced MHCII expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Yet how MED16 controls <italic>Ciita</italic> expression upstream of MHCII remains an open question. One recent study showed that MED16 controls NRF2 related signaling networks that respond to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sekine et al., 2016</xref>). A major finding of our MED16 transcriptional analysis was the identification of several metabolic pathways involved in oxidative stress and xenobiotics. Given the previous work that described how oxidative stress and the NRF2 regulator KEAP1 regulated IFNγ-mediated MHCII expression in human melanoma cells, NRF2 regulation and redox dysregulation could explain a possible mechanism for MED16 control of MHCII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wijdeven et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, the effect of MED16 loss was negligible on many STAT1 and IRF1 targets, and, in fact, resulted in a type I interferon gene signature. Further experiments found that co-culture of <italic>Med16</italic> KO with NTC cells did not alter MHCII expression in either population suggesting a cell-autonomous effect of <italic>Med</italic>16 KO. Thus, what is driving the type I signature following type II interferon activation remains unknown suggesting a careful balance between regulation of distinct IFN-mediated gene expression signatures.</p><p>Previous studies showed that CDK8, a kinase that can associate with the mediator complex, controls a subset of IFNγ-dependent gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bancerek et al., 2013</xref>). However, our results strongly support a model where MED16 acts independently of CDK8. Not only was CDK8 not identified in the initial CRISPR screen, but our transcriptional profiling showed that the major IFNγ-dependent genes controlled by <italic>Cdk8, Tap1</italic> and <italic>Irf1</italic>, remain unchanged in <italic>Med16</italic> KO macrophages. Thus, understanding what transcription factors MED16 interacts with in the future will be needed to fully determine the mechanisms of MED16-dependent transcription and its control over <italic>Ciita</italic> and IFNγ-mediated gene expression.</p><p>While we hypothesize that MED16 directly controls <italic>Ciita</italic> transcription, GSK3 likely regulates MHCII through signaling networks upstream of transcription initiation. GSK3α and GSK3β are multifunctional kinases that regulate diverse cellular functions including inflammatory and developmental cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu and Pan, 2010</xref>). Our studies found that GSK3β and GSK3α coordinate IFNγ-mediated MHCII expression, with GSK3β playing a primary role and GSK3α contributing in the absence of GSK3β. The mechanism of this compensation, however, appears independent of protein abundance or phosphorylation and remains unclear. One possibility is that GSK3β outcompetes GSK3α for substrates related to MHCII expression but testing this hypothesis will require further biochemical studies. Thus, GSK3α and GSK3β are partially redundant in their control of IFNγ-mediated MHCII expression highlighting the interlinked regulation of MHCII.</p><p>Because GSK3α/β control many pathways, careful work is needed to determine which networks upstream and downstream of GSK3α/β are responsible for controlling <italic>Ciita</italic> expression. Previous studies suggested that GSK3 controls IFNγ mediated STAT3 activation, LPS-mediated nitric oxide production, and IRF1 transcriptional activity but our transcriptional results clearly show these do not explain the requirement for GSK3-dependent MHCII expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beurel and Jope, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garvin et al., 2019</xref>). Work in human monocyte-derived macrophages showed previously that IFNγ primed macrophages activate mTORC1 resulting in blunted TLR2 responses opposite of the results from the MHCII genetic screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Su et al., 2015</xref>). Given GSK3 was previously shown to be modified by mTORC1, we directly examined how mTORC1 modulates IFNγ-mediated responses in the presence and absence of functional GSK3α/β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Turnquist et al., 2010</xref>). Our study provides new evidence that mTORC1 differentially controls the expression of distinct IFNγ-inducible genes. Blocking mTORC1 activation enhanced IFNγ-mediated PD-L1 surface expression in line with observations in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Su et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, mTOR activity was required for robust IFNγ-mediated MHCII expression, in agreement with the bioinformatic analysis from our screen. We also observed that mTORC1 inhibition further diminished MHCII expression in <italic>Gsk3b</italic> KO or CHIR99021 cells suggesting GSK3α/β functions independently of mTOR to control IFNγ-inducible MHCII. Thus, our findings suggest that mTORC1 is both a positive and negative regulator of IFNγ responses that functions independently of GSK3β and Med16 to control MHCII expression. Given mTORC1 is the target of many therapeutics, the mechanisms regulating this differential control of IFNγ-activated pathways will be important to understand.</p><p>One additional function of GSK3 is to modulate the activation of the Wnt signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu and Pan, 2010</xref>). Inhibition or loss of GSK3 results in the constitutive stabilization of Beta-Catenin and <italic>Tcf</italic> expression. If the constitutive activation of Beta-catenin and Wnt signaling prevents effective <italic>Ciita</italic> expression remains to be determined. Interestingly, another Wnt signaling pathway member <italic>Fzd4</italic> was identified in our screen as required for MHCII expression in our screen, supporting a possible role for Wnt in IFNγ-induced MHCII regulation. It is tempting to speculate that Wnt signaling balances IFNγ-induced activation, resulting in distinct MHCII upregulation between cells with different Wnt activation states. While there is data supporting interactions between Wnt pathways and Type I IFN during viral infections, this has not been explored yet in the context of IFNγ(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>GSK3 was recently found to be co-opted by the <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium effector SteE to skew infected macrophage polarization and allow infection to persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gibbs et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Panagi et al., 2020</xref>). Our results suggest another possible effect of targeting GSK3 may be the inefficient upregulation of MHCII on Salmonella-infected macrophages in response to IFNγ. While it is known that <italic>Salmonella</italic> and other pathogens including <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, modulate the expression of MHCII, the precise mechanisms underlying many of these virulence tactics remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alix et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ankley et al., 2020</xref>). Our screening results provide a framework to test the contribution of each candidate MHCII regulator during infection with pathogens that target MHCII. These directed experiments would allow the rapid identification of possible host-pathogen interactions. It will be important to determine if augmenting specific MHCII pathways identified by our screen overcomes pathogen-mediated inhibition and induces robust MHCII expression to better activate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and protect against disease using <italic>in vivo</italic> models. Conditional knockout mice were recently developed for GSK3α and Gsk3β and can now be used to specifically ablate <italic>Gsk3b</italic> in macrophages <italic>in vivo</italic> and examine IFNγ responses. However, previous work targeting <italic>Med16</italic> found this knockout is embryonic lethal thus work is underway to develop conditional <italic>Med16</italic> knockout animals to specifically test Med16 function in IFNγresponses to infection <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Beyond infections, our dataset provides an opportunity to examine the importance of newly identified MHCII regulators in other diseases such as tumor progression and autoimmunity. Of course, MHCII is not the only surface marker that is targeted by pathogens and malignancy. Other important molecules including MHCI, CD40, and PD-L1 are induced by IFNγ stimulation and are targeted in different disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia-Diaz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mandai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou, 2009</xref>). Employing our screening pipeline for a range of surface markers will identify regulatory pathways that are shared and unique at high resolution and provide insights into targeting these pathways therapeutically. Taken together, the tools and methods developed here identified new regulators of IFNγ-inducible MHCII that will illuminate the underlying biology of the host immune response.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Using the BRIE library, 4 sgRNAs targeting every coding gene in mice in addition to 1000 non-targeting controls (78,637 sgRNAs total) were packaged into lentivirus using HEK293T cells and transduced in L3 cells at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI &lt;0.3) and selected with puromycin two days after transduction. Sequencing of the input library showed high coverage and distribution of the library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next treated the library with IFNγ (10 ng/ml) and 24 hr later the cells were fixed and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to isolate the MHCII<sup>high</sup> and MHCII<sup>low</sup> bins. Bin size was guided by the observed phenotypes of positive control sgRNAs, such as RFX5, which were tested individually and to ensure sufficient coverage ( &gt; 25 x unselected library) in the sorted populations. Genomic DNA was isolated from sorted populations from two biological replicate experiments using Qiagen DNeasy kits. Amplification of sgRNAs by PCR was performed as previously described using Illumina compatible primers from IDT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doench et al., 2016</xref>), and amplicons were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500.</p><p>Sequence reads were first trimmed to remove any adapter sequence and to adjust for p5 primer stagger. We used bowtie two via MAGeCK to map reads to the sgRNA library index without allowing for any mismatch. Subsequent sgRNA counts were median normalized to control sgRNAs in MAGeCK to account for variable sequencing depth. Control sgRNAs were defined as non-targeting controls as well as genes not-transcribed in our macrophage cell line as determined empirically by RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). To test for sgRNA and gene enrichment, we used the ‘test’ command in MAGeCK to compare the distribution of sgRNAs in the MHCII<sup>high</sup> and MHCII<sup>low</sup> bins. Notably, we included the input libraries in the count analysis in order to use the distribution of sgRNAs in the unselected library for the variance estimation in MAGeCK. sgRNA cloning sgOpti was a gift from Eric Lander &amp; David Sabatini (Addgene plasmid #85681) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fulco et al., 2016</xref>). Individual sgRNAs were cloned as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, annealed oligos containing the sgRNA targeting sequence were phosphorylated and cloned into a dephosphorylated and BsmBI (New England Biolabs) digested SgOpti (Addgene#85681) which contains a modified sgRNA scaffold for improved sgRNA-Cas9 complexing. A detailed cloning protocol is available in supplementary methods. To facilitate rapid and efficient generation of sgRNA plasmids with different selectable markers, we further modified the SgOpti vector such that the mammalian selectable marker was linked with a distinct bacterial selection. Subsequent generation of SgOpti-Blasticidin-Zeocin (BZ), SgOpti-Hygromycin-Kanamycin (HK), and SgOpti-G418-Hygromycin (GH) allowed for pooled cloning in which a given sgRNA was ligated into a mixture of BsmBI-digested plasmids. Successful transformants for each of the plasmids were selected by plating on ampicillin (SgOpti), zeocin (BZ), kanamycin (HK), or hygromycin (GH) in parallel. In effect, this reduced the cloning burden 4 x and provided flexibility with selectable markers to generate near-complete editing in polyclonal cells and/or make double knockouts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Cells were harvested at the indicated times post-IFNγstimulation by scraping to ensure intact surface proteins. Cells were pelleted and washed with PBS before staining for MHCII. MHCII expression was analyzed on the BD LSRII cytometer or a BioRad S3E cell sorter. All flow cytometry analysis was done in FlowJo V9 or V10 (TreeStar).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Chemical inhibitors and agonists</title><p>CHIR99021 (Sigma) was resuspended in DMSO at 10 mM stock concentration. DMSO was added at the same concentration to the inhibitors as a control. Cells were maintained in 5 % CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were stimulated with 6.25 ng/ml of IFNγ (Biolegend) for the indicated times in each figure legend before analysis. Torin2 (Sigma) was resuspended in DMSO and diluted to the concentrations indicated in each experiment. PAM3SK4 (Invivogen) NG-MDP (Invivogen), IFNβ (BEI Resources), and TNF (Peprotech) were resuspending in sterile PBS and added to cells at the indicated concentrations in the figure legends.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>NK cell isolation, activation, and co-culture</title><p>Untouched naïve NK cells were isolated from spleen homogenates of C57BL/6 J mice using the MojoSort Mouse NK cell isolation kit (Biolegend). NK cells were grown for 7–10 days in RPMI with 10 % FBS, non-essential amino acids, 50 µM b-mercaptoethanol and 50 nM murine IL-15 (Biolegend). NK cells were then activated for 18 hr by adding 2 nM IL-12 and 20 nM IL-18 to cells. NK cells viability, differentiation, and activation was confirmed prior to experiments by flow cytometry using anti-CD335 and anti- IFNγ antibodies in combination with a viability live/dead stain (biolegend).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Isolation of knockout cells</title><p>Cells transduced with either MED16 or GSK3β sgRNAs were stimulated with IFNγ then stained for MHCII 24 hr later. Cells expressing low MHCII were then sorted using a BioRad S3e cell sorter and plated for expansion. Gene knockouts were confirmed by amplifying the genomic regions encoding either MED16 or GSK3β from each cell population in addition to NTC cells using PCR. PCR products were purified by PCR-cleanup Kit (Qiagen) and sent for Sanger Sequencing (Genewiz). The resultant ABI files were used for TIDE analysis to assess the frequency and size of indels in each population compared to control cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA isolation</title><p>Macrophages were homogenized in 500 µL of TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. A total of 100 µL of chloroform was added to the homogenate, vortexed, and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 20 min at 4 C to separate nucleic acids. The clear, RNA containing layer was removed and combined with 500 µL of ethanol. This mixture was placed into a collection tube and protocols provided by the Zymo Research Direct-zol RNA extraction kit were followed. Quantity and purity of the RNA was checked using a NanoDrop and diluted to 5 ng/µL in nuclease-free water.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>RNA-sequencing analysis</title><p>To generate RNA for sequencing, macrophages were seeded in 6-well dishes at a density of 1 million cells/well. Cells were stimulated for 18 hr with IFNγ (Peprotech) at a final concentration of 6.25 ng/mL, after which RNA was isolated as described above. RNA quality was assessed by qRT-PCR as described above and by TapeStation (Aligent); the median RIN value was 9.5 with a ranger of 8.6–9.9. A standard library preparation protocol was followed to prepare sequencing libraries on poly-A tailed mRNA using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina. In total, 18 libraries were prepared for dual index paired-end sequencing on a HiSeq 2500 using a high-output kit (Illumina) at an average sequencing depth of 38.6e6 reads per library with &gt;93 % of bases exceeding a quality score of 30. FastQC (v0.11.5) was used to assess the quality of raw data. Cutadapt (v2.9) was used to remove TruSeq adapter sequences with the parameters <monospace>--cores</monospace> = 15 m 1 a <named-content content-type="sequence">AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA</named-content> -<named-content content-type="sequence">A AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT</named-content>. A transcriptome was prepared with the rsem (v1.3.0) command rsem-prepare-reference using bowtie2 (v2.3.5.1) and the gtf and primary <italic>Mus musculus</italic> genome assembly from ENSEMBL release 99. Trimmed sequencing reads were aligned and counts quantified using rsem-calculate-expression with standard bowtie2 parameters; fragment size and alignment quality for each sequencing library was assessed by estimating the read start position distribution (RSPD) via <monospace>--estimate-rspd</monospace>. aBriefly, counts were imported using tximport (v1.16.0) and differential expression was performed with non-targeting control (‘NTC’) and unstimulated (‘Condition A’) as reference levels for contrasts. For visualization via PCA, a variance stabilizing transformation was performed in DESeq2. Pathway enrichment utilized R packages gage and fgsea or Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen). Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed utilized gene rank lists as calculated from defined comparisons in DeSeq2 and was inclusive of gene sets comprised of 10–500 genes that were compiled and made available by the Bader lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reimand et al., 2019</xref>). Pathway visualization and network construction was performed in CytoScape 3.8 using the apps STRING and EnrichmentMap. Pathway significance thresholds were set at an FDR of 0.1 unless specified otherwise.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>PCR amplification of the RNA was completed using the One-step Syber Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen). 25 ng of total RNA was added to a master mix reaction of the provided RT Mix, Syber green, gene specific primers (5 uM of forward and reverse primer), and nuclease-free water. For each biological replicate (triplicate), reactions were conducted in technical duplicates in 96-well plates. PCR product was monitored using the QuantStudio3 (ThermoFisher). The number of cycles needed to reach the threshold of detection (Ct) was determined for all reactions. Relative gene expression was determined using the 2^-ddCT method. The mean CT of each experimental sample in triplicate was determined. The average mean of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was subtracted from the experimental sample mean CT for each gene of interest (dCT). The average dCT of the untreated control group was used as a calibrator and subtracted from the dCT of each experimental sample (ddCT). 2^-ddCT shows the fold change in gene expression of the gene of interest normalized to GAPDH and relative to to untreated control (calibrator).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunoblot analysis</title><p>At the indicated times following stimulation, cells were washed with PBS once and lysed in on ice using the following buffer: 1 % Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 % SDS, 0.5 % DOC, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with protease and phosphatase inhibitor (Sigma #11873580001 and Sigma P5726).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Maziar Divangahi (Reviewer #2); Ivan Zanoni (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Experimental treatment with IFNγ may not be physiological. In key experiments, authors should try co-culture with activated NK cells +/- IFNγ neutralization.

Does IFNγ signaling interface with GSK3 or MED16 to regulate their activity, or do other physiological stimuli interface with GSK3 or MED16 to modulate the ability of IFNγ signaling to regulate MHC class II molecule expression? How do GSK3 and MED16 modulate specific aspects of the IFNγ-mediated transcriptional response?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript entitled &quot;A genetic screen in macrophages identifies new regulators of IFNγ-inducible MHCII that 2 contribute to T cell activation&quot; by Kiritsy, Akley et al., the authors provide novel insight into the cellular signalling pathways involved in MHC-II upregulation on macrophages following exposure to IFN-γ. Although the potent ability of IFN-γ to induce MHC-II on macrophages has been known for decades, here the authors employ a new-age CRISPR-Cas9 forward genetic screen to reveal novel players in the pathway. Following validation, they elucidate 15 novel candidates and subsequently extensively validate two candidates experimentally: MED16 and Glycogen 186 synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). Finally, they confirm these two candidates regulate MHC-II upregulation in response to IFN-γ on macrophages, albeit through different mechanisms, and that this functionally contributes to the feed-forward loop of MHC-II upregulation and antigen presentation to CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells for further production of IFN-γ.</p><p>As the authors rightly point-out, they only validate two candidates, the results of their forward screen can lead to subsequent investigation of many other candidates, which adds tremendous value to the submitted study and ensures further contributions to the literature. Although this reviewer is not an expert in CRISPR-Cas9 editing and genomics and, thus, cannot intimately validate the appropriateness of controls and experimental design of these portions, the conceptual framework of this study is very novel and the experiments with KO macrophages and co-cultures are rigorous and exciting. The major concern of this reviewer is the functional importance of these candidates outside of the contrived conditions of direct IFN-γ application to primarily immortalized macrophages. Therefore, some additional experiments can considerably enhance the immunological relevance of this manuscript.</p><p>1. The vast majority of experiments are conducted using a single-dose of exogenous IFN-γ in macrophages, where MHC-II expression is then assessed at one single timepoint. Although the authors performed some co-culture experiments (Figure 6), but these experiments were insufficient considering the cellular source as well as the physiological relevance of IFN-γ in these culture models are not known. Can the author performed experiments with activated NK cells that produce large amounts of IFN-γ? Macrophage expression of MHC-II can be investigated following co-culture with stimulated NK cells. Importantly, in this model system, the specificity of IFN-γ in the upregulation of MHC-II can be interrogated using inhibitors of the receptor or neutralization of IFN-γ in the cultures.</p><p>2. Along to the above point, is the function of MED16 and GSK3β in the induction of MHC-II specific to type II IFN? The authors find a substantial type I IFN signature in the MED16-deficient macrophages following IFN-γ stimulation. As there is considerable overlap between these pathways, can type I IFN (e.g. α or β) induce MHC-II expression in these macrophages? Additionally, the authors can stimulate the macrophages with PAMPs, such as Poly I:C, or endotoxin (LPS) and investigate whether type I IFN provides a compensatory mechanism for MHC-II induction, by blocking again IFN-γ or type I IFN in those conditions.</p><p>3. Finally, if the authors extend their findings to an in vivo setting, this will tremendously improve the significant of their study. For instance, adoptive transfer of WT or KO macrophages into an LPS- or Poly I:C-treated mice (CD45.1 versus CD45.2) can determine whether the expression of MHC-II will be increased specifically on those transferred macrophages.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Throughout the paper there is a lack of comparison with cells that have not been exposed to IFNγ. Data shown in figure 1A, B clearly demonstrate that some regulators can change the basal levels of MHCII. This confounds the interpretation of several data in two main ways: (i) it is impossible to distinguish the effects of genes that regulate the basal expression of MHCII and the ones whose activity is solely induced by IFNγ; (ii) in several experiments the upregulation of MHCII upon IFNγ is expressed as a ratio with untreated cells (eg. Figure 1E), not taking into account the activity of the gene(s) of interest on the basal levels of MHCII.</p><p>This issue could be solved by: (i) always showing the activity of the gene(s) of interest also in untreated cells; (ii) by using other inflammatory stimuli -eg PAMPs- that are well known to increase MHCII expression. This would also extend the findings of the authors to other stimuli beside IFNγ.</p><p>The finding that the mTOR pathway (Figure S2E) may be involved in MHCII upregulation is of great interest. As reported by the authors, this pathway may converge on the activation of GSK3b. The authors completely overlooked if IFNγ is inducing mTOR activation that in turns regulate GSK3b. This issue could be easily solved by administering commercially available drugs to inhibit mTOR activation. Notably, it has been previously shown that IFNγ inhibits mTORC1 in human macrophages (Nat Imm 2015, Ivashkiv). How is the activation state of the mTOR pathway in the cell line used by the authors? Is it active or inhibited? How does this link to GSK3b activation?</p><p>The last two panels of figure 2 rise some concerns/questions. While MHCII is completely dampened in Rfx5 KO, Med16 KO show complete abrogation of Ciita but only partial decrease of MHCII. How do the authors explain this phenotype? CIITA and RFX5 are supposed to work in the same complex. Can the authors show the protein levels of CIITA in the Med16 KO cells? Is it possible that Ciita RNA is completely down but the protein is still partially present? This point of Med16 functioning is critical and may need additional experimental data.</p><p>The relationship between GSK3b and α is another critical point. It should be important to immediately introduce the relationship between the two proteins cause although presented as a &quot;strong&quot; phenotype by the authors, the phenotype in figure 3B, C D and F is clearly (very) partial. The authors should immediately clarify this in the text and prepare the reader to the transition from figure 3 to figure 4. Clearly the role of GSKa in the absence of GSKb is pretty strong (and not &quot;minor&quot; as stated by the authors in line 289). Is it possible to explain the partial phenotype of the GSK3b KO cells reported in Figure 3 by a non-homogeneous population of cells in which some of the cells still express GSK3b and/or overexpress GSK3a and/or other components of the mTOR pathway? A subcloning of the GSK3b KO cell line may be useful. Also, are the levels of GSKa unaltered in GSK3b KO cells or a feed-back loop is initiated that can explain the major role palyed by GSKa in GSKb KO, but not WT, cells?</p><p>Figure 5A, B misses a key control: a side-by-side analysis of WT cells treated in the same manner.

In key experiments, authors should try co-culture with activated NK cells +/- IFNγ neutralization. A dose and time response curve of IFNγ treatment may be valuable in key experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>These comments were very helpful to highlight that Med16 and GSK3a/b robustly control MHCII as discovered in our genetic screen. There were two key points raised by the reviewers that we have now addressed:</p><p>A. The reviewers were concerned with the possibility that the IFNg concentrations used were not physiological. To address this we optimized an NK cell co-culture assay. These experiments showed that while NTC macrophages robustly induced MHCII, Med16 and GSK3b KO cells in addition to cells treated with the GSK3a/b inhibitor CHIR99021 were inhibited. The induction of MHCII was IFNg -dependent as NK cells deficient in IFNg or antibody blockade of the IFNgR did not induce MHCII. Thus, using physiological levels of IFNg provided by NK cells we confirm the requirement for Med16 and GSK3a/b in macrophages for IFNg-dependent MHCII expression. These data are now included in our revised manuscript in Figures 2G and 3G.</p><p>B. The reviewers were also interested in how MHCII dynamics change over time and with differing IFNg concentrations. To address this we first examined MHCII expression over 48 hours of IFNg stimulation in NTC, GSK3b and Med16 KO macrophages. Regardless of the time point examined there was a significant reduction in the mRNA expression of H2-aA and the surface expression of MHCII in the KO cells compared to NTC controls. While there was a slight increase in MHCII expression in KO macrophages at 48 hours compared to 24 hours, it remained significantly lower than NTC controls. This supports the conclusion that loss of GSK3b and Med16 prevents robust IFNg-mediated MHCII expression. We further examined the sensitivity of MHCII inhibition in Med16 and GSK3b KO macrophages to IFNg concentration. IFNg concentrations as low as 1.5 ng/ml, ten-fold lower than is standard, was sufficient to induce MHCII in NTC macrophages but did not alter GSK3b or Med16 KO MHCII expression. Thus, the phenotypes we identified in our genetic screen are robust to changes in IFNg activation time and IFNg dose. These experiments have been included in Figures S3B-D and S4B-D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Comparison to cells not stimulated with IFNγ is needed in key experiments. Comparison to WT cells is needed in Figure 5 A,B.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out that we did not include a comparison of basal MHCII expression in our validation studies. We have now included both the fold change and the basal MHCII expression level for all targeted macrophages. We did not observe any significant changes in MHCII expression in any target macrophage in the absence of IFNg-activation. These data are now presented in Figure S2F. Throughout the remainder of the manuscript we include IFNg untreated conditions in key experiments and observed no change in MHCII between Med16 and GSK3b KO cells such as in Figures 2D-G, 3C-D and 4A-D.</p><p>We also thank the reviewers for pointing out the missing control. We have now included this control in the revised manuscript in Figure 4A. As expected CHIR99021 treatment of NTC cells resulted in a similar inhibition of IFNg-mediated MHCII expression compared to treatment of GSK3b KO cells. This shows that the further reduction in MHCII on GSK3b KO cells following CHIR99021 treatment is likely due to inhibition of active GSK3a.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Stimulation with Type I IFN and other PAMPs in key experiments, as comparison to the effects of IFNγ and to broaden the relevance of their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that understanding other environments where Med16 and GSK3b regulate MHCII expression in other inflammatory environments is essential to fully understand their function. We tested a range of stimuli on immortalized bone marrow derived macrophages as suggested by the reviewers. We found that no other stimulations resulted in a significant change in MHCII expression (See Figure S1C and S1D in the revised manuscript) while several stimulations drove increased surface PD-L1 expression. These results are in line with previous studies in BMDMs and epithelial cells that found TLR stimulation and Type I IFN activation do not alter MHCII expression and in fact inhibit IFNg-mediated MHCII expression. We further confirmed that co-stimulation with IFNg and LPS or PAM results in reduced MHCII expression. Our findings are consistent with a model that MHCII expression in bone-marrow derived macrophages is strongly dependent on IFNg activation thus, we did not include any other stimulations throughout the manuscript as the dynamic range of changes is limited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) More insight into how IFNγ signaling interfaces with GSK3 and MED16 is needed (e.g. role of mTORC1 pathway in regulating GSK3).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for encouraging us to understand the role of mTORC1 in the regulation of IFNg responses and of GSK3- and Med16-dependent pathways. The previous Ivashkiv study cited by the reviewer showed that macrophages treated with IFNg for 24 hours have reduced responsiveness to TLR2 activation that is mediated by an inhibition of mTORC1. This study suggests that IFNg inhibits mTORC1 signaling, at least after 24 hours of activation. In contrast to these results, bioinformatic analysis from our genetic screen showed that the mTORC1 pathways are required for IFNg-mediated MHCII expression. To resolve these discrepancies, we directly tested the role of mTORC1 activation in modulating IFNg responses. We first treated immortalized macrophages with the mTOR inhibitor Torin2 and found blocking mTORC1 activation inhibits the robust expression of IFNg-dependent MHCII in agreement with our screen results. However, when we examined a different IFNg-inducible marker PD-L1 we observed increased IFNg-mediated expression when mTORC1 is inhibited. These findings are consistent with the original findings by Ivashkiv et al., and are presented in Figure 4B-E. Thus, the role of mTORC1 in regulating IFNg-mediated MHCII and PD-L1 are distinct. This suggests that the role of mTORC1 in modulating specific IFNg responses is pathway dependent. We have also expanded our discussion on mTORC1 and IFNg on lines 543-562.</p><p>Another key question raised by the reviewers is whether IFNg responses mediated by GSK3b or Med16 are directly modulated by mTORC1 activity. A subset of GSK3a/b functions previously were shown to be regulated by AKT/mTOR activation suggesting a possible link between these pathways. We inhibited mTOR using Torin2 in Med16 and GSK3b KO cells in addition to CHIR99021 treated cells. Our findings clearly show dose dependent decreases in the remaining IFNg-inducible MHCII and increases in PD-L1 expression in each condition shown in Figure 4D and 4E. These data strongly support a model where Med16, GSK3a/b and mTOR all modulate distinct pathways that contribute to IFNg-mediated MHCII surface expression. Several previous studies have shown that a subset of GSK3a/b substrates such as β-catenin are not affected by changes in mTOR activation providing a possible explanation for these results that will need to be tested in our future studies (Reviewed in PMID 31884070). Altogether, our deeper investigation into the role of the mTOR pathway during IFNg responses as suggested by the reviewers has furthered our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms modulating IFNg-inducible MHCII in macrophages. We have uncovered exciting new parallel pathways that are required for effective cross-talk between the innate and adaptive immunity that we can examine in more detail in the future. We have added an additional figure to the manuscript summarizing these results in Figures 5 and S5. We have also added text to discuss how our findings and those by Ivashkiv suggest complex regulation of IFNg pathways by mTOR on lines 543-562.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Can the authors extend their data to an in vivo setting?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that examining how Med16 and GSK3b modulate MHCII in vivo is an important question to fully understand their function. The reviewer asked us to transfer congenically marked macrophages into the lungs of mice that are then treated with LPS or Poly I:C, and examine changes in MHCII. However, given our data presented above that MHCII is not strongly modulated by other stimuli, this experiment is challenging and unlikely to provide informative results. Furthermore, we believe this type of transfer experiment is very similar to the NK-cell co-culture experiments that we now include in the revised manuscript. Rather than mixing IFNg producing cells in a dish, these cells would instead be mixed in the lungs, limiting the additional biological information gleaned while using many animals. Instead, we strongly believe the correct approach to address this question is to generate animals deficient in GSK3b and Med16. Given deletion of both GSK3b and Med16 is embryonic lethal this requires using conditional alleles. We recently acquired GSK3b and GSK3a floxed animals that we are now breeding to generate macrophage specific deletions. We are also designing a Med16 floxed animal with our small animal core. Given the length of time needed to generate these new novel models, we believe these experiments are outside the scope of this manuscript. With the inclusion of NK co-culture data to ensure IFNg levels are physiological, in addition to T-cell co-culture experiments that convincingly show that macrophage changes in MHCII directly alter T cell responses our findings directly relate to cellular interactions seen in vivo. We have also added additional text to the discussion to raise the limitation of our study not using in vivo models and how we will address this in the future on lines 582-589.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Can the authors clarify the relative roles of GSK3a and GSK3b? For example, how do the authors explain the lack of a robust phenotype in Figure 3B-F?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out that our original manuscript made the relative roles of GSK3b and GSK3a ambiguous. There were two main concerns, first why is there a moderate phenotype for GSK3b in Figure 3 and second how does GSK3a fit in our model. In the revised manuscript we have made several changes that we believe more clearly articulate our findings with GSK3a and GSK3b.</p><p>First, with regard to the phenotypes shown in the original Manuscript, we respectfully disagree that these results are not robust. We isolated a knockout GSK3b clone by cell sorting that was confirmed to be fully edited. By flow cytometry there is a reproducible 3-5-fold reduction in the MHCII MFI in GSK3b KO cells and by RT-PCR almost a 5-10-fold reduction in Ciita and H2-aA mRNA expression. Several of these data are presented on a log10 scale given the magnitude of changes following IFNg activation. The timecourse data added in revision further support that this reduction of MHCII expression is seen over time following IFNg activation. The loss of GSK3b alone is also biologically significant as it reduces the capacity of macrophages to activate T cells effectively, suggesting an important conclusion that smaller changes in MHCII expression can directly modulate T cell function.</p><p>However, as the reviewers pointed out correctly partial MHCII expression clearly remains in GSK3b KO cells that we believe is mediated by GSK3a compensation. This was not clearly explained in our initial submission. In our revised manuscript we have reordered figures related to GSK3b and GSK3a to introduce GSK3a and the overlap in functions earlier in the results as requested by the reviewer (New Figure 3). This enabled a clearer discussion on the roles of GSK3a and GSK3b throughout the manuscript. We also include new data probing how GSK3a controls MHCII only in the absence of GSK3b to better understand underlying mechanisms. We found that the protein expression levels of GSK3a remain unchanged in GSK3b knockouts, and the phosphorylation of GSK3a also remains unchanged shown in figure 3H. These data suggest a more complicated mechanism used by GSK3a to provide redundant control in GSK3b KO cells. One possibility is that GSK3b outcompetes GSK3a for substrates related to Ciita expression preventing any major regulatory role for GSK3a when GSK3b is present. However, in the absence of GSK3b, these substrates are freed allowing GSK3a to regulate their function. Testing these hypotheses are biochemically intensive experiments that we are excited to pursue in the future. We have added this possibility to the discussion on lines 535-542 where we also more formally discuss the roles of GSK3b and GSK3a to clarify their functions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors are encouraged to dig deeper into their biological system. Does IFNγ signaling interface with GSK3 or MED16 to regulate their activity, or do other physiological stimuli interface with GSK3 or MED16 to modulate the ability of IFNγ signaling to regulate MHC class II molecule expression? How do GSK3 and MED16 modulate specific aspects of the IFNγ-mediated transcriptional response?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their recommendations. Our revised manuscript has added additional data to support our models and examine further mechanisms of this pathway. As discussed above new findings have been added related to : (A) the interplay between GSK3a and GSK3b (B) the role of mTOR in regulating Med16/GSK3 pathways (C) NK cell co-culture experiments to understand physiological activation (D) examination of other stimuli that may modulate MHCII function. With these these additions, combined with the data from the original manuscript including a genome-wide genetic screen, RNAseq analysis and T cell interaction studies our manuscript tells a convincing and complete story about regulators of MHCII expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript entitled &quot;A genetic screen in macrophages identifies new regulators of IFNγ-inducible MHCII that 2 contribute to T cell activation&quot; by Kiritsy, Akley et al., the authors provide novel insight into the cellular signalling pathways involved in MHC-II upregulation on macrophages following exposure to IFN-γ. Although the potent ability of IFN-γ to induce MHC-II on macrophages has been known for decades, here the authors employ a new-age CRISPR-Cas9 forward genetic screen to reveal novel players in the pathway. Following validation, they elucidate 15 novel candidates and subsequently extensively validate two candidates experimentally: MED16 and Glycogen 186 synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). Finally, they confirm these two candidates regulate MHC-II upregulation in response to IFN-γ on macrophages, albeit through different mechanisms, and that this functionally contributes to the feed-forward loop of MHC-II upregulation and antigen presentation to CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells for further production of IFN-γ.</p><p>As the authors rightly point-out, they only validate two candidates, the results of their forward screen can lead to subsequent investigation of many other candidates, which adds tremendous value to the submitted study and ensures further contributions to the literature. Although this reviewer is not an expert in CRISPR-Cas9 editing and genomics and, thus, cannot intimately validate the appropriateness of controls and experimental design of these portions, the conceptual framework of this study is very novel and the experiments with KO macrophages and co-cultures are rigorous and exciting. The major concern of this reviewer is the functional importance of these candidates outside of the contrived conditions of direct IFN-γ application to primarily immortalized macrophages. Therefore, some additional experiments can considerably enhance the immunological relevance of this manuscript.</p><p>1. The vast majority of experiments are conducted using a single-dose of exogenous IFN-γ in macrophages, where MHC-II expression is then assessed at one single timepoint. Although the authors performed some co-culture experiments (Figure 6), but these experiments were insufficient considering the cellular source as well as the physiological relevance of IFN-γ in these culture models are not known. Can the author performed experiments with activated NK cells that produce large amounts of IFN-γ? Macrophage expression of MHC-II can be investigated following co-culture with stimulated NK cells. Importantly, in this model system, the specificity of IFN-γ in the upregulation of MHC-II can be interrogated using inhibitors of the receptor or neutralization of IFN-γ in the cultures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recommending these experiments. As discussed above, we have completed these experiments and include them in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Along to the above point, is the function of MED16 and GSK3β in the induction of MHC-II specific to type II IFN? The authors find a substantial type I IFN signature in the MED16-deficient macrophages following IFN-γ stimulation. As there is considerable overlap between these pathways, can type I IFN (e.g. α or β) induce MHC-II expression in these macrophages? Additionally, the authors can stimulate the macrophages with PAMPs, such as Poly I:C, or endotoxin (LPS) and investigate whether type I IFN provides a compensatory mechanism for MHC-II induction, by blocking again IFN-γ or type I IFN in those conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>These are great questions from the reviewer that are addressed in our above responses. We found no other stimulations that significantly alter the expression of MHCII on macrophages. With regard to type I IFN in Med16 KO cells we do not currently understand how this signature is occurring mechanistically. Previous studies suggest differential roles of type I IFN on MHCII dependent on cell type. While type I IFN can modulate MHCII in DCs, our results in macrophages (Figure S1C/D) and other previous studies suggest there may be cell type specificity to the effect of Type I IFN on MHCII expression. For example, Type I IFN has been shown to blunt IFNg-mediated MHCII surface expression in a variety of contexts (PMID: 19667042 and 7595221). Thus, it was possible that Med16 KO cells drive increased Type I IFN that inhibits IFNg-mediated MHCII expression. To test this possibility we co-cultured wild type and Med16 KO cells in the same well and treated with IFNg reasoning that if increased Type I IFN was inhibiting Med16 KO this should inhibit NTC cells in trans. However, our results clearly showed that Med16 KO inhibition of MHCII is cell-autonomous. These new results are now presented in Figure 5H. As the reviewer correctly points out there is significant overlap between the regulons induced by IFNg and Type I IFN. Our current hypothesis is that dysregulated IFNg responses in Med16 KO macrophages results in the loss of regulation over Type I IFN pathways. In future studies we look forward to understanding this delicate balance between Type I and Type II IFN responses in macrophages. This has been further discussed on lines 525-529.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Finally, if the authors extend their findings to an in vivo setting, this will tremendously improve the significant of their study. For instance, adoptive transfer of WT or KO macrophages into an LPS- or Poly I:C-treated mice (CD45.1 versus CD45.2) can determine whether the expression of MHC-II will be increased specifically on those transferred macrophages.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment that was addressed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Throughout the paper there is a lack of comparison with cells that have not been exposed to IFNγ. Data shown in figure 1A, B clearly demonstrate that some regulators can change the basal levels of MHCII. This confounds the interpretation of several data in two main ways: (i) it is impossible to distinguish the effects of genes that regulate the basal expression of MHCII and the ones whose activity is solely induced by IFNγ; (ii) in several experiments the upregulation of MHCII upon IFNγ is expressed as a ratio with untreated cells (eg. Figure 1E), not taking into account the activity of the gene(s) of interest on the basal levels of MHCII.</p><p>This issue could be solved by: (i) always showing the activity of the gene(s) of interest also in untreated cells; (ii) by using other inflammatory stimuli -eg PAMPs- that are well known to increase MHCII expression. This would also extend the findings of the authors to other stimuli beside IFNγ.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. Both issues raised by the reviewer have been addressed in the revised manuscript as described above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The finding that the mTOR pathway (Figure S2E) may be involved in MHCII upregulation is of great interest. As reported by the authors, this pathway may converge on the activation of GSK3b. The authors completely overlooked if IFNγ is inducing mTOR activation that in turns regulate GSK3b. This issue could be easily solved by administering commercially available drugs to inhibit mTOR activation. Notably, it has been previously shown that IFNγ inhibits mTORC1 in human macrophages (Nat Imm 2015, Ivashkiv). How is the activation state of the mTOR pathway in the cell line used by the authors? Is it active or inhibited? How does this link to GSK3b activation?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above this was an excellent suggestion by the reviewer that has uncovered a surprising and unexpected differential role of mTORC1 to control IFNg-mediated MHCII or PD-L1 expression. Our inhibitor results suggest that mTOR is activated in our cells during IFNg stimulation and appears to be independent of GSK3b. We are excited to examine the role differential roles of mTOR during IFNg responses in more detail in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The last two panels of figure 2 rise some concerns/questions. While MHCII is completely dampened in Rfx5 KO, Med16 KO show complete abrogation of Ciita but only partial decrease of MHCII. How do the authors explain this phenotype? CIITA and RFX5 are supposed to work in the same complex. Can the authors show the protein levels of CIITA in the Med16 KO cells? Is it possible that Ciita RNA is completely down but the protein is still partially present? This point of Med16 functioning is critical and may need additional experimental data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for asking us to clarify this point. While the reviewer is correct that the RT-PCR data in Figure 2 shows limited Ciita expression, data from replicate experiments in addition to our data from the more sensitive RNAseq do show some Ciita expression (See Figure 5B and 5C) following IFNg activation in Med16 KO. Given that small amounts of Ciita can initiate the assembly of the transcriptional complexes at the MHCII locus, we believe this is responsible for the limited MHCII expression seen. Since none of the macrophages express any Ciita in the absence of IFNg, it is also unlikely that Ciita protein is present without IFNg activation. We have added a line to the text to clarify this point for the readers in the discussion on lines 515-516.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The relationship between GSK3b and α is another critical point. It should be important to immediately introduce the relationship between the two proteins cause although presented as a &quot;strong&quot; phenotype by the authors, the phenotype in figure 3B, C D and F is clearly (very) partial. The authors should immediately clarify this in the text and prepare the reader to the transition from figure 3 to figure 4. Clearly the role of GSKa in the absence of GSKb is pretty strong (and not &quot;minor&quot; as stated by the authors in line 289). Is it possible to explain the partial phenotype of the GSK3b KO cells reported in Figure 3 by a non-homogeneous population of cells in which some of the cells still express GSK3b and/or overexpress GSK3a and/or other components of the mTOR pathway? A subcloning of the GSK3b KO cell line may be useful. Also, are the levels of GSKa unaltered in GSK3b KO cells or a feed-back loop is initiated that can explain the major role palyed by GSKa in GSKb KO, but not WT, cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. As described above we have addressed each question experimentally and with text to more clearly explain the role of GSK3a/b throughout the manuscript. We believe they have greatly improved the clarity of this section of the revised study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5A, B misses a key control: a side-by-side analysis of WT cells treated in the same manner.
