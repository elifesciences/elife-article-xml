Recent advances in parameterizing neural power spectra offer practical tools for evaluating these features separately. Although neural signals vary dynamically and express non-stationarity in relation to ongoing behaviour and perception, current methods yield static spectral decompositions. Here, we introduce Spectral Parameterization Resolved in Time (SPRiNT) as a novel method for decomposing complex neural dynamics into periodic and aperiodic spectral elements in a time-resolved manner. First, we demonstrate, with naturalistic synthetic data, SPRiNT’s capacity to reliably recover time-varying spectral features. We emphasize SPRiNT’s specific strengths compared to other time-frequency parameterization approaches based on wavelets. Second, we use SPRiNT to illustrate how aperiodic spectral features fluctuate across time in empirical resting-state EEG data (n=178) and relate the observed changes in aperiodic parameters over time to participants’ demographics and behaviour. Lastly, we use SPRiNT to demonstrate how aperiodic dynamics relate to movement behaviour in intracranial recordings in rodents. We foresee SPRiNT responding to growing neuroscientific interests in the parameterization of time-varying neural power spectra and advancing the quantitation of complex neural dynamics at the natural time scales of behaviour.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aperiodic</kwd><kwd>periodic</kwd><kwd>parameterization</kwd><kwd>power spectra</kwd><kwd>neural oscillations</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Undergraduate Student Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Luc Edward</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Alexander Graham-Bell NSERC Doctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>da Silva Castanheira</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EB026299</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baillet</surname><given-names>Sylvain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery Grant,436355-13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baillet</surname><given-names>Sylvain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Canada Research Chair in Neural Dynamics of Brain Systems</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baillet</surname><given-names>Sylvain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000008</institution-id><institution>Health Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Brain Canada Foundation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baillet</surname><given-names>Sylvain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010785</institution-id><institution>Canada First Research Excellence Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Innovative Ideas program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baillet</surname><given-names>Sylvain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The new method and reported findings address a growing interest in neuroscience for research tools that can reliably decompose brain activity at the mesoscopic scale into interpretable components.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The brain constantly expresses a repertoire of complex dynamics related to behaviour in health and disease. Neural oscillations, for instance, are rhythmic (periodic) components of brain activity that emerge from a background of arrhythmic (aperiodic) fluctuations recorded with a range of electrophysiological techniques at the mesoscopic scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buzsáki, 2006</xref>). Brain oscillations and their rhythmic dynamics have been causally linked to individual behaviour and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albouy et al., 2017</xref>) and shape brain responses to sensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Samaha et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Current methods for measuring the time-varying properties of neural fluctuations include several time-frequency decomposition techniques such as Hilbert, wavelet, and short-time Fourier signal transforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruns, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen, 2014</xref>), and more recently, empirical mode decompositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 1998</xref>) and time-delay embedded hidden Markov models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Quinn et al., 2018</xref>). Following spectral decomposition, rhythmic activity within the empirical bands of electrophysiology manifests as peaks of signal power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buzsáki and Watson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen, 2014</xref>). However, time-resolved signal power decompositions (spectrograms) do not explicitly account for the presence of aperiodic signal components, which challenge both the detection and the interpretability of spectral peaks as genuine periodic signal elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>). This is critical as aperiodic and periodic components of neural activity represent distinct, although possibly interdependent physiological mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Aperiodic neural activity is characterized by a reciprocal distribution of power with frequency (1 /f), which can be parameterized with two scalars: exponent and offset. These parameters are physiologically meaningful: current constructs consider the offset as reflecting neuronal population spiking and the exponent as related to the integration of synaptic currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Voytek and Knight, 2015</xref>) and reflecting the balance between excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) currents (i.e., the larger the exponent, the stronger the inhibition; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waschke et al., 2021</xref>). Aperiodic neural activity is ubiquitous throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He, 2014</xref>), and it differentiates healthy ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cellier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hill et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ostlund et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schaworonkow and Voytek, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Voytek et al., 2015</xref>) and is investigated as a potential marker of neuropsychiatric conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Molina et al., 2020</xref>) and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Heumen et al., 2021</xref>). Though the study of aperiodic neural activity has recently advanced, unanswered questions remain about its functional relevance, which requires an expanded toolkit to track their evolution across time and the broadest possible expressions of behaviour.</p><p>One little studied aspect of aperiodic activity is its fluctuations, both spontaneously over time, and in association with task and mental states. Baseline normalization is a common approach to compensate for aperiodic contributions to spectrograms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen, 2014</xref>), with the underlying assumption, however, that characteristics of aperiodic activity (exponent and offset) remain unchanged throughout the data length—an assumption that is challenged by recent empirical data that demonstrated their meaningful temporal fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Heumen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waschke et al., 2021</xref>). Akin to the motivations behind aperiodic/periodic spectral parameterization and signal decomposition techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wen and Liu, 2016</xref>), undetected temporal variations within the neural spectrogram may conflate fluctuations in aperiodic activity with modulations of periodic signals, hence distorting data interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>). Recent methodological advances have contributed practical tools to decompose and parameterize the neural power spectrum (periodogram) into aperiodic and periodic components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wen and Liu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He, 2014</xref>). One such practical tool (<italic>specparam</italic>) sequentially fits aperiodic and parametric components to the empirical neural power spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>). The resulting model for the aperiodic component is represented with exponent and offset scalar parameters; periodic elements are modelled with a series of Gaussian-shape functions characterized with three scalar parameters (centre frequency, amplitude, and SD). <italic>Specparam</italic> accounts for static spectral representations and as such does not account for the non-stationary contents of neural time series.</p><p>We introduce SPRiNT (Spectral Parameterization Resolved in Time) as a novel approach to identify and model dynamic shifts in aperiodic and periodic brain activity, yielding a time-resolved parameterization of neurophysiological spectrograms. We validate the method with an extensive set of naturalistic simulations of neural data, with benchmark comparisons to parameterized wavelet signal decompositions. Using SPRiNT, we also show that aperiodic fluctuations of the spectrogram can be related to meaningful behavioural and demographic variables from human EEG resting-state data and electrophysiological recordings from free-moving rodents.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>SPRiNT consists of the following methodological steps. First, short-time Fourier transforms (STFTs) are derived from overlapping time windows that slide over data time series. Second, the resulting STFT coefficients are averaged over consecutive time windows to produce a smooth estimate of the power spectral density of the recorded data. Third, the resulting periodogram is parameterized into aperiodic and periodic components with <italic>specparam</italic> (see Methods). As the procedure is repeated over the entire length of the data, SPRiNT produces a time-resolved parameterization of the data’s spectrogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The resulting parameters are then compiled into fully parameterized time-frequency representations for visualization and further derivations. A fourth step consists of an optional post-processing procedure meant to prune outlier transient manifestations of periodic signal components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Methods synopsis.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Overview of the Spectral Parameterization Resolved in Time (SPRiNT) approach: At each time bin along a neurophysiological time series (black trace) <italic>n</italic> overlapping time windows are Fourier-transformed to yield an estimate of spectral contents, which is subsequently parameterized using <italic>specparam</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>).

We first tested SPRiNT’s ability to detect and track transient and chirping periodic elements (with time-changing aperiodic components) and benchmarked its performance against parameterized wavelet signal decompositions and parameterized periodograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). A second validation challenge focused on simulations derived from randomly generated sets of realistic aperiodic and periodic parameters; this challenge served to assess SPRiNT’s performance across naturalistic heterogeneous signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; see Methods). Further below, we describe the application of SPRiNT to a variety of empirical data from human and rodent electrophysiology.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Methods benchmarking (synthetic data)</title><p>We first simulated 10,000 time series (60 s duration each) with aperiodic components transitioning linearly between t=24 s and t=36 s, from an initial exponent of 1.5 Hz<sup>–1</sup> and offset of –2.56 (arbitrary units, a.u.) towards a final exponent of 2.0 Hz<sup>–1</sup> and offset of –1.41 a.u. The periodic components of the simulated signals included transient activity in the alpha band (centre frequency: 8 Hz; amplitude: 1.2 a.u.; SD: 1.2 Hz) occurring between 8 and 40 s, 41–46 s and 47–52 s and a down-chirping oscillation in the beta band centre frequency decreasing from 18 to 15 Hz; amplitude: 0.9 a.u.; SD: 1.4 Hz, between 15 and 25 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We applied SPRiNT on each simulated time series, post-processed the resulting parameter estimates to remove outlier transient periodic components, and derived goodness-of-fit statistics of the SPRiNT parameter estimates with respect to their ground-truth values. We compared SPRiNT’s performances to parameterized periodograms (<italic>specparam</italic>), as well as the parameterization of temporally smoothed spectrograms obtained from Morlet wavelets time-frequency decompositions of the simulated time series (smoothed using a 4 s Gaussian kernel, SD = 1 s).

We discarded these segments from further analysis. We ran a logistic regression model with SPRiNT parameter estimates as fixed effects (mean and SD of alpha centre frequency, alpha power, and the aperiodic exponent across time) and found a significant effect of mean alpha power (<italic>β</italic> = –6.31, SE = 0.92, and 95% CI [–8.23,–4.61]), SD of alpha power (<italic>β</italic> = 4.64, SE = 2.03, and 95% CI [0.76, 8.73]), and mean aperiodic exponent (<italic>β</italic> = 2.55, SE = 0.53, and 95% CI [1.55, 3.63]) as predictors of the behavioural condition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). According to this model, lower alpha power, larger aperiodic exponents, and stronger fluctuations of alpha-band activity over time are signatures of the eyes-open resting condition. A Bayes factor analysis confirmed the evidence of effects of mean alpha power (BF = 4.39 × 10<sup>–13</sup>) and mean aperiodic exponent (BF = 1.62 × 10<sup>–4</sup>), and indicated mild evidence against the temporal variability of alpha power (BF = 3.81; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

SPRiNT parameterization found in the two subjects that resting bouts were associated with larger aperiodic exponents and more positive offsets than during movement bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We ran SPRiNT parameterizations over 8 s epochs proximal to transitions between movement and rest; we observed dynamic shifts between aperiodic modes associated with behavioural changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

SPRiNT extends recent practical tools that determine aperiodic and periodic parameters from static power spectra of neural signals to their spectrograms. Aperiodic spectral components may confound the detection and interpretation of narrow-band power changes as periodic, oscillatory signal elements. Given the scientific prominence of measures of neural oscillations in (causal) relation to behaviour (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albouy et al., 2017</xref>) and clinical syndromes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ostlund et al., 2021</xref>), it is essential that their characterization in time and frequency be contrasted with that of the underlying aperiodic background activity at the natural time scale of behaviour and perception.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>SPRiNT expands the neural spectrogram toolkit</title><p>Recent empirical studies show that the spectral distribution of neural signal power with frequency can be decomposed into low-dimensional aperiodic and periodic components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>) and that these latter are physiologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cole et al., 2019</xref>), clinically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Molina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Heumen et al., 2021</xref>), and behaviourally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ouyang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waschke et al., 2021</xref>) meaningful.</p><p>SPRiNT extends the approach to the low-dimensional time-resolved parameterization of neurophysiological spectrograms. The method combines the simplicity of the <italic>specparam</italic> spectral decomposition approach with the computational efficiency of STFTs across sliding windows. The present results demonstrate its technical concept and indicate that SPRiNT unveils meaningful additional information from the data beyond established tools such as wavelet time-frequency decompositions.</p><p>Using realistic simulations of neural time series, we demonstrate the strengths and current limitations of SPRiNT. We show that SPRiNT decompositions provide a comprehensive account of the neural spectrogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), tracking the dynamics of periodic and aperiodic signal components across time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We note that the algorithm performs optimally when the data features narrow-band oscillatory components that can be characterized as spectral peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The algorithm performs best when the data contains two or fewer salient periodic components concurrently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). We found that these current limitations are inherent to <italic>specparam</italic>, which is challenged by the dissociation of spectral peaks from background aperiodic activity at the lower edge of the power spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our synthetic data also identified certain limitations of the SPRiNT approach. The algorithm tends to overestimate the bandwidth of spectral peaks, which we discuss as related to the frequency resolution of the spectrogram (mostly 1 Hz in the present study). The frequency resolution of the spectrogram at 1 Hz, e.g., may be too low to quantify narrower band-limited components. The intrinsic noise level present in STFTs (i.e., spectral power not explained by periodic or aperiodic components) may also challenge bandwidth estimation. Increasing STFT window length augments spectral resolution and reduces intrinsic noise, although to the detriment of temporal specificity. We also found that SPRiNT may underestimate the number of periodic components, though this can be interpreted as the joint probability of SPRiNT detecting multiple independent oscillatory peaks (where the probability of detecting a given peak is between 65 and 75%; approximating a binomial distribution). We found that a peak was more likely to be detected if its amplitude is stronger and the centre frequency is above 8 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>), and if separated from other peaks by at least 8 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Finally, SPRiNT’s performances were slightly degraded when spectrograms composed an aperiodic knee (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is due to the specific challenge of estimating knee parameters. Nevertheless, the spectral knee frequency is related to intrinsic neuronal timescales and cortical microarchitecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2020</xref>), which are expected to be stable properties within each individual and across a given recording. Thus, we recommend estimating (and reporting) aperiodic knee frequencies from the power spectrum of the data with <italic>specparam</italic> and specifying the estimated value as a SPRiNT parameter.</p><p>SPRiNT’s optional outlier peak removal procedure increases the specificity of detected spectral peaks by emphasizing the detection of periodic components that develop over time. This feature is controlled by threshold parameters that can be adjusted along the time and frequency dimensions. So far, we found that applying a semi-conservative threshold for outlier removal (i.e., if less than three more peaks are detected within 2.5 Hz and 3 s around a given peak of the spectrogram) reduced the false detection rate by 50%, without affecting the true detection rate substantially (a&lt;5% reduction; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Setting these threshold parameters too conservatively would reduce the sensitivity of peak detection.</p><p>Practical mitigation techniques have been proposed to account for the presence of background aperiodic activity when estimating narrow-band signal power changes. For instance, baseline normalization is a common approach used to isolate event-related signals and prepare spectrograms for comparisons across individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen, 2014</xref>). However, the resulting relative measures of event-related power increases or decreases do not explicitly account for the fact that behaviour or stimulus presentations may also induce rapid changes in aperiodic activity. Therefore, baseline normalization followed by narrow-band analysis of power changes is not immune to interpretation ambiguities when aperiodic background activity also changes dynamically. Further, the definition of a reference baseline can be inadequate for some study designs, as exemplified herein with the LEMON dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>SPRiNT decomposition of EEG data tracks and predicts behaviour and demographics</title><p>We found in the LEMON dataset that measuring narrow band power changes without accounting for concurrent variations of the aperiodic signal background challenges the interpretation of effects manifested in the spectrogram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scally et al., 2018</xref>). Spectral parameterization with SPRiNT or <italic>specparam</italic> enables this distinction, showing that both periodic and aperiodic changes in neural activity are associated with age and behaviour. We found strong evidence for decreases in alpha-peak power and increases in aperiodic exponent during eyes-open resting-state behaviour (compared to eyes-closed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether these effects are independent or related. A recent analysis of the same dataset showed that the amplitude of alpha oscillations around a non-zero mean voltage influences baseline cortical excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Studenova et al., 2021</xref>)—an effect observable in part through variations of the aperiodic exponent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). Using both SPRiNT and <italic>specparam</italic>, we also observed both slower alpha-peak centre frequencies and smaller aperiodic exponents in the older age group, in agreement with previous literature on healthy ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cellier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hill et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ostlund et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schaworonkow and Voytek, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Using <italic>specparam</italic>, we found lower alpha-band peak amplitudes in older individuals in the eyes-closed condition. We could not replicate this effect from spectrograms parameterized with SPRiNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). This apparent divergence may be due to the challenge of detecting low-amplitude peaks in the spectrogram of older individuals. Periodograms are derived from averaging across time windows, which augments signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and therefore the sensitivity of <italic>specparam</italic> to periodic components of lower amplitude. In a subset of participants (&lt;10%), we also observed considerable differences between the alpha-peak amplitudes extracted from <italic>specparam</italic> and SPRiNT, which we explained by unstable expressions of alpha activity over time in these participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). The average alpha-peak amplitude estimated with SPRiNT is based only on time segments when an alpha-band periodic component is detected. With <italic>specparam</italic>, this estimate is derived across all time windows, regardless of the presence/absence of a bona fide alpha component at certain time instances. The consequence is that the estimate of the average alpha-peak amplitude is larger with SPRiNT than with <italic>specparam</italic> in these participants. Therefore, differences in alpha power between SPRiNT and <italic>specparam</italic> may be explained, at least in some participants, by differential temporal fluctuations of alpha band activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donoghue et al., 2021</xref>). This effect is reminiscent of recent observations that beta-band power suppression during motor execution is due to sparser bursting activity, not a sustained decrease of beta-band activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sherman et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We also emphasize how the variability of spectral parameters may relate to demographic features, as shown with SPRiNT’s prediction of participants’ age from the temporal variability of eyes-open alpha-peak centre frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). This could account for the interpretation derived from the periodogram, where eyes-open alpha-peak centre frequency is predictive of age instead. Previous studies explored similar effects of within-subject variability of alpha-peak centre frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haegens et al., 2014</xref>) and their clinical relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Larsson and Kostov, 2005</xref>). These findings augment the recent evidence that neural spectral features are robust signatures proper to an individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">da Silva Castanheira et al., 2021</xref>) and open the possibility that their temporal variability is neurophysiologically significant.</p><p>We also report time-resolved fluctuations in aperiodic activity related to behaviour in freely moving rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). SPRiNT aperiodic parameters highlight larger spectral exponents in rats during rest than during movement. Time-resolved aperiodic parameters can also be tracked with SPRiNT as subjects transition from periods of movement to rest and vice versa. The smaller aperiodic exponents observed during movement may be indicative of periods of general cortical disinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). Previous work on the same data has shown how locomotor behaviour is associated with changes in amplitude and centre frequency of entorhinal theta rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mizuseki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Samiee and Baillet, 2017</xref>). We also note that strong theta activity may challenge the estimation of aperiodic parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). Changes in aperiodic exponent were partially explained by movement speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), which could reflect increased processing demands from additional spatial information entering entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keene et al., 2016</xref>) or increased activity in cells encoding speed directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iwase et al., 2020</xref>). Combined, the reported findings support the notion that aperiodic background neural activity changes in relation to a variety of contexts and subject types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Molina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ostlund et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pathania et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waschke et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Heumen et al., 2021</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2017</xref> established a link between aperiodic exponent and the local balance of neural excitation vs inhibition. How this balance adjusts dynamically, potentially over a multiplicity of time scales, and relates directly or indirectly to individual behaviour, demographics, and neurophysiological factors remains to be studied.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Practical recommendations for using SPRiNT</title><p>SPRiNT returns goodness-of-fit metrics for all spectrogram parameters. However, these metrics cannot account entirely for possible misrepresentations or omissions of certain components of the spectrogram. Visual inspections of original spectrograms and SPRiNT parameterizations are recommended, e.g., to avoid fitting a ‘fixed’ aperiodic model to data with a clear spectral knee or to ensure that the minimum peak height parameter is adjusted to the peak of lowest amplitude in the data. Most of the results presented here were obtained with similar SPRiNT parameter settings.

A major asset of STFT is computational efficiency, but with sliding time windows of fixed duration, the method is less sophisticated that wavelet alternatives in terms of trading-off between temporal specificity and frequency resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen, 2014</xref>). Combining <italic>specparam</italic> with STFT yields rapid extraction of spectral parameters from time-frequency data. In principle, spectral parameterization should be capable of supplementing any time-frequency decomposition technique, such as wavelet transforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pietrelli et al., 2021</xref>), though at the expense of significantly greater computational cost. However, we have shown that the wavelet-<italic>specparam</italic> alternative to SPRiNT underperformed to recover aperiodic signal components. Further, the temporal smoothing necessary to reduce wavelet-<italic>specparam</italic> parameter estimation errors to levels similar to SPRiNT’s (4 s Gaussian kernel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) yields substantial redundancy of the spectral parameterization following wavelet decompositions.

The final simulated time series was generated as the linear combination of cosines of each sampled frequency (with random initial phases), with amplitudes across time corresponding to the expected power from the spectrogram.</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Simulations of transient and chirping periodic components</title><p>The aperiodic exponent was initialized to 1.5 Hz<sup>–1</sup> and increased to 2.0 Hz<sup>–1</sup>, and offset was initialized to –2.56 a.u. and increased to –1.41 a.u.; both linearly increasing between the 24 s and 36 s time stamps of the time series. Periodic activity in the alpha band (centre frequency = 8 Hz, amplitude = 1.2 a.u., and SD = 1.2 Hz) was generated between time stamps 8 s and 40 s, as well as between 41–46 s and 47–52 s. Periodic activity in the beta band (centre frequency = 18 Hz, amplitude = 0.9 a.u., and SD = 1.4 Hz) was generated between 15 and 25 s and down-chirped linearly from 18 to 15 Hz between 18 and 22 s. Peak amplitude was calculated as the relative height above the aperiodic component at every sampled frequency and time point. The SNR for peaks is reflected in their respective amplitudes, with peaks of lower amplitude exhibiting lower SNRs. All amplitudes of periodic activity were tapered by a Tukey kernel (cosine fraction = 0.4). Aperiodic and periodic parameters (and their dynamics) were combined to form a spectrogram of simulated activity.</p><p>All simulations (n=10,000) were unique as each was generated from a unique white-noise time series seed, and the cosine waves to simulate periodic components were each assigned a random initial phase.</p><p>Each simulated time series was analysed with SPRiNT using 5×1 s sliding time windows with 50% overlap (frequency range: 1–40 Hz).

Settings for peak post-processing were: number of neighbouring peaks: 3; centre frequency: 2.5 Hz; time bin: 6 bins (=3 s). Periodic alpha activity was identified using the highest amplitude peak parameterized in each time bin between 5.5 and 10.5 Hz, while periodic beta activity was identified using the highest amplitude peak in each time bin between 13.5 and 20.5 Hz.</p><p>We also parameterized Morlet wavelet spectrograms of each simulated time series using <italic>specparam</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>; MATLAB version).

Before parameterizing wavelet transforms, we applied a 4 s temporal smoothing filter (Gaussian kernel, SD = 1 s; time range: 3.5–56.5 s, in 0.005 s steps) to increase SNR (results prior to this step are shown for the first 1000 simulations in Supplemental materials).

Algorithmic performances were assessed by calculating MAE in parameter estimates across simulations and time points relative to expected parameters.

Within the 12–36 s time segment into the simulation (onset randomized), the aperiodic exponent and offset underwent a linear shift of magnitude in the ranges –0.5–0.5 Hz<sup>–1</sup> and –1–1 a.u.

Between zero and four oscillatory (rhythmic) components were added to each trial with parameters randomly sampled within the following ranges: centre frequency: 3–35 Hz; amplitude: 0.6–1.6 a.u.; SD: 1–2 Hz. The onset (5–40 s) and duration (3–20 s) of each of the rhythmic components were also randomized across components and across trials, with the constraint that they would not overlap both in time and frequency; they were allowed to overlap in either dimension. If a rhythmic component overlapped temporally with another one, its centre frequency was set at least 2.5 peak SDs from the other temporally overlapping rhythmic component(s).

The spectrogram outcome of SPRiNT was analysed to identify rhythmic components as correct (i.e., present in ground truth signal) or incorrect components. Rhythmic SPRiNT components were labelled as correct if their centre frequency was within 2.5 peak SDs from any of the ground truth rhythmic components. In the event of multiple SPRiNT rhythmic components meeting these conditions, we selected the one with the largest amplitude peak (marking the other as incorrect).</p><p>Errors on parameter estimates were assessed via MAE measures with respect to their ground truth values.

Animals were implanted with eight-shank multi-site silicon probes (200 µm inter-shank distance) spanning multiple layers of dorsocaudal medial entorhinal cortex (entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus, and hippocampus). Neurophysiological signals were recorded while animals traversed to alternating ends of an elevated linear track (250 × 7 cm) for 30 µL water reward (animals were water deprived for 24 hr prior to task). All surgical and behavioural procedures in the original study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Rutgers University (protocol No. 90–042). Recordings were acquired continuously at 20 kHz (RC Electronics) and bandpass-filtered (1 Hz-5 kHz) before being down-sampled to 1250 Hz. In two rats (EC012 and EC013), nine recording blocks of activity in entorhinal cortex layer 3 (EC3) were selected for further analysis (16 electrodes in EC012 and 8 electrodes in EC013). Electrodes in EC012 with consistent isolated signal artefacts were removed (average number of bad electrodes = 2; none in EC013). Movement-related artefacts (large transient changes in LFP across all electrodes, either positive or negative) were identified by visual inspection and data coinciding with these artefacts were later discarded from further analysis. Animal head position was extracted from video recordings (39.06 Hz) of two head-mounted LEDs and temporally interpolated to align with SPRiNT parameters across time (piecewise cubic Hermite interpolative polynomial; MATLAB’s <italic>pchip</italic>; 2020a; Natick, MA, USA).</p><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Spectrogram analysis</title><p>Each recording block was analysed with SPRiNT using 5×2 s sliding time windows with 75% overlap (frequency range: 2–40 Hz). The 1 Hz frequency bin was omitted from spectral analyses due to its partial attenuation by the bandpass filter applied to the data. Time windows of 2 s were used to increase frequency resolution, with an overlap ratio of 75% to preserve the temporal resolution of 0.5 s and to increase the temporal specificity of the spectrogram windows. Settings for <italic>specparam</italic> were set: peak width limits: (1.5 5); maximum number of peaks: 3; minimum peak amplitude: 0.5 a.u.; peak threshold: 2.0 SDs; proximity threshold: 2.0 SDs; aperiodic mode: fixed. Settings for peak post-processing were set as: number of neighbouring peaks: 3; centre frequency bounds: 2.5 Hz; time bin bounds: 6 bins (=3 s). Aperiodic parameters were averaged across electrodes and aligned with behavioural data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Tracking aperiodic dynamics during movement transitions</title><p>Time bins were categorized based on whether animals were resting at either end of the track or moving towards opposite ends of the track (‘rest’ or ‘movement’, respectively) using animal position (and speed). Rest-to-movement and movement-to-rest transitions were defined as at least four consecutive seconds of rest followed by four consecutive seconds of run (t=0 s representing the onset of movement) or vice versa (t=0 s representing the onset of rest), respectively.

components</title><p>A known issue of specparam is the fitting of spurious, outlier spectral peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>). With Spectral Parameterization Resolved in Time (SPRiNT), these peaks often appear as transient episodes of periodic activity in the spectrogram. We propose a post-processing option in SPRiNT to detect and remove fast, transient periodic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In short, the procedure searches for clusters of spectral peaks over a user-defined maximum time period (see Methods &quot;Pruning of periodic component outliers&quot;). Once an outlier peak is detected at a given time bin and removed from the model, aperiodic parameters are refit with specparam to account for the variance previously attributed to the spurious peak, and models are subsequently updated to reflect changes in parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-2"><title>Wavelet-specparam with alternative wavelet parameters (synthetic data challenge I)</title><p>In addition to the wavelet settings used in the main text, we parameterized Morlet wavelet spectrograms of the first 1000 simulated time series from challenge I using alternative full width at half maximum (FWHM) settings for the wavelet transforms.

This was done by extending previous work by embracing time-resolved parametrization of both simulated, noninvasive EEG and intracranial data. The new approach is termed Spectral Parametrization Resolved in Time (SPRiNT) and the paper shows that the slope of aperiodic activity is linked with both behavior and age. The method thus demonstrates the importance of evaluating the state-dependence of aperiodic activity and dynamic properties of oscillatory components in a time-resolved manner, and we believe that this approach would be of great interest to researchers analyzing human electrophysiological data to address clinical and cognitive neuroscience questions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77348.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>Ole</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03angcq70</institution-id><institution>University of Birmingham</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>van Es</surname><given-names>MWJ</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/052gg0110</institution-id><institution>Oxford University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Kujala</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05n3dz165</institution-id><institution>University of Jyväskylä</institution></institution-wrap><country>Finland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.01.21.477243">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.21.477243v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Floris de Lange as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mats W.J. van Es (Reviewer #2); Jan Kujala (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The three reviewers were in general positive about the manuscript. However, several concerns were raised. Several of those were related to the simulated data used for testing the algorithm. Also, the comparison to other methods could be improved. Please see below for details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>One aspect that can improve the impact of the paper is to show how the application of SPRiNT cardinally changes the interpretation of the data in the case when it was analyzed with rather conventional approaches. For instance, one can show that while using conventional methods, there are changes in the power, yet, when SPRiNT is applied these changes disappear or vice versa. It can be either dataset presented in this study or other datasets.</p><p>Please explain more carefully how the data was generated with respect to SNR of oscillations, how SNR was explicitly controlled.</p><p>The authors write: &quot;Each simulation was analyzed with SPRiNT using 5x1s STFT windows with 50% overlap (frequency range: 1-40 Hz).&quot; What would happen if the fluctuation of periodic and aperiodic components occur in &lt; 1-sec time range? This would correspond to a situation in real brain activity since E and I inputs are often transient in nature and can span just a few hundred milliseconds.</p><p>When differentiating eyes-open or eyes-closed condition, was this differentiation based on 5 mins data or on shorter segments, like a few seconds only? The latter case would be most interesting.</p><p>What are the smallest segments and number of overlapped segments for the estimation of periodic and aperiodic components? It seems that EEG and LFP data were analyzed with different parameters.</p><p>In contrast to EEG data, intracranial animal data was analyzed with different parameters for SPRiNT, i.e. each recording block was analyzed with SPRiNT using 5x2 s sliding time windows with 75% overlap. Why was it the case? For the reader, it is important to know how these decisions are made about the length of the window and overlap.</p><p>When tracking movement transitions it is important to take into account movement-related artifacts which can introduce changes in a wide frequency range. How were they handled?</p><p>The authors write: &quot;We noted that both methods tended to overestimate peak bandwidths (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1)&quot; It seems that there is a systematic bias in peak bandwidth estimation. Is there a way to compensate for it?</p><p>It is possible that the changes between young and old participants (or in eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions) were due to relatively local changes in low-frequency oscillations which would consequently lead to deviation from 1/f decay of spectrum. This in turn would lead to changes in goodness-of-fit (GOF) of 1/f component between conditions. Have authors observed systematic changes in GOFs between different conditions?</p><p>Please discuss cases where the aperiodic part can be stable vs when it can be unstable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In the first analysis, the authors compare SPRiNT with specparam applied to a wavelet time-frequency spectrum. Given that the original method by Donoghue et al., is based on Welch's method (which uses the Discrete Fourier Transform; DFT), it is unclear why the authors chose wavelets as a benchmark. A more direct comparison with Donoghue et al., would be comparing the time-resolved with the static specparam approach, without the implicit comparison of STFT with wavelets. Could the authors please motivate their choice of benchmark? (potentially the analysis described in lines 36-46 of the supplement could be moved/referred to in the main text).</p><p>2. One issue when applying SPRiNT to task data is that it temporally smooths a/periodic parameter estimates (i.e. by averaging Fourier coefficients over neighbouring windows), which can lead to blurring of baseline and task windows (especially in a typical task where baseline and task period are only a few seconds). Could the authors elaborate on how to choose parameter settings (e.g., number of overlapping time windows; whether or not to fit a knee) and what pitfalls to look out for?</p><p>3. Line 194 refers to a supplemental figure (the figure 2 equivalent prior to removal of outlier peaks). Line 21 of the supplement also refers to this figure. However, the figure appears to be absent.</p><p>4. Figure 3D shows there is a general underestimation of the number of periodic components, especially in the δ band. Perhaps it would be useful to add a figure to the supplement containing a confusion matrix, i.e. showing how likely each simulated peak is to be recognised as a peak in a different frequency band (or not recognised) over all simulations.</p><p>5. Figure 3C shows the detection probability of spectral peaks with respect to centre frequency and peak amplitude. Could to authors create a similar figure for bandwidth, or at least comment on this?</p><p>6. Alternatives to the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) are discussed in both the introduction and discussion but do not mention Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD; Huang et al., 1998; Quinn et al., 2021).</p><p>7. Recently, another adaptation of specparam, called PAPTO, was described by Brady and Bardouille (2022; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.118974), specifically regarding transient oscillations. It would be good if the authors could add this in their discussion, especially in light of pruning the periodic component outliers.</p><p>8. A few observations from the Results are missing in the discussion. I would like to ask the authors to add a discussion on (1) the overestimation of peak bandwidth by SPRiNT, (2) the underestimation of the number of detected peaks in figure 3, and (3) the peaks in the aperiodic component and offset at moments of switching eyes open/closed in figure 4 – supplement 1 (also related to point 2).</p><p>9. From lines 245-248 it does not become clear from the main text that the authors conducted a logistic regression analysis; this only becomes clear from the subtext of figure 4B. Please add it to the main text.</p><p>10. It seems that tables 5 and 6 are mixed up in the main text (line 304, 309), e.g. line 304 is referring to table 5 but should be referring to table 6.</p><p>11. There appears to be a grammatical error in lines 416-418 (&quot;…has associated how locomotor behavior is associated…&quot;).</p><p>12. Figure 3D would be clearer with a legend. Also, the subtext talks about &quot;blue&quot; for 3-8 Hz peaks but is ambiguous because (dark) blue also denotes an undetected peak. Please clarify in the text.</p><p>13. The reference to figure 3E in the subtext should be in bold font.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77348.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>One aspect that can improve the impact of the paper is to show how the application of SPRiNT cardinally changes the interpretation of the data in the case when it was analyzed with rather conventional approaches.

It can be either dataset presented in this study or other datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion and agree with the significance of the proposed experiment.</p><p>We have therefore re-analyzed the LEMON dataset to provide new results obtained from the periodogram decompositions of the EEG data using specparam, in the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. Our goal was to evaluate whether static periodogram parameters from specparam would show effects compatible with those observed with the spectrogram parametrization derived from SPRiNT. When averaged across time, the SPRiNT α-peak amplitude in the eyes-closed condition was not predictive of age group, contrarily to the specparam α-peak amplitude in the same condition (Figure 4b). Additionally, specparam α centre frequency in the eyes-open condition was predictive of age, while SPRiNT found that the variability (but not the mean) of eyes-open α centre frequency was predictive of age, instead.</p><p>The results relating to α-peak amplitude from specparam are consistent with age-related differences reported by Donoghue et al., (2020) in the seminal specparam publication. Indeed, the detection of low-amplitude peaks is more challenging in spectrograms than in periodograms because of lesser signal averaging yielding lower signal-to-noise ratios. Further, we observed in a fraction (&lt;10%) of LEMON participants substantial disparities between the respective estimates of eyes-closed α-peak amplitude from SPRiNT and specparam. In these participants, the spectrograms show that the presence of an α peak was sporadic (see an illustrative case in Figure 4c: the α peak is visible only during 40% of the eyes-closed condition). The fluctuations in peak presence/absence over the duration of the recording cannot be detected via a periodogram and specparam. We can therefore conclude that in this situation, α-peak amplitude in the eyes-closed condition reported by specparam may be confounded in small part by the pronounced temporal variability of the data in a subset of participants (Donoghue et al., 2021). This Discussed point is now added to the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Using specparam, we found lower α-band peak amplitudes in older individuals in the eyes-closed condition. We could not replicate this effect from spectrograms parametrized with SPRiNT (Figure 4b). This apparent divergence may be due to the challenge of detecting low-amplitude peaks in the spectrogram of older individuals. Periodograms are derived from averaging across time windows, which augments signal-to-noise ratios, and therefore the sensitivity of specparam to periodic components of lower amplitude. In a subset of participants (&lt;10%), we also observed considerable differences between the α peak amplitudes extracted from specparam and SPRiNT, which we explained by unstable expressions of α activity over time in these participants (Figure 4C). The average α peak amplitude estimated with SPRiNT is based only on time segments when an α-band periodic component is detected. With specparam, this estimate is derived across all time windows, regardless of the presence/absence of a bona fide α component at certain time instances. The consequence is that the estimate of the average α peak amplitude is larger with SPRiNT than with specparam in these participants. Therefore, differences in α power between SPRiNT and specparam may be explained, at least in some participants, by differential temporal fluctuations of α band activity (Donoghue et al., 2021). This effect is reminiscent of recent observations that β-band power suppression during motor execution is due to sparser bursting activity, not to a sustained decrease of β-band activity (Sherman et al., 2016).” (Lines 521 to 538)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please explain more carefully how the data was generated with respect to SNR of oscillations, how SNR was explicitly controlled.</p></disp-quote><p>Since our analyses focus on spectral components, we define signal-to-noise ratio for the spectrum. We defined the spectral signal-to-noise ratio in log-space (log-SNR) as the amplitude of the simulated peak component in the log-transformed periodogram divided by the standard deviation of the intrinsic spectral noise (i.e., variance unaccounted for by periodic and aperiodic components). We used 1-s time windows in all simulations, with periodograms derived from averaging Fourier coefficients over 5 overlapping windows, therefore the standard deviation of spectral noise was fixed across simulations (standard deviation = 0.2 a.u.). Hence, the log-SNR of oscillations in our simulations is equal to the simulated peak amplitude divided by 0.2 a.u. To illustrate this aspect, we provide two example spectra derived from SPRiNT (5x1-s windows with 50% overlap) with oscillatory peaks in the α band as well as their simulated peak amplitudes and derived SNRs.

Please also note that as the number of averaged windows increases (i.e., as signal duration increases), spectral noise decreases (assuming the signal is stationary) which increases log-SNR (not shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors write: &quot;Each simulation was analyzed with SPRiNT using 5x1s STFT windows with 50% overlap (frequency range: 1-40 Hz).” What would happen if the fluctuation of periodic and aperiodic components occur in &lt; 1-sec time range?

The settings used in the experiments reported (two overlapping time windows per second) would not be optimal to track phenomena at sub-second timescales. We would therefore recommend specific parameter settings to achieve higher temporal resolution: averaging Fourier coefficients over five one-second windows with 75% overlap, for instance, would provide four samples per second but with reduced spectral SNR (Figure 2 —figure supplement 3). Following the Reviewer’s suggestions (comments 3 and 5), as well as suggestion from Reviewer 2 (comments 2 and 4), we now provide practical recommendations for tuning SPRiNT parameters depending on the neuroscience question and study objectives in the revised manuscript. We also encourage the reader to consult the recommendations for <italic>specparam</italic> settings issued by Ostlund et al., (2021) and Gerster et al., (2022).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When differentiating eyes-open or eyes-closed condition, was this differentiation based on 5 mins data or on shorter segments, like a few seconds only?

We also observed sporadic changes of α activity in a subset of participants (Figure 4c). Although we sample the spectrum at sub-second resolution, we derive measures of mean and dispersion by sampling over the entire time series. The minimum recording length required for stability in measures of mean and dispersion across spectral parameters is a relevant question, but we believe that it falls outside the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What are the smallest segments and number of overlapped segments for the estimation of periodic and aperiodic components?

Accordingly, we chose to increase the frequency resolution by doubling the window length to include more samples from low frequencies and better resolve the shape of the low-frequency power spectrum. To maintain a 0.5-s temporal sampling rate of the SPRiNT model, we increased the overlap ratio parameter to 75%.</p><p>As mentioned in the response to this Reviewer’s point #3 above, we now provide practical recommendations for parameter setting in the revised Discussion section. In Methods, we now explain how the SPRiNT parameters were set to analyze the intracranial data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When tracking movement transitions it is important to take into account movement-related artifacts which can introduce changes in a wide frequency range. How were they handled?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing at possible sources of artifacts in the data that would bias result interpretation.</p><p>Originally, we removed one electrode from EC012 due to poor signal quality. However, pursuant to this Reviewer’s comment, we returned to the data to identify possible remaining movement-related artifacts. As a result, we visually identified and removed electrodes with isolated movement artifacts (only observed in EC012, mean = 2 channels removed), as well as artifacts contaminating all electrodes over &lt;5% of all time points across both subjects. We have updated the results reported accordingly. Although all reported effects remain unaltered, we regret not noticing and removing these artifacts initially. We have edited the Methods section to detail the procedures applied for artifact detection and removal:</p><p>“Electrodes in EC012 with consistent isolated signal artifacts were removed (average number of bad electrodes = 2; none in EC013). Movement-related artifacts (large transient changes in local field potential across all electrodes, either positive or negative) were identified by visual inspection and data coinciding with these artifacts were later discarded from further analysis.” (Lines 897 to 901)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors write: &quot;We noted that both methods tended to overestimate peak bandwidths (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1)&quot; It seems that there is a systematic bias in peak bandwidth estimation. Is there a way to compensate for it?</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is correct in stating that “there is a systematic bias in peak bandwidth estimation”.</p><p>This bias is related to the balance of time and frequency resolution inherent to SPRiNT, as well as its consequences on spectral SNR. Donoghue et al., (2020) showed that peak bandwidth estimation error is low when spectral noise is negligible, as is more common for static periodograms (see Figure 3C of Donoghue et al., 2020). Resolving spectral power estimates in time introduces additional noise to the spectrum, which challenges the estimation of spectral parameters (especially peak bandwidth, as we have observed).</p><p>We have pasted the relevant portions of the revised manuscript discussing this limitation below:</p><p>“The algorithm tends to overestimate the bandwidth of spectral peaks, which we discuss as related to the frequency resolution of the spectrogram (mostly 1 Hz in the present study). The frequency resolution of the spectrogram at 1Hz, for example, may be too low to quantify narrower band-limited components. The intrinsic noise level present in short-time Fourier transforms (i.e., spectral power not explained by periodic or aperiodic components) may also challenge bandwidth estimation. Increasing STFT window length augments spectral resolution and reduces intrinsic noise, although to the detriment of temporal specificity.” (Lines 467 to 474)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is possible that the changes between young and old participants (or in eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions) were due to relatively local changes in low-frequency oscillations which would consequently lead to deviation from 1/f decay of spectrum.

Have authors observed systematic changes in GOFs between different conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s insight and suggestion on the interpretation of this aspect of the reported data.</p><p>We found that SPRiNT average model fit errors were significantly different between conditions (p = 0.002; two-sample t-test), but not between age groups. However, including model fit error in as a predictor in our logistic regression model for predicting condition did not change the interpretation of previous results. We have now added a table (Table 3) and section to the revised Supplemental Materials to report and detail these findings, provided below:</p><p>“We performed t-tests of model fit errors (MAE) between conditions and age groups. While there were no age-related effects on model fit error (eyes-open: p = 0.09; eyes closed: p = 0.69), we observed slightly lower model fit errors in the eyes-open condition (mean = 0.032) compared to the eyes-closed condition (mean = 0.033; t(354) = 3.17, p = 0.002, 95% CI [3.0x10-4 1.3x10-3]). The size of this effect was small-to-medium (Cohen’s d = 0.34).</p><p>To determine whether model fit error would affect our SPRiNT logistic regression model for condition, we included it as a fixed effect in a new logistic regression model (Table 3). Here, we observed the same effects for predicting condition as the original model (mean aperiodic exponent, mean α power, variability of α power; see Table 2), with no significant effect of model fit error (p = 0.45).” (Lines 1338 to 1347)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please discuss cases where the aperiodic part can be stable vs when it can be unstable.</p></disp-quote><p>We foresee that new time-resolved methods such as SPRiNT will enable measures of how aperiodic spectrogram parameters evolve over time with behaviour, as illustrated with some of the data in the manuscript where we observe changes in mean aperiodic exponent associated with locomotive behaviour (Figure 5). Aperiodic activity could also exhibit changes in its variability without changing its average shape, though we did not observe this effect in the present study. We have revised the Discussion section by elaborating on a possible scenario (e.g., temporal instability of the excitation/inhibition ratio) where one might expect to observe increased variability in aperiodic parameters, as pasted below:</p><p>“Gao et al., (2017) established a link between aperiodic exponent and the local balance of neural excitation vs. inhibition.

Most of the results presented here were obtained with similar SPRiNT parameter settings. Below are practical recommendations for SPRiNT parameter settings, in mirror and complement of those provided by Ostlund et al., (2022) and Gerster et al., (2022) for specparam:</p><p>Window length determines the frequency and temporal resolution of the spectrogram. This parameter needs to be adjusted to the expected timescale of the effects under study so that multiple overlapping SPRiNT time windows (with overlap) cover the expected duration of the effect of interest; see for instance, the 2-s time windows with 75% overlap designed to detect the effect at the timescale characterized in Figure 5.</p><p>Window overlap ratio is a companion parameter of window length that also determines the temporal resolution of the spectrogram. While a greater overlap ratio increases the rate of temporal sampling, it also increases the redundancy of the data information collected within each time window and therefore smooths the spectrogram estimates over the time dimension. A general recommendation is that longer time windows (&gt;2 s) enable larger overlap ratios (&gt;75%). We recommend a default setting of 50% as a baseline for data exploration.</p><p>Number of windows averaged in each time bin enables to control the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the spectrogram estimates (higher SNR with more windows averaged), with the companion effect of increasing the temporal smoothing (i.e., decreased temporal resolution) of the spectrogram. We recommend a baseline setting of 5 windows.</p><p>Learning from the specparam experience, we expect that more practical (and critical) recommendations will emerge and be shared by more users adopting SPRiNT, with the pivotal expectation, as with all analytical methods in neuroscience (Salmelin and Baillet, 2009), that users carefully and critically review the sensibility of the outcome of SPRiNT parameterization applied to their own data and to their own neuroscience questions (Ostlund et al., 2022).” Lines (570 to 598)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Line 194 refers to a supplemental figure (the figure 2 equivalent prior to removal of outlier peaks). Line 21 of the supplement also refers to this figure. However, the figure appears to be absent.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching this mistake: the figure was indeed erroneously omitted from the original manuscript. The figure is now included as Figure 2 —figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 3D shows there is a general underestimation of the number of periodic components, especially in the δ band. Perhaps it would be useful to add a figure to the supplement containing a confusion matrix, i.e. showing how likely each simulated peak is to be recognised as a peak in a different frequency band (or not recognised) over all simulations.</p></disp-quote><p>The suggestion from the Reviewer is very appreciated.</p><p>We have produced a confusion matrix for the revised manuscript, which is now displayed in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1b.</p><p>Please note that, as we aimed to associate detected peak components with the original periodic components of the synthetized data, the estimated peaks could not be located more than 2.5 peak standard deviations from the simulated centre frequency, which explains why, for instance, no 3-8 Hz peaks were recovered in the 18-35 Hz range.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 3C shows the detection probability of spectral peaks with respect to centre frequency and peak amplitude. Could to authors create a similar figure for bandwidth, or at least comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.</p><p>We have produced and added the proposed figure as Figure 2 —figure supplement 1a in the revised manuscript. We also discuss that the probability of peak detection does not depend on the bandwidth of the periodic component on line 236, pasted below:</p><p>“However, the detection rate did not depend on peak bandwidth (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1a).” (Line 235)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Alternatives to the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) are discussed in both the introduction and discussion but do not mention Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD; Huang et al., 1998; Quinn et al., 2021).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.</p><p>We now mention EMD in the Introduction; please see lines 53 to 57, pasted below:</p><p>“Current methods for measuring the time-varying properties of neural fluctuations include several time-frequency decomposition techniques such as Hilbert, wavelet, and short-time Fourier signal transforms (Bruns, 2004; Cohen, 2014), and more recently, empirical mode decompositions (EMD; Huang et al., 1998) and time-delay embedded hidden Markov models (TDE-HMM; Quinn et al., 2018).” (Lines 53 to 57)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Recently, another adaptation of specparam, called PAPTO, was described by Brady and Bardouille (2022; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.118974), specifically regarding transient oscillations. It would be good if the authors could add this in their discussion, especially in light of pruning the periodic component outliers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for mentioning this recent published work.</p><p>We agree that PAPTO is a relevant approach for detecting transient oscillatory activity (and aperiodic compensation) in the field.</p><p>We now discuss the relevance of PAPTO and another methodologically similar approach (fBOSC; Seymour et al., 2022) in the revised Discussion:</p><p>“Scientific interest towards aperiodic neurophysiological activity has recently intensified, especially in the context of methodological developments for the detection of transient oscillatory activity in electrophysiology (Brady and Bardouille, 2022; Seymour et al., 2022). These methods first remove the aperiodic component from power spectra using specparam, before detecting oscillatory bursts from wavelet spectrograms. SPRiNT’s outlier peak removal procedure also detects burst-like spectrographic components, although for a different purpose. SPRiNT is one methodological response for measuring and correcting for aperiodic spectral components and as such, could contribute to improve tools for detecting oscillatory bursts, as suggested by Seymour et al., (2022).” (Lines 616 to 624)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. A few observations from the Results are missing in the discussion. I would like to ask the authors to add a discussion on (1) the overestimation of peak bandwidth by SPRiNT, (2) the underestimation of the number of detected peaks in figure 3, and (3) the peaks in the aperiodic component and offset at moments of switching eyes open/closed in figure 4 – supplement 1 (also related to point 2).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing at these gaps in the Discussion.</p><p>We have revised the Discussion accordingly (with the third point being more methodological), addressing all the points raised by this Reviewer. Please see the following sections of the manuscript, pasted below:</p><p>“The algorithm tends to overestimate the bandwidth of spectral peaks, which we discuss as related to the frequency resolution of the spectrogram (mostly 1 Hz in the present study). The frequency resolution of the spectrogram at 1Hz, for example, may be too low to quantify narrower band-limited components. The intrinsic noise level present in short-time Fourier transforms (i.e., spectral power not explained by periodic or aperiodic components) may also challenge bandwidth estimation. Increasing STFT window length augments spectral resolution and reduces intrinsic noise, although to the detriment of temporal specificity.” (Lines 467 to 474)</p><p>“We also found that SPRiNT may underestimate the number of periodic components, though this can be interpreted as the joint probability of SPRiNT detecting multiple independent oscillatory peaks (where the probability of detecting a given peak is between 65-75%; approximating a binomial distribution).” (Lines 474 to 474)</p><p>“We observed sharp changes in aperiodic exponent and offset at the transitions between eyes-open and eyes-closed (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1), which are likely to be artifactual residuals of eye movements. We discarded these segments from further analysis.” (Lines 296 to 298)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.
