In this study, we developed a high-throughput CDKN2A functional assay and characterized all possible human <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants. We found that 17.7% of all missense variants were functionally deleterious. We also used our functional classifications to assess the performance of in silico models that predict the effect of variants, including recently reported models based on machine learning. Notably, we found that all in silico models performed similarly when compared to our functional classifications with accuracies of 39.5–85.4%. Furthermore, while we found that functionally deleterious variants were enriched within ankyrin repeats, we did not identify any residues where all missense variants were functionally deleterious. Our functional classifications are a resource to aid the interpretation of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> variants and have important implications for the application of variant interpretation guidelines, particularly the use of in silico models for clinical variant interpretation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>missense</kwd><kwd>functional</kwd><kwd>assay</kwd><kwd>variants</kwd><kwd>predictors</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50CA62924</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>Nicholas Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Susan Wojcicki and Dennis Troper</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>Nicholas Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Sol Goldman Pancreatic Cancer Research Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>Nicholas Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017989</institution-id><institution>Rolfe Pancreatic Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>Nicholas Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Japanese Society of Gastroenterology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Support for Young Gastroenterologists Studying in the United States</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kimura</surname><given-names>Hirokazu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Overseas Research Fellowships</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kimura</surname><given-names>Hirokazu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High-throughput characterization of all possible CDKN2A missense variants identifies functionally deleterious variants and establishes accuracy of variant effect predictors.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genetic testing of patients with cancer to identify variants associated with an increased cancer risk and sensitivity to targeted therapies is becoming more common as broad testing criteria are integrated into clinical care guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goggins et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stoffel et al., 2019</xref>). The American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) provides a framework to integrate multiple types of evidence, including variant characteristics, disease epidemiology, clinical information, and functional classifications, to interpret variants in any gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Richards et al., 2015</xref>). In silico variant effect predictors are also integrated into ACMG variant interpretation guidelines as supporting evidence to aid classification of variants. While numerous models have been developed, varied accuracy, poor agreement between models, and inflated performance on publicly available data have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cubuk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaffe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilcox et al., 2022</xref>). Recently developed variant effect predictors aim to overcome these limitations by incorporating deep-learning-based protein structure predictions and by not training on human annotated datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brandes et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2023</xref>). However, post-development assessment of machine learning-based variant effect predictors, to determine accuracy on novel experimental datasets and suitability for clinical use, are limited.</p><p>Variants that cannot be classified as either pathogenic or benign are categorized as variants of uncertain significance (VUSs). However, while pathogenic and benign variants identified during genetic testing are clinically actionable, VUSs are the cause of deep uncertainty for patients and their health care providers as an unknown fraction are functionally deleterious and, therefore, likely pathogenic. For example, individuals with germline VUSs in a pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene are not be eligible for clinical surveillance programs that are associated with improved patient outcomes, unless they otherwise meet family history criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goggins et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stoffel et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, patients with breast or pancreatic cancer and a germline <italic>BRCA2</italic> VUS would not be eligible for treatment with olaparib, a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Golan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tutt et al., 2021</xref>). Reclassification of VUSs into pathogenic or benign strata has real-world, life-or-death consequences that necessitate a high degree of accuracy.</p><p>Germline VUSs in hereditary cancer genes are a common finding in patients with cancer and frequently can be reclassified as pathogenic on the basis of in vitro functional evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kimura et al., 2022</xref>). In patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), germline <italic>CDKN2A</italic> VUSs affecting p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, most often rare missense variants, are found in up to 4.3% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaffee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kimura et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McWilliams et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roberts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shindo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhen et al., 2015</xref>). As functional data from well-validated in vitro assays are incorporated into ACMG variant interpretation guidelines, we recently determined the functional consequence of 29 <italic>CDKN2A</italic> VUSs identified in patients with PDAC using an in vitro cell proliferation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kimura et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Richards et al., 2015</xref>). We found that over 40% of VUSs assayed were functionally deleterious and could reclassified as likely pathogenic.</p><p>Functional characterization, however, is time-consuming, expensive, and requires technical and scientific expertise. These limitations hinder assessment of in silico variant effect predictors and patient access to functional data that may allow reclassification of VUSs into clinically actionable strata. As <italic>CDKN2A</italic> VUSs will continue to be identified in patients with cancer undergoing genetic testing, we developed a high-throughput functional assay to provide a broad interpretation framework for <italic>CDKN2A</italic> variants. We characterized all possible <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants and compared our functional classifications to recently developed in silico models based on machine learning to determine the accuracy of variant effect predictions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Functional characterization of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants</title><p>We utilized a codon-optimized <italic>CDKN2A</italic> sequence for our multiplexed functional assay. Expression of codon-optimized CDKN2A or the synonymous CDKN2A variants, p.L32L, p.G101G, and p.V126V, in PANC-1, a PDAC cell line with a homozygous deletion of <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, resulted in significant reduction in cell proliferation (p-value&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). There was no significant difference between codon-optimized CDKN2A and the three synonymous variants assayed. Conversely, expression of three pathogenic variants, p.L32P, p.G101W, and p.V126D, in PANC-1 cells did not result in any significant changes in cell proliferation. To determine if there were unappreciated selective effects during in vitro culture, we generated a CellTag library based on the pLJM1 plasmid that contained 20 nonfunctional 9 base pair barcodes of equal representation. We then transduced PANC-1 cells that stably expressed codon-optimized CDKN2A with the CellTag library (day 0) and determined representation of each barcode in the cell pool on day 9 and at confluency (day 45). We found no statistically significant changes in barcode representation, indicating that representation of a pool of functionally neutral variants is stable over a period of in vitro culture representing our assay time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>We next determined whether we could identify functionally deleterious <italic>CDKN2A</italic> variants at a single residue when all amino acid variants were assayed simultaneously. We generated lentiviral expression plasmid libraries for all 156 CDKN2A amino acid residues, where each library contained all possible amino acids at a single residue. Twenty-seven variants (27 of 3120, 0.87%) were represented in the plasmid libraries at ≤1%. Expression plasmids for each of these 27 variants were individually generated by site-directed mutagenesis and added to the corresponding plasmid library to a calculated representation of 5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Plasmid libraries were then individually amplified, and lentivirus produced. To confirm that the representation of each variant was maintained after transduction, we transduced three lentiviral libraries (amino acid residues p.R24, p.H66, and p.A127) individually into PANC-1 cells and determined the proportion of each variant in the amplified plasmid library and in the cell pool at day 9 post-transduction. The proportion of each variant in the amplified plasmid library and in the cell pool at day 9 were highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>For two CDKN2A amino acid residues that include pathogenic and benign variants, p.V126 and p.R144, we determined the representation of each variant in the transduced cell pool at day 9 and at confluency after a period of in vitro culture, day 23 and day 31 post-transfection, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Two synonymous variants, p.V126V and p.R144R, as well as a previously reported benign variant, p.R144C, either decreased or maintained their representation in the cell pool during in vitro culture as determined by the number of sequence reads supporting the variant. Representation of a previously reported pathogenic variant, p.V126D, increased in the cell pool. Notably, several other variants including p.V126R, p.V126W, p.V126K, and p.V126Y, also increased in representation in the cell pool, suggesting that additional amino acid changes at this residue are functionally deleterious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pooled analysis of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> variants at two residues with previously reported pathogenic and benign variants.</title><p>PANC-1 cell stably expressing 1 of 20 <italic>CDKN2A</italic> variants, 19 missense variants, and 1 synonymous variant, at residue p.V126 or p.R144 were cultured.

Variant read counts were then analyzed using a gamma generalized linear model (GLM), that does not rely on annotation of pathogenic and benign variants to set classification thresholds, and variants with statistically significant p-values were classified as functionally deleterious (log<sub>2</sub> p-values≤–53.2). Variants with p-values that did not reach statistical significance were classified as either of indeterminate function (log<sub>2</sub> p-values&gt;–53.2 and &lt;–5.8) or functionally neutral (log<sub>2</sub> p-values≥–5.8).</p><p>We found that 525 of 2964 missense variants (17.7%) were functionally deleterious in our assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

ACMG variant interpretation guidelines incorporate functional data, as well as other evidence such as in silico predictions of variant effect, to aid classification of variants as either pathogenic or benign. <italic>CDKN2A</italic> VUSs are a frequent finding in patients with PDAC. We previously found that over 40% of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> VUSs identified in patients with PDAC were functionally deleterious and therefore could be reclassified as likely pathogenic. In this study, we developed, a high-throughput, in vitro assay and functionally characterized 2964 <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants, representing all possible single amino acid variants. We found that 525 missense variants (17.7%) were functionally deleterious. These predefined functional characterizations are resource for the scientific community and can be integrated into variant interpretation schema to aid classification of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> germline variants and somatic mutations.</p><p>We classified <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants using a gamma GLM as either functionally deleterious, indeterminate functional, or functionally neutral. However, we did not classify variants that may have gain-of-function effects, resulting in decreased representation in the cell pool. Future studies are necessary to determine the prevalence and significance of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> gain-of-function variants.</p><p>Importantly, variant classifications using a gamma GLM were not biased by assay outputs for previously reported – benchmark – pathogenic or begin variants to determine thresholds. Classification thresholds were determined using the change in representation of 20 nonfunctional barcodes in a pool of PANC-1 cells stably expressing CDKN2A after a period of in vitro proliferation. Even so, <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variant classifications were remarkably similar using a gamma GLM or normalized fold change with thresholds determined using benchmark pathogenic and begin variants. Of missense variants classified as functionally deleterious using a gamma GLM, 98.5% were similarly classified using normalized fold change.</p><p>We repeated our functional assay twice for 28 CDKN2A residues. For the remaining 128 residues of CDKN2A, the functional assay was completed once. While we found general agreement between functional classifications from each replicate for the 28 residues assayed in duplicate, additional repeats for each residue are necessary to determine variability in variant functional classifications.</p><p>Our characterization of all possible <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants allowed us to assess the ability of in silico algorithms – including recently published predictors based on machine learning AlphaMissense, ESM1b, and PrimateAI-3D – to predict the pathogenicity or functional effect of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants. We found that all in silico variant effect predictors assessed performed similarly. Highest accuracy was observed with PrimateAI-3D at 85.4%, followed by VEST at 71.9% and AlphaMissense at 71.6%. Importantly, even in silico predictors performing best in one metric may perform poorly in others. For example, PrimateAI-3D had the highest specificity (0.98) and positive predictive values (0.68), but the lowest sensitivity (0.25) and negative predictive value (0.87). Given that reclassification of VUSs in hereditary cancer genes into inappropriate strata has significant implications for patients, use of in silico models for clinical variant interpretation, including those utilizing machine learning, may be premature. Ultimately, our data support current ACMG guidelines that include in silico predictions of variant effect as supporting evidence of pathogenicity or benign impact.</p><p>Our study also provides other insights for the implementation of variant interpretation guidelines. ACMG guidelines include presence of a missense variant at a residue with a previously reported pathogenic variant as moderate evidence of pathogenicity. We found that functionally deleterious missense variants were not evenly distributed across <italic>CDKN2A</italic>. We found enrichment of functionally deleterious missense variants in ankyrin repeats 1–3 and depletion in ankyrin repeat 4. Notably, no CDKN2A residue was completely intolerant of amino acid changes. Suggesting, at least for <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, that the presence of a pathogenic missense variant at a residue should be used with caution when classifying other missense variants at the same residue.</p><p>We characterized variants based upon a broad cellular phenotype, cell proliferation, in a single PDAC cell line. It is possible that <italic>CDKN2A</italic> variant functional classifications are cell-specific and assay-specific. Our assay may not encompass all cellular functions of CDKN2A and an alternative assay of a specific CDKN2A function, such as CDK4 binding, may result in different variant functional classifications. Furthermore, <italic>CDKN2A</italic> variants may have different effects if alternative cell lines are used for the functional assay. However, cell-specific effects appear to be limited. In our previous study, we characterized 29 <italic>CDKN2A</italic> VUSs in three PDAC cell lines, using cell proliferation and cell cycle assays, and found agreement between all functional classifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kimura et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>This study supports the utility of our in vitro functional assay. In general, we found that benchmark pathogenic variants, benchmark benign variants, and VUSs previously reported to be functionally deleterious had congruent functional classifications in our assay. Moreover, we found that functionally deleterious effects were enriched among somatic missense mutations, and depleted in missense VUSs in gnomAD, compared to all <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants. Importantly, our functionally assay provides evidence to reclassify 301 of 395 (76.2%) missense VUSs reported in ClinVar and 208 of 264 (78.8%) missense VUSs reported in gnomAD. These include 45 (11.4%) VUSs in ClinVar and 31 missense VUSs in gnomAD that could be reclassified as likely pathogenic variants.</p><p>In this study, we determined functional classifications for all possible <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants. Comparison of our functional classifications to in silico variant effect predictors, including recently described algorithms based on machine learning, provides performance benchmarks and supports

The results are also compared to in silico variant predictors currently utilized by the current diagnostic frameworks to gauge these predictors' performance. The authors also functionally classify CDKN2A somatic mutations in cancers across different tissues.</p><p>Review:</p><p>The goal of this paper was to perform functional classification of missense mutations in CDKN2A in order to generate a resource to aid in clinical interpretation of CDKN2A genetic variants identified in clinical sequencing. In our initial review, we concluded that this paper was difficult to review because there was a lack of primary data and experimental detail. The authors have significantly improved the clarity, methodological detail and data exposition in this revision, facilitating a fuller scientific review. Based on the data provided we do not think the functional characterization of CDKN2A variants is robust or complete enough to meet the stated goal of aiding clinical variant interpretation. We think the underlying assay could be used for this purpose but different experimental design choices and more replication would be required for these data to be useful. Alternatively, the authors could also focus on novel CDKN2A variants as there seems to be potential gain of function mutations that are simply lumped into &quot;neutral&quot; that may have important biological implications.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>Low experimental concordance. The p-value scatter plot (Figure 2 Figure Supplement 3A) across 560 variants shows low collinearity indicating poor replicability. These data should be shown in log2fold changes, but even after model fitting with the gamma GLM still show low concordance which casts strong doubt on the function scores.</p></disp-quote><p>Concordance among non-significant p-values is generally low because most of the signal comes from random variability across repeats. If the observed log2 fold change between the repeats is entirely due to noise, one would expect two repeated p-values to behave like independent random uniforms. True concordance is typically more evident in significant p-values because they reflect consistent effects above random noise. Functionally deleterious variants are called when their associated p-value is significant. To confirm this statement, a scatter plot with the log2 normalized fold change was added in Figure 2 Supplement 3C. We see low concordance between repeats in the log2 normalized fold changes centered around 0, corresponding to log log2 normalized changes mainly due to noise. The concordance increases as the variants become significant. One can notice that the correlation coefficient between duplicate assay results was almost identical between the model-based p-values and log2normalized fold change (Figure 2-figure supplement 3A and 3C, Appendix 1-table 4, and Appendix 1-table 6). Also, importantly, no variant was functionally deleterious in one replicate and functionally neutral in another, implying a perfect concordance in calls if we exclude variants that were called indeterminate in one of the two repeats. Finally, of variants with discordant classifications, only 6/560 repeats (1.1%) were functionally deleterious (significant p-value) in one replicate and of indeterminate function in another. We have updated the text as follows:</p><p>“Of variants with discordant classifications, 6 (1.1%) were functionally deleterious in one replicate and of indeterminate function in another. While 102 variants (18.2%) were functionally neutral in one replicate and of indeterminate function in another. Importantly, no variant that was functionally deleterious in one replicate and functionally neutral in another (Appendix 1 -table 4). Furthermore, the correlation coefficient between duplicate assay results was similar using the gamma GLM and log2 normalized fold change (Figure 2-figure supplement 3A and 3C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The more detailed methods provided indicate that the growth suppression experiment is done in 156 pools with each pool consisting of the 20 variants corresponding to one of the 156 aa positions in CKDN2A. There are several serious problems with this design.</p><p>Batch effects in each of the pools preventing comparison across different residues. We think this is a serious design flaw and not standard for how these deep mutational scans are done. The standard would be to combine all 156 pools in a single experiment. Given the sequencing strategy of dividing up CDKN2A into 3 segments, the 156 pools could easily have been collapsed into 3 (1 to 53, 54 to 110, 111 to 156). This would significantly minimize variation in handling between variants at each residue and would be more manageable for performance of further replicates of the screen for reproducibility purposes. The huge variation in confluency time 16-40 days for each pool suggest that this batch effect is a strong source of variation in the experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>While there is variation in time to confluency between different amino acid residues, we do not anticipate this batch effect to significantly affect variant classifications in our study. For example, our results were generally consistent with previous classifications. All synonymous variants (one per residue) and benchmark benign variants assayed were classified as functionally neutral. Furthermore, of benchmark pathogenic variants assayed, none were classified as functionally neutral. 84% were classified as functionally deleterious and 16 percent were classified as indeterminate function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lack of experimental/biological replication: The functional assay was only performed once on all 156 CDKN2A residues and was repeated for only 28 out of 156 residues, with only ~80% concordance in functional classification between the first and second screens. This is not sufficiently robust for variant interpretation. Why was the experiment not performed more than once for most aa sites?</p></disp-quote><p>In our study we determined functional classifications for all <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants while assessing variability with replicates across 28 residues. Of these variants, only 6 (1.1%) were functionally deleterious in one replicate and of indeterminate function in another. Furthermore, no variant was functionally deleterious in one replicate and functionally neutral in another (Appendix 1 -table 4). As noted above, we provided additional context in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the screen, the methods section states that PANC-1 cells were infected at MOI=1 while the standard is an MOI of 0.3-0.5 to minimize multiple variants integrating into a single cell. At an MOI = 1 under a Poisson process which captures viral integration, ~25% of cells would have more than 1 lentiviral integrant. So in 25% of the cells the effect of a variant would be confounded by one or more other variants adding noise to the assay.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted previously, we are not able to differentiate effects due to multiple viral integrations per cells. However, we do not anticipate multiple viral integrations to significantly affect variant classifications in our study as our results are consistent with previous classifications, as described above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the authors provide more explanation of the gamma GLM, we strongly advise that the heatmap and replicate correlations be shown with the log2 fold changes rather than the fit output of the p-values.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. As noted, we provide additional explanation in the manuscript about why we classified variants using a gamma GLM. Using a gamma GLM, classification thresholds were determined using the change in representation of 20 non-functional barcodes in a pool of PANC-1 cells stably expressing CDKN2A after a period of in vitro proliferation. Our variant classifications were therefore not based on assay outputs for previously reported – benchmark – pathogenic or begin variants to determine thresholds. We strongly prefer using p-values and classifications using the gamma GLM in the manuscript. However, comparison of assay outputs using a gamma GLM and log2 fold change are included in the manuscript. Read counts, log2 fold change, and classifications based on log2 fold change are presented in the manuscript, for all variants. Readers who wish to use these data may do so and we refer them to the manuscript text, Appendix 1 -table 4, Appendix 1 -table 6, and Figure 2 -figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this study, the authors only classify variants into the categories &quot;neutral&quot;, &quot;indeterminate&quot;, or &quot;deleterious&quot; but they do not address CDKN2A gain-of-function variants that may lead to decreased proliferation. For example, there is no discussion on variants at residue 104, whose proliferation values mostly consist of higher magnitude negative log2fold change values. These variants are defined as neutral but from the one replicate of the experiment performed, they appear to be potential gain-of-function variants.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a comment to the discussion to highlight that we did not identify potential gain-of-function variants. Specifically:</p><p>“We classified <italic>CDKN2A</italic> missense variants using a gamma GLM, as either functionally deleterious, indeterminate functional or functionally neutral. However, we did not classify variants that may have gain-of-function effects, resulting in decreased representation in the cell pool. Future studies are necessary to determine the prevalence and significance of <italic>CDKN2A</italic> gain-of-function variants.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor concerns:</p><p>The differentiation between variants of &quot;neutral&quot; and &quot;indeterminate&quot; function seems unnecessary and it seems like there are too many variants that fall into the &quot;indeterminate&quot; category. The authors seem to have set numerical thresholds for CDKN2A function using benchmark variants of known function. While the benchmark variants are important as a frame of reference for the &quot;dynamic range&quot; of the assay, their function scores should not necessarily be used to define hard cutoffs of whether a variant's function score can be interpreted.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not utilize benchmark variants to define thresholds for functional classifications using a gamma GLM. This is one of the strengths of using a gamma GLM model for classification. As explained in our manuscript, classification thresholds were determined using the change in representation of 20 non-functional barcodes in a pool of PANC-1 cells stably expressing CDKN2A after a period of in vitro proliferation. Our variant classifications were therefore not based on assay outputs for previously reported – benchmark – pathogenic or begin variants. While not required when using a gamma GLM, we included indeterminate classifications, which are not uncommon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 supplement 2 - on the x-axis, should &quot;intermediate&quot; be &quot;indeterminate&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>This, and a similar typographical error in Figure 2 -figure supplement 3, has been corrected.</p></body></sub-article></article>
