Tryptophan-tryptophan (WW) domains of Nedd4 family E3 ligases bind to substrate proteins via interaction with PY motifs containing a consensus sequence P/L-P-x-Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rotin and Kumar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schild et al., 1996</xref>). Other substrates lack PY motifs and instead rely on interactions with adaptor proteins that recruit the Nedd4 E3 ligase to them, exemplified by a family of arrestin-related trafficking adaptors (ARTs) that bridge the association between substrates and Rsp5 for ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, Rsp5 adaptors include a diverse group of proteins to mediate degradation of membrane proteins localized at the PM, Golgi, endosome, and vacuole membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvaro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becuwe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hatakeyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hettema et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hovsepian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Léon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">MacDonald et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nikko and Pelham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">O’Donnell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sardana et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Many of the Nedd4/Rsp5 adaptor proteins undergo self-ubiquitination. The ART proteins Art1, Art4, and Art8 require specific ubiquitination by Rsp5 to reach full activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becuwe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hovsepian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). Ubiquitination of Nedd4 adaptor protein <italic>Commissureless</italic> is required to downregulate the Robo receptor at the cell surface of axons, essential for midline crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ing et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Myat et al., 2002</xref>). The N-lobe region of the Nedd4/Rsp5 family E3 ligase HECT domain contains an exosite which binds ubiquitin (Ub) and has been shown to orient the Ub chain to promote conjugation of the next Ub molecule of the growing polyubiquitin chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maspero et al., 2011</xref>). It was proposed that ubiquitinated Rsp5 adaptors are more active when locked onto Rsp5 but less active when unlocked by Ubp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">MacDonald et al., 2020</xref>). However, the mechanism of how Nedd4/Rsp5 adaptor ubiquitination helps enhance E3 ligase function remains unclear.</p><p>In this study, we decoded the activation mechanism of how adaptor protein ubiquitination enhances E3 ligase function and how this ubiquitination itself is regulated by the deubiquitination (DUB) enzyme Ubp2. Remarkably, we discovered that the Rsp5 adaptors Art1, Art4, and Art5 are conjugated with K63-linked di-ubiquitin (di-Ub) at specific ubiquitination sites. Ubiquitination of Art5 and Art1 enhances Rsp5 recruitment to the plasma membrane (PM) thereby promoting substrate ubiquitination. Our analysis of the binding affinity of di-Ub or isolated PY motifs to Rsp5 targeted domains uncovered that K63-linked di-Ub conjugation to the adaptor protein Any1 enhances its binding to E3 ligase Pub1. Strikingly, we found that deletion of <italic>UBP2</italic> rescues the DUB of adaptor proteins Art5 and Art1 in the <italic>rsp5</italic>-exosite mutant. Our data reveal the interplay between Ubp2 and ‘Rsp5 exosite engagement’ to modulate adaptor protein ubiquitination. Taken together, these results serve as a portal for future studies of Nedd4/Rsp5 adaptor proteins in general.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rsp5 adaptor protein Art5 undergoes K63-linked di-ubiquitination</title><p>In yeast, 14 α-arrestin domain containing proteins have been identified: Art1–Art10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nikko and Pelham, 2009</xref>), Bul1–Bul3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yashiroda et al., 1996</xref>), and Spo23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aubry and Klein, 2013</xref>). These proteins have clear arrestin sequence signatures and contain multiple PY motifs that specifically interact with the WW domains in Rsp5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baile et al., 2019</xref>), and can recruit Rsp5 to specific intracellular locations. This interaction not only results in ubiquitination of cargo proteins, but also ubiquitination of ARTs themselves. In fact, several α-arrestin domain containing proteins have been shown to be ubiquitinated by Rsp5, including Bul1, Bul2, Art1, Art4, Art5, Art6, and Art8. Among these, Art5 contains an α-arrestin domain and three C-terminal PY motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It has been shown that Art5 is the only ART protein required for the inositol-induced endocytosis and degradation of the PM inositol transporter Itr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nikko and Pelham, 2009</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Art5 undergoes K63-linked di-ubiquitination.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the domain architecture of Art5.

Mass spectrometry has previously indicated that Ub is mainly conjugated on the K364 residue of the Art5 α-arrestin domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Swaney et al., 2013</xref>). We confirmed that Art5 ubiquitination was decreased by mutating K364 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 3), and is completely abolished in the <italic>art5</italic><sup>∆PY</sup> mutant in which all three PY motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) were mutated (lane 4), demonstrating that Art5 ubiquitination depends on its interaction with Rsp5 via PY motifs. There is a minor amount of PY motif-dependent Art5 higher molecular weight species visible on the gel (lane 2), probably due to ubiquitination on other lysines. Strikingly, the molecular weight difference (~20 KDa) between the non-ubiquitinated and ubiquitinated forms of Art5 appears to be more than one single Ub (~9 KDa), suggesting more than one Ub molecule is conjugated to the Art5 protein. To test this hypothesis, we fused the C-terminus of <italic>art5<sup>∆PY</sup></italic> with 1, 2, 3, or 4 Ub molecules to create <italic>art5<sup>∆PY</sup></italic>-1xUb, <italic>art5<sup>∆PY</sup></italic>-2xUb, <italic>art5<sup>∆PY</sup></italic>-3xUb, and <italic>art5<sup>∆PY</sup></italic>-4xUb, respectively. Remarkably, the ubiquitinated Art5<sup>WT</sup> runs in line with <italic>art5<sup>∆PY</sup></italic>-2xUb, indicating that Art5 is di-ubiquitinated mainly at the K-364 residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 4–6).</p><p>We next asked what the linkage in the di-Ub is conjugated to Art5. Rsp5 mainly catalyzed K63-linked Ub chain synthesis in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lauwers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saeki et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore decided to examine whether the di-Ub moiety on Art5 is K63-linked. To test it, we analyzed the migration of Art5<sup>WT</sup><italic>, art5<sup>K364R</sup></italic>, and <italic>art5<sup>∆PY</sup></italic> proteins in yeast strains expressing Ub-WT and Ub-K63R. Notably, we found that the size of the di-ubiquitinated Art5 band (lanes 2 and 3) is reduced to the mono-ubiquitinated band (lanes 9 and 10), in line with <italic>art5<sup>∆PY</sup></italic>-1xUb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As expected, this mono-Ubiquitin (mono-Ub) was conjugated to K364 residue. We noticed the loss of Art5 protein in the Ub-K63R mutant in a K364 and PY motif dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 9), which will be discussed later. In addition, the mono-ubiquitinated band of Art5 in the yeast Ub-K63R mutant is K364 residue dependent, confirming that the mono-Ub is conjugated mainly at the K364 residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Together, our results demonstrate that Art5 protein is di-ubiquitinated at the residue K364 in a K63 linkage by Rsp5.</p><p>Besides Art5, we next addressed if the K63-linked di-Ub also apply to ART-family members Art1 and Art4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becuwe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). Art1 contains an N-terminal arrestin fold with PY motifs near its C-terminus and K486 residue is required for Art1 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The ubiquitinated form of Art1 shows the same mobility shift in comparison with <italic>art1<sup>∆PY</sup></italic>-2xUb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The ubiquitinated band of Art1 migrates with <italic>art1</italic><sup>∆PY</sup>-2xUb in the Ub-WT strain, while Art1 is mono-ubiquitinated at K486 in the yeast strain bearing Ub-K63R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Art4 interacts with Rsp5 via PY motifs and can be ubiquitinated at a cluster of lysines (235, 245, 264, and 267) in the N-terminal arrestin domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Due to Art4 phosphorylation when cells were grown in lactate medium, Art4 protein was treated with phosphatase after being shifted to glucose containing culture medium. The ubiquitinated form of Art4<sup>WT</sup> migrates with the <italic>art4<sup>∆PY</sup></italic>-2xUb and Art4<sup>WT</sup> was only mono-ubiquitinated in Ub-K63R condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>To directly determine the linkage composition of the di-Ub chain linked to Rsp5 adaptor proteins, we carried out a UbiCRest assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hospenthal et al., 2015</xref>) on Art1 K63-linked di-Ub. The Art1 protein was first immunoprecipitated (IPed) from WT cells then treated with DUBs: USP2, OTUB1, YOD1, AMSH, OTULIN, and Cezanne, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The resulting reaction mixture was resolved by SDS-PAGE gel and the bands were visualized by Western blot. The disappearance of higher molecular weight species of Art1 upon USP2 (non-specific DUB) and AMSH (K63-specific) treatment indicates that the substrate protein Art1 was ubiquitinated with a K63-linked Ub chain. Intriguingly, Cezanne treatment leads to the better release of the distal-end Ub than the proximal-end Ub from Art1-di-Ub. This result is consistent with previously published results demonstrating that Cezanne removes K63-linked Ub chains, albeit less efficient than hydrolyzing K11-linked Ub chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Enesa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mevissen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, no cleavage of Art1-di-Ub is visualized when incubated with YOD1, which cleaves K6, K11, K27, K29, or K33 linkage Ub chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mevissen et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, no cleavage of Art1-di-Ub is observed when treated with K48-specific DUB OTUB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mevissen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2009</xref>) and M1-specific DUB OTULIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keusekotten et al., 2013</xref>). In line with the UbiCRest profiling result of Art1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), mono-Ub can be released when K63-linked di-Ub is treated with USP2, AMSH, or Cezanne (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Taken together, our results demonstrated that α-arrestin domain containing adaptor proteins Art1, Art4, and Art5 are di-ubiquitinated and the di-Ub is K63-linked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ubiquitination of Art5 is required for cargo protein Itr1 ubiquitination</title><p>We therefore sought to investigate how Art5 ubiquitination affects efficient inositol-dependent endocytosis and protein degradation of Itr1.

The <italic>art5<sup>K364R</sup></italic> can be co-IPed by Itr1-GFP comparable to Art5<sup>WT</sup>, indicating that the decrease of Itrt1 ubiquitination upon inositol stimulation is not due to the loss of interaction between adaptor protein Art5 and cargo protein Itr1.</p><p>Consistent with the result of <italic>art5<sup>K364R</sup></italic>, the <italic>art1<sup>K486R</sup></italic> allele leads to a sorting defect of Mup1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–1C</xref>). We sought to test if the Mup1-GFP can bind to both Art1<sup>WT</sup> and <italic>art1<sup>K486R</sup></italic>. To do so, we examined the protein interaction between Mup1 and Art1 using Co-IP analysis. Indeed, we can observe the interaction between Mup1 and overexpressed Art1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In agreement with previous finding that the acidic patch in the Mup1 N-terminal tail is required for binding with Art1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guiney et al., 2016</xref>), we showed that the Q49R Mup1 mutant does not interact with Art1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Furthermore, both Art1<sup>WT</sup> and <italic>art1<sup>K486R</sup></italic> can bind to Mup1, as evidenced by the Co-IP of <italic>art1<sup>K486R</sup></italic> with Mup1 when Art1 ubiquitination is impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Thus, our results demonstrate that the sorting defect of Mup1-GFP in the presence of <italic>art1<sup>K486R</sup></italic> is not due to the loss of protein interaction between the adaptor protein Art1 and cargo protein Mup1.</p><p>Since TORC1 kinase regulates the Art1-dependent Ub-mediated cargo protein endocytosis by modulating Art1 phosphorylation via Npr1 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">MacGurn et al., 2011</xref>), we next tested if the non-ubiquitinated pool of Art1 altered the Npr1 dependence for phosphorylation, thereby affecting cargo protein sorting. First, we expressed Art1<sup>WT</sup> or <italic>art1<sup>K486R</sup></italic> in WT and <italic>npr1</italic>∆ mutant strains. We observed that both the di-ubiquitinated or the non-ubiquitinated Art1 pools migrated slightly faster in the <italic>npr1</italic>∆ mutant, consistent with dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Next, we treated the cells with either rapamycin or cycloheximide to monitor the change in phosphorylation status for ubiquitinated or non-ubiquitinated Art1. Also, the activated Npr1 kinase triggered by rapamycin treatment leads to phosphorylation of both Art1<sup>WT</sup> and <italic>art1<sup>K486R</sup></italic>, whereas the dephosphorylation of these two proteins is observed following cycloheximide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The Npr1-dependent phosphorylation is therefore the intrinsic feature of Art1, regardless of the ubiquitination status of Art1.</p><p>Since ARTs ubiquitination is necessary for cargo sorting, we next sought to test if C-terminal Ub fusion with KR or ∆PY motif mutants of adaptors rescues their cargo sorting defect. We first tested if Itr1-GFP sorting can be restored by <italic>art5</italic><sup>K364R</sup> and <italic>art5</italic><sup>∆PY</sup> with C-terminal 2xUb and found the 2xUb fusion does not restore the Itr1 sorting defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–3D</xref>). Since the toxic arginine analog canavanine hypersensitivity occurs in an <italic>art1∆</italic> mutant, where Can1 cannot be endocytosed, it provides a readout of Art1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grenson et al., 1966</xref>).

These results indicate that di-Ub needs to be conjugated at specific residues for proper functionality. Furthermore, the ubiquitination of ARTs is required for enhancing cargo protein sorting but cannot bypass PY motif, responsible for binding with Rsp5.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PM recruitment of Rsp5 is enhanced by Art5 and Art1 protein ubiquitination</title><p>The <italic>art5<sup>K364R</sup></italic> mutant partially blocks the ubiquitination and cargo sorting of Itr1 after inositol treatment, but still interacts with Itr1. We therefore hypothesized that the defective ubiquitination of <italic>art5<sup>K364R</sup></italic> may impair Rsp5 recruitment to the PM. To test this idea, we examined the localization of Art5-GFP in yeast cells before and after inositol treatment. The Art5<sup>WT</sup>-GFP localized at cytosol, nucleus, and occasional cytosolic puncta (Sec7-negative, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we set out to examine the binding between mono-Ub or K63-linked di-Ub and the HECT domain of Rsp5.

The dissociation constant (Kd) for the interaction between HECT and mono-Ub was quantified by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assay to be approximately 201 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Ub is often recognized through a hydrophobic surface containing Ile44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dikic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shih et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sloper-Mould et al., 2001</xref>). As expected, the I44A mutation of Ub abolishes the binding between mono-Ub and the HECT domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Our results suggest that the HECT domain exosite and the I44-containing Ub hydrophobic surface are required to bridge the protein-protein interaction between the HECT domain and ubiquitin. In contrast to the mono-Ub results, K63-linked di-Ub enhances the HECT domain binding affinity (Kd = 33 µM), nearly sixfold relative to the mono-Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Head-to-tail M1-linked di-Ub was proposed to mimic the K63 Ub linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Komander et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). As expected, our ITC analysis showed that M1-linked di-Ub binds to HECT with Kd = 36 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), comparable with the K63-linked di-Ub. Also, our in-vitro binding assay showed that the binding between GST-2xUb and HECT domain is stronger than GST-Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In comparison, K48-linked di-Ub shows a much lower affinity than K63-di-Ub, Kd = 145 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In line with the GST-binding result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), no binding was detected between the Ub variants and exosite mutant F618A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-E</xref>). Thus, our results demonstrate that HECT domain specifically binds to linear form K63-linked di-Ub and the exosite site is required for Ub binding.</p><p>We next wondered if both the proximal and distal end Ub of the K63-linked di-Ub contribute the binding to the HECT domain. To test it, we fused a distal end Ub (I44A) mutant to a proximal Ub (WT) and generated the distal end I44A mutant of K63 di-Ub (Ub<sup>WT</sup>-Ub<sup>I44A</sup>, proximal-distal). However, since the Ile44 residue of the proximal end Ub is essential for Ub binding by Ubc13/Mms2 and critical for K63-linked di-Ub catalysis, the Ile44 mutant of the proximal end Ub of the K63 di-Ub cannot be made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsui et al., 2005</xref>). We found that the K63-linked Ub<sup>WT</sup>-Ub<sup>I44A</sup> binds to HECT with a Kd = 120 µM, lower binding affinity than the K63 di-Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

We first confirmed the interaction between <italic>art1</italic>-K486R or <italic>art5</italic>-K364R with Rsp5 using Co-IP, due to the interaction between the PY motifs and WW domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-B</xref>). Indeed, Art1 and Art5 PY motif containing peptides interact with purified WW domains from Rsp5 (Kd = 3.6 µM for Art1, Kd = 3.1 µM for Art5), but not with PY motif mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–1B</xref>). We next test if the di-Ub/HECT interaction enhances the binding between E3 ligases and adaptors. We found that we could not express Art1 or Art5 at high levels in <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> therefore we expressed the Art1 ortholog Any1 from <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The <italic>S. pombe</italic> Rsp5 ortholog Pub1 interacts with Any1 with a binding affinity Kd~2.1 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), in a similar range as the binding affinity between PY motifs and WW domains shown earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-D</xref>). The association between Pub1 and Any1 was also demonstrated by size exclusion chromatography, in which the Any1 can be co-fractionated with Pub1 without being conjugated with di-Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–2C</xref>). The ITC and co-fractionation results suggest that Pub1 interacts with Any1 in a PY motif dependent manner. The di-Ub modification of adaptor protein likely upregulates the interaction affinity between the adaptor and Need4 E3 ligase. Remarkably, Any1 conjugated with K63 di-Ub enhances the binding with Pub1 nearly eightfold in comparison with non-conjugated Any1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), suggesting that di-Ub conjugation onto Any1 probably leads to a structural conformation change of Any1 and therefore enhances the Pub1 binding. This data is in line with the results that di-ubiquitination of Art5 and Art1 are required for efficient Rsp5 recruitment to the PM and for cargo protein sorting. In comparison, the Any1-di-Ub binds to exosite mutant <italic>pub1</italic>-F576A with a Kd = 2.3 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), confirming that the di-Ub binds to Pub1 exosite.

Strikingly, the di-ubiquitinated Art5 and Art1 are nearly fully restored in the <italic>rsp5</italic>-F618A/<italic>ubp2</italic>∆ strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating that Ubp2 trims the di-Ub on adaptors Art5 and Art1 when they are disengaged from the Rsp5 exosite. To test if Ubp2 is playing a catalytic or structural role in this process, we complemented the <italic>rsp5</italic>-F618A/<italic>ubp2</italic>∆ with either a WT or a catalytic mutant <italic>ubp2</italic>-C745V. We found that the Ubp2-WT abrogates the rescue of Art1 trimming seen in the lane 1, whereas the <italic>ubp2</italic>-C745V does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the exosite can protect the di-Ub moiety on adaptors from the cleavage by Ubp2.</p><p>We next wondered if the loss of Art5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, lane 2) is mediated by proteasome function. To test it, we treated the <italic>rsp5</italic>-F618A mutant with proteasome inhibitor MG132. We found that the full length Art5 protein is restored 3.8-fold upon the inhibition of proteasome function by MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting that Art5 probably undergoes K48-linked polyubiquitination because K48-linked Ub chains are preferred by proteasome. Either the PY motif or the K364R mutant rescues the loss of Art5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating that Rsp5 is responsible for Art5 degradation and the K364 is used for this ubiquitination process. To directly determine the involvement of K63 versus K48 linkage in the Art5 degradation, we examined the effect of overexpressing myc-Ub with WT, K63R, and K48R mutations on Art5 ubiquitination. We found that expressing myc-Ub K63R does not affect Art5 hyperubiquitination in the <italic>rsp5</italic>-exosite mutant background, whereas the K48R Ub mutant substantially reduced Art5 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This result suggests that the Art5 ubiquitination in the <italic>rsp5</italic>-exosite mutant is mediated by a K48-linked polyubiquitin chain.</p><p>We then sought to uncover the mechanism by which the Art5 degradation is triggered. We observed that Art5 protein is also degraded in the <italic>Ub</italic>-K63R mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We wondered if <italic>ubp2</italic>∆ can rescue Art5 degradation in the <italic>Ub</italic>-K63R mutant. To test this, we deleted Ubp2 in the <italic>Ub</italic>-K63R mutant and found that <italic>ubp2</italic>∆ does not reverse the loss of Art5 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Our results suggest that the loss of K63-linked di-Ub on Art5, instead of Ubp2, in either the <italic>Ub</italic>-K63R mutant or <italic>rsp5</italic>-exosite mutant, leads to Art5 degradation. Also, in these two conditions, the Art5 degradation can be rescued in <italic>art5</italic>-K364R and <italic>art5</italic>-∆PY mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>).</p><p>We next asked if the adaptor ubiquitination process is reversible and Ubp2 is involved in this process or not. To monitor the pre-existing adaptor proteins, we decided to employ the <italic>tet</italic>-Off system to fix the pool of adaptor proteins by treating the cells with doxycycline. As seen in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–2D</xref>, pre-existing Art5 or Art1 undergoes ubiquitination upon inositol or methionine treatment for 1 hr in both WT and <italic>ubp2</italic>∆ conditions, whereas the adaptor proteins shifted back to less ubiquitinated status after removing the stimulation in the WT condition, but not in the <italic>ubp2</italic>∆ mutant. Together, our data demonstrate a model for adaptor protein recycling mediated by Ubp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>). First, stimulation enhances adaptor ubiquitination. Second, the ubiquitinated pool of adaptor proteins can be deubiquitinated by Ubp2 when stimulation is terminated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we identified the first K63-linked di-Ub modification that modulates the function of Rsp5 and adaptor proteins. Our data demonstrates that two biological functions are implicated with this K63-linked di-Ub modification. First, K63-linked di-Ub activates Rsp5 function. K63-linked di-Ub enables the full engagement of adaptors onto the Rsp5 exosite and sharply enhances the binding affinity with Rsp5, which facilitates Rsp5 recruitment and accelerates substrate protein ubiquitination. Second, K63-linked di-Ub on adaptors engaged with the Rsp5 exosite are not accessible to Ubp2. Once released from Rsp5 exosite, the exposed K63-linked di-Ub is subjected to cleavage by Ubp2. Furthermore, we monitored the ubiquitination status of adaptor proteins Art1 and Art5. Using <italic>tet</italic>-Off system, we have shown that adaptor proteins undergo ubiquitination upon substrate stimulation and Ubp2 is required for DUB of adaptor proteins once the stimulation is removed. As hypothesized by our earlier review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">MacGurn et al., 2012</xref>), our current data supports the model that ubiquitinated adaptor proteins were deubiquitinated by Ubp2 so that the adaptor proteins can be recycled for the next round of ubiquitination event.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>K63-linked di-Ub is engaged into Rsp5 E3 ligase for activation</title><p>While we showed that Rsp5 adaptors Art1, Art4, and Art5 undergo K63-linked di-Ub modification, we also demonstrate that this conjugation sharply enhances the binding with the E3 ligase and activates the E3 ligase function for substrate ubiquitination. We reason that the interaction between the di-Ub chain and the HECT domain locks the E3 ligase and adaptor into an active/functional conformation. For adaptor-independent ubiquitination, the Nedd4/Rsp5 ligase exosite is also required for efficient Ub conjugation, demonstrating that the ‘Ub-exosite binding’ is required to localize and orient the distal-end Ub chain to promote conjugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maspero et al., 2011</xref>). In terms of the Rsp5 adaptor-mediated function, we propose that the binding between ‘di-Ub and exosite’ not only enhances the binding affinity between the E3 ligase and adaptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, F</xref>), but also leads to more productive Rsp5 recruitment to properly orient and present the substrate for ubiquitination at target membranes.</p><p>While we presented the evidence of E3 ligase activation by ubiquitinated adaptors, we also showed that K63 di-Ub generates a sixfold tighter binding to the HECT domain than mono-Ub. We reason that the K63 di-Ub not only provides alternative options to bind a single site, but also fits with a model in which there are multiple Ub binding sites. It was found that three N-lobe mutations (Y516A, F618A, and V621A/V622A) completely abolished Ub binding and three extra mutations (N513A, Y521A, and R651A) caused a reduction in binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">French et al., 2009</xref>). Kim and coworkers found that the L8-I44-V70 hydrophobic patch of mono-Ub sits on Rsp5 in three legs, like a tripod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Likewise, two separated UIMs in Rap80 bind to extended K63-linked Ub chain favorably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sato et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sims and Cohen, 2009</xref>). Indeed, K63-linked di-Ub with a mutation (I44A) at the distal end Ub leads to lower binding with Rsp5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). We propose that Rsp5 exosite accommodates the two hydrophobic patches of the distal and proximal Ub at multiple Ub binding sites, which needs be assigned in the future by structural analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The linkage specificity and length control for the K63-linked di-Ub</title><p>We have been intrigued by the question of how the K63 linkage of di-Ub was achieved and preferred, instead of K48. While the K63-linked di-Ub binds to the HECT domain with a stronger affinity than K48-linked di-Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), short K63 di-Ub chains (&lt;4) generally do not play as degradation signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nathan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thrower et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Windecker and Ulrich, 2008</xref>). Interestingly, both the M1- and K63-linked di-Ub adopt an equivalent open conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Komander et al., 2009</xref>) and exhibit similar binding affinity to the HECT domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), indicating that the HECT domain exosite has a strong preference for the linear and extended form of di-Ub. In contrast, the K48-linked polyubiquitin chain adopts a significantly distinct and compact structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eddins et al., 2007</xref>), which may not be favorable for the HECT domain.</p><p>Why is the K63-linked di-Ub chain limited to a dimer? On the one hand, this probably correlates with the physiological reversible function of adaptors. The K63-linked Ub chains (≥3) likely generate stronger binding with the HECT domain than di-Ub. We reason that the di-Ub binds well with HECT domain, but still can be disengaged from the HECT domain under physiological conditions so that Rsp5 can be disassociated and recycled. Furthermore, the K63-linked di-Ub is probably just enough to be masked by the HECT domain exosite cavity whereas longer chains will be trimmed by Ubp2. Future studies could address the accessible region for the di-Ub isopeptide bond cleavage by Ubp2 when di-Ub is engaged into the HECT domain.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Ubp2 mediates the recycling of Rsp5 E3 ligases from adaptors after ubiquitination</title><p>The PY motif containing Rsp5 adaptors share the E3 ligase Rsp5 and an adaptor should disassociate from Rsp5 to allow other adaptors to engage with Rsp5 to ubiquitinate different substrate proteins. In agreement with this working model, Nedd4-mediated downregulation of the sodium channel ENaC is impaired when Nedd4 is sequestered by overexpression of another Nedd4 E3 adaptor, Ndfip2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Konstas et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Besides cleavage of K63 di-Ub in the <italic>rsp5</italic>-exosite mutant, Ubp2 allows the recycling of Rsp5 from its adaptor proteins. MacDonald and coworkers proposed that several Rsp5 adaptors compete for Rsp5 and a Ubp2 deficiency increased both the adaptor activity and the ability to compete for Rsp5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">MacDonald et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, we observe that Art5 and Art1 di-ubiquitination in response to inositol or methionine treatment is inhibited in the absence of Ubp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating the decrease of Rsp5 availability in <italic>ubp2∆</italic> mutant. Since K63 di-Ub greatly enhances the binding affinity between adaptors and E3 ligase, Ubp2 likely helps the Nedd4/Rsp5 E3 ligase to catalyze distinct ubiquitination events by cleaving the di-Ub off the adaptors and recycling Rsp5. The multitasking of Rsp5 via various adaptors leads us to hypothesize that activated Rsp5 can be released from engaged adaptor proteins. We showed that the adaptor proteins Art1 and Art5 undergo di-ubiquitination upon environmental stimulation and Ubp2 is required to reverse this ubiquitination. Once the ubiquitination is done, the engaged K63 di-Ub is exposed for cleavage by Ubp2. Thereafter, Ubp2 acts on ubiquitinated adaptor proteins to release the adaptor proteins and Rsp5. The mechanism by which Ubp2 executes this reaction needs to be resolved in the future.</p><p>Collectively, we propose that Rsp5 ubiquitinates adaptors to trigger their engagement with the Rsp5 exosite upon stimulation, which enables the tight binding between adaptors and Rsp5, and efficient Rsp5 recruitment to target membranes thereby activating Rsp5 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Ubp2 acts as an antagonist for K63 di-Ub to modulate the interaction between K63-di-Ub and the Rsp5 exosite in a reversible manner to maintain cellular homeostasis of Rsp5. Future work needs to address the atomic structure of the ART family of adaptor proteins in complex with Rsp5 to understand how di-Ub is attached to the adaptor and how the di-ubiquitinated adaptors engage with the HECT E3 ligases, stabilizing an activated conformation of the E3 ligase.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Attachment of K63 di-ubiquitin (di-Ub) to adaptor protein Art5 enables efficient membrane recruitment of Rsp5.</title><p>This model depicts that the adaptor protein Art5 forms binary protein complex with E3 ligase Rsp5 via the interaction between the PY motif and tryptophan-tryptophan (WW) domain, following by the stimulation of cargo protein Itr1. The efficient membrane recruitment of Rsp5 is activated by this binding scaffold when adaptor protein Art5 linked with K63 di-Ub is fully engaged into the Rsp5 exosite.</p></caption><graphic

K63-linked di-Ub is synthesized by incubating purified human E1 (0.1 µM), yeast E2 (Ubc13 and Mms2, 8 µM of each), two Ub mutants (K63R and D77, 5 mg/mL of each), ATP (2.5 mM), 1  mM DTT and 1 × PBDM buffer (pH 7.6). For K48-linked di-Ub synthesis, purified human E1 (0.1 µM), E2-25K (20 µM), two Ub mutants (K48R and D77, 7.5 mg/mL of each), ATP (2.5 mM), 1 mM DTT and 1 × PBDM buffer (pH 8.0) were mixed.

ubiquitylation by Rsp5 in the regulation of cargo import by endocytosis. Rsp5 promotes K63 linked ubiquitylation of Art proteins, thereby enhancing plasma membrane recruitment. Along with detailed biochemical analysis, this study uncovers a novel ubiquitination modification implemented by Rsp5 adaptor proteins, underscoring the regulatory mechanism of how adaptor proteins control the recruitment and activity of Rsp5 for the turnover of membrane proteins.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77424.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Harper</surname><given-names>Wade</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03vek6s52</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Danny</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03pv69j64</institution-id><institution>Beatson Institute for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.11.25.470069">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.25.470069v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Danny Huang (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers find the paper to be very interesting and of potential interest to <italic>eLife</italic> readers. Many aspects of the paper are well done. However, some of the conclusions are not sufficiently supported by data. The reviewers feel that among the various aspects that were described in the detailed review, the following four areas need to be addressed.</p><p>1) The conclusion that the di-ubiquitin linkage is K63 rests on the use of a K63R mutant. But this could be indirect. The authors should provide further demonstration of linkage type. For example, proteomics analysis or with a K63-specific DUB compared to DUBs specific for other linkage types (UbiCRest).</p><p>2) The authors claim that loss of the K63 di-ubiquitination of ART proteins does not affect their interaction with cargoes for ubiquitination and endocytosis.

ARTs are adaptors for Rsp5 that link it to recruitment to membranes including the plasma membrane where the ubiquitylation activity of Rsp5 promotes cargo endocytosis. Rsp5 di-ubiquitylates several ARTs and this enhances Rsp5 recruitment to membranes and is required for cargo ubiquitylation. Interestingly, the HECT domain exosite blocks the di-K63 ubiquitin from removal by DUBs. When the exosite interaction is not present, di-K63 is removed and ARTs become substrates for K48 ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. These studies reveal a detailed mechanism of ARTs modification that couples Rsp5 activity to activation of ARTs for cargo import.</p><p>Overall, the studies are well performed and described.</p><p>Figure 1. This experiment nicely shows that K364 is the primary site of ubiquitylation in Art5 and that this occurs largely through K63 linkages. For Figure 1C, I found the explanation and conclusion not so clear. The apparent mono-ubiquitylated species seems to still be detected in the K364 mutant – it's just that the abundance of the unmodified form is increased. There could be other weaker sites of ubiquitylation that are modified in the mutant but this isn't really consistent with how this is described. It could also be that when the mono-ubiquitylation cannot be extended, the ubiquitin is removed (which is addressed later in the paper). In supplemental figures, the authors look at Art1 and Art4. The issue described above is clearer with Art4, and somewhat so with Art1. It seems like this inconsistency should be addressed.</p><p>For Figure 2, the Art5 K364 mutant has residual processing to yield GFP (Figure 2A), and there is also a small amount of GFP in the vacuole. However, the authors call the &quot;essential&quot;. There may be low levels of ubiquitylation of other residues that give this low-level trafficking, but ubiquitylation of that site isn't &quot;essential&quot;. The text should be modified.</p><p>Figure 3 examines the role of Art ubiquitylation for Rsp5 recruitment to the PM. This is well done and carefully explained.</p><p>Figure 4 examines the role of a cargo protein in recruitment, while Figure 5 shows that the interaction between the ligase and the Art protein is enhanced by di-K63 Ub.

When the exosite is mutated, Ubp2 can remove ubiquitin, which then allows the assembly of K48 chains on Art5 through the same lysine residue, thereby leading to the turnover of Art by the proteasome. What wasn't clear to me is whether the K48 chain assembly is via Rsp5 or a different E3. The model would suggest that it is Rsp5, but I am not sure that the data is presented to demonstrate that.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors claim that Art1, Art4, and Art5 are di-ubiquitinated by Rsp5. This conclusion is based on the fact that di-ubiquitination of the three arrestins is dependent on the presence of PY motifs in each protein, and thus their interaction with Rsp5. However, the binding of each ART protein to Rsp5 via its exosite is required to protect the proteins from deubiquitination by Ubp2. Thus, the authors cannot distinguish whether the effect observed by the ∆PY mutants (Figures 1C, Figure 1 supp 1C, and Gid1 supp 2B) are due to ubiquitination by Rsp5 itself or simply to a loss of protection from deubiquitination. Additional experiments would be needed to clarify this point. For example, could the authors reconstitute the ubiquitination reactions in vitro using their purified ART and Rsp5 proteins? The authors could also separate roles of Ub binding to the exosite and other functions by using one of Sidhu's ubiquitin variants that bind the exosite but would not be deconjugated by Ubp2.</p><p>2) The conclusion that the di-ubiquitin linkage is K63 rests on the use of a K63R mutant.

Nedd4/Rsp5 family E3 ligases mediate numerous cellular processes. Under environmental cues, adaptor proteins of Nedd4/Rsp5 E3 ligases provide a cargospecific quality-control pathway that mediates endocytic downregulation by coupling Rsp5/Nedd4 to diverse plasma membrane proteins. Many Nedd4 family E3 ligase adaptors were self-ubiquitinated for activation of the E3 ligase. The mechanism for how adaptor protein ubiquitination activates Rsp5/Nedd4 E3 ligase has been a long-standing fundamental question in the field. For the first time, our study identified that the adaptor proteins ARTs undergo di-Ub modification, which strengthens the binding with Rsp5 and promotes the efficient recruitment of Rsp5. Adaptor linked di-Ub will enhance the recruitment of Rsp5 locally for specific cargo protein ubiquitination reactions but is unlikely change the Rsp5 ligase activity. The Nedd4/Rsp5 exosite is critical for the HECT domain to bind Ub moieties but exosite mutations do not alter the E3 ligase catalytic activity (Maspero, Polo, et al., EMBO Rep. 2011. PMID: 21399620). This result supports a model that the in-trans interaction between the HECT domain N-lobe region and di-Ub does not interfere the HECT domain catalytic activity.</p><p>b. Yes. Based on our recent in-vitro reconstituted ubiquitination assay, we found that K63-di-ubiquitin enhances cargo protein ubiquitination better than mono-Ub (unpublished). We found it quite interesting, and the results fit our current working model. Since this result is beyond the scope of this study, we do not discuss it in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. For ITC experiments, it was difficult to visualize the ITC curves for the controls. Best to show the control curves in the supplemental. Is it possible to estimate the stoichiometry of the binding?

Thanks for your comments. We also noticed that molar ratio for K63-di-ubiquitin and linear-di-ubiquitin do not appear to be 1:1 binding. It seems like multiple sites in the HECT domain N-lobe region were involved in Ub binding. This is in line with the previous published results by French and coworkers (French, Hicke, et al., JBC. 2009. PMID: 19252184). Three N-lobe mutations (Y516A, F618A, and V621A/V622A) of Rsp5 completely abolished ubiquitin binding. Three mutations (N513A, Y521A, and R651A) of Rsp5 caused a reduction in binding with Ub. Rsp5(N534A) reproducibly enhanced Ub binding &lt;inline-graphic mimetype=&quot;image&quot; mime-subtype=&quot;png&quot; xlink:href=&quot;media/image1.png&quot; /&gt;2–3-fold relative to wild-type. A highresolution atomic structure of the ART family of adaptor proteins in complex with Rsp5 will be required to assign the binding stoichiometry for how multiple Ubbinding sites in the HECT domain interact with a di-Ub molecule and how the diubiquitinated adaptors engage the HECT E3 ligases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The linear di-ubiquitin exhibited a high affinity for Rsp5 exosite but Art KR mutant fused with linear di-ubiquitin at the C-terminus did not rescue the defect. Could the authors provide an explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>These results suggest that di-ubiquitin needs to be conjugated at specific residues for proper functionality. It also implies that Need4/Rsp5 E3 ligases need to be engaged with di-ubiquitinated adaptors precisely to direct the E3 ligase activity to the appropriate cargo proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Please state how protein concentrations are determined in the method. Is the protein concentration of di-ubiquitin calculated based on dimer or monomer?</p></disp-quote><p>a. Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm (divided by extinction coefficient for specific proteins).</p><p>b. The di-Ub concentrations were calculated based on the extinction coefficient of the ubiquitin dimer.</p></body></sub-article></article>
