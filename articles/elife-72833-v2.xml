When accurate positioning of the spindle fails, a surveillance mechanism named the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC) prevents cells from exiting mitosis. Mutants with a defective SPOC become multinucleated and lose their genomic integrity. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of the SPOC mechanism is missing. In this study, we identified the type 1 protein phosphatase, Glc7, in association with its regulatory protein Bud14 as a novel checkpoint component. We further showed that Glc7-Bud14 promotes dephosphorylation of the SPOC effector protein Bfa1. Our results suggest a model in which two mechanisms act in parallel for a robust checkpoint response: first, the SPOC kinase Kin4 isolates Bfa1 away from the inhibitory kinase Cdc5, and second, Glc7-Bud14 dephosphorylates Bfa1 to fully activate the checkpoint effector.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>spindle position checkpoint</kwd><kwd>PP1</kwd><kwd>signalling</kwd><kwd>mitotic exit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IG - 3918</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kocakaplan</surname><given-names>Dilara</given-names></name><name><surname>Caydasi</surname><given-names>Ayse Koca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>TUBITAK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>117C041</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caydasi</surname><given-names>Ayse Koca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>TUBITAK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>118Z979</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karaburk</surname><given-names>Hüseyin</given-names></name><name><surname>Kirdök</surname><given-names>Idil</given-names></name><name><surname>Caydasi</surname><given-names>Ayse Koca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>H2020-MSCA-IF (796599)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caydasi</surname><given-names>Ayse Koca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ICGEB</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IG-No. CRP/TUR17-04_EC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caydasi</surname><given-names>Ayse Koca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>TUBITAK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>117Z232</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bektas</surname><given-names>Seyma Nur</given-names></name><name><surname>Caydasi</surname><given-names>Ayse Koca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PP1-Bud14 is a novel Spindle Position Checkpoint component.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Budding yeast undergoes asymmetric cell division in every cell cycle and is an intrinsically polarized cell. In every cell cycle, a new cell buds on the mother cell and pinches of from this location at the end of the cell division, giving rise to a young daughter cell and an old mother cell. In order for the daughter cell to receive one copy of the duplicated genetic material, budding yeast has to segregate its chromosomes along its mother-to-bud polarity axis, which requires positioning of the mitotic spindle apparatus along this direction. The correct orientation of the mitotic spindle is achieved by two redundant pathways, namely the ‘early’ and ‘late’ pathways, which are dependent on the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) homolog Kar9 and the microtubule motor protein Dyn1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adames and Cooper, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beach et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Siller and Doe, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Correct orientation of the mitotic spindle is monitored by a mitotic checkpoint named the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC) in budding yeast. SPOC prevents cell cycle progression of cells that fail to orient their spindle in the mother-to-bud direction, and hence provides time for cells to correct their spindle orientation before mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adames et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bardin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bloecher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yeh et al., 1995</xref>). Yeast cells with defects in the spindle positioning pathways or cells with impaired microtubule function rely on the SPOC to maintain their ploidy. Absence of SPOC causes multinucleation, enucleation, and aneuploidy in budding yeast. A SPOC-like checkpoint also exists in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and may be present in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">O’Connell and Wang, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pereira and Yamashita, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In response to spindle mispositioning, SPOC inhibits cell cycle progression by inhibiting the mitotic exit network (MEN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caydasi et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Caydasi and Pereira, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Weiss, 2012</xref>). MEN is a GTPase-driven signaling pathway that is essential for mitotic exit in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jaspersen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shou et al., 1999</xref>). A single conserved phosphatase, named Cdc14, triggers mitotic exit in budding yeast through inactivation of the mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and dephosphorylation of CDK targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Manzano-López and Monje-Casas, 2020</xref>). At the anaphase onset, a transient wave of Cdc14 activation is triggered by the cdc fourteen early anaphase release (FEAR) network, whereas later in anaphase the MEN promotes full activation of Cdc14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jaspersen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rock and Amon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shou et al., 1999</xref>). A Ras-like small GTPase named Tem1 is the main switch located near the top of the MEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Morishita et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Scarfone and Piatti, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shirayama et al., 1994b</xref>). When bound to GTP, Tem1 initiates the MEN signaling by recruiting the Cdc15 kinase to the spindle pole bodies (SPBs, centrosome equivalent in yeast), which therein activates Dbf2 kinase in association with its regulatory subunit Mob1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asakawa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cenamor et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Visintin and Amon, 2001</xref>).</p><p>SPOC inhibits the MEN through inactivation of Tem1 by a bipartite GTPase-activating complex (GAP) composed of Bfa1 and Bub2 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Geymonat et al., 2002</xref>). Activity of the Bfa1-Bub2 GAP complex is tightly regulated at the level of Bfa1 phosphorylation. In cells with a correctly positioned anaphase spindle, the polo-like kinase Cdc5 phosphorylates Bfa1 to prevent Bfa1-Bub2 GAP activity towards Tem1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hu et al., 2001</xref>). CDK also phosphorylates Bfa1 in an activating manner until anaphase when this phosphorylation is removed in a FEAR-related manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Caydasi et al., 2017</xref>). In the presence of spindle misalignment, however, Kin4 kinase phosphorylates Bfa1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maekawa et al., 2007</xref>). This phosphorylation prevents inhibitory phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Cdc5 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>). Consequently, Bfa1-Bub2 GAP complex activity is promoted, Tem1 activity is prevented, and exit from mitosis is inhibited.</p><p>SPBs, serving as a scaffold, play a key role in mitotic exit and its timely regulation by the spindle position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campbell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gruneberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pereira and Schiebel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Valerio-Santiago and Monje-Casas, 2011</xref>). When the spindle is properly oriented, Bfa1-Bub2 and Tem1 reside in a preferential, asymmetrical manner at the SPB that moves to the daughter cell (dSPB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Molk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>). On the contrary, Kin4 localizes exclusively to the SPB that stays in the mother cell (mSPB) during an unperturbed anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">D’Aquino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>). Spindle misalignment alters SPB localization of SPOC components. Upon mispositioning of the mitotic spindle, Kin4 localizes to both SPBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>). Phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Kin4 promotes binding of the 14-3-3 family protein Bmh1 to Bfa1, which causes dissociation of Bfa1-Bub2 from SPBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Caydasi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Caydasi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Monje-Casas and Amon, 2009</xref>). Hence, upon spindle mispositioning, the amount of Bfa1-Bub2 at both SPBs decreases, while their cytoplasmic levels increase. The release of Bfa1-Bub2 from SPBs is thought to keep Bfa1-Bub2 away from the inhibitory kinase Cdc5 and thus prevent inactivation of Bfa1-Bub2 by Cdc5. However, what dephosphorylates the Cdc5-phosphorylated Bfa1 remains elusive.</p><p>Here, we identified Bud14 as a novel SPOC protein. Deletion of <italic>BUD14</italic> rescued cold sensitivity of <italic>lte1∆</italic> cells, lethality of mitotic exit-deficient <italic>lte1∆ spo12∆</italic> cells, and growth defects of MEN temperature-sensitive mutants <italic>cdc15-1</italic>, <italic>dbf2-2</italic>, and <italic>mob1-67</italic>. Our data showed that <italic>bud14∆</italic> cells accumulated multinucleated phenotypes when spindle positioning was impaired in cells via deletion of <italic>KAR9</italic> or <italic>DYN1</italic>. Fluorescence time-lapse microscopy revealed that <italic>bud14∆</italic> cells failed to delay mitotic exit in response to spindle mispositioning. We observed an additive decrease in anaphase duration of <italic>kin4∆ bud14∆</italic> cells with misaligned spindles compared to the cells bearing single-gene deletions of <italic>KIN4</italic> or <italic>BUD14,</italic> suggesting that Kin4 and Bud14 work in parallel in SPOC. We further found that the mitotic exit inhibitory function Bud14 required its association with the type 1 protein phosphatase, Glc7. A temperature-sensitive version of Glc7 (<italic>glc7-12</italic>) and a version of Bud14 that cannot interact with Glc7 (<italic>bud14-F379A</italic>) caused SPOC deficiency and rescued growth of mitotic exit mutants. Yeast two hybrid data indicated an interaction between Bfa1 and Bud14 that required the presence of Bub2, which suggests that Bud14 may recognize Bfa1-Bub2. Intriguingly, <italic>bud14∆</italic> and <italic>bud14-F379A</italic> cells had more Bfa1-Bub2 localized at the dSPBs, suggestive of a role for Bud14-Glc7 in limiting SPB-bound levels of Bfa1-Bub2. Similarly to the wild-type cells, upon spindle mispositioning, levels of Bfa1 at the dSPB were able to decrease in <italic>bud14∆</italic> cells, unlike <italic>kin4∆</italic> cells, which also supported separate functions of Bud14 and Kin4 in SPOC. We further observed that <italic>lte1∆</italic> cells lacking Bud14 accumulated hyperphosphorylated Bfa1 forms during anaphase. Furthermore, overexpression of <italic>BUD14</italic> but not <italic>bud14-F379A</italic> caused a reduction in this hyperphosphorylated forms of Bfa1. Finally, through in vitro phosphatase assays we showed that Glc7-Bud14 promoted dephosphorylation of hyperphosphorylated Bfa1. Our data altogether indicates that Glc7-Bud14 is a novel mitotic exit inhibitor in budding yeast that works upon spindle mispositioning. We propose a checkpoint model in which two independent mechanisms activate the checkpoint effector: first, the SPOC kinase Kin4 prevents further Cdc5 phosphorylation of Bfa1 by rapidly removing Bfa1 away from the Cdc5 kinase, and second, Glc7-Bud14 dephosphorylates Bfa1 to activate the Bfa1-Bub2 GAP complex. Both mechanisms are crucial for rapid activation of the checkpoint effector Bfa1-Bub2 upon mispositioning of the anaphase spindle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bud14 is a novel mitotic exit inhibitor</title><p>Lte1 is a mitotic exit activator that becomes essential for mitotic exit at cold temperatures (&lt;16°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shirayama et al., 1994a</xref>).

We thus asked whether the novel mitotic exit inhibitor Bud14 has a role in SPOC. To address this, we first employed a population-based approach. Cells with a functional SPOC, arrest in anaphase with mispositioned nuclei upon spindle mispositioning, whereas SPOC-deficient cells such as <italic>bfa1∆</italic> or <italic>kin4∆</italic> continue cell cycle progression, resulting in the formation of multinucleated and enucleated cells. We assayed SPOC deficiency in cell populations as a measure of frequency of multinucleation, relative to that of the spindle mispositioning (SPOC deficiency index). Kar9- and Dynein-dependent spindle positioning pathways act redundantly to align the spindle along mother-to-daughter polarity axis in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Eshel et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Miller and Rose, 1998</xref>).

Cells were imaged through fluorescence time-lapse microscopy for 90 min with 1 min time resolution at 30°C. Anaphase duration was calculated as the time elapsed between the start of fast spindle elongation and the spindle breakage, which are indications of anaphase onset and mitotic exit, respectively. In cells with a normally positioned spindle, mean anaphase duration of all analyzed cell types was similar – ranging from 18 to 19 min with a standard deviation of 2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s1sdata2">Figure 2—figure supplement 1—source data 2a</xref>). The majority of <italic>kar9∆</italic> cells with a misaligned spindle stayed arrested with an intact spindle during the time-lapse movie (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>kar9∆,</italic> red triangles), whereas <italic>kin4∆ kar9∆</italic> cells with misaligned spindles broke their anaphase spindle in average 27 ± 7 min (mean ± standard deviation) after the onset of anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>kar9∆ kin4∆,</italic> black squares). <italic>bud14∆ kar9∆</italic> cells with misaligned spindles also broke their spindle and with a mean anaphase duration of 23 ± 4 min (mean ± standard deviation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>kar9∆ bud14∆</italic>, black squares). These data altogether suggest that Bud14 is needed as a part of the SPOC mechanism to delay mitotic exit upon spindle mispositioning.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Function of Bud14 in SPOC is parallel to Kin4</title><p>Bfa1-Bub2 is the most downstream component of SPOC, and Kin4 is the key SPOC kinase that resides upstream of Bfa1 to promote Bfa1-Bub2 GAP activity upon spindle misalignment. We next asked whether Bud14 works parallel to Kin4 in SPOC. We reasoned that if Bud14 and Kin4 work in parallel, concomitant loss of Bud14 and Kin4 would cause a greater SPOC deficiency index than individual loss of Bud14 or Kin4. SPOC deficiency index of <italic>kin4∆ bud14∆ kar9∆</italic> was significantly higher than that of <italic>kin4∆ kar9∆</italic> or <italic>bud14∆ kar9∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Likewise, SPOC deficiency phenotype was more prominent in <italic>kin4∆ bud14∆ dyn1∆</italic> cells than in <italic>kin4∆ dyn1∆</italic> or <italic>bud14∆ dyn1∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, <italic>KIN4</italic> and <italic>BUD14</italic> deletion showed an additive effect with respect to SPOC deficiency. Of note, deletion of <italic>BUD14</italic> in <italic>bfa1∆ kar9∆</italic> cells did not cause any increase in SPOC deficiency index compared to <italic>bfa1∆ kar9∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These data are suggestive of a role for Bud14 parallel to Kin4 and upstream of Bfa1 and in SPOC.</p><p>Additive effect of <italic>KIN4</italic> and <italic>BUD14</italic> deletion was also evident in anaphase duration comparisons. Even though <italic>BUD14</italic> deletion caused mitotic exit of cells with misaligned spindles, duration of anaphase in <italic>bud14∆ kar9∆</italic> cells was significantly longer during spindle misalignment than during spindle normal alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>bud14∆</italic>, squares vs. circles). In addition, 1 out of 18 cells was able to hold the SPOC arrest longer than an hour. Similar phenomenon was also observed in <italic>kar9∆ kin4∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>kin4∆</italic>, squares vs. circles) and was also reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Caydasi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Falk et al., 2016b</xref>). This indicates that in the absence of Bud14 or Kin4 cells are still able to delay mitotic exit in response to spindle positioning defects, albeit for a short time. On the contrary, when both <italic>KIN4</italic> and <italic>BUD14</italic> were deleted, cells exited mitosis with the same timing regardless of the spindle position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>kar9∆ bud14∆ kin4∆,</italic> black squares vs. circles). Thus, concomitant deletion of <italic>KIN4</italic> and <italic>BUD14</italic> results in a more severe loss of SPOC functionality than single deletion of either <italic>KIN4</italic> or <italic>BUD14</italic>. This data is in line with our conclusion that Kin4 and Bud14 act in parallel to promote SPOC arrest.</p><p>To rule out the possibility that Bud14 may also be acting upon Kin4, we next analyzed the effect of Bud14 on Kin4 functionality. For this, we first analyzed cells overexpressing Kin4. Kin4 overexpression blocks exit from mitosis through constitutive Bfa1-Bub2 activation and thus results in lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">D’Aquino et al., 2005</xref>). This lethality can be rescued by deletion of <italic>BFA1</italic> or <italic>BUB2,</italic> which are the most downstream SPOC components, and by deletion of <italic>RTS1</italic> or <italic>ELM1</italic>, which are Kin4 regulators, and by deletion of <italic>BMH1</italic>, which works downstream of <italic>KIN4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caydasi et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Caydasi et al., 2014</xref>). Unlike the aforementioned gene deletions, deletion of <italic>BUD14</italic> did not rescue the lethality of Kin4 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, overproduced Kin4 is still able to activate Bfa1 constitutively in the absence of Bud14. Next, we analyzed the effect of Bud14 on Kin4 localization. Kin4 localized to SPBs in response to microtubule depolymerization independently of the presence of Bud14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Likewise, Kin4 localized to SPBs during anaphase in <italic>lte1∆</italic> cells both in the presence and absence of Bud14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Kin4 mobility on SDS-PAGE was not altered in cells lacking Bud14 either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These data indicate that Bud14 does not work upstream of Kin4. As we will describe later, analysis of Bfa1 localization during spindle misalignment also supported that Kin4 regulation of Bfa1 takes place independently of Bud14 (Figure 6D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Taken altogether, our data support a model where Bud14 acts in a pathway parallel to Kin4 in SPOC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Bud14 function in SPOC is independently of its role in actin regulation</title><p>Bud14 regulates actin cable formation through its formin-regulatory motif (amino acids 135–150) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chesarone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Eskin et al., 2016</xref>). Bud14’s function in controlling formin activity also requires its interaction with KELCH domain proteins Kel1 and Kel2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gould et al., 2014</xref>). We addressed the contribution of actin regulatory role of Bud14 to its mitotic exit inhibitory function through two independent approaches. First, we made use of the <italic>bud14-5A</italic> mutant whose formin-regulatory motif is disrupted by five alanine amino acid substitutions at Bud14 residues 135 and 137–140 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Eskin et al., 2016</xref>). Ectopic expression of <italic>bud14-5A</italic> and <italic>BUD14</italic> on a centromeric yeast plasmid (pRS416) under <italic>BUD14</italic> endogenous/native promoter rescued the SPOC-deficient phenotype of <italic>bud14∆ kar9∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Thus, <italic>bud14-5A</italic> mutant, which is deficient in formin binding, is functional in terms of mitotic exit inhibition. Of note, expression of <italic>bud14-5A</italic> caused a significantly greater extent of reduction in SPOC deficiency index of <italic>bud14∆ kar9∆</italic> cells than expression of <italic>BUD14</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, Bud14-5A interacted with Glc7 more readily in yeast two hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which may indicate a link between Glc7-Bud14 interaction and SPOC robustness.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Function of Bud14 in actin regulation is dispensable for spindle position checkpoint (SPOC).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Endpoint analysis of SPOC deficiency index in <italic>bud14∆ kar9∆</italic> cells carrying <italic>URA3</italic>-based empty plasmid (empty) or <italic>BUD14</italic>-containing <italic>URA3</italic>-based plasmids (<italic>BUD14</italic> and <italic>bud14-5A</italic>).

We also showed that it interacts with Bfa1. We next asked whether Bud14-Glc7 affects Bfa1 function. SPOC functionality relies on a radical change in SPB localization of Bfa1-Bub2. When the spindle is properly oriented, Bfa1-Bub2 preferentially localizes to the SPB that moves to the daughter cell (dSPB). Upon spindle misalignment, Bfa1-Bub2 is released from dSPB, hence a low level of Bfa1-Bub2 is attained at both SPBs. Thus, we analyzed the effect of Bud14 on SPB localization of Bfa1-Bub2. First, we compared the SPB-bound levels of Bfa1-GFP at SPBs in wild-type and <italic>bud14∆</italic> cells with normally aligned anaphase spindles (spindle length &gt;3 µm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

We thus asked whether <italic>bud14∆</italic> cells were able to change their Bfa1 localization from asymmetric to symmetric in response to spindle misalignment. As a measure of signal asymmetry at SPBs, we calculated Bfa1-GFP asymmetry index as the ratio of Bfa1-GFP intensity at SPBs of <italic>kar9∆</italic> cells with correctly aligned and misaligned anaphase spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

We also analyzed the behavior of Bfa1-GFP through time-lapse experiments.

This arrest mimics a SPOC-activated state where Cdc5 phosphorylation of Bfa1 is prevented by Kin4 phosphorylation of Bfa1 and consequently Bfa1 hyperphosphorylation is restored upon deletion of <italic>KIN4</italic> in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertazzi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Bud14 overexpression causes cells to arrest in a pre-anaphase state, and, hence, it is lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chesarone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cullen and Sprague, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Knaus et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pinsky et al., 2006</xref>). Of importance, this lethality is not dependent on Bfa1 or Kin4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To obtain cells arrested in anaphase in the presence of high levels of Bud14, we first arrested <italic>cdc15-as</italic> (L99G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bishop et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">D’Aquino et al., 2005</xref>) bearing cells in anaphase through 1NM-PP1 treatment and then induced Gal1-<italic>BUD14</italic> overexpression by addition of galactose into the growth medium. Overexpression of <italic>BUD14</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) but not <italic>bud14-F379A</italic> caused a reduction in hyperphosphorylated forms of Bfa1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). This data suggests that Glc7-Bud14 causes dephosphorylation of hyperphosphorylated Bfa1 in anaphase-arrested cells.</p><p>To further understand whether Glc7-Bud14 dephosphorylates Bfa1, we performed an in vitro dephosphorylation assay.

Protein phosphorylation and localization play a key role in SPOC. Especially the activity of Bfa1, the most downstream effector of the SPOC, is tightly controlled with respect to the spindle orientation through phosphorylation by the polo like kinase Cdc5 and the mother-specific kinase Kin4 in an opposing manner. Phosphorylation of Bfa1 in turn affects activity and localization of Bfa1-Bub2 and hence the activity and the localization of the GTPase Tem1 at SPBs. Despite the knowledge on Bfa1 phosphorylating kinases, knowledge on phosphatases counteracting these kinases has been limited. In this study, we established Glc7-Bud14 as a novel SPOC component that promotes dephosphorylation of Bfa1 when Bfa1 is hyperphosphorylated in anaphase in a Cdc5-dependent manner. Our work supports a model where Bfa1-Bub2 is activated by Glc7-Bud14 in parallel to Kin4. Upon spindle misalignment in this model, the SPOC kinase Kin4 phosphorylates Bfa1 to remove Bfa1 from the SPBs, away from the inhibitory kinase Cdc5, and Glc7-Bud14 dephosphorylates Bfa1 to remove its inhibitory phosphorylation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Glc7-Bud14 is a SPOC component</title><p>Our study identified Glc7, the budding yeast protein phosphatase 1, in association with its regulatory subunit Bud14 as a novel SPOC component that inhibits mitotic exit upon spindle mispositioning. Several lines of evidence led us to this conclusion. First, similar to other SPOC proteins, <italic>BUD14</italic> deletion rescued growth of several mutants impaired in mitotic exit, including the cold-sensitive <italic>lte1∆</italic> cells, the temperature-sensitive MEN mutants (<italic>cdc15-1</italic>, <italic>dbf2-2,</italic> and <italic>mob1-67</italic>), and the synthetic lethal <italic>lte1∆ spo12∆</italic> cells. Partial impairment of Glc7 function via the <italic>glc7-12</italic> mutant also rescued growth lethality of <italic>lte1∆ spo12∆</italic> cells. In addition, a Bud14 mutant that cannot bind Glc7 (<italic>bud14-F379A</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Knaus et al., 2005</xref>) also rescued cold sensitivity of <italic>lte1</italic>Δ cells. Second, similar to other SPOC proteins, <italic>BUD14</italic> deletion caused accumulation of multinucleated cells when spindle misalignment was induced in cells by deletion of <italic>KAR9</italic> or <italic>DYN1</italic>, implying that <italic>bud14∆</italic> cells are deficient in arresting upon mispositioning of the anaphase spindle. Of importance, similar to <italic>bud14∆</italic>, <italic>glc7-12</italic> and the <italic>bud14-F379A</italic> mutants were also SPOC deficient. Bud14 was implicated in the Dynein pathway of spindle positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Knaus et al., 2005</xref>). However, deletion of <italic>BUD14</italic> caused accumulation of multinucleated phenotypes not only in <italic>kar9∆</italic> but also in <italic>dyn1∆</italic> backgrounds, indicating that the function of Bud14 in Dynein activation is not contributing to the observed multinucleation phenotype. In line with this notion, time-lapse analysis revealed that <italic>bud14∆ kar9∆</italic> cells exited mitosis regardless of the spindle position. Furthermore, similar to other SPOC components, absence of <italic>BUD14</italic> did not affect the timing of mitotic exit when the spindle was correctly positioned but was crucial for delaying exit from mitosis when the spindle is misoriented. Data supporting this included the anaphase duration of <italic>bud14∆ kar9∆</italic> cells with normally positioned spindles, which was not different than that of <italic>kar9∆</italic> cells and also Mob1-GFP localization in <italic>bud14∆</italic> cells, which was not different than that in wild-type cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Glc7-Bud14 works in a pathway parallel to Kin4</title><p>Our data showed that Bud14 does not work in the Kin4 branch of SPOC. First, Kin4 localization and phosphorylation did not depend on Bud14. Second, Kin4 overexpression still caused toxicity in <italic>BUD14-</italic>deleted cells, indicating that Kin4, when produced at high levels, is able to keep Bfa1 active. Furthermore, time-lapse analysis of Bfa1 localization during spindle misalignment showed that Bfa1 is being removed from SPBs of <italic>bud14∆</italic> cells with misaligned spindles, while removal of Bfa1 from SPBs is largely a Kin4-dependent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Monje-Casas and Amon, 2009</xref>). Thus, Kin4 is able to exert its effect on Bfa1 in the absence of <italic>BUD14</italic>. These data altogether exclude the possibility that Bud14 works through Kin4 branch of the SPOC and suggests a model in which Glc7-Bud14 prevents mitotic exit of cells with misaligned spindles in a way parallel to Kin4. In support of this model, we observed an additive decrease in anaphase duration of <italic>kin4∆ bud14∆</italic> cells with misaligned spindles compared to the cells bearing single-gene deletions of <italic>KIN4</italic> or <italic>BUD14</italic>. Importantly, <italic>kin4∆ bud14∆</italic> cells completely failed to delay mitotic exit while <italic>kin4∆</italic> or <italic>bud14∆</italic> cells were able to slightly delay mitotic exit in response to spindle misorientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Accordingly, SPOC activity in <italic>kin4∆ bud14∆</italic> cells was as disrupted as in <italic>bfa1∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, we propose that Kin4 and Bud14 work in parallel and presence of both is critical for a robust SPOC arrest.</p><p>Interestingly, neither <italic>KIN4</italic> nor <italic>BUD14</italic> is required for spindle assembly checkpoint-dependent metaphase arrest of cells, whereas Bfa1-Bub2 is (data not shown; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>). This suggests that Kin4 and Bud14 become important to halt mitotic exit after APC/Cdc20 activation at the metaphase-anaphase transition. Anaphase onset also brings about the partial activation of Cdc14 by the FEAR pathway, which primes MEN activation in several ways, and Kin4 was shown to be dispensable for SPOC in cells lacking FEAR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Caydasi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Falk et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Scarfone et al., 2015</xref>). Consistently, Bud14 was also dispensable for SPOC in <italic>spo12∆</italic> cells that lack FEAR (data not shown). These data support that Kin4 and Bud14 work in parallel to keep Bfa1-Bub2 active in anaphase, to provide an arrest of anaphase cells prior to mitotic exit.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Glc7-Bud14 promotes dephosphorylation of Bfa1</title><p>The SPOC component Bfa1 is a highly phosphorylated protein in a cell cycle-dependent manner. So far, Bfa1 has been shown to be the target of kinases Cdk1, Cdc5, and Kin4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Caydasi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Geymonat et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>). Among these kinases, Cdc5 plays an inhibitory role, whereas Cdk1 and Kin4 play an activating role. It is possible that other kinases may also phosphorylate Bfa1. There has been an ongoing curiosity for phosphatases that act on Bfa1. So far, Cdc14 was shown to counteract Cdk1 phosphorylation of Bfa1 to partially inhibit Bfa1-Bub2 activity after anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Caydasi et al., 2017</xref>) and PP2A-Cdc55 was shown to counteract Cdc5-dependent phosphorylation of Bfa1 before anaphase onset, and hence downregulation of PP2A-Cdc55 activity after anaphase onset facilitates Bfa1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baro et al., 2013</xref>). Our data that Bfa1 appears hyperphosphorylated in <italic>lte1∆ bud14∆</italic> cells, in a Cdc5-dependent manner, during anaphase indicate that Glc7-Bud14 promotes dephosphorylation of hyperphosphorylated Bfa1 after anaphase onset. Consistently, overexpression of <italic>BUD14</italic> but not the <italic>bud14-F379A</italic>, which cannot bind Glc7, promoted dephosphorylation of Bfa1 in anaphase-arrested cells. Furthermore, through an in vitro dephosphorylation assay we showed that Glc7-Bud14 is able to dephosphorylate hyperphosphorylated Bfa1 purified from anaphase-arrested cells.</p><p>We further showed that Bfa1 and Bud14 interacted in yeast two hybrid assays. However, it is important to note that despite the observed yeast two hybrid-based interaction between Bfa1 and Bud14, and observed in vitro enzymatic activity of Glc7-Bud14 towards hyperphosphorylated Bfa1, we failed to detect Bfa1-Bud14 physical interaction via co-immunoprecipitation-based methods. Although this may indicate that only a minor pool of Bfa1 and Bud14 may be interacting in a very transient manner, further studies will be necessary to show the nature of this interaction. Of note, Bfa1-Bud14 interaction observed in the yeast two hybrid assays required presence of Bub2. This data not only rules out the possibility of a false-positive Bfa1-Bud14 yeast two hybrid interaction in wild-type cells, but also suggest that Bud14 may recognize Bfa1-Bub2 as a complex, or the interaction between Bud14 and Bfa1 may require in vivo modifications of Bfa1 that occur only when bound to Bub2. It has been known that hyperphosphorylated forms of Bfa1 abolish in the absence of Bub2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lee et al., 2001b</xref>). In addition, Bfa1 fails to localize to SPBs in the absence of Bub2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, Bfa1 phosphorylation by Cdc5 takes place at SPBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maekawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pereira et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>These findings, altogether, are suggestive of a model in which Glc7-Bud14 may recognize specifically a phosphorylated form of Bfa1. We favor a speculative model where Glc7-Bud14 dephosphorylates Cdc5-phosphorylated Bfa1 specifically upon spindle misalignment. This model is also in concordance with our previous conclusion that Glc7-Bud14 works in a parallel pathway to Kin4. Removal of Cdc5-dependent phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Glc7-Bud14 and isolation of Bfa1 away from the inhibitory Cdc5 kinase activity by Kin4 would concertedly reduce the levels of Cdc5-phosphorylated Bfa1 and thus work together to rapidly increase the levels of active Bfa1-Bub2.</p><p>Kin4 phosphorylation of Bfa1 prevents Cdc5 phosphorylation of Bfa1 both during SPOC activation (i.e., anaphase arrest of <italic>lte1∆</italic> cells that mimics SPOC arrest) and during the metaphase arrest upon nocodazole treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertazzi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">D’Aquino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>). However, unlike <italic>kin4∆</italic> cells, <italic>bud14∆</italic> cells arrested in metaphase through nocodazole treatment did not have hyperphosphorylated Bfa1 (data not shown). This discrepancy between Kin4 and Glc7-Bud14 may indicate alternative scenarios: first, Glc7-Bud14 may dephosphorylate sites other than those phosphorylated by Cdc5. Second, there may be redundant mechanisms of Bfa1 dephosphorylation at Cdc5 phosphorylation sites that especially dominate in metaphase. PP2A-Cdc55 was shown to counteract Bfa1 phosphorylation before anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baro et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, one possibility is that PP2A-Cdc55 and Glc7-Bud14 may work redundantly to dephosphorylate Cdc5-phosphorylated Bfa1 at different stages of the cell cycle, metaphase, and anaphase, respectively.</p><p>In addition, a truncated version of Bud14 that lacks the SH3 domain was also unable to inhibit mitotic exit. This truncated Bud14 is unable to localize at the bud cortex and is also unable to bind Glc7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Knaus et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Our yeast two hybrid analysis also revealed that Bud14-SH3∆ also have a reduced binding to Bfa1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, the loss in SPOC activity of the Bud14-SH3∆ can be attributed to its reduced association with Glc7 and Bfa1.</p><p>Intriguingly, another version of Bud14, which lacks the formin-regulatory motif (Bud14-5A), was able to yield a stronger interaction with Glc7 in our yeast two hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This increased association may explain why Bud14-5A provided a stronger SPOC activity than the Bud14 wild type based on SPOC functionality measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Bud14 deletion causes an increase in dSPB-bound levels of Bfa1-Bub2 and Tem1</title><p>We observed that cells lacking <italic>BUD14</italic> had more Bfa1, Bub2, and Tem1 localized at dSPB, making their localization more asymmetric. The asymmetry of Bfa1 at SPBs was shown to be dependent on Cdc5, as in the absence of Cdc5 activity Bfa1 localized more symmetrically to SPBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, presence of more Cdc5-phosphorylated Bfa1 in <italic>bud14∆</italic> cells may account for increased levels of Bfa1 at the dSPB, and also Bub2 and Tem1, which bind SPBs in association with Bfa1. Alternatively, Glc7-Bud14 may have other targets at the SPB that might normally decrease Bfa1-Bub2 docking sites at the SPBs.</p><p>Studies that used versions of Bfa1 forced to bind SPBs stably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Scarfone et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Valerio-Santiago and Monje-Casas, 2011</xref>), suggested that increased Bfa1-Bub2 localization at SPBs can lead to increased MEN activity, as it also causes increased Tem1 association with SPBs. Does altered localization of Bfa1-Bub2 and Tem1 observed in <italic>bud14∆</italic> contribute to mitotic exit? Analysis of Mob1 localization as a marker for MEN activation suggests that <italic>bud14∆</italic> cells do not activate MEN prematurely. This suggests that Bud14-Glc7 may be inhibiting mitotic exit by activation of Bfa1-Bub2 GAP complex through counteracting an inactivating phosphorylation of Bfa1 rather than through modulating SPB-bound levels of Bfa1-Bub2. We favor that the change in SPB localization is a consequence of the change in the phosphorylation status of Bfa1 or another target at the SPB.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Role of PP1 through the cell cycle</title><p>PP1 has numerous functions in the control of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Holder et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Moura and Conde, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nasa and Kettenbach, 2018</xref>). PP1, together with PP2A, is required for mitotic exit in animal cells by counteracting CDK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). In human cells, PP1 also regulates centrosome splitting by antagonizing the Nek2 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Meraldi and Nigg, 2001</xref>). In addition, PP1 facilitates abscission by counteracting Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of the centrosomal protein CEP55 during late mitosis and thus promoting its midbody localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). In meiosis of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, PP1 regulates G2/M transition by partially activating Cdc25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Perdiguero and Nebreda, 2004</xref>). From yeast to mammals, PP1 is essential for silencing of the spindle assembly checkpoint through stabilization of kinetochore microtubule interactions by counteracting Aurora B and potentially regulating recruitment of MCC to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kelly and Funabiki, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kotwaliwale and Biggins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ruchaud et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, we show that the budding yeast PP1, Glc7, in association with its regulatory subunit, Bud14, inhibits mitotic exit upon anaphase spindle mispositioning. This function of PP1 seems to be opposite to the mitotic exit, promoting the role of PP1 reported in animal cells. The fact that mitotic exit is achieved by the Cdc14 phosphatase in budding yeast, instead of the PP1 and PP2 phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Manzano-López and Monje-Casas, 2020</xref>), is likely the reason for Glc7 gaining a different function after the anaphase onset during the narrow time window until exit from mitosis.</p><p>Glc7-Bud14 was implicated in microtubule cortex interactions. Data based on Kin4 activity on Bfa1 indicates that SPOC mechanism may sense microtubule-cortex interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maekawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Monje-Casas and Amon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</xref>). How spindle alignment is sensed and this information activates SPOC still remain unknown. Due to their known function in regulating microtubule-cortex interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Knaus et al., 2005</xref>), Glc7-Bud14 constitutes a great candidate for sensing of such interactions. Considering that Glc7 (PP1) is a conserved phosphatase, similar mechanisms may be employed by higher eukaryotes. Future work will show whether Glc7-Bud14 may act as a sensor that translates the unattached microtubule-cortex interactions to the downstream SPOC machinery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast methods, strains, and growth</title><p>All yeast strains used are isogenic with S288C and are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

24 hr. The OD<sub>600</sub> of the cultures were adjusted to 1, and 10-fold serial dilutions were made using sterile PBS. 10 µl of serial dilutions were spotted on appropriate agar plates and grown at appropriate temperatures for 1–3 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cell cycle synchronizations</title><p>Cells were synchronized in G1 phase by treating log-phase cultures with 10 µg/ml α-factor (Sigma #T6901) dissolved in DMSO and incubating for one and a half doubling time. For synchronization in metaphase without spindles, 15 µg/ml nocodazole (Sigma #M1404) dissolved in DMSO were added to log-phase cultures and incubated for ~2 hr. The arrest was confirmed by microscopy after fixing the cells with 70% ethanol and resuspending in PBS containing 1 µg/ml 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma). For nocodazole arrest from G1 synchronized yeast cultures, cells were first treated with α-factor and released in nocodazole-containing YPAD. For telophase arrest of Gal1-UPL-Tem1-bearing cells, after cultures were grown to log-phase in raffinose-galactose-containing medium, cells were transferred into YPAD medium and grown for ~3 hr until cells (&gt;%90) were arrested with large buds and separated nuclei. For telophase arrest from G1-arrested cells: log-phase cultures of Gal1-UPL-Tem1-bearing cells grown in raffinose/galactose were treated with α-factor. 30 min before G1 synchronization was completed, glucose was added to the culture to give 2% final concentration. Then cells were released from α-factor in YPAD. The arrest was confirmed by microscopy after ethanol fixation of the cells and staining the nucleus with DAPI. As for anaphase arrest using <italic>cdc15-as</italic>, log-phase cell cultures grown in YP-raffinose medium were treated with 1NM-PP1 (2.5 µM) and incubated for 3 hr. Synchronization was judged based on microscopy after DAPI staining.

For time-lapse experiments, cells were prepared on glass-bottom Petri dishes (WVR 10810-054 Matsunami) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Caydasi and Pereira, 2017</xref>). Briefly, the glass center of the Petri dish was covered with 6% Concanavalin A (<italic>Canavalia ensiformis</italic> Jack Bean, type IV Sigma C2010-G). Excess Concanavalin A was washed out and 150 µl of culture was pipetted on the dish followed by a 30 min incubation at 30°C. Then, cells were aspirated gently and cells that were not attached on the dish were washed out with prewarmed fresh media.

summary:</bold></p><p>Spindle positioning checkpoint (SPOC) is a mechanism that prevents aneuploidy in yeast. Previous work has revealed the importance of the MEN pathway and its components in the regulation of aspects of the SPOC. Here through the use of a comprehensive and extensive array of approaches the authors propose an overlapping role for the kelch repeat protein BUD14 and protein phosphatase 1 (Glc7) in regulating SPOC. Given the role of phosphatases in spindle orientation and positioning in others organisms (such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>), these mechanisms may be more widespread.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Protein Phosphatase 1 in association with Bud14 inhibits mitotic exit in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>&quot; for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor (Mohan Balasubramanian) and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Rosella Visintin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that your work will not be considered further for publication by eLife at present. This is largely due to the extensive amount of revisions suggested. However, given that the editors' and referees' views on the significance of the work and the strength of conclusions, we will be happy to consider a thoroughly reworked manuscript. The revisions required includes a full rewrite (Dr. Visintin has kindly provided a large number of suggestions to this effect) as well as better quantitation and a few other mechanistic experiments (suggested by both referees).</p><p>The editors and the referees are enthusiastic about this field of work and the fact that you have identified Bud14 as a novel component of the Spindle position checkpoint. They appreciate that insights developed from your work can help understand related processes in other organisms as well. The referees also appreciate the case you have built on the interplay between Bud14, PP1, and the MEN signaling network. But both referees have raised a number of major concerns that are listed verbatim below, addressing which will help in revising this work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors aim to uncover novel regulators of the Spindle position checkpoint (SPOC), and the results have implications in understanding the signaling cross-talk between mitotic exit and spindle position. The authors initially show that Bud14 deletion can rescue growth defects of mitotic exit deficient cells and based on these observations, they hypothesize that Bud14 may play a role in the activation of Spindle Position Checkpoint (SPOC). They use genetic, microscopic, and biochemical tools to test their hypothesis. The genetic and microscopic analysis presented in the manuscript demonstrates that Bud14 is involved is directly involved in SPOC activation upon spindle misalignment and is convincing despite a few minor issues. They also provide data that this effect exerted by Bud14 on SPOC may require its interaction with PP1 phosphatase Glc7; however, the involvement of Glc7 is not directly shown in all assays. Building on the genetic evidence, the biochemical analysis presented in the manuscript attempts to test whether Glc7 in association with Bud14 dephosphorylates Bfa1 and helps in its activation, but the biochemical data shown to support this claim is not sufficiently convincing and has problems in experimental design and interpretation. The data does not provide clear evidence to demonstrate that Glc7 dephosphorylates Bfa1 and lacks empirical evidence of the effect of the same on Bfa1. Overall, the study succeeds in building a preliminary case for the role of Glc7-Bud14 but lacks the mechanistic details of how they regulate bfa1 activity during normal or misaligned spindle positioning.</p><p>In this manuscript Kocakaplan et al, have identifies the role of Bud14-Glc7 as a novel regulator of SPOC by controlling Bfa1 activity through dephosphorylation. This study provides a very preliminary insight into Bud14-Glc7 role in Spindle Position Checkpoint. In addition, the majority of the results presented in this manuscript need further detailed experiments and analysis to support the claims made by the authors. Some of the interpretations of data are largely not convincing (i.e., Glc7-Bud14 dependent dephosphorylation of Bfa1 in vivo and in vitro). Further mechanistic insights of Glc7-Bud14 role in regulating MEN component (Bfa1) are strongly required. Over all the initial findings by Kocakaplan et al seem interesting observations in the field of SPOC and MEN regulation.</p><p>1) In Figure 1, the authors have shown that Bud14 genetically interacts with MEN components and Bud14 deletion rescues growth defects of MEN-ts mutants. Based on these observations, they hypothesize that Bud14 may be involved in mitotic exit inhibition and acting upstream of MEN pathway. The data presented support the conclusion, but the authors should mention the restrictive temperatures of MEN-ts mutants used in Figure 1C.</p><p>2) In Figure 2, the authors show that Bud14 deletion causes a deficiency of SPOC arrest upon spindle misalignment by comparing anaphase duration with Kar9 null cells. Bud14 is also shown to have synthetic sick interaction with Kar9. The behaviour of Bud14 is similar to the behaviour of Kin4, which is already known to be involved in SPOC activation. The data presented in the figure collectively suggest a role for Bud14 in SPOC arrest activation and supports the conclusions made by the authors. However, there are no statistics shown in Figure 2A and 2B to determine whether the differences observed are significant or not.</p><p>3) In Figure 3, the authors show that Glc7-Bud14 interaction is important for Bud14 role in SPOC and its function in SPOC is independent of its function in Bnr1-regulation. The data supports the conclusions well except for the following discrepancies:</p><p>a) In Figure 3B, glc7 only rescues the lethality of lte1Δspo12Δ cells at its semi-permissive temperature (33C). This raises the question whether this condition represents a Glc7 deficient condition. The authors should address this.</p><p>b) No statistics in Fig 3C to ascertain significance between differences.</p><p>c) In Figure 3D, the introduction of bud14-F379A mutant in kar9Δbud14Δ cells shows partial rescue of the multi-nucleate phenotype of kar9Δbud14Δ cells (compare black bars). This observation challenges the importance of Glc7-Bud14 interaction in activating SPOC. Also, no statistics is provided to ascertain the significance of differences.</p><p>4) In Figure 4, the authors demonstrate that Bud14 interacts with Bfa1 and Bub2 is important for this interaction. The authors should also check these interactions using the already used Bud14 mutants in Figure 3 to get more insight into the nature of these interactions. In addition to Bud14, they should also check Glc7 interaction with these proteins to support the idea that Glc7-Bud14 interaction is necessary for SPOC activation.</p><p>5) In Figure 5, the authors show that more Bfa1 associates with SPBs, especially dSPB in Bud14Δ cells. They also show that unlike Kin4 deletion, Bud14 depletion does not change in the asymmetric localization of Bfa1 between the two SPBs but merely causes an increase in Bfa1 accumulation at SPBs irrespective of spindle misalignment. These observations suggest a role for Bud14 in controlling Bfa1 sequestration at the SPB and further support the idea that Kin4 and Bud14 work independently in different pathways in SPOC.</p><p>6) In Figure 6, the authors show that Bfa1 may be dephosphorylated by Bud14 as there is the accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated Bfa1 in lte1Δbud14Δ and lte1Δkin4Δ cells. The authors argue that like Kin4, Bud14 activity may be counteracting the effect of Cdc5 kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Bfa1. However, the data has the following discrepancies:</p><p>7) In Figure 6C, the effect of the phosphatase inhibitor Okadaic acid is not striking even at high concentration (lane 3). Since the effect is so small, I suggest the authors to quantify the effect for better visualization of the reader.</p><p>8) Based on Figure 6C, the authors make the conclusion that Glc7 promotes dephosphorylation of Bfa1 (lines 342-343 in text), but Okadaic acid is not a specific inhibitor for Glc7. It can also inhibit Cdc55-PP2A and other phosphatases (i.e., Cdc14), which is known to dephosphorylate Bfa1 so this conclusion cannot be made until the contribution of Cdc55 can be separated from the contribution of Glc7.</p><p>9) In Figure 6D, the bands in Lane 1,2,3 show very little presence of Bfa1-HA (measured using anti-HA antibody) as compared to Lanes 4,5,6. Considering that equal amounts of Bfa1-HA were used for the in vitro phosphatase assay, the levels of Bfa1-HA in all lanes should be approximately equal. This can potentially confound analysis of the assay. The authors should also check Bfa1 dephosphorylation in the presence of both Bud14 and Glc7 as that represents the in vivo condition. The experiment should be replicated to prove the reproducibility of the observed result.</p><p>10) In Figure 6D, Bud14 addition has no visible effect on the phosphorylation status of Bfa1, but the authors come to a totally opposite conclusion in Lines 349-352 in the text.</p><p>11) In Figure 7, the authors show that the percentage of cells with Bud14 showing bud cortex localization decreases upon spindle misalignment, but this could just be a consequence of prolonged mitotic arrest due to SPOC. The data presented in the figure does not contribute much to the main story of the paper. As an addition, the authors should also check co-localization of Bud14, Glc7 and Bfa1 during the cell cycle in cells with normal and misaligned spindles to test their hypothesis that Glc7-Bud14 complex dephosphorylates Bfa1 to activate SPOC.</p><p>In summary, the manuscript needs major revision with more emphasis on uncovering the molecular mechanism of how Glc7-Bud14 action on Bfa1 helps in SPOC.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript &quot;Protein Phosphatase 1 in association with Bud14 inhibits mitotic exit in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>&quot; Kocakaplan and colleagues identify Bud14 as a novel component of the Spindle Positioning Checkpoint (SPoC) in budding yeast. The SPoC is a surveillance pathway that prevents mitotic exit until the correct spindle position is achieved, hence preserving genome integrity. Importantly, this mechanism is likely to be conserved, at least functionally, in higher eukaryotes, making its characterization of high relevance. Although Bud14 was previously linked to the regulation of spindle positioning - through the modulation of Dyn1 and actin cables - this work unveils a novel connection between Bud14 and the regulation of mitotic exit. The authors show that Bud14 in complex with the PP1 phosphatase Glc7 de-phosphorylates the checkpoint effector Bfa1, thereby fully activating it.</p><p>The authors succeeded in the characterization of Bud14 as a novel component of the checkpoint; in the identification of its role within the pathway, that is via regulation of type 1 phosphatase Glc7 and in identifying Bfa1 as a target for the Bud14-Glc7 complex. The majority of the data supporting these aspects are solid, well controlled and sustained by the appropriate statistical analyses. Statistics for Figure 2C could be worked out better.</p><p>The paper is weaker in respect to the characterization of the molecular mechanism by which the Bud14-Glc7 complex affects Bfa1 activity. For this section data need to be clarified and extended.</p><p>Although I found the topic interesting and most of the data solid, I found the manuscript very difficult to read. My major criticism of the manuscript concerns the logic of the storyline. In particular it was not always clear to me the rationale by which experiments were performed and interpreted and consequently I found confusing the sequence in which the data were presented. I believe that the manuscript will benefit from a substantial re-writing and re-organization of the data. For the above-mentioned reason I organized my review into two distinct sections: the first aimed at suggesting an alternative way of presenting the data, the second focused on addressing few experimental concerns, whose elucidation could contribute in strengthening the authors conclusions.</p><p>Part one:</p><p>Following the identification of Bud14 as a novel mitotic exit inhibitor, the authors move to investigate its potential role in the SPoC. I would re-organize the manuscript starting from here:</p><p>Q1: Is Bud14 a component of the SPoC?</p><p>Rationale1: Inactivation of SPoC in cells with mis-aligned spindles results in formation of multinucleate and anucleate cells.</p><p>Experimental design1: assess the consequences of deleting BUD14 in cells lacking Kar9 or Dyn1 - both presenting mis-aligned spindles (I would introduce Dyn1 with the same logic used for Kar9) - looking at multinucleate cells as output</p><p>Results1: In both cases the percentage of multinucleate cells increases indicating that bud14Δ cells are defective in SPoC</p><p>Rationale1.2: To further investigate the role of Bud14 in SPoC assess the anaphase residence timing</p><p>Results1.2: Bud14 is a bona fide SPoC component</p><p>Q2: Is Bud14 working together or parallel to Kin4?</p><p>Rationale2: Epistasis experiments: kin4 bud14 double mutant and GAL-KIN4 bud14</p><p>Results2: They work in parallel</p><p>Q3: Which function of Bud14 is required for its SpoC activity?</p><p>Rationale3: Bud14 is reported to act as an inhibitor of formin and a regulatory subunit of PP1 Glc7. Assess whether one of these functions is required for SPoC activity</p><p>Experimental design3.1: Formin/actin experiment</p><p>Results3.1: Bud14 does not contribute to the SpoC via formin or actin regulation</p><p>Experimental design3.2: Test for Glc7 function</p><p>Results3.1: Bud14 contributes to SPoC activity at least in part through its association with Glc7. However the obs that lack of the SH3 domain leads to a more severe defect calls for an additional mechanism, likely involving Bud14 cortex localization</p><p>Q4: What is Bud14-Glc7 target within the SPoC?</p><p>Rationale4: the obs that: i)Kin4 targets Bfa1; ii)the multinucleate defect of kin4bud14 double mutants in kar9delta cells resembles the one of kar9bfa1 double mutants identify Bfa1 as a putative candidate</p><p>Experimental design4: 2-hybrid experiment and phosphorylation/de-phosphorylation experiments</p><p>Results4: Bfa1 is a target of the Bud14-Glc7 complex</p><p>Q5: How does Bud14-Glc7 affect Bfa1 activity?</p><p>Rationale5.1: Bfa1 regulated by changes in subcellular localization</p><p>Experimental design5.1: Test Bfa1 localization in cells lacking Bud14</p><p>Results5.1: does not seem to affect localization but rather Bfa1 amount</p><p>Q6: Does Bud14-Glc7 counteract Cdc5-mediated Bfa1 inhibitory phopshorylation?</p><p>Rationale5.2: Bfa1 is inhibited by Cdc5</p><p>Experimental design5.2: Test whether the Bud14-Glc7 complex counteracts Cdc5-mediated Bfa1 inhibitory phopshorylation</p><p>Results5.2: likely so</p><p>Part two: Specific comments</p><p>– p.7 line 126 = the authors state that &quot;deletion of mitotic exit inhibitors.... rescues growth lethality of MEN mutants&quot; . Add references. I would like that the authors include in the dilution series experiment at least one reported strain for immediate comparison. Moreover, I slightly disagree with the conclusion of the experiment in respect to the cdc5-10 mutants. To me this mutant is not rescued by BUD14 deletion, which is ok given the central role of Cdc5 in controlling Cdc14 activity.</p><p>– p.8 I would move the concepts expressed from line 153 to 158 to the discussion</p><p>– Figure 2: (A-B) As a control I would include also a bfa1Δ bud14Δ double mutant strain in this analysis. (C) better statistical analysis</p><p>– p.10 line 192 :&quot;Similar to bud14Δ kar9Δ (add kar9Δ)... &quot; . Moreover, I slightly disagree with the conclusion here. The phenotype of the bud14Δ kar9Δ double mutant cells is more severe than both bud14-Φ379Α kar9Δ and glc7-ts kar9Δ associated phenotypes.

The SPoC is a surveillance pathway that prevents mitotic exit until the correct spindle position is achieved, hence preserving genome integrity. Importantly, this mechanism is likely to be conserved, at least functionally, in higher eukaryotes, making its characterization of high relevance. Although Bud14 was previously linked to the regulation of spindle positioning - through the modulation of Dyn1 and actin cables - this work unveils a novel connection between Bud14 and the regulation of mitotic exit. The authors propose that Bud14 in complex with the PP1 phosphatase Glc7 de-phosphorylates the checkpoint effector Bfa1, thereby fully activating it.</p><p>The authors succeeded in the characterization of Bud14 as a novel component of the checkpoint; in the identification of its role within the pathway, that is via regulation of type 1 phosphatase Glc7 and in identifying Bfa1 as a target for the Bud14-Glc7 complex. The majority of the data supporting these conclusions are solid, well controlled and sustained by the appropriate statistical analyses.</p><p>Building from genetic evidence the authors take a biochemical approach to address the molecular mechanism by which the Bud14-Glc7 complex affects Bfa1 activity. They propose that the Bud14-Glc7 complex dephosphorylates Bfa1 and this leads to activation of the checkpoint effector Bfa1-Bub2 complex.

The authors use genetic and biochemical experiments to characterize the activity of Bud14 in SPoC. Firstly, the authors show that Bud14 deletion rescues lethality of MEN-ts mutants and also causes deficient SPOC. Next, they show that the activity of Bud14 in SPoC is independent of its activity in actin regulation via Bnr1 and that Bud14-Glc7 interaction is necessary for its role in activating SPoC. They further show that Bud14-Glc7 exerts their function on SPoC via Bfa1 dephosphorylation. Their data supports a model where Bfa1 is dephosphorylated by Bud14-Glc7 complex, which may inhibit its MEN-promoting activity to activate SPoC.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this study, the authors aim to uncover novel regulators of the Spindle position checkpoint (SPOC), and the results have implications in understanding the signaling cross-talk between mitotic exit and spindle position. The authors initially show that Bud14 deletion can rescue growth defects of mitotic exit deficient cells and based on these observations, they hypothesize that Bud14 may play a role in the activation of Spindle Position Checkpoint (SPOC). They use genetic, microscopic, and biochemical tools to test their hypothesis. The genetic and microscopic analysis presented in the manuscript demonstrates that Bud14 is involved is directly involved in SPOC activation upon spindle misalignment and is convincing despite a few minor issues. They also provide data that this effect exerted by Bud14 on SPOC may require its interaction with PP1 phosphatase Glc7; however, the involvement of Glc7 is not directly shown in all assays. Building on the genetic evidence, the biochemical analysis presented in the manuscript attempts to test whether Glc7 in association with Bud14 dephosphorylates Bfa1 and helps in its activation, but the biochemical data shown to support this claim is not sufficiently convincing and has problems in experimental design and interpretation. The data does not provide clear evidence to demonstrate that Glc7 dephosphorylates Bfa1 and lacks empirical evidence of the effect of the same on Bfa1. Overall, the study succeeds in building a preliminary case for the role of Glc7-Bud14 but lacks the mechanistic details of how they regulate bfa1 activity during normal or misaligned spindle positioning.</p><p>In this manuscript Kocakaplan et al, have identifies the role of Bud14-Glc7 as a novel regulator of SPOC by controlling Bfa1 activity through dephosphorylation. This study provides a very preliminary insight into Bud14-Glc7 role in Spindle Position Checkpoint. In addition, the majority of the results presented in this manuscript need further detailed experiments and analysis to support the claims made by the authors. Some of the interpretations of data are largely not convincing (i.e., Glc7-Bud14 dependent dephosphorylation of Bfa1 in vivo and in vitro). Further mechanistic insights of Glc7-Bud14 role in regulating MEN component (Bfa1) are strongly required. Over all the initial findings by Kocakaplan et al seem interesting observations in the field of SPOC and MEN regulation.</p><p>1) In Figure 1, the authors have shown that Bud14 genetically interacts with MEN components and Bud14 deletion rescues growth defects of MEN-ts mutants. Based on these observations, they hypothesize that Bud14 may be involved in mitotic exit inhibition and acting upstream of MEN pathway. The data presented support the conclusion, but the authors should mention the restrictive temperatures of MEN-ts mutants used in Figure 1C.</p></disp-quote><p>We now mention the restrictive temperatures of the MEN-ts mutants (page 8 lines 137-139). We also replaced the figure for this data (Figure 1C) to include <italic>BFA1</italic> deletion as a control for comparison of rescue of MEN-ts mutants, as suggested by Reviewer 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 2, the authors show that Bud14 deletion causes a deficiency of SPOC arrest upon spindle misalignment by comparing anaphase duration with Kar9 null cells. Bud14 is also shown to have synthetic sick interaction with Kar9. The behaviour of Bud14 is similar to the behaviour of Kin4, which is already known to be involved in SPOC activation. The data presented in the figure collectively suggest a role for Bud14 in SPOC arrest activation and supports the conclusions made by the authors. However, there are no statistics shown in Figure 2A and 2B to determine whether the differences observed are significant or not.</p></disp-quote><p>We now included statistics for all SPOC functionality assays shown throughout the paper including the Figure 2A and 2B. To have a simpler representation and better comparison of SPOC functionality we calculated the “SPOC deficiency index” which shows the ratio of percentage of cells with multi-nucleated phenotypes to the percentage of cells with mispositioned separated nuclei. This way of quantifying the SPOC functionality normalizes the data for fluctuations in percentage of cells with misaligned spindle among different experiments and among different samples. Therefore, it allows for better comparison and statistics.</p><p>Nevertheless, we are also including the raw data for these experiments as source data, so the percentage cell quantifications that are used for these calculations are also available. We are also including all statistical outcomes in this source data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 3, the authors show that Glc7-Bud14 interaction is important for Bud14 role in SPOC and its function in SPOC is independent of its function in Bnr1-regulation. The data supports the conclusions well except for the following discrepancies:</p><p>a) In Figure 3B, glc7 only rescues the lethality of lte1Δspo12Δ cells at its semi-permissive temperature (33C). This raises the question whether this condition represents a Glc7 deficient condition. The authors should address this.</p></disp-quote><p>We assessed <italic>glc7-12</italic> functionality at different temperatures based on reported phenotypes associated with Glc7 loss/reduction of function. Accordingly, phenotypes investigated were growth, HU sensitivity and accumulation of large-budded cells with single nucleus. This data is presented in Figure 4-Supplement 1. These data indicate that <italic>glc7-12</italic> is partially inactivated at 33 C-35 C with respect to its known functions in DNA damage response and spindle assembly checkpoint inactivation, and fully inactivated at 37 C based on growth. Our data additionally shows that this partial inactivation is also true for function of Glc7 in mitotic exit. In addition, we now show the growth phenotype of <italic>lte1Δspo12Δglc7-12</italic> not only at 33 C but also at 35 C in Figure 4C. Also, partial inactivation of Glc7 is now clearly stated in the text (Pages 14, lines 276290). The growth rescue and SPOC functionality of <italic>glc7-12</italic> is now shown in Figure 4C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) No statistics in Fig 3C to ascertain significance between differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We now included statistics for this experiment (data is now shown in Figure 4D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) In Figure 3D, the introduction of bud14-F379A mutant in kar9Δbud14Δ cells shows partial rescue of the multi-nucleate phenotype of kar9Δbud14Δ cells (compare black bars). This observation challenges the importance of Glc7-Bud14 interaction in activating SPOC. Also, no statistics is provided to ascertain the significance of differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank reviewers for raising this point. In the previous version of the manuscript, pRS416 ADH-BUD14-F379A plasmid (pMK131) was used for SPOC functionality assays of Bud14-F379A. This plasmid, where Bud14 was expressed under ADH promoter did not allow us to detect Bud14 expression because Bud14 was untagged in the construct. To control for any difference in Bud14 expression levels, we now constructed a new plasmid that contains GFP-Bud14-F379A under the Bud14 native promoter (pHK002). This construct also let us analyze Bud14 expression levels. In the current version of the manuscript, we repeated all SPOC functionality assays using centromeric plasmids containing GFP-<italic>BUD14</italic> under its native promoter (pMK60, pDKY001, pDKY003 and pHK002) (Figure 3A, Figure 4B). We also analyzed the expression of all ectopic Bud14 versions used in the SPOC functionality experiments (Figure 3 - Supplement 1A). In the experiments using these plasmids, the SPOC deficiency index of <italic>BUD14</italic>-F379A was not statistically different than the SPOC deficiency index of cells containing the empty plasmid but was significantly different from cells expressing wild type <italic>BUD14</italic> (Figure 4B). Statistics for pairwise comparisons were shown in the figure as well as in the source data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 4, the authors demonstrate that Bud14 interacts with Bfa1 and Bub2 is important for this interaction. The authors should also check these interactions using the already used Bud14 mutants in Figure 3 to get more insight into the nature of these interactions. In addition to Bud14, they should also check Glc7 interaction with these proteins to support the idea that Glc7-Bud14 interaction is necessary for SPOC activation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank to the reviewer for this suggestion. We now show the interaction of Bfa1 with the Bud14 mutants used in the study (Figure 5C). We also analyzed interaction of Glc7 with the Bud14 mutants (Figure 3- Figure Supplement 1B) and with SPOC components (Figure 5 – Figure Supplement 1). We recapitulated the published interaction loss between Glc7 and BUD14-F379A (Figure 3- Figure Supplement 1B). Of note, Bfa1 interaction with Bud14-F379A was similar to Bfa1 interaction with Bud14 wild type in our yeast two hybrid assays (Figure 5C), whereas Glc7 interaction with Bud14-F379A was completely diminished. This data shows that Bud14-F379A is defective in Glc7 binding but not in Bfa1 binding and supports the use of Bud14-F379A to assess contribution of Glc7-Bud14 to mitotic exit, SPOC and Bfa1 hyperphosphorylation.</p><p>We also recapitulated the published interaction loss between Glc7 and Bud14ΔSH3 mutant (Figure 3- Figure Supplement 1B). We further found that interaction of Bfa1 with Bud14ΔSH3 mutant was reduced when compared to Bfa1 interaction with the wild type Bud14 (Figure 5C). With this data we can now explain the SPOC functionality loss observed in the Bud14ΔSH3 mutant.</p><p>Curiously, we also observed that the interaction of Glc7 with Bud14-5A was enhanced compared to the Glc7-Bud14 wild type interaction (Figure 3- Figure Supplement 1B). However, interaction of Bfa1-Bud14 and Bfa1Bud14-5A was similar in our yeast two hybrid assays (Figure 5C). This data now can explain the significantly increased SPOC proficiency (decreased SPOC deficiency index) of the Bud14-5A mutant (Figure 3A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 5, the authors show that more Bfa1 associates with SPBs, especially dSPB in Bud14Δ cells. They also show that unlike Kin4 deletion, Bud14 depletion does not change in the asymmetric localization of Bfa1 between the two SPBs but merely causes an increase in Bfa1 accumulation at SPBs irrespective of spindle misalignment. These observations suggest a role for Bud14 in controlling Bfa1 sequestration at the SPB and further support the idea that Kin4 and Bud14 work independently in different pathways in SPOC.</p></disp-quote><p>We now mentioned in the text that this data is in support of the idea that Kin4 and Bud14 work independently in different pathways in SPOC (Page 11 lines 224-228, Page 17 lines 369-372).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 6, the authors show that Bfa1 may be dephosphorylated by Bud14 as there is the accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated Bfa1 in lte1Δbud14Δ and lte1Δkin4Δ cells. The authors argue that like Kin4, Bud14 activity may be counteracting the effect of Cdc5 kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Bfa1. However, the data has the following discrepancies:</p><p>7) In Figure 6C, the effect of the phosphatase inhibitor Okadaic acid is not striking even at high concentration (lane 3). Since the effect is so small, I suggest the authors to quantify the effect for better visualization of the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the effect of the inhibitor is minor in this experimental setup. This is most likely due to the already hyperphosphorylated nature of Bfa1 in the anaphase cell extracts. With the suggestion from the Reviewer 2, we now replaced this experiment with another experimental set up, which allowed us better visualization of the differences in Bfa1 migration (page 18-19, lines 389-398, Figures 7D, 7E, 7F). We now show the phosphorylation status of Bfa1 from anaphase arrested cells (via usage of analog sensitive allele of Cdc15-as) with and without overexpression of <italic>BUD14</italic> (Figure 7D-E) and <italic>bud14-F379A</italic>, which cannot bind Glc7 (Figure 7E-F). Our results show that overexpression of <italic>BUD14</italic> but not the <italic>Bud14-F379A</italic> causes a downshift in Bfa1 phosphorylation. This finding indicates a Bud14-Glc7 dependent Bfa1 dephosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Based on Figure 6C, the authors make the conclusion that Glc7 promotes dephosphorylation of Bfa1 (lines 342-343 in text), but Okadaic acid is not a specific inhibitor for Glc7. It can also inhibit Cdc55-PP2A and other phosphatases (i.e., Cdc14), which is known to dephosphorylate Bfa1 so this conclusion cannot be made until the contribution of Cdc55 can be separated from the contribution of Glc7.</p></disp-quote><p>The new experiment (Figure 7D-E) did not require the use of Okadaic acid which also avoids any concern of unspecific inhibition of PP2A along with PP1. Nevertheless, we were curious about the contribution of Cdc55 on Bfa1 dephosphorylation during anaphase. Although we did not show it in manuscript, we monitored the contribution of Cdc55 on Bfa1 hypophosphorylation in <italic>lte1Δ</italic> cells in the same experiment shown in Figure 7A-B. Unlike <italic>bud14Δ</italic>, <italic>cdc55Δ</italic> did not cause hyperphosphorylation of Bfa1 in <italic>lte1Δ</italic> cells during anaphase. This was consisted with the previous reports that showed PP2A-CDC55 promotes Bfa1 dephosphorylation in metaphase, and at anaphase onset Cdc55PP2A activity is downregulated in a Separase-dependent manner to allow Cdc5 phosphorylation of Bfa1 and thus MEN activation (Baro <italic>et al</italic>, 2013; Queralt <italic>et al</italic>, 2006).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In Figure 6D, the bands in Lane 1,2,3 show very little presence of Bfa1-HA (measured using anti-HA antibody) as compared to Lanes 4,5,6. Considering that equal amounts of Bfa1-HA were used for the in vitro phosphatase assay, the levels of Bfa1-HA in all lanes should be approximately equal. This can potentially confound analysis of the assay. The authors should also check Bfa1 dephosphorylation in the presence of both Bud14 and Glc7 as that represents the in vivo condition. The experiment should be replicated to prove the reproducibility of the observed result.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the loading problem in this figure. We replicated the experiment and replaced the figure with a new one (now shown as Figure 7G and Figure 7- Figure Supplement 2B). We also included a quantification of the observed changes in Bfa1 phosphorylation by presenting the ratio of intensity of the slow migrating Bfa1 forms to the intensity of fast migrating Bfa1 forms. For both assays that used Glc7TAP (Figure 7G) and Bud14-TAP (Figure 7-Figure supplement 2B) we performed 4 independent experiments. These experiments show that addition of Glc7-TAP or Bud14-TAP causes a downshift in Bfa1, which was greatly prevented by inhibitor addition. Importantly, the downshift of Bfa1 upon Glc7-Bud14 addition was consistent in all experiments and the differences were statistically significant.</p><p>It is also worth stating that due to inherent variabilities in these phosphatase reactions, the variation among independent experiments is relatively high. The variation comes from several factors:</p><p>1. Glc7 and Bud14 are pulled down on IgG beads and used freshly in thereaction in each experiment.</p><p>2. For each experiment Bfa1-3HA was purified from anaphase arrestedyeast cells freshly, as the hyperphosphorylated Bfa1-3HA diminished upon storage.</p><p>3. Okadaic acid was prepared freshly for each experiment, as we realizedlong term storage was problematic in our hands.</p><p>4. Separation of Bfa1 phospho-forms in Western blot is inherentlyvariable, depending on variation in the home-made gels, buffers, blotting etc.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In Figure 6D, Bud14 addition has no visible effect on the phosphorylation status of Bfa1, but the authors come to a totally opposite conclusion in Lines 349-352 in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for this confusion. As explained above in detail (see response to point 9), we now show another blot for Bud14 addition with the control lane loaded just next to Bud14 (Figure 7-Figure supplement 2B). We also included a quantification of this experiment. The data comes from 4 independent experiments. The pattern was consistent in all experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) In Figure 7, the authors show that the percentage of cells with Bud14 showing bud cortex localization decreases upon spindle misalignment, but this could just be a consequence of prolonged mitotic arrest due to SPOC. The data presented in the figure does not contribute much to the main story of the paper. As an addition, the authors should also check co-localization of Bud14, Glc7 and Bfa1 during the cell cycle in cells with normal and misaligned spindles to test their hypothesis that Glc7-Bud14 complex dephosphorylates Bfa1 to activate SPOC.</p><p>In summary, the manuscript needs major revision with more emphasis on uncovering the molecular mechanism of how Glc7-Bud14 action on Bfa1 helps in SPOC.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this data does not contribute much to the main story of the paper as the localization change is likely a consequence of prolonged mitotic arrest. We removed this figure from the current version of the manuscript as suggested by both reviewers. However, it is worth mentioning that we performed more localization experiments, which we would like to share with the reviewers only. We did check Glc7 localization and observed that Glc7 localizes to the poles of the spindles during anaphase regardless of the spindle position. Glc7 was already shown to be an interaction partner of kinetochore proteins and to be localizing at the poles. Because kinetochores of the budding yeast cluster underneath the SPBs, we don’t know whether this localization is at the SPBs or at the kinetochore clusters. To discriminate this, we used a temperature sensitive mutant (<italic>ndc10-1</italic>) in which chromosomes/kinetochores remain only at one pole during anaphase. However, as we shift the temperature from 30 to 37 C for inactivation of <italic>ndc10-1</italic>, Glc7 pole localization become completely undetectable in both wild type and <italic>ndc10-1</italic> cells. Glc7 localization at poles is normally very faint and we think that the raise in the temperature may cause an increase in the background noise which may interfere with the signal detection even in wild type cells. Therefore, at the moment, we are unable to address whether Glc7 is at SPBs or kinetochores during spindle misalignment. Nevertheless, we are not showing any of this data and as suggested by both reviewers we removed Bud14 localization data from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Although I found the topic interesting and most of the data solid, I found the manuscript very difficult to read. My major criticism of the manuscript concerns the logic of the storyline.

I believe that the manuscript will benefit from a substantial re-writing and re-organization of the data.

(C) better statistical analysis</p></disp-quote><p>We added this control in the new version of the manuscript (Figure 2A, page 10, lines 192-194) and we performed one-way Anova as statistical analysis of the data shown in Figure 2C. All the statistics of the pairwise comparisons were shown in the source data for Figure 2C, whereas only comparisons of normal and misaligned spindles were indicated on the figure to avoid cluttering of the graph.</p><p>In addition, as was raised by reviewer #1 we now included statistics for all population-based SPOC functionality assays shown throughout the paper including the Figure 2A and 2B. To have a simpler representation and better comparison of SPOC functionality we calculated the “SPOC deficiency index” which shows the ratio of percentage of cells with multinucleated phenotypes to the percentage of cells with mispositioned separated nuclei. This way of quantifying the SPOC functionality normalizes the data for fluctuations in percentage of cells with misaligned spindle among different experiments and among different samples. Therefore, it allows for better comparison and statistics. Nevertheless, we are also including the raw data for these experiments as source data, so the percentage cell quantifications that are used for these calculations are also available. We are also including all statistical outcomes in this source data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– p.10 line 192 :&quot;Similar to bud14Δ kar9Δ (add kar9Δ)... &quot; . Moreover, I slightly disagree with the conclusion here. The phenotype of the bud14Δ kar9Δ double mutant cells is more severe than both bud14-Φ379Α kar9Δ and glc7-ts kar9Δ associated phenotypes. This suggests an additional role of Bud14 in inhibiting mitotic exit in line with the phenotype observed in Bud14 mutants lacking the SH3 domain.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. The same concern for BUD14-F379A was also raised by the reviewer #1 (point 3c). Here is our response:</p><p>In the previous version of the manuscript, pRS416 ADH-BUD14-F379A plasmid (pMK131) was used for SPOC functionality assays of Bud14F379A. This plasmid, where Bud14 was expressed under ADH promoter did not allow us to detect Bud14 expression because Bud14 was untagged in the construct. To control for any difference in Bud14 expression levels, we now constructed a new plasmid that contains GFP-Bud14-F379A under the Bud14 native promoter (pHK002). This construct also let us analyze Bud14 expression levels. In the current version of the manuscript, we repeated all SPOC functionality assays using centromeric plasmids containing GFP-<italic>BUD14</italic> under its native promoter (pMK60, pDKY001, pDKY003 and pHK002) (Figure 3A, Figure 4B). We also analyzed the expression of all ectopic Bud14 versions used in the SPOC functionality experiments (Figure 3 - Supplement 1A). In the experiments using these plasmids, the SPOC deficiency index of <italic>BUD14</italic>-F379A was not statistically different than the SPOC deficiency index of cells containing the empty plasmid but was significantly different from cells expressing wild type <italic>BUD14</italic> (Figure 4B). Statistics for pairwise comparisons were shown in the figure as well as in the source data.</p><p>Furthermore, we now have an explanation for the phenotype of Bud14 lacking the SH3 domain. Based on yeast two hybrid analysis, we showed that interaction was abolished between Glc7 and Bud14ΔSH3 mutant (Figure 3- Figure Supplement 1B). This interaction loss was also published before (Knaus <italic>et al</italic>, 2005). Through yeast two hybrid assays, we further found that interaction of Bfa1 with Bud14ΔSH3 mutant was also reduced (Figure 5C). Thus, the loss of SPOC function in Bud14ΔSH3 mutant can be attributed to loss of its interaction with Glc7 and Bfa1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– p.11 line 215 it is Figure 3F NOT 3E</p></disp-quote><p>This is changed in the current version of the manuscript (page 12, line 238). The corresponding figure is shown as Figure 3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– p.12 I would move the concepts expressed from line 225 to line 234 to the discussion. As a curiosity it would be interesting to see what is the phenotype of kel1bud14 double mutant cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We were also curious to see the phenotype of <italic>kel1Δbud14Δ</italic> double mutants. We analyzed the phenotype with respect to the ability to rescue <italic>lte1Δspo12Δ</italic> lethality and to cause SPOC deficiency. The SPOC deficiency of the double mutant was similar to the SPOC deficiency of the <italic>bud14Δ</italic>. Double mutants had a growth rescue phenotype more than the <italic>kel1Δ</italic> single mutant. The growth rescue of the double mutant was comparable to the rescue by <italic>bud14Δ</italic>, but the colony sizes were slightly reduced. This reduction was not observed on SC plates.</p><p>This data is in line with that Bud14 has more profound role in inhibition of MEN, and also suggests that the cellular roles of Kel1 and Bud14 may be more complex than we anticipated. We decided not to show this data in the manuscript to keep it simple and focused. Conclusions made in the manuscript are not contradicting with this data.</p><p>As we want to show the growth rescue differences between <italic>bud14Δ</italic>, <italic>kel1Δ</italic> and <italic>kel2Δ</italic> (in the <italic>lte1Δ</italic> and <italic>lte1Δspo12Δ</italic> backgrounds), we decided to keep this part of the manuscript in the results part (page 13, lines 255264). It can however be moved to the discussion as “data not shown” if necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2 - Figure supplement 1C - Please include the loading control for the western blot analysis. In this blot the 3 strains have significantly different amounts of Kin4 protein. Why is this? Overall I found it difficult to properly assess its mobility</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this blot. We now show another blot which also has a loading control (Figure 2 – Figure supplement 1D). Kin4 is hyperphosphorylated in <italic>rts1Δ</italic> cells, while this is not the case for wild type and <italic>bud14Δ</italic> cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– P.14 line 294 and 295 - Figure 5 Figure Supplement 1D not 1C</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for this mistake. This is changed in the current version of the manuscript (page 17, lines 348-349). The corresponding figure is shown as Figure 6 – Figure Supplement 1D in the current version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Are the altered amounts of Bfa1, Bub2 and Tem1 at SPB affecting MEN activity? how is Dbf2 localization in cells lacking Bud14?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question. To understand whether the increased Bfa1Bub2 and Tem1 recruitment to the dSPBs observed in <italic>bud14Δ</italic> cells may be affecting MEN activity, i.e may be causing premature activation of the MEN, we analyzed Mob1 SPB localization in these cells. We chose Mob1 over Dbf2 due to its brighter fluorescence signal. Mob1-GFP did not prematurely localize to SPBs in <italic>bud14Δ</italic> cells (Figure 6 – Figure Supplement 2A-C). The levels of Mob1-GFP at the SPBs of <italic>bud14Δ</italic> cells were not altered in anaphase either (Figure 6- Figure Supplement 2D-E). Thus, we conclude that despite the elevated levels of Bfa1-Bub2 and Tem1 at the dSPB, MEN activity is not enhanced by <italic>BUD14</italic> deletion in cells with normally aligned spindles. This experiment results are presented in the text (page 16, lines 336-345) and in Figure 6- Figure Supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I found the data presented in Figure 6 the weakest of the entire paper. (A) What is the white line between the 45 and 75 minute samples? have samples been run in different gels? If this is the case, why? Author should clearly state this.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. The samples were run in the same gel, but due to loss of the 60 min <italic>bud14Δ</italic> sample during protein extraction, we removed the lanes for 60min for all three samples from the image and added the white line instead, to clearly show that a lane was removed. To avoid confusion, we now show another blot from another experiment (Figure 7A-B). <italic>lte1Δkin4Δ</italic> and <italic>lte1Δ</italic> time-course series from the previous figure is now shown in another figure without the white line (Figure 7 – Figure Supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) I cannot fully appreciate differences in migration from the three samples. Please add a more sensitive loading control than poinceau.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the effect of the inhibitor is minor in this experimental setup. This is most likely due to the already hyperphosphorylated nature of Bfa1 in the anaphase cell extracts. Also considering the concerns raised by the Reviewer #1 (points # 7 and 8) with respect to usage of okadaic acid, this experiment is now replaced with Bud14 overexpression experiments (Figure 7D-E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>D) The western Blot it is too poor to appreciate differences.</p></disp-quote><p>(See also Reviewer #1 concern 9 and10). We apologize for the blot problem in this figure. We now repeated the experiments and replaced the figure with new ones (now shown as Figure 7G and Figure 7- Figure Supplement 2B). We also included a quantification of the observed changes in Bfa1 phosphorylation by presenting the ratio of intensity of the slow migrating Bfa1 forms to the intensity of fast migrating Bfa1 forms. Importantly, the downshift of Bfa1 upon Glc7 addition was consistent in all experiments and the differences were statistically significant (now shown as Figure 7G and Figure 7- Figure Supplement 2B). We believe that with these quantifications and data representation, the differences in Bfa1 mobility among samples are more noticeable.</p><p>It is however worth stating that due to inherent variabilities in these phosphatase reactions, the deviation among independent experiments is relatively high. The variation comes from several factors: 1. Glc7- and Bud14 are pulled down on IgG beads and used freshly in the reaction in each experiment. 2. For each experiment Bfa1-3HA was purified from anaphase arrested yeast cells freshly, as the hyperphosphorylated Bfa13HA diminished upon storage. 3. Okadaic acid was prepared freshly for each experiment, as we realized long term storage was problematic in our hands. 4. Separation of Bfa1 phospho-forms in Western blot is inherently variable, depending on variation in the home-made gels, buffers, blotting etc…</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To address the possibility that the Bud14-Glc7 complex antagonizes Cdc5-mediated Bfa1 phosphorylation, why not trying to assess the consequences of overexpressing Bud14 in lte1kin4 double mutant cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank to the reviewer for suggesting this very important experiment. We analyzed the effect of <italic>BUD14</italic> overexpression on Bfa1 phosphorylation (page 18-19, lines 389-398, Figures 7D, 7E, 7F). As Bud14 overexpression causes cells to arrest in a pre-anaphase state, we first arrested <italic>cdc15-as</italic> bearing cells in anaphase through 1NM-PP1 treatment and then induced Gal1-<italic>BUD14</italic> overexpression by addition of Galactose into the growth medium. Overexpression of <italic>BUD14</italic> (Figure 7D) caused a downshift in Bfa1 migration in anaphase arrested cells. We also analyzed the effect of <italic>bud14-F379A</italic> overexpression in the same experimental setup (Figure 7E). <italic>bud14-F379A</italic> overexpression did not cause a downshift in Bfa1 phosphorylation, while <italic>BUD14</italic> overexpression did (Figure 7E). The relative ratios of slow migrating and fast migrating forms of Bfa1 in this experiment were also presented (Figure 7F). With this data, now, we can clearly show the effect of Glc7-Bud14 on Bfa1 phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the bulk of Bfa1 phosphorylation in lte1kin4 cells is likely due to Cdc5, why not testing directly for this introducing a cdc5 conditional allele in these cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We now show that Bfa1 phosphorylation in <italic>bud14Δlte1Δ</italic> cells is Cdc5 dependent, using the <italic>cdc5-10</italic> conditional allele (Figure 7C and page 18, lines 386-388).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I would delete the paragraph probing for Bud14 localization. The data are not fully convincing and it does not add anything to the storyline.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by both reviewers, we now removed this data.
