manipulating brain networks with high spatial resolution are fundamental to study how neuronal ensembles drive behavior. Stimulation of neuronal ensembles using two-photon holographic techniques requires high-sensitivity actuators to avoid photodamage and heating. Moreover, two-photon-excitable opsins should be insensitive to light at wavelengths used for imaging. To achieve this goal, we developed a novel soma-targeted variant of the large-conductance blue-light-sensitive opsin CoChR (stCoChR). In the mouse cortex in vivo, we combined holographic two-photon stimulation of stCoChR with an amplified laser tuned at the opsin absorption peak and two-photon imaging of the red-shifted indicator jRCaMP1a. Compared to previously characterized blue-light-sensitive soma-targeted opsins in vivo, stCoChR allowed neuronal stimulation with more than 10-fold lower average power and no spectral crosstalk. The combination of stCoChR, tuned amplified laser stimulation, and red-shifted functional indicators promises to be a powerful tool for large-scale interrogation of neural networks in the intact brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>two-photon optogenetics</kwd><kwd>mouse cortex</kwd><kwd>soma targeting</kwd><kwd>CoChR</kwd><kwd>red-shifted functional indicators</kwd><kwd>jRCaMP1a</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>647725</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fellin</surname><given-names>Tommaso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 NS090576</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fellin</surname><given-names>Tommaso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19 NS107464</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fellin</surname><given-names>Tommaso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEEPER 101016787</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yizhar</surname><given-names>Ofer</given-names></name><name><surname>Fellin</surname><given-names>Tommaso</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>819496</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yizhar</surname><given-names>Ofer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGY0064/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yizhar</surname><given-names>Ofer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yizhar</surname><given-names>Ofer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ilse Katz Institute for Material Sciences and Magnetic Resonance Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yizhar</surname><given-names>Ofer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Adelis Brain Research Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yizhar</surname><given-names>Ofer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new soma-targeted variant of the large-conductance blue-light-sensitive opsin CoChR combined with advanced optical stimulation methods allows high-efficiency all-optical neuronal imaging and stimulation in mouse brain in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During information processing, storage, and retrieval, the electrical activity of most brain circuits is organized in complex spatial and temporal patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salinas and Sejnowski, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shahidi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shamir and Sompolinsky, 2006</xref>). The coding rules intrinsic to these activity patterns are believed to underlie fundamental operating principles of brain networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Panzeri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuste, 2015</xref>). Recent techniques for all-optical interrogation of neural circuits allow for the first time to causally investigate these coding rules with unprecedented spatial resolution in living mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrillo-Reid et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chettih and Harvey, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gill et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marshel et al., 2019</xref>; ). In particular, two-photon calcium imaging combined with two-photon optogenetics makes it possible to simultaneously monitor and manipulate dozens of neurons with near single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bovetti and Fellin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mardinly et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Packer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rickgauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). However, significant challenges still remain to be addressed to accurately interrogate neural circuits in vivo. First, since the average power of illumination used to stimulate neurons is proportional to the probability of introducing thermal damage to brain tissue and unwanted modulation of neuronal physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Owen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picot et al., 2018</xref>), maximizing the efficiency of optogenetic stimulation by increasing opsin excitation and photocurrent is of utmost importance. Thus, there is a need for the development of novel high-efficiency, large-conductance opsins and efficient illumination strategies for their two-photon activation. Second, the crosstalk between imaging and stimulation, that is, the unwanted activation of opsin-expressing neurons by imaging light, needs to be minimized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Packer et al., 2015</xref>). This effect is due to the overlap between the two-photon absorption spectra of the opsin and of the calcium sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Venkatachalam and Cohen, 2014</xref>), and it is typically pronounced for red-shifted opsins, such as C1V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>) and ReaChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2013</xref>), which are used in combination with blue-light-sensitive indicators (e.g. GCaMP6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2013</xref>]). This process may lead to non-negligible neuronal activation during two-photon imaging of the blue-light-sensitive indicator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Packer et al., 2015</xref>). The non-selective excitation of neurons in the field-of-view (FOV) due to this type of crosstalk could promote the formation of unwanted cell-assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carrillo-Reid et al., 2016</xref>) and bias the activity in the monitored area, complicating the interpretation of biological results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Emiliani et al., 2015</xref>). The use of blue-shifted opsins (e.g, ChR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nagel et al., 2003</xref>] and GtACR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Govorunova et al., 2015</xref>]) combined with red-shifted calcium sensors (e.g. jRCaMP1a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dana et al., 2016</xref>]) was proved to be a valid approach, which largely eliminates the effect of the imaging beam on opsin excitation while allowing simultaneous imaging and bidirectional manipulation of neural activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forli et al., 2018</xref>). However, the limited photocurrent of ChR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nagel et al., 2003</xref>) prevented the efficient stimulation of multiple neurons with low average power delivery to the brain tissue.</p><p>To address this limitation, we describe here a new high-efficiency blue-light-sensitive opsin (stCoChR), derived from the large-conductance opsin CoChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>), which was targeted to the soma using the Kv2.1 targeting sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lim et al., 2000</xref>). We combined stCoChR with holographic two-photon stimulation, low repetition rate laser source excitation tuned at the peak of the opsin absorption spectrum, and imaging of the red-shifted functional indicator jRCaMP1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dana et al., 2016</xref>) in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>stCoChR: a high-efficiency, soma-targeted, blue-light-sensitive opsin</title><p>In order to achieve efficient optogenetic excitation using minimal light power and to minimize crosstalk between optogenetic stimulation and jRCaMP1a imaging, we used the high-conductance, blue-light-sensitive opsin CoChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>). To improve the spatial specificity of stimulation, we restricted the presence of CoChR molecules to the somatic region, such that stimulating one cell body will lead to minimal photocurrents in nearby neuronal projections of other cells. For this purpose, we incorporated a soma-targeting sequence taken from the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel Kv2.1, which was previously found to reduce the presence of channels, including channelrhodopsins, in distal dendrites and axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lim et al., 2000</xref>). To generate soma-targeted CoChR (stCoChR), we appended the Kv2.1 motif C-terminally to the CoChR coding sequence, followed by a fluorophore (mScarlet or eGFP) which was separated from CoChR-Kv2.1 using the self-cleaving peptide P2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), leading to fluorescence labeling of the entire cell (EF1α-CoChR-Kv2.1-P2A-XFP; see Materials and methods). We expressed the non-targeted CoChR (hereafter CoChR) and the soma-targeted stCoChR in sparse sets of cortical neurons of mice using AAV injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also expressed the previously published somatic variant soCoChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shemesh et al., 2017</xref>), in which somatic targeting was achieved using a sequence from the kainate receptor KA2 subunit. We performed whole-cell recordings from opsin-expressing neurons in acute brain slices in order to measure the photocurrents elicited by each variant and their restriction to the somatic region. Upon two-photon (2P) scanning (λ = 940 nm) with a spiral pattern over the soma, photocurrents elicited by stCoChR did not differ from those elicited by CoChR, but were ~130-fold higher than those elicited by soCoChR under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- Supplementary Table 1; stCoChR: 1927.4 ± 283.3 pA, n = 10 cells; CoChR: 712.3 ± 188.9 pA, n = 11 cells; soCoChR: 14.9 ± 4.2 pA, n = 10 cells; Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc comparisons: stCoChR <italic>vs</italic> CoChR, p=0.11; stCoChR <italic>vs</italic> soCoChR, p=3.8E–6). Under one-photon (1P) full-field illumination covering the soma and neurites (illumination area ~0.66 mm<sup>2</sup>), photocurrents elicited by stCoChR were similar to those of CoChR, but were approximately 40-fold higher than photocurrents elicited by soCoChR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- Supplementary Table 2; stCoChR: 3709.5 ± 381.2 pA, n = 14 cells; CoChR: 3296.3 ± 452.4 pA, n = 14 cells; soCoChR: 91.8 ± 9.7 pA, n = 11 cells; Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc comparisons: stCoChR <italic>vs</italic> CoChR, p=0.87; stCoChR <italic>vs</italic> soCoChR, p=2.2E–5). As a measure for restriction of the opsin to the somatic region, we calculated the ratio between the photocurrents observed under 2P soma scanning and under 1P full-field illumination per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- Supplementary Table 3). We found that this ratio was higher for stCoChR than both CoChR and soCoChR, whereas it did not differ between soCoChR and CoChR (stCoChR: 0.53 ± 0.06, n = 10 cells; CoChR: 0.18 ± 0.04, n = 11 cells; soCoChR: 0.15 ± 0.03, n = 10 cells; Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc comparisons: stCoChR <italic>vs</italic> CoChR, p=8.4E-3; stCoChR <italic>vs</italic> soCoChR, p=1.3E-3; soCoChR <italic>vs</italic> CoChR, p=0.80), suggesting that the Kv2.1 motif in stCoChR concentrates the opsin molecules at the somatic region. This effect persisted when using a higher light power for 2P stimulation of soCoChR (40 mW instead of 15 mW; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, magenta and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- Supplementary Table 1,3). As another measure for soma restriction, we measured the photocurrents elicited by 2P spiral stimulation of selected points along the neurites of recorded cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found that the photocurrent in cells expressing stCoChR decayed at shorter distances when the stimulation spiral moved away from the soma along the path of the neurites compared with cells expressing CoChR, whereas the decay length constant did not differ between stCoChR and soCoChR and between soCoChR and CoChR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- Supplementary Table 4; stCoChR: τ<sub>decay</sub> = 16.1 ± 1.9 µm, n = 10 cells; CoChR: τ<sub>decay</sub> = 35.4 ± 6.6 µm, n = 11 cells; soCoChR: τ<sub>decay</sub> = 27.2 ± 6.2, n = 10 cells; Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc comparisons: stCoChR <italic>vs</italic> CoChR, p=3.8E-2; stCoChR <italic>vs</italic> soCoChR, p=0.46; soCoChR <italic>vs</italic> CoChR, p=0.43). Increasing the power of soCoChR stimulation from 15 mW to 40 mW resulted in a decay length constant similar to that of stCoChR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- Supplementary Table 4; τ<sub>decay</sub> = 17.2 ± 3.2, n = 9 cells; Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc comparisons: soCoChR under 40 mW <italic>vs</italic> CoChR under 15 mW, p=0.02; soCoChR under 40 mW <italic>vs</italic> stCoChR under 15 mW, p=0.94). These results suggest that stCoChR maintains the overall superior photocurrents characteristic of CoChR while a larger fraction of the current arises from opsin molecules in the somatic membrane.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of soma-targeted CoChR variants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example photocurrents recorded in the acute slice preparation from cortical neurons expressing either non-targeted CoChR, stCoChR or soCoChR upon two-photon scanning with a spiral pattern (10 µm diameter) over the soma (λ = 940 nm, 15 or 40 mW on cell, 10.05 ms scan duration, 80 MHz laser repetition rate).

To stimulate neurons, we incorporated a liquid crystal spatial light modulator (SLM)-based holographic module in the beam path of a two-photon microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, see Materials and methods for a detailed description of the optical setup). The SLM allowed projecting holographic oval shapes covering the soma of target neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In urethane-anaesthetized mice, we then performed two-photon-targeted juxtasomal recordings from stCoChR-positive neurons in order to record their supra-threshold electrical activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>) before, during, and after holographic stimulation of the recorded neurons (shape diameter: 10–15 μm; average power <italic>per</italic> neuron: ≤30 mW; stimulation duration: ≤100 ms; λ<sub>stim</sub> = 920 nm). We observed a significant increase in the firing rate of the recorded neuron during the stimulation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Neuronal responses to holographic two-photon stimulation increased with the average power of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

To evaluate the temporal precision of stimulation, we computed the action potential (AP) probability as a function of illumination duration: at all tested average powers (10, 20, and 30 mW), one or more spikes could be recorded in a time window of ≤100 ms with high probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The latency to first spike and the jitter depended on the illumination power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

Moreover, raster scanning at 920 nm caused a large and significant increase in the neuron’s spontaneous firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>). Importantly, we verified that the average imaging power used to estimate the crosstalk (between 30 mW and 35 mW) was sufficient to detect jRCaMP1a fluorescence transients associated with spontaneous firing of APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), similarly to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forli et al., 2018</xref>). We also performed a similar experiment with SST-positive interneurons expressing stCoChR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In agreement with our findings on principal cells, scanning stCoChR-positive interneurons at 1100 nm did not significantly raise the firing rate of recorded cells, while scanning at 920 nm did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Finally, in principal cells co-expressing jRCaMP1a and stCoChR further increasing the average imaging power to 50 mW did not increase the ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> of calcium events in cells expressing jRCaMP1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), while it led to small but significant increase in the AP frequency induced by raster scanning in both cells expressing stCoChR and cells expressing stCoChR +jRCaMP1 a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that imaging at longer wavelengths (~1100 nm) with average power allowing detection of calcium events (30–35 mW) does not significantly perturb the supra-threshold activity of stCoChR-positive principal neurons and interneurons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Limited crosstalk between imaging and photostimulation using blue-light-sensitive opsins and red-shifted indicators.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two-photon image of L2/3 principal cells expressing stCoChR in vivo (CoChR-Kv2.1-P2A-NLS-eGFP).

By combining two-photon excitation of functional indicators and optogenetic actuators, it has now been possible to simultaneously image and manipulate neural networks with near single-cell resolution in the intact brain of behaving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrillo-Reid et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gill et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jennings et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marshel et al., 2019</xref>). Ideally, optogenetic actuators should require minimal light power for neuronal excitation, allowing efficient stimulation of large numbers of neurons while minimizing heating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picot et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, they should display no activation by the light wavelength used for imaging, that is limited crosstalk between imaging and photostimulation. Here, we demonstrate that the large-conductance blue-light-sensitive soma-targeted opsin, stCoChR, in combination with high-energy ultrafast laser sources tuned at the opsin’s peak absorption wavelength, requires more than one order of magnitude lower average power <italic>per</italic> cell compared to previously characterized blue-light-sensitive soma-targeted opsins in vivo. Moreover, imaging conditions commonly used to monitor red-shifted functional indicators do not result in significant suprathreshold activation of stCoChR-expressing neurons.</p><p>In a previous study, Shemesh et al. demonstrated temporally precise stimulation of neurons in vitro using a different somatic variant of CoChR (soCoChR, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shemesh et al., 2017</xref>). In that study, somatic targeting of CoChR was achieved through a sequence from the kainate receptor (KA2). The resulting soCoChR yielded decreased somatic photocurrents with respect to the unmodified CoChR. In this manuscript, we used a different targeting motif, taken from the Kv2.1 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chettih and Harvey, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mahn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mardinly et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marshel et al., 2019</xref>), to enrich CoChR expression in the somatic compartment. While Shemesh et al. did screen for soma-targeting with the Kv2.1 motif in their study, they conducted this initial screen using dissociated cultured neurons. Our previous work has demonstrated that the efficiency of soma-targeting with the Kv2.1 motif is greatly improved in vivo compared with the dissociated culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mahn et al., 2018</xref>), which might explain its apparent inferior performance in the Shemesh et al. study. Furthermore, Shemesh et al. added the Kv2.1 targeting sequence following the CoChR-GFP sequence, whereas our construct contains the Kv2.1 targeting sequence immediately following the CoChR coding sequence, positioning it closer to the membrane as it is naturally located in the Kv2.1 channel sequence. We found that while the photocurrent elicited by stCoChR under full-field illumination is similar to the photocurrent elicited by unmodified CoChR, a higher fraction of that current originated from the soma in stCoChR-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The reduction in extra-somatic photocurrents was consistent in stCoChR-expressing cells, while it was only observed in soCoChR-expressing cells under very high light power. Our results suggest that the overall level of expression and efficiency of targeting to the plasma membrane are similar for CoChR and stCoChR, while stCoChR molecules are better retained at the proximal membrane. Thus, stCoChR achieves soma restriction without compromising photocurrent. Although the molecular mechanisms leading to these results remain to be investigated, we found that stCoChR led to very efficient two-photon neuronal excitation which required an average power of 0.25–5 mW <italic>per</italic> cell.</p><p>Limiting the crosstalk between imaging and photostimulation is a critical aspect of all-optical methods. Red-shifted opsins are generally prone to unwanted activation during imaging of blue-light-sensitive indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Venkatachalam and Cohen, 2014</xref>), because of the intrinsic absorption properties of the retinal group at shorter wavelengths. Previous work demonstrated that combining blue-light-sensitive opsins (e.g. ChR2, GtACR2) with red-shifted indicators (jRCaMP1a) is a valid choice to effectively reduce this form of crosstalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forli et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, despite the fact that stCoChR has a much larger photocurrent compared to ChR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>), we show here that suprathreshold activation of stCoChR-expressing neurons during imaging at red-shifted wavelengths is not significant at imaging power &lt;35 mW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This allowed us to combine high-energy two-photon holographic illumination of stCoChR at around the peak of its absorption spectrum (~920 nm, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shemesh et al., 2017</xref>]) with concurrent two-photon imaging of jRCaMP1a at 1100 nm (around the peak of absorption of this red-shifted indicator), achieving minimal cross activation. So far, efficient two-photon excitation of blue-shifted opsins has largely been constrained by the limited availability of high-energy pulsed systems tuned at ~920 nm. The recent accessibility of ready-to-use optical-parametric amplifiers makes it now possible to generate ultrafast high-energy pulses at a tunable wavelength in that spectral range and at a variable repetition rate (0.1–1 MHz). We used one such system to stimulate, for the first time, stCoChR at high energy around its two-photon absorption peak (920 nm, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shemesh et al., 2017</xref>]), thus minimizing energy waste and activation of red-shifted fluorescent indicator. Furthermore, stimulation at 920 nm reduces tissue heating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Podgorski and Ranganathan, 2016</xref>) that is, in contrast, higher at the longer wavelengths (&gt;1000 nm) commonly used to excite red-shifted opsins. Previous work showed that under the illumination conditions that we are using in our study (energy per pulse, ≤7 nJ), thermal effects dominate over non-linear photodamage effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picot et al., 2018</xref>) and that lowering the laser repetition rate is advantageous for two-photon excitation of the retinal group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Palczewska et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, previous studies showed that energies up to 60–200 nJ per pulse can be used to activate opsins without causing retinal bleaching and cell damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gill et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mardinly et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that the peak energy could be further increased compared to the one used in our study, while still preserving opsin functionality.</p><p>The soma-restriction method described in this study effectively increased the spatial resolution of photo-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). However, the axial spread of the illumination profile combined with the high sensitivity of stCoChR may cause significant activation of non-target cells located above and below the focal plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). This is not a major issue for single layered neural targets (e.g. mitral cell layer in the olfactory bulb, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gill et al., 2020</xref>]) or in the case of sparse labeling, but it may compromise the interpretation of photostimulation experiments in denser cell layers, (e.g. neocortical layers). The axial extension of the illumination profile can be reduced using temporal focusing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Spatial resolution could also be further increased by developing more effective soma-restriction motifs.</p><p>To reduce crosstalk between imaging and photostimulation, we imaged red-shifted indicators while stimulating blue-light-sensitive opsins. However, red-shifted indicators such as jRCaMP1a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forli et al., 2018</xref> have lower accuracy in detecting single or few APs compared to green indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Our method will benefit from future improvement leading to more efficient red-shifted indicators. Besides decreasing crosstalk, the choice of red-shifted indicators may facilitate imaging in deeper regions by using longer wavelengths, which are less sensitive to scattering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Helmchen and Denk, 2005</xref>). Moreover, the expression of red-shifted indicators is stable over long time windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dana et al., 2016</xref>) and this may facilitate chronic imaging experiments. Finally, holographic stimulation at 920 nm may decrease tissue heating which is higher at the longer wavelengths (λ = 1040 nm) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Podgorski and Ranganathan, 2016</xref> used to stimulate red-shifted opsins (e.g. C1V1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrillo-Reid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Packer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Packer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prakash et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rickgauer et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Compared to scanning methods with diffraction-limited-spots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carrillo-Reid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrillo-Reid et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chettih and Harvey, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marshel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Packer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), our extended illumination approach distributes the laser pulse energy across a much larger volume, that is the cell body volume of the stimulated neuron. Thus, the instantaneous energy density and the consequent risk of non-linear photodamage are decreased, allowing higher energy <italic>per</italic> pulse to be used. We exploited this advantage and compared light-evoked responses of the same stCoChR-expressing neurons to stimulation with low energy <italic>per</italic> pulse and high repetition rate (80 MHz) or high energy <italic>per</italic> pulse and low repetition rate (1 MHz).

This effectively stimulates red-shifted opsins, but not blue-light-sensitive opsins. Here, we combined a low repetition rate laser with a non-collinear optical parametric amplifier, to efficiently stimulate blue-light-sensitive opsins with high energy pulses at the wavelength corresponding to the peak of the two-photon action spectrum of CoChR (λ = 920 nm). Excitation at a low repetition rate allowed us to significantly increase the response of illuminated neurons <italic>per</italic> mW of delivered average power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, we reasoned that the slow kinetics of the opsins and the threshold for non-linear photodamage would allow us to further reduce the repetition rate of the excitation light source and the average power delivered to the sample. We found that the probability of eliciting suprathreshold responses during two-photon holographic excitation sublinearly decreased with the repetition rate (energy <italic>per</italic> pulse was 5 nJ under the objective and constant for the different repetition rates, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, we found that, at 50 kHz repetition rate, stimulation of target cells could be achieved with &lt;1 mW, more than one order of magnitude lower average power per cell compared to previously published blue-light-sensitive soma-targeted (st) opsins in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forli et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, we validated these findings across both principal cells and interneurons (SST<sup>+</sup>), showing that two-photon holographic stimulation can be applied to cell types with different biophysical properties with similar efficacy. Altogether, the use of stCoChR in vivo, compared with other opsins including ST-ChroME, Chronos and the non-soma-targeted version of CoChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mardinly et al., 2018</xref>), allows photoexcitation with lower average power of excitation (1–5 mW at 1 MHz repetition rate, and potentially less at repetition rates &lt; 1 MHz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results pave the way for the simultaneous modulation of the electrical activity of large number of neurons for prolonged periods with minimal risk of tissue heating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Picot et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Podgorski and Ranganathan, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we developed a new soma-targeted variant of the large-conductance opsin CoChR. Compared to previously characterized blue-light-sensitive soma-targeted opsins in vivo, stCoChR allowed comparable neuronal stimulation with more than one order of magnitude decreased average power delivered to the brain tissue and with minimal crosstalk between imaging and photostimulation. The combination of stCoChR with tuned amplified laser stimulation and red-shifted functional indicators represents a powerful alternative approach to performing high-efficiency all-optical causal investigation of neural circuits in the intact brain with minimal crosstalk between the imaging and photostimulation channels.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td>Charles River</td><td>IMSR Cat# JAX:000664, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>STOCK Sst<sup>tm2.1(cre)</sup><italic>Zjh/J</italic></td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>IMSR Cat# JAX:013044, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:013044">IMSR_JAX:013044</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pAAV-Syn-CoChR-GFP</td><td>Addgene</td><td>Addgene plasmid #59070;

A half-wave plate (RAC 5.2.10 achromatic λ/2 retarder - B. Halle Nachfl GMBH, Berlin, DE) was placed before the SLM in order to obtain the optimal polarization for phase-only modulation at the SLM. A first telescope (IR doublets 30 mm and 75 mm, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) expanded the laser beam to fill the active window of the SLM. A second telescope (IR doublets 300 mm and 150 mm, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) was used to resize the laser beam to fit the dimensions of the scanning mirrors inside the scan-head (G in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, G2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and to optically conjugate the plane of the SLM with the back aperture of the objective. Two multi-alkali photomultipliers tubes (PMTs, Hamamatsu, Milan, IT) were used as detectors for raster scanning imaging. Dual emission filters in front of the two PMTs were 525/70 nm and 607/45 nm, respectively.

Pipettes were filled with aCSF solution mixed with Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 (10 mM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). stCoChR-expressing neurons in L2/3 were targeted under the two-photon microscope by imaging the expressed fluorescent reporter (eGFP or mScarlet, at 920 nm and 1050 nm excitation wavelength, respectively) while monitoring the pipette fluorescence and its electrical resistance (through brief voltage steps). When the pipette tip and the target cell were in close contact one to the other, a patch of cell membrane was sealed on the pipette tip by applying a mild negative pressure. The juxtasomal configuration was reached when the pipette resistance was &gt;20 MΩ and spikes were clearly visible.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Shai Berlin (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors developed a soma-targeted variant of an existing blue-light sensitive opsin, CoChR, for efficient optogenetic stimulation and combined it with red calcium indicator aiming to achieve low crosstalk in all-optical control of neuronal activity. Compared to a previous soma-restricted version of CoChR, the new stCoChR achieves soma restriction without compromising photocurrent, thus enabling efficient two-photon neuronal excitation in vivo. The optimal laser power and repetition rate for driving spikes in stCoChR positive neurons were carefully calibrated with juxtasomal recordings in vivo. The authors tested the crosstalk between two-photon raster scanning at a wavelength typically used for imaging red functional indicators and photoactivation of stCoChR-expressing neurons. They also demonstrated simultaneous two-photon imaging and holographic photostimulation of L2/3 neurons in mice.</p><p>While the reviewers are impressed by the efficiency of the new opsin variant, which will be useful for the growing community of experimenters performing &quot;all-optical experiments&quot;, the claim of 'crosstalk-free' all-optical interrogation – stated in the title! – is not fully convincing. Therefore, the advance presented here is being oversold, unless the authors provide further evidence as detailed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The experiments in Figure 5 and Figure S5 aim to quantify the crosstalk between imaging and photostimulation, which is the key advantage of the proposed method over previous all-optical approaches. However, these experiments were performed in neurons expressing stCoChR without RCaMP.</p><p>The concern is whether the imaging conditions used here can provide sufficient RCaMP signal, if RCaMP is co-expressed. Imaging quality is particularly important here given that jRCaMP1a is not as bright as GCaMP6s as adopted in many other all-optical studies. The authors argued they used 'imaging conditions commonly used to monitor red-shifted functional indicators', but the expression of stCoChR may affect the expression of RCaMP, and therefore requires more power for imaging the same neurons.</p><p>Ideally these cross-talk experiments should be done in neurons co-expressing stCoChR and RCaMP, with simultaneous imaging and juxtasomal recording to confirm that the imaging conditions used here is sufficient to report spikes in the jRCaMP1 signal while insufficient to activate the opsin.</p><p>2. What is the success rate of all-optical manipulation? Specifically, what is the percentage of targeted cells that showed fluorescence transients with adequate signal-to-noise? How does this percentage vary with different photostimulation laser repetition rates and power? Are the traces in Figure 6C showing all targeted neurons in one experiment?</p><p>3. Will increasing imaging power assist the detection of photostimulation-evoked RCaMP events? As one increases the imaging laser power, at what point does it stop improving detection of RCaMP events immediately following photostimulation, and at what point does it start to increase the baseline RCaMP events in the opsin-positive neurons in the field-of-view? Answers to these questions will also assist the evaluation of crosstalk between RCaMP imaging and stCoChR activation.</p><p>4. The authors show that reducing the repetition rate of the laser allows holographic activation of stCoChR at low average power. A biophysical explanation for this observation is not given. The results are clearly presented and the new tool is certainly of interest for in-vivo optogenetics labs, as there is no detectable interference between calcium imaging and photostimulation. A caveat is the relatively poor control of spike timing: The method requires 20 ms of 2p excitation to reliably generate an action potential, while blue light pulses of 1 ms are usually sufficient. Given that the closing of stCoChR is also relatively slow, it would be of interest to know the maximum frequency at which single spike control is possible with this approach. Also, the z-resolution is poor (&gt;80 µm), which could be a problem for dense cell layers. In a methods paper, these limitations should be discussed.</p><p>5. Because of the quadratic dependence of excitation events on pulse intensity, 2p imaging/photoactivation at lower pulse repetition rates can be performed at lower average power – this is not a miracle. Whether a low rep rate/high pulse energy regime confers any real advantage depends on the nature of the expected photodamage: If thermal effects dominate, low average power is a good thing. The advantage of reduced repetition rates (and very short pulses!) for two-photon imaging of retinal has recently been published (Palczewska et al., PNAS, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2007527117), this paper should be cited. If, on the other hand, triplet states and solvated electrons are produced and lead to the destruction of biomolecules, high peak powers are to be avoided. For 2p imaging, it has been shown that higher rep rates (with lower pulse power) strongly reduce the amount of photobleaching (Fuzeng Niu et al. 2019 Laser Phys. 29 046001). Will ever higher peak powers at some point be a problem for CoChR, do they bleach the retinal? A discussion along these lines would leave the reader less mystified (as the authors do not show a lower limit/optimum for the rep rate).</p><p>6. The authors do not provide a single micrograph showing the localization of stCoChR. As this is one of their main contributions here, they should provide high resolution micrographs showing the localization of the stCoChR in neurons. This could be done by immunolabelling or by simply removing the P2A sequence, and trying to see whether these are really soma targeted (and to what extent in comparison to dendrites, for instance).</p><p>7. What is missing throughout the paper are control experiments showing that without opsins, these different illumination schemes do not evoke firing. This is really missing in the all-optical interrogation of neurons in Figure 6. The authors need to show that under identical imaging settings, neurons that do not express stCoChR (but that positively express jRCaMP1a) do not fire! This experiment (Figure 6) also requires recording of electrical activity along the optical responses and this is because in the example they show (Figure 6C), the responses do not look like APs, rather small increases in fluorescence due to low Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations. The authors should also show longer recordings (as they do in Figure 5B for instance) and then compare between the optical responses (DF/F) of jRCAMP to spontaneous APs versus those obtained by the optical stimulation of stCoChR. Are they different (DF/F, kinetics, etc).?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63359.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Similarly to what previously observed in cells expressing only stCoChR, we found that raster scanning at 1100 nm (imaging power: 30-35 mW) did not alter the spontaneous firing rate of imaged neurons (new Figure 5E-F). As expected raster scanning at 920 nm, the wavelength of efficient two-photon excitation of stCoChR, caused a large and significant increase in the neuron’s spontaneous firing rate (new Figure 5E-F). Importantly, using imaging power between 30 mW and 35 mW allowed the detection of jRCaMP1a fluorescence transients (Figure 5G). Detectable jRCaMP1a events were mainly associated with the discharge of multiple action potentials similarly to previous reports (Dana et al. 2016, Forli et al. 2018). These experiments are now described in the Results section at lines 254-263. Following referees’ concern about jRCaMP1a performance, we modified the Discussion (lines 397-407) to highlight the limitations of current red-shifted sensors and the importance of future improvements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In combined imaging and juxtasomal electrophysiological recordings, we found that the ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> of jRCaMP1a transients tended to be higher at 50 mW but the effect was not statistically significant (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2). We then evaluated crosstalk between imaging and photostimulation at the higher imaging average power (i.e., 50 mW). We found that raster scanning induced a small, but significant, increase in spontaneous firing frequency (new Figure 5—figure supplement 3). This was true in neurons expressing stCoChR (Figure 5—figure supplement 3 left) and in neurons co-expressing stCoChR and jRCaMP1a (Figure 5—figure supplement 3 right). Thus, on the one hand increasing imaging power did not significantly improve the ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> of jRCaMP1a transients. On the other hand, imaging at higher average power started causing small but significant crosstalk. These results are now reported at lines 268-272.</p><p>Given that with these new experiments we evaluated the threshold for inducing crosstalk under our experimental conditions, we modified the title of the paper. It now reads: “Optogenetic strategies for high-efficiency all-optical interrogation using blue light-sensitive opsins”.

The overall effect can be explained by considering the relationship between the probability of a two-photon absorption process, the power of the stimulating laser, and the repetition rate of the laser source (Denk and Webb, 1990; Zipfel at al., 2003).</p><p>To address the request of the referees regarding single spike control, we performed new juxtasomal electrophysiological recordings in cell expressing stCoChR during stimulation with trains of short pulses (pulse duration, 10 ms; number of pulses, 5; average power, 5 mW) at different frequency (20 Hz -50 Hz, new Figure 3—figure supplement 1). We found that the probability of eliciting at least one action potential raised from 20 Hz to 40 Hz and then tended to decrease at 50 Hz (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B).

Previous work shows that under the illumination conditions that we are using in our study (energy per pulse, ≤ 7 nJ), thermal effects dominate over non-linear photodamage effects (Picot et al. 2018, Charan et al. 2018). Moreover, the retinal group is the same in all opsins and previous work showed that energies up to 60-200 nJ per pulse can be used to activate opsins without causing retinal bleaching and cell damage (Mardinly et al. 2018, Gill et al. 2020, Chen et al. 2019). Thus, we expect that the peak energy could be further increased compared to the one used in our study, while preserving opsin functionality. We added a paragraph to the discussion on page lines 377-385 to clarify these points.</p><p>We thank the referees for pointing our attention to Palczewska et al. 2020, which is now cited in the manuscript at line 381.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors do not provide a single micrograph showing the localization of stCoChR. As this is one of their main contributions here, they should provide high resolution micrographs showing the localization of the stCoChR in neurons. This could be done by immunolabelling or by simply removing the P2A sequence, and trying to see whether these are really soma targeted (and to what extent in comparison to dendrites, for instance).</p></disp-quote><p>Following the referees’ request, we now provide confocal images showing CoChR and stCoChR expression in neurons (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1). However, we think that confocal image analysis of protein localization is not conclusive of a somatic localization due to the limited quantitative accuracy of immunostaining. Moreover, removing the P2A sequence, as the referees proposed, would change the sequence of stCoChR and might in itself modify the targeting efficiency of the CoChR-fluorophore fusion molecules. In contrast, we believe the functional measurements displayed in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2, in which we directly measured photocurrent induced by localized two-photon excitation as a function of the distance from the soma, as well as the soma-to-full-field photocurrent ratio, provide clear and conclusive evidence of the somatic restriction of stCoChR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. What is missing throughout the paper are control experiments showing that without opsins, these different illumination schemes do not evoke firing. This is really missing in the all-optical interrogation of neurons in Figure 6. The authors need to show that under identical imaging settings, neurons that do not express stCoChR (but that positively express jRCaMP1a) do not fire! This experiment (Figure 6) also requires recording of electrical activity along the optical responses and this is because in the example they show (Figure 6C), the responses do not look like APs, rather small increases in fluorescence due to low Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations. The authors should also show longer recordings (as they do in Figure 5B for instance) and then compare between the optical responses (DF/F) of jRCAMP to spontaneous APs versus those obtained by the optical stimulation of stCoChR. Are they different (DF/F, kinetics, etc).?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the experiments requested by the referees. Specifically:</p><p>1. We performed combined photostimulation and juxtasomal electrophysiological experiments in neurons expressing only jRCaMP1a. Under these experimental conditions, we found that photostimulation did not increase neuronal firing (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1), demonstrating no effect of two-photon holographic stimulation on neuronal firing in the absence of opsin expression. These results are now described at lines 300-301.</p><p>2. We performed simultaneous all-optical and juxtasomal electrophysiological recordings in neurons co-expressing jRCaMP1a and stCoChR (new Figure 6F-G). We observed that jRCaMP1a transients induced by photostimulation were associated with the firing of 6.7 ± 1.9 (range: 3-14) action potentials, in agreement with what previously observed in cells expressing only stCoChR (Figure 3B, C). These results are now described at lines 295-299. As requested by the referees, we also compared spontaneous and photostimulation-evoked jRCaMP1a transients (new Figure 6—figure supplement 2). We found that the ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> of spontaneous events corresponding to the discharge of few action potentials were smaller than the ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> of photostimulation-evoked jRCaMP1a transients, in agreement with the observation that our photostimulation protocol evoked trains of 3-14 action potentials in stimulated neurons (new Figure 6—figure supplement 2). The decay kinetic of spontaneous and photostimulation-evoked jRCaMP1a transients were not significantly different (new Figure 6—figure supplement 2). These results are now described at lines 301-307.</p></body></sub-article></article>
