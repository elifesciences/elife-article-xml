Here, we show that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is critical for activation of murine peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells failed to proliferate and blast after in vitro TCR/CD28 stimulation. Upon T-cell activation, genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis are upregulated while genes that promote cholesterol efflux are repressed. HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had reduced levels of cellular cholesterol both before and after activation. HDAC3-deficient cells upregulate cholesterol synthesis appropriately after activation, but fail to repress cholesterol efflux; notably, they overexpress cholesterol efflux transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1. Repression of these genes is the primary function for HDAC3 in peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, as addition of exogenous cholesterol restored proliferative capacity.

This metabolic transition shortly after TCR engagement has been defined as quiescence exit, and is characterized by several key cellular events including cell growth, interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling, increased anabolic metabolism, and reprogramming of mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chapman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chapman and Chi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ron-Harel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Each of these checkpoints prepares CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells for proliferation and effector function by generating the cellular building blocks required for activated T cells such as fatty acids and sterols, nucleotides, amino acids, and other metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bensinger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geiger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kidani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ricciardi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Given the importance of these molecules during activation, this metabolic reprogramming is under the control of keenly regulated molecular circuits to ensure resources are used efficiently. To date, our understanding of the transcriptional control of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells exiting quiescence is incomplete.</p><p>Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), particularly mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), directs many aspects of metabolic reprogramming after T-cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). One role of mTORC1 is to drive lipid synthesis through the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kidani et al., 2013</xref>). SREBPs are transcription factors that orchestrate lipid synthesis after T-cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeBose-Boyd and Ye, 2018</xref>). In addition to increasing lipid and sterol synthesis, recently activated T cells also halt cholesterol efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bensinger et al., 2008</xref>). Activated T cells rapidly decrease expression of cholesterol efflux transporters in order to retain recently generated cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Michaels et al., 2021</xref>). Both of these steps, increased cholesterol synthesis and decreased cholesterol efflux, are required for successful proliferation and blast formation. Disruptions in cholesterol synthesis in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells inhibited blasting and proliferation after TCR engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kidani et al., 2013</xref>), while enforced expression of cholesterol efflux transporter ABCG1 inhibited proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bensinger et al., 2008</xref>). Cholesterol metabolism may not be identically regulated in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, as deletion of Acetyl-CoA Acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) enhanced proliferation and effector function in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but not CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these studies point to an important ‘cholesterol checkpoint’ in which T cells require an optimal amount of cholesterol to exit quiescence.</p><p>Although previous work highlights the importance of transcription factors in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, less is known about the role of chromatin modifiers in the regulation of cholesterol availability in T cells. Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is a Class I HDAC that deacetylates lysine residues on histones H3 and H4 in order to repress gene expression. Previously, our group has shown that HDAC3 serves as a targeted regulator of key gene expression during T-cell development. During positive selection in the thymus, HDAC3 is required for downregulation of RORγt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Philips et al., 2016</xref>). Further, HDAC3 suppression of the purinergic-receptor P2RX7 is critical for survival of double positive thymocytes in the ATP-rich thymic cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Philips et al., 2019b</xref>). Recently, the role of HDAC3 as an inhibitor of the cytotoxicity program of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was examined using E8I-Cre, which initiates deletion in CD8 SP thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ellmeier et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tay et al., 2020</xref>). Collectively, this work supports the idea that HDAC3 is a highly specific transcriptional regulator in lymphocytes.</p><p>Little is known of the role that HDAC3 plays in peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Here, we report that HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have a loss of differentiated helper T-cell populations in vivo. This loss of differentiated T-cell numbers is due to an inability of HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to blast and proliferate after activation. HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells upregulate cholesterol synthesis genes normally after activation, but fail to downregulate cholesterol efflux. This results in reduced cellular cholesterol levels in HDAC3-deficient T cells before and after T-cell activation. HDAC3-deficient cells upregulate mRNA expression of genes encoding the cholesterol efflux transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1. Increased mRNA expression is maintained after TCR ligation. Further, deletion of HDAC3 results in hyperacetylation of promoter sites for both <italic>Abca1</italic> and <italic>Abcg1,</italic> consistent with direct gene regulation by HDAC3 deacetylase activity. Importantly, the addition of exogenous cholesterol restores proliferative capacity of HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, indicating that a decreased cholesterol level is the primary block preventing proliferation and blasting. Thus, HDAC3 is required to maintain cholesterol availability after T-cell activation through the repression of cholesterol efflux.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have intrathymic deletion of HDAC3 in dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO, but CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells initiate deletion in recent thymic emigrants</title><p>Previous studies have outlined several important roles for HDAC3 during T-cell development in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Philips et al., 2016</xref>; 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Philips et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stengel et al., 2015</xref>). To interrogate the role of HDAC3 in peripheral T cells, distal-Lck-Cre (dLck-Cre) HDAC3 cKO mice were generated. In this system, Cre recombinase expression is driven by the distal promoter of lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck). Previous studies showed this system drives Cre expression after positive selection in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). Adult dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO mice had normal numbers of naive and memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell populations in the spleen, but had a significant decrease in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Previous work in which HDAC3 was deleted in the thymus revealed HDAC3 is required for T-cell maturation, leading to a block at the recent thymic emigrant (RTE) stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have intrathymic deletion of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in dLck-HDAC3 cKO, but CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells initiate deletion at the recent thymic emigrant (RTE) stage.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Profile of primary splenic T-cell populations from wild-type (WT) and dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO mice including total T cells (TCRβ<sup>+</sup>), total CD4<sup>+</sup> (TCRβ<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup>), and total CD8<sup>+</sup> (TCRβ<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup>), as well as memory (CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD62L<sup>lo</sup>) and naive (CD44<sup>lo</sup> CD62L<sup>hi</sup>) from each of the CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> populations.

To do this, developing thymocyte populations were examined. Total numbers of double negative (DN), double positive (DP), and CD4 and CD8 single positive (CD4 SP/CD8 SP) in the dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO thymus were roughly equivalent to wild-type (WT) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Surprisingly, the CD8 SP population had a loss of HDAC3 protein level compared to WT CD8 SP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Thus, dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO initiated deletion as early as the CD8 SP thymocyte stage. HDAC3 expression was unaffected in CD4 SP thymocytes. Given the critical roles for HDAC3 in developing thymocytes, we concluded that dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO mice are not a suitable model for examination of mature peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the absence of HDAC3. Thus, this work focuses on the role of HDAC3 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>Having established that HDAC3 expression is intact in the developing CD4<sup>+</sup> SP thymocytes, the HDAC3 protein expression in peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell populations at homeostasis was assessed. In previously published studies with dLck-Cre systems, deletion is inefficient in the mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). To measure the efficiency of HDAC3 deletion in dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO mice, naive (CD62L<sup>hi</sup>CD44<sup>lo</sup>) and memory phenotype (CD62<sup>lo</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup>) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were examined. RTEs and mature naive T cells (MNTs) were distinguished using CD55 and CD45RB, both markers that are upregulated during peripheral T-cell maturation. HDAC3 deletion began soon after T cells egress from the thymus since ~25% of RTEs were HDAC3 deficient in the dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Further, MNTs were enriched for HDAC3<sup>−</sup> cells, with &gt;75% of them being HDAC3 deficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Surprisingly, only 25% of the memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were HDAC3 deficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) suggesting that HDAC3-deficient memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had a competitive disadvantage to the HDAC3-sufficient memory CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are capable of differentiation, but produce fewer cells than WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells</title><p>Given the incongruence of HDAC3 deletion between the naive and memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell populations in the dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO, we examined whether HDAC3 could play a role in the formation and expansion of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. To test this, differentiated helper T-cell populations were measured at homeostasis in vivo. There were very few HDAC3-deficient T helper (T<sub>h</sub>) cells including T<sub>h</sub>1, T<sub>h</sub>2, T<sub>h</sub>17, T<sub>reg</sub>, and T<sub>fh</sub> cells in the spleen in dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO mice when compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The frequency of HDAC3-deficient T<sub>h</sub>17 cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs) was also reduced in dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The frequency of the other T<sub>h</sub> populations in mLN and Peyer’s patches was not statistically different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In fact, total numbers of the HDAC3-deficient differentiated splenic populations more closely resembled CD4-Cre HDAC3 cKO mice, which are highly lymphopenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>). Of note, HDAC3-deficient cells could differentiate in a noncompetitive environment. CD4-Cre HDAC3 cKO mice generated T<sub>h</sub>2, T<sub>h</sub>17 and T<sub>reg</sub> and T<sub>fh</sub> cells at about the same frequency as WT cells in the spleen and the mesenteric lymph node although total numbers were highly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since those mice are highly lymphopenic, they exist in a relatively noncompetitive environment when compared to the competitive dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO mice where HDAC3-sufficient cells are present. With this information, we hypothesized that HDAC3 plays a role in maintaining CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell fitness to successfully differentiate in vivo.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO mice have reduced differentiated T<sub>h</sub>-cell populations.</title><p>Identification of helper T-cell populations in vivo.

However, HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells did not have a global impairment in their ability to respond to CD3/CD28 stimulation, as induction of CD69 expression was only slightly reduced. Greater than 80% of HDAC3-deficient T cells upregulated CD69 expression, and the MFI was similar between WT and HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, indicating that HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can respond to TCR signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).

In addition, the percentage of HDAC3<sup>−</sup> cells that induced CD25 expression 3 days after αCD3/αCD28 stimulation was greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).

This finding is unexpected, as previous studies showed that disruptions in mTORC1 activity altered the expression of cholesterol synthesis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zeng et al., 2013</xref>). However, HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had a higher Filipin III signal after TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), indicating they were still capable of increasing cholesterol synthesis despite reduced mTORC1 activation.

ABCA1 and ABCG1 are pivotal players in cholesterol efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tarling and Edwards, 2012</xref>). ABCG1 in particular has been identified as a key cholesterol transporter downregulated after T-cell activation and important for LXR’s antiproliferative effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bensinger et al., 2008</xref>).

To test whether the addition of exogenous cholesterol improves HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell proliferation, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from WT and dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO mice were labeled with CFSE and cultured with αCD3/αCD28 simulation in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml MBCD-Chol for 3 days. Remarkably, HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that received exogenous cholesterol proliferated equivalently to WT T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Additionally, HDAC3<sup>−</sup> dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells treated with cholesterol had a strong recovery in the percentage of blasting cells compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Importantly, cell size measured by FSC-A recovered to levels equivalent to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). However, cell granularity as measured by SSC-A did not return to WT levels in the cholesterol-treated HDAC3 cKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), indicating HDAC3 may play a role in other pathways downstream of TCR signaling. WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that received exogenous cholesterol also increased their blasting and proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a, b</xref>), reinforcing the idea that cholesterol regulates the rate of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell proliferation. These data confirmed that the reduction in cholesterol availability drove the defect in proliferation and blasting in the HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Interestingly, concentration of lipid rafts remained reduced in cholesterol-treated HDAC3<sup>−</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Filipin III signal, as expected, was increased in the cholesterol-treated HDAC3<sup>−</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Since lipid rafts remained disrupted in dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we next asked whether the addition of cholesterol altered signaling events in HDAC3-deficient T cells. CD25 expression 3 days after in vitro stimulation was similar to WT levels in HDAC3-deficient T cells given exogenous cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Conversely, p-S6 and Egr2 remained disrupted 16 hr after αCD3/αCD28 stimulation in the presence of exogenous cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f, g</xref>). These data reveal that although mTORC1 signaling remained reduced in HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, the residual signal was sufficient to drive normal proliferation given exogenous cholesterol. The ability of exogenous cholesterol to restore proliferation of HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells demonstrated that the primary function of HDAC3 is to repress cholesterol efflux during T-cell activation.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Defective proliferation and blasting in histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is rescued by addition of exogenous cholesterol in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Enriched CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were labeled with CFSE and stimulated with 5 µg of plate-bound αCD3 and 1 µg/ml of αCD28 in the presence or absence of 5 µg cholesterol-methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 3 days and examined by flow cytometry for proliferation.

HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have a defect in blasting and proliferation after in vitro αCD3/αCD28 stimulation. This defect is dependent upon reduced intracellular cholesterol levels as addition of exogenous cholesterol in culture restores proliferation and blasting in HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Importantly, the addition of cholesterol does not restore diminished mTORC1 signaling in HDAC3<sup>−</sup> T cells, which implies that reduced mTORC1 in HDAC3 cKO T cells is sufficient to drive proliferation. Moreover, we have outlined a role for HDAC3 in the regulation of cholesterol efflux. In the absence of HDAC3, both resting and activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have increased expression of the cholesterol efflux transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1. Inhibition of HDAC3 in WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells revealed that repression of <italic>Abca1</italic> and <italic>Abcg1</italic> was dependent upon HDAC3 enzymatic activity. Previous work has shown that components of the SMRT/NCOR complex play a critical role in regulating gene expression of cholesterol efflux transporter ABCG1 in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jakobsson et al., 2009</xref>). However, the functional importance of the regulation of ABCG1 was not elucidated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that HDAC3 localized to the promoter region of both ABCA1 and ABCG1 in human macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jakobsson et al., 2009</xref>). Further, HDAC3 ChIP-Seq in human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells revealed HDAC3 binding at the <italic>Abcg1</italic> locus, and upstream of the <italic>Abca1</italic> locus. In this study, we show that HDAC3-deficient thymocytes had hyperacetylation of the promoter region of the <italic>Abca1</italic> and <italic>Abcg1</italic> genes. In addition, we show that HDAC3 enzymatic inhibition by RGP966 led to increased ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression, demonstrating a critical role for HDAC3-mediated histone deacetylation in active suppression of ABCA1 and ABCG1. Thus, HDAC3 is a direct regulator of the <italic>Abca1</italic> and <italic>Abcg1</italic> genes in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate that HDAC3 regulates cholesterol availability in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and that HDAC3 is required during T-cell activation to transcriptionally repress cholesterol efflux through ABCA1 and ABCG1. Importantly, the regulation of cholesterol availability was the limiting factor blocking proliferation of HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, as proliferation was restored by the addition of exogenous cholesterol.</p><p>T cells are uniquely sensitive to changes in cholesterol concentration shortly after activation, as recently activated T cells rapidly upregulate cholesterol synthesis and simultaneously abolish cholesterol efflux in preparation for the membrane production required for proliferation. Thus, disruptions in cholesterol synthesis produce profound defects in T-cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kidani et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, it has been shown that enforced expression of the cholesterol efflux transporter ABCG1 through treatment with LXR agonists results in defective T-cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bensinger et al., 2008</xref>). Conversely, loss of LXRβ activity through genetic deletion alters T-cell fitness in the context of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Michaels et al., 2021</xref>), while genetic deletion of <italic>Abcg1</italic> in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells results in increased proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armstrong et al., 2010</xref>). Collectively, this demonstrates that transcriptional control of genes involved in cholesterol availability is critical for successful T-cell responses, and here we demonstrate a role for HDAC3 in controlling cholesterol availability in activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This work demonstrates a highly specific role for HDAC3 in suppressing cholesterol efflux during T-cell activation. Importantly, critical components of the cholesterol synthesis pathway are unaltered by HDAC3 loss, demonstrating that HDAC3 serves as a specific regulator, rather than a generic regulator, of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Hdac3 fl/fl</italic> mice were generously provided by Dr. Scott Hiebert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knutson et al., 2008</xref>). dLck-Cre mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.

For the Mito Stress Assay, OCR was measured with additions of oligomycin (1.5 μM), FCCP (2-[2-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]hydrazinylidene]-propanedinitrile, 1.5 μM), rotenone (1 μM), and antimycin A (1 μM) during the assay.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Real-time quantitative PCR analysis</title><p>For qPCR analyses, mRNA was isolated from FACS sorted CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell populations or from 16610D9 thymocytes using Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit. cDNA was generated using Superscript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA was amplified and detected using TaqMan probes for <italic>Srebf1</italic> (Thermo #Mm00550338_m1), <italic>Srebf2</italic> (Thermo #Mm01306292_m1), Idi1 (Thermo #Mm01337454_m1), <italic>Sqle</italic> (Thermo #Mm00436772_m1), <italic>Nr1h2</italic> (Thermo #Mm00437265_g1), <italic>Sult2b1</italic> (Thermo #Mm00450550_m1), <italic>Ldlr</italic> (Thermo #Mm00440169_m1), <italic>Abcc1</italic> (Thermo #Mm01344332_m1), <italic>Dhcr7</italic> (Thermo #Mm00514571_m1), <italic>Hmgcr</italic> (Thermo #Mm01282499_m1), <italic>Abca1</italic> (Thermo #Mm00442646_m1), <italic>Abcg1</italic> (Thermo #Mm00437390_m1) as well as an 18S rRNA (Applied Biosystems #4352930) to serve as an internal control.

This cell line was generated and received from Dr. Stephen Hedrick at UCSD. This cell line is not on the list of commonly misidentified cell lines and authentication for this cell line is not available from ATCS. To verify the identity of this cell line, flow cytometry using murine-specific antibodies for CD4, CD8, CD5, TCRβ, and CD24 was performed. The 16610D9 cells in this manuscript were CD4<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> double positive cells with intermediate expression of TCRβ, high expression of CD24, and low expression of CD5. This is consistent with the original description of the cell line. Mycoplasma testing was performed using the Universal Mycoplasma Detection Kit (ATCC Product # 30-1012 K), and the 16610D9 cell line was negative for mycoplasma contamination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare between two groups for total cell counts, in vitro differentiation assays, proliferation, blasting, signal transduction flow cytometry, phosflow, filipin, and qPCR analysis. For comparisons with three or more groups, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA was used for total cell counts and HDAC3 expression in thymocytes, cell counts in splenocytes and mesenteric lymph nodes, proliferation, blasting and signaling events after cholesterol addition). The exactTest (edgeR software) was used to compare mRNA levels (RPKM) from individual genes in RNA-Seq datasets. <italic>T</italic>-tests and ANOVA analysis were calculated using GraphPad Prism. To calculate proliferation index in proliferation assays, the ‘Generation 0’ peak was set by drawing a gate around the unstimulated peak from an unstimulated sample in FlowJo. This gate was then applied to stimulated samples derived from the same mouse, and Flowjo calculated the proliferation index for each. For Filipin and CTB analysis, MFI was normalized to cell size by taking MFI divided by spheroid time of flight (FSC-W<sup>3</sup>) to estimate cell volume as has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tzur et al., 2011</xref>) Details for each statistical test used are included in each figure legend.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Validation, Writing – original draft, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers provided detailed recommendations which are also provided below for clarity and context. Among these, it would be good to focus on the following:</p><p>1) The staining for T<sub>fh</sub> cells in Figure 2 is not convincing. The shift of the Bcl6-positive population is rather low and therefore it is difficult to gate of T<sub>fh</sub> cells. In addition, the number of T<sub>fh</sub> cells for non-immunized mice seems to be rather high. This might be related to the gating strategy. It might be better to use PD1 vs CXCR5 for the definition of T<sub>fh</sub> cells (and then gate on Bcl6). Did the authors analyze the frequency of T<sub>fh</sub> cells in peyer's patches (in WT mice, T<sub>fh</sub> cells are present in PP at steady state)?</p><p>2) Have the authors analyzed cytokine expression in ex vivo isolated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (stimulated with PMA/ionomycin). It would be very informative to know whether T-bet+ or RORgt+ HDAC3- CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells display changes in IFNγ or IL-17A expression, respectively.</p><p>3) The authors need to more convincingly demonstrate that the blasting/proliferation phenotype is related to the cholesterol content. There is some reservations about the filipin staining that can be easily addressed by looking at their existing data. It would be beneficial to see the cholesterol loading experiments redone where they aren't overloading the cells with cholesterol and have the proper control.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The study &quot;Histone deacetylase 3 represses cholesterol efflux during CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation&quot; represents a detailed study on the role of HDAC3 on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation. The reader is presented with detailed analysis on how loss of HDAC3 alters cholesterol metabolism in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The provided data are well presented and conclusive.</p><p>Overall, this is a nice study. Some comments are listed below.</p><p>(1) In Figure 1c, the data would be easier to read if the order of the statistical summary showing the percentage of the various cell populations correlates with the sequence of the representative FACS plots.</p><p>(2) In Figure 2 the authors should display data from the same organ (spleen) for all subsets, while mLN data should be presented exclusively in the corresponding supplementary Figure.</p><p>(3) The staining for T<sub>fh</sub> cells in Figure 2 is not convincing. The shift of the Bcl6-positive population is rather low and therefore it is difficult to gate of T<sub>fh</sub> cells. In addition, the number of T<sub>fh</sub> cells for non-immunized mice seems to be rather high. This might be related to the gating strategy. It might be better to use PD1 vs CXCR5 for the definition of T<sub>fh</sub> cells (and then gate on Bcl6). Did the authors analyze the frequency of T<sub>fh</sub> cells in peyer's patches (in WT mice, T<sub>fh</sub> cells are present in PP at steady state)?</p><p>(4) Have the authors analyzed cytokine expression in ex vivo isolated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (stimulated with PMA/ionomycin). It would be very informative to know whether T-bet+ or RORgt+ HDAC3- CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells display changes in IFNγ or IL-17A expression, respectively.</p><p>(5) It is not clear, at least to the reviewer, why the authors show the % of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as well as total cell numbers from CD4-Cre HDAC3cKO mice in the diagrams in the right panels of Figure 2. If they include the data, one would also have to show the % and number of the corresponding WT cells from the study.</p><p>(6) Which cells were used as negative control in Figure 3 as well as in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. This is not described in the manuscript. Ideally, the negative controls are unboosted but stained cells. If the negative controls are unstained cells, the negative control peaks might in fact not correlate with the negative cytokine peak of the actual sample. The gating for IFNγ, IL-4 and IL-17 (is it IL-17A?) cytokine expression doesn't look okay, e.g. there are two peaks for IFNγ expression, but the gates include cells that appear IFNγ-negative. Similarly, the authors show 90% IL-17+ cells. This is very high, however, there seems to be a small fraction of cells that express very high levels. Are these cells the &quot;real&quot; IL-17A positive cells?</p><p>Showing contour plots (or dot plots) CD4 vs cytokine might help to discriminate between cytokine negative and positive peaks.</p><p>Have the cells been restimulated/boosted with PMA/ionomycin?</p><p>(7) Approx. 50% of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have deleted HDAC3 (as shown in Figure 1c). After differentiation into the various lineages shown in Figure 3, what was the % of cells that had deleted HDAC3. Was there a competitive advantage of cells that didn't delete HDAC3?</p><p>(8) The authors should briefly explain why they used Rag1-GFP mice for the data presented in Figure 5d and 5e and why the sorted GFP- cells for this experiment.

Wouldn't it be better to show results from primary cells?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Past work of this lab and others have described a role for the histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in the regulation of thymocyte development and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function. This study used a loss-of-function approach to study the role of HDAC3 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This was done by studying the T cell compartment in HDAC3 floxed mice that were crossed to mice expressing the distal Lck-Cre promoter (HDAC3 T KO mice). They observed that HDAC3 T KO mice exhibited CD8, but not CD4 T cell lymphopenia and a normal naïve to memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell ratio convincingly establishing that Th cell development was intact in these mice. They then established using in vitro assays that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had defects in blasting and proliferation that correlated with reduced expression IL-2 and CD25, and reduced expression and activity of mTORC1 targets. They then focused their analysis on cholesterol metabolism-related genes in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and discovered that two cholesterol efflux proteins were upregulated in HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at the mRNA level. Past work in the literature had established that cholesterol efflux is downregulated during T cell activation to support T cell growth. They also showed that loading T cells with cholesterol restored the defect in T cell blasting and proliferation and CD25 expression in HDAC3 KO CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript was well-written and concisely presented. The experiments that were performed generated data of high quality. Experimental approaches were appropriate for surveying defects in the T cell compartment and effector T cell function. Experiments were replicated and, in most instances, means represented means of experiments, which is to be commended. Statistics were appropriate for each analysis that was performed.</p><p>With the exception of some of the data in Figure 6, the conclusions match the data presented.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The conclusion that &quot;HDAC3-deficiency results in cholesterol deficiency and this is the cause of the proliferation defects&quot; could be strengthened by the following considerations. First, since they gated on total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which were overall smaller in size in the HDAC3 KO mice, it would be important to show that the lowered filipin and cholera toxin staining is not a result of reduced autofluorescence.</p><p>In addition, the loading of the cells with cholesterol appeared to be almost too efficient and resulted in higher filipin staining than the WT T cells (Figure 6). To prove that the effects of the HDAC3-deficiency on T cell blasting and proliferation are indeed related to the cholesterol deficiency, the experiment should attempt to restore, not increase cholesterol levels. A cholesterol-loaded WT should also be included as a control. In addition, since cholesterol efflux is not being measured in the study, conclusions could have been strengthened by staining for cholesterol transporters using commercial antibodies.</p><p>In addition, the manuscript would have been improved if certain details were provided about the nature of the WT mice used in each experiment. The methods described that the littermate floxed mice were used as controls in some experiments and &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; C57BL6/J mice were used in others and the term WT was used interchangeably to describe these different mice. The legends also did not detail what the sample size represented (individual mice or cultures) and what sex of mice were used for each experiment.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1. It is surprising that the filipin staining is lowered in T cells cultured in full serum media. I have conducted such studies in T cells cultured with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors and as unable to see decreases in filipin staining in T cells unless the T cells were cultured with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors with serum-free media. This suggested to me that the media could be an important source of cholesterol for these cells. This aspect was not considered.</p><p>2. It would be good to gate the blasting and non-blasting cells with similar sized gates in the WT and KO T cells in the FSC/SSC plot before looking at filipin staining to rule out size effects on autofluorescence.</p><p>3. The finding that the deletion appears to be more efficient in the naïve mature T cells (25% still expressing), versus the memory T cells (75%), suggests that the HDAC3 defect may have given the remaining HDAC3+ T cells a selective advantage to enter the memory T cell pool as a result of homeostatic proliferation. This possibility was not considered.</p><p>4. Legends are sometimes confusing. For example, for Figure 4 (are these HDAC- gated cells from dLck-Cre mice?). If so, what is the WT control. Do you have the internal WT control (HDAC3+ cells in the dLck-Cre floxed mice)? Why was this shown for some experiments and not others.</p><p>5. I didn't find the rationale completely convincing to justify the focus on cholesterol metabolism, when IL-2 and IL-2R expression were decreased by more than 50%! mTORC and metabolic changes occur in part downstream of IL-2R (and CD28). IL-2 and IL-2R defects could have explained the phenotype.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70978.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers provided detailed recommendations which are also provided below for clarity and context.

The shift of the Bcl6-positive population is rather low and therefore it is difficult to gate of T<sub>fh</sub> cells. In addition, the number of T<sub>fh</sub> cells for non-immunized mice seems to be rather high. This might be related to the gating strategy. It might be better to use PD1 vs CXCR5 for the definition of T<sub>fh</sub> cells (and then gate on Bcl6). Did the authors analyze the frequency of T<sub>fh</sub> cells in peyer's patches (in WT mice, T<sub>fh</sub> cells are present in PP at steady state)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have altered the gating scheme to match what was proposed by the reviewer. Figure 2 and its associated supplements 1 and 2 now utilize the two-step strategy of gating on PD-1<sup>+</sup> CXCR5<sup>+</sup> cells and then gating on the Bcl-6<sup>hi</sup> cells. We also added data for T<sub>fh</sub> cells in the Peyer’s patch in Figure 2—figure supplement 2. Using this gating strategy, we see a significant reduction in total T<sub>fh</sub> numbers in the spleen in the dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO compared to WT. There was not a significant difference in T<sub>fh</sub> frequency between dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO and WT in the mLN or Peyer’s patches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Have the authors analyzed cytokine expression in ex vivo isolated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (stimulated with PMA/ionomycin).

Short-term stimulation worked well for IFN-γ in splenocytes, and was comparable between WT and HDAC3-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> Tbet<sup>+</sup> T cells. This is consistent with our in vitro results (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) We conducted short-term (6 hour) stimulation of cells from mesenteric lymph node, where RORγt<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are more abundant, but we were unable to detect IL-17A production in either the WT or HDAC3 cKO cells after PMA/ionomycin stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors need to more convincingly demonstrate that the blasting/proliferation phenotype is related to the cholesterol content.

The data in figure 5 still demonstrates a significant reduction of Filipin III signal and Cholera Toxin Subunit B signal in the HDAC3<sup>-</sup> dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, confirming that HDAC3<sup>-</sup> dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have a reduction in cholesterol content independent from changes in cellular volume during blasting and activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be beneficial to see the cholesterol loading experiments redone where they aren't overloading the cells with cholesterol and have the proper control.</p></disp-quote><p>The concentration of methyl-β-cyclodextrin cholesterol (MBCD-Chol) we used in the paper (5ug/mL) was the lowest biologically relevant concentration for restoration of proliferation. Titration experiments using lower concentrations had little to no effect on the function of dLck-Cre HDAC3-cKO or WT cells. We speculate that this may be related to the mechanism of MBCD-Chol incorporation into cells. Little is known as to whether MBCD-Chol incorporates into membranes or lipid rafts with the same efficiency or frequency into the various cellular compartments as unconjugated cholesterol. It is possible that although the cells are taking up a great deal of cholesterol (as shown by the increase in Filipin III staining), only a fraction of that is providing a physiological benefit to the cells. We have added in the WT+ Cholesterol control to all experiments in figure 6 to demonstrate the effects of exogenous cholesterol on wild type cells as a control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The study &quot;Histone deacetylase 3 represses cholesterol efflux during CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation&quot; represents a detailed study on the role of HDAC3 on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation.

If they include the data, one would also have to show the % and number of the corresponding WT cells from the study.</p></disp-quote><p>To simplify this figure, we removed the % of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell bar graphs from figure 2. For Figure 2 – supplement 1 we now only report the frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the mLN as the number of lymph nodes harvested from each mouse was variable, the frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is a more appropriate comparator than total cell number. For clarity, we added in the flow analysis for the CD4-Cre HDAC3 cKO mice. The CD4-Cre HDAC3 cKO cells have a block in thymocyte development that results in very few mature T cells (and thus differentiated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) in vivo<italic>,</italic> and thus serve as a good control for the loss of the differentiated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell numbers. Further, this loss of mature T cells in CD4-Cre HDAC3 cKO mice produces a relatively non-competitive environment, which allows for the development of relatively normal frequencies of differentiated T<sub>reg</sub>, T<sub>h</sub>2, and T<sub>h</sub>17 CD4 populations in the spleen (Figure 2), despite dramatically reduced total numbers. This reinforces the idea that HDAC3-deficient T cells are capable of differentiating, but are outcompeted by the WT cells in the competitive environment of the dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO in vivo due to poor proliferative capacity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Which cells were used as negative control in Figure 3 as well as in Figure 3—figure supplement 1.

Similarly, the authors show 90% IL-17+ cells. This is very high, however, there seems to be a small fraction of cells that express very high levels. Are these cells the &quot;real&quot; IL-17A positive cells?</p></disp-quote><p>The stain is using an IL-17A antibody (Biolegend Cat #506910). We set a positive gate for all cytokine gates based on the unstimulated controls (black histograms figure 3 – supplement 1). As over 90% of the cells in our T<sub>h</sub>17 differentiation assays were RORγt<sup>+</sup> (Figure 3), the percentage of IL-17A producing cells in this figure is consistent with this.

This result is likely confounded by the deletion timing of HDAC3 in the dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO system. Most (~65-70%) of the recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) are HDAC3 sufficient, while very few (~20%) of the mature naïve T cells are HDAC3 sufficient (Figure 1c). Thus, most of the magnetically-enriched naïve HDAC3-sufficient cells are RTEs, which have been previously shown to have significant functional impairment compared to mature naïve T cells (Cunningham, Helm, and Fink, 2018).Thus, the naïve HDAC3-sufficient cells from the dLck-Cre HDAC3 cKO mice likely do not have a competitive advantage in the stimulation cultures since most of them are also functionally impaired RTEs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The authors should briefly explain why they used Rag1-GFP mice for the data presented in Figure 5d and 5e and why the sorted GFP- cells for this experiment.
