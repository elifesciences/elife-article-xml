intracellular parasite that causes a long-term latent infection of neurons. Using a custom MATLAB-based mapping program in combination with a mouse model that allows us to permanently mark neurons injected with parasite proteins, we found that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>-injected neurons (TINs) are heterogeneously distributed in the brain, primarily localizing to the cortex followed by the striatum. In addition, we determined that cortical TINs are commonly (&gt;50%) excitatory neurons (FoxP2<sup>+</sup>) and that striatal TINs are often (&gt;65%) medium spiny neurons (MSNs) (FoxP2<sup>+</sup>). By performing single neuron patch clamping on striatal TINs and neighboring uninfected MSNs, we discovered that TINs have highly aberrant electrophysiology. As approximately 90% of TINs will die by 8 weeks post-infection, this abnormal physiology suggests that injection with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> protein—either directly or indirectly—affects neuronal health and survival. Collectively, these data offer the first insights into which neurons interact with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and how these interactions alter neuron physiology in vivo.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is an intracellular parasite that infects the brain. Whereas most microbial infections of the brain result in severe illness or death, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infections are usually asymptomatic. This is because the parasite has evolved the ability to exist within the brain by dampening the immune response. The parasite can therefore asymptomatically co-exist with its host for years – or even an entire lifetime. The strategy has proved so successful that up to one third of the world’s population is now thought to be infected with <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>.</p><p>While this persistence tends not to be a problem for most healthy individuals, dormant <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> parasites can reactivate in individuals whose immune systems fail. This can result in life-threatening neurological disease. In pregnant women, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> parasites can also cross the placenta, which can trigger miscarriage or cause harmful disease in the newborn.</p><p>To develop treatments for these cases of symptomatic disease, we need to understand how the parasite hides from the immune system in asymptomatic individuals. Mendez et al. have therefore leveraged a mouse model in which neurons injected with <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> proteins (<italic>Toxoplasma</italic>-injected neurons, or ‘TINs’) produce a green fluorescent protein. This enables the infected cells to be viewed under a microscope.</p><p>Examining the mouse brains revealed that most TINs were located in two specific regions: the cortex and the striatum. The cortex is the brain’s outer layer of tissue. The striatum is a structure deep within the brain that helps regulate movement and responses to rewards. Both the cortex and the striatum contain different types of neurons. The results revealed that the proteins from the parasite were spread roughly equally among the various cell types, rather than targeting a specific subtype of neuron.</p><p>Neurons close to TINs had slightly abnormal electrical activity, whereas the TINs themselves had highly abnormal activity. By eight weeks post-infection, however, the number of TINS had fallen by around 90%. This suggests that many neurons containing <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> protein are sick and dying, and that their altered electrical activity reflects this unhealthy state.</p><p>Understanding how <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> parasites persist in the brain has the potential to reveal new targets for treating symptomatic infections. It could even provide new possibilities for targeting the inflammation that drives many other neurological diseases. Harnessing this potential will require finding out why <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infects specific brain regions and why most neurons that directly interact with the parasite die.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>toxoplasma gondii</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>localization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F99 NS108514</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mendez</surname><given-names>Oscar A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R25 NS076437</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flores Machado</surname><given-names>Emiliano</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008335</institution-id><institution>Arizona Biomedical Research Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ADHS14-082991</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koshy</surname><given-names>Anita A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS095994</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koshy</surname><given-names>Anita A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multi-level profiling of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>-injected neurons identifies brain regions and neuron subtype predilections as well as the effect of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> interactions on neuron physiology and health.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A select number of highly divergent microbes (e.g., measles virus, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>) naturally cause infections of neurons within the central nervous system (CNS). Most of these viruses cause debilitating disease or death, whereas alphaherpes viruses and the eukaryotic parasite <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> primarily establish persistent, relatively quiescent neuronal infections in the immunocompetent host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dubey, 2009</xref>). While neuron-alphaherpes virus interactions have been studied for decades—leading to a mechanistic understanding of herpes virus latency in neurons and the development of novel tools for circuit tracing—our understanding of neuron-<italic>Toxoplasma</italic> interactions is just beginning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ugolini, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wickersham et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p><italic>Toxoplasma</italic> is a ubiquitous intracellular parasite that can infect a wide range of warm-blooded hosts, including birds, rodents, and humans. In most immunocompetent hosts, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> establishes a long-term, asymptomatic infection in specific organs. In humans and rodents, the CNS is a major organ of persistence and is the organ most affected by symptomatic disease in immunocompromised patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Remington and Cavanaugh, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luft and Remington, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dubey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Neu et al., 2015</xref>). Using a Cre-based mouse model in which host cells injected with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> protein permanently express a green fluorescent protein (GFP), our group showed that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> predominantly interacts with neurons, not glia, in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koshy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cabral et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, we determined that neurons injected with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> protein outnumber cysts by over 20-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koshy et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that far more neurons interact with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> than are persistently infected.</p><p>Here, we continue to harness this Cre-based model to extend our understanding of the neuron-<italic>Toxoplasma</italic> interface. We leverage the high numbers of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>-injected neurons (TINs) and the expression of GFP, which labels the full neuron, to carry out a systematic neuroanatomic mapping of TINs. These studies revealed that TINs are most commonly found within the cortex followed by the striatum and are rarely found in the cerebellum. Within the cortex and the striatum, we used immunofluorescent assays to determine if <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> preferentially interacts with specific neuron subtypes, finding instead that the lineage of TINs essentially mirrors regional neuron subtype abundance. Finally, we used single neuron patch clamping in ex vivo slices to compare the electrophysiology of striatal TINs to neighboring ‘bystander’ neurons (neurons within the same slice that were not injected with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> proteins). These first-of-their-kind studies for any neurotropic microbe showed that TINs—but not bystander neurons—had dramatically altered electrophysiology. At 8 weeks post-infection (wpi), the number of TINs drops by approximately 90%, suggesting this abnormal physiology reflects an unhealthy cellular state. Collectively, these data offer the first insights into which neurons interact with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and how these interactions—either directly or indirectly—alter neuron physiology and survival in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TINs are enriched in the cortex, irrespective of infecting <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strain</title><p>Prior work in AIDS patients and rodents suggested that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> does not evenly distribute across the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Post et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lang et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luft and Remington, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arendt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Porter and Sande, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Strittmatter et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berenreiterová et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Evans et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Neu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dubey et al., 2016</xref>). These studies have conflicting findings as to where <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> lesions or cysts (in rodent studies) are predominantly found, differences that might be driven by the small numbers of patients or rodents analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berenreiterová et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Evans et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dubey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boillat et al., 2020</xref>). Given these conflicting studies, we sought to neuroanatomically map the location of TINs, a population that includes both uninfected, injected neurons and actively infected neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koshy et al., 2012</xref>). To accomplish this goal, we used our previously published semi-automated method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mendez et al., 2018</xref>) which utilizes the Allen Institute Mouse Brain Atlas as a reference to quantify and map TINs quickly. This automation made it feasible to sample multiple brain sections per mouse across multiple cohorts of mice infected with either of two genetically distinct <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains (type II— Prugniaud, type III—CEP) that express a <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>:Cre fusion protein and mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koshy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koshy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christian et al., 2014</xref>). For simplicity, from here forward, we will refer to these strains as II-Cre and III-Cre. We quantified TINs in 16–19 brain sections/mouse across 32 regions identified in the Allen Institute Mouse Brain Atlas. Data points were grouped into 12 major regions. For both II-Cre and III-Cre infected mice, the cortex contained the highest average number of TINs, followed by the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In general, III-Cre infected mice showed a higher overall number of TINs compared to II-Cre infected mice (average of 247.5 III-Cre versus 216.7 II-Cre). The increase in absolute numbers in III-Cre infected mice was most pronounced in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

Our method of sectioning does not allow us to collect the smaller sections of the cerebellum, therefore we only included the cerebellar areas from sections 10-16 of the Allen atlas for normalization (consistent with the regions of the cerebellum which were analyzed). To align our sections with the Allen Institute sections, we also excluded the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mendez et al., 2018</xref>). Even with these exclusions, 85% of the original Allen atlas area was used. If the number of TINs in a region is proportional to the size of that region, the normalization index will approximate 1, while regions enriched for TINs will have indices &gt; 1, and regions relatively devoid of TINs will have indices &lt; 1. Using this normalization, we determined that the cortex was the only region which was significantly enriched for TINs in both II-Cre and III-Cre infected mice (index score 1.4 ± 0.1 and 2.2 ± 0.2, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). For both groups of infected mice, within the cortex, the somatosensory, motor, and visual cortices had the highest enrichment score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, two regions—the cerebellum and the white matter tracts—showed a significant lack of enrichment in both II-Cre and III-Cre infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). The lack of TINs in white matter tracts is expected given that these tracts are primarily made up of neuron axons and thus have a paucity of neuron nuclei, the cellular component by which neurons are anatomically mapped. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> has the full list of enrichment scores and statistical analysis for the 12 listed regions.</p><p>In summary, these data show that, irrespective of infecting <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strain, TINs are commonly found in the cortex followed by the striatum and relatively rarely found in the cerebellum. While TINs localization in the striatum is consistent with its size, the enrichment of TINs in the cortex and lack of TINs in the cerebellum are not accounted for by the relative size of these regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>TINs rarely co-localize with markers of inhibitory neurons</title><p>As the cortex and the striatum had the highest number of TINs, we decided to use these areas to determine if <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> targeted a specific neuron population. Neurons can be classified in many ways, including by neurotransmitter expression, physiology, and morphology. The simplest way is to classify neurons is as inhibitory or excitatory. Given that prior work suggested that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection might specifically affect inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2015</xref>), we first examined how often TINs co-localized with two common markers for inhibitory interneurons, calbindin and parvalbumin. We chose these makers rather than the pan-inhibitory marker glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) [GAD<sup>+</sup> interneurons make up approximately 15–20% of all cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gentet et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lodato and Arlotta, 2015</xref>)] as GAD staining is altered in <italic>Toxoplasma-</italic>infected brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrillo et al., 2020</xref>). Fortunately, parvalbumin labels 40–50% of GAD<sup>+</sup> interneurons and calbindin labels approximately 30% of GAD<sup>+</sup> interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hof et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keller et al., 2019</xref>). To quantify how often TINs were calbindin or parvalbumin interneurons, we labeled brain sections with antibodies against either calbindin or parvalbumin, and with antibodies against NeuN, a pan-neuronal marker. These labeled sections were then imaged with confocal microscopy to identify TINs that co-stained with NeuN and either calbindin or parvalbumin. Within the cortex, irrespective of infecting strain, approximately 5% (4.8 ± 2.0% II-Cre, 3.9 ± 0.6% III-Cre) of TINs were calbindin<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), while none were parvalbumin<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). In the striatum, we observed that approximately 4% of II-Cre TINs were calbindin<sup>+</sup> (4.4 ± 2.0%) and approximately 9% of III-Cre TINs were calbindin<sup>+</sup> (9.4 ± 3.4%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>).

To determine the abundance of FoxP2 and DARPP32 neurons near TINs, we re-analyzed the images used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, this time quantifying the number of GFP<sup>-</sup> neurons (NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells) that co-localized with FoxP2 or DARPP32. To determine the abundance of FoxP2 and DARPP32 neurons regardless of proximity to TINs, we generated new, randomly distributed images from a subset of stained sections used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and quantified the co-localization between GFP<sup>-</sup> neurons and FoxP2 or DARPP32.

None of these TINs generated APs in response to the standard protocol, possibly because this highly depolarized membrane potential is too close to the threshold for firing an AP (~45 mV) in MSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Several possibilities could most easily explain this highly depolarized membraned potential: (i) the patched GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were not neurons, (ii) the patched cells were dead neurons, or (iii) the patched cells were unhealthy neurons. To distinguish between these possibilities, when possible, we hyperpolarized the patched TINs, followed by attempts to generate APs. For five TINs, after we applied between −20 and −180 pA of negative current, membrane potentials of −55 to −66 mV were observed. With this ‘normalization’ of the resting membrane potential, we found that TINs could generate APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), definitively showing that they were neurons.

Across multiple cohorts of mice and using two genetically distinct <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains, our data show that TINs consistently localize to the cortex and striatum. For the cortex, the number of TINs is higher than would be expected even after accounting for the size of the cortex. Within the cortex and striatum, we found little evidence of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> targeting a specific neuron subtype, as TINs co-localize with markers for highly abundant neurons in a region (e.g., MSNs in the striatum). Interestingly, when we used whole cell patch clamping in ex vivo slices to assess both striatal TINs and bystander MSNs, we found discrepant electrophysiology. Bystander MSNs showed mild changes in resting membrane potential and no changes in other passive firing properties, while TINs had highly depolarized resting membrane potentials and did not fire APs unless artificially hyperpolarized. These data suggest that TINs, but not bystanders, are unhealthy and potentially dying, a possibility confirmed by a drastic decrease in the number of TINs by 8 wpi. Together, these data offer an unprecedented look into the neuron-<italic>Toxoplasma</italic> interface, raising new questions about why the cortex is particularly vulnerable to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection and the evolutionary advantage of the death of neurons injected with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> protein.</p><p>One of the major advances of this work is how we mapped neuron-<italic>Toxoplasma</italic> interactions. Most previous studies have utilized a single <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strain, relatively few animals (or more animals but relatively few sections/animal), and were limited to measuring cyst location. On the other hand, we mapped TINs, which outnumber cysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koshy et al., 2012</xref>) and show uniform distribution of GFP, allowing us to map neuron cell bodies/somas which is the traditional method for identifying neuron anatomic location. Furthermore, as our semi-automated method is relatively quick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mendez et al., 2018</xref>), in total, we mapped a total of over 5000 TINs/<italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strain, using multiple cohorts of mice and &gt;15 sections/mouse. These robust methods offer confidence that our findings are not unduly influenced by a single outlier mouse, a cohort effect, or insufficient sampling for a process that is highly heterogenous. Our findings are consistent with several aspects of the two most extensive cyst mapping studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berenreiterová et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boillat et al., 2020</xref>). All three studies found: (i) high levels of inter-mouse variability; (ii) identified the cortex—and especially the motor, somatosensory, visual cortical regions—as showing enrichment for <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> presence (TINs or cysts) even when accounting for region size; and (iii) determined that the cerebellum shows relatively little <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> presence, especially when accounting for size. These consistencies suggest that regional cyst burden is driven by differences in the number of neuron-parasite interactions, not by differences in regional innate immune responses as has been suggested for West Nile virus (WNV) infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, these regional differences are consistent with the largest studies in AIDS patients with toxoplasmic encephalitis, in which more lesions are identified in the cortex and the basal ganglia compared to the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Porter and Sande, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arendt et al., 1999</xref>), highlighting the relevance of the mouse model to human disease. Currently, we do not know what drives these regional differences in tropism, though one possibility is differences in the transmissibility of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> across the vasculature that supplies the cortex and striatum/basal ganglia versus the cerebellum (anterior versus posterior circulation, respectively), a possibility also suggested for WNV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daniels et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A second advance in our study is the ability to identify the type of neuron injected by <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. The finding that TINs are comprised of common neuron subtypes in the deep cortex and striatum (e.g., FoxP2<sup>+</sup> neurons) suggests that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> injects (and presumptively infects) in proportion to the neuron subtypes in a given region. One exception to this rule is the lack of TINs that also express parvalbumin. Parvalbumin-expressing neurons make up approximately 40–50% of the cortical GABAergic (inhibitory) neurons and are found in all deeper layers of the cortex, while calbindin-expressing neurons are less frequent, especially in layers IV-VI of the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hof et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). One possibility for the lack of parvalbumin<sup>+</sup> TINs is a decrease or change in parvalbumin expression/location as seen for DARPP-32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) or GAD-67 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2015</xref>). Another more exciting possibility is that parvalbumin<sup>+</sup> neurons have fewer interactions with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> because they have a high concentration of perineural nets—extracellular matrix that surrounds different parts of the neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2017</xref>)—blocking <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>’s ability to contact parvalbumin<sup>+</sup> neurons. Another possibility is that parvalbumin<sup>+</sup> neurons are highly sensitive to injection with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> protein and rapidly die before expressing GFP and/or die prior to the time point at which we performed our studies. Future studies will define the factors that determine which neurons interact with parasites.</p><p>A final advance in this work is the electrophysiology comparing TINs and bystander neurons. To the best of our knowledge, these studies are the first in any neurotropic infection to compare the in situ electrophysiology between microbe-interacted (or infected) neurons versus those neurons in close proximity but without direct microbial interactions. The utility of comparing TINs and bystanders is to address what physiologic effects are driven by the general neuroinflammatory response versus those changes driven by neuron-parasite interactions. Given the relatively common understanding that microglia will strip synapses off infected and uninfected neurons in the inflamed brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vasek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Liberto et al., 2018</xref>), we found it remarkable that bystander MSNs physiology showed only minor changes compared to MSNs from uninfected mice while TINs showed highly abnormal electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). One possible explanation for the minimal changes seen in bystanders is that these neurons undergo compensatory mechanisms that allow them to avoid drastically changing, as a dramatic response would be detrimental to the local circuitry. Another possibility is that the effect of the neuroinflammatory response is confined to a small area near TINs, leaving these more distant bystanders relatively spared. Either explanation would preserve circuit function at a global level and allow for a relatively quick reversal of these physiologic changes once the inflammatory response subsides. Of note, while the physiology of the bystanders is relatively normal compared to TINs, this depolarized resting membrane potential is still abnormal and the decrease in required input current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) suggests these neurons are mildly hyperexcitable. If similar changes also occur in other bystander neurons (e.g., cortical neurons) and in other CNS infections, they might explain why patients with active brain infections have an increased likelihood of seizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luft and Remington, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Neu et al., 2015</xref>). These mild abnormalities might also summate across many bystander neurons to cause circuit level changes. While we did not test this possibility, such changes in the far more numerous bystanders—especially if the changes are reversible—could explain both the heterogeneity of behavioral changes seen in infected animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Worth et al., 2014</xref>) and the relative lack of behavioral abnormalities observed in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>-infected mice that have cleared both the infection and the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McGovern et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>TINs—which include actively infected neurons and uninfected, injected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>)—show highly abnormal electrophysiology, only firing APs after artificial hyperpolarization. While we cannot distinguish between whether this abnormal physiology leads to neuron death or the sick state of these neurons drives the abnormal physiology (we favor the latter possibility), the discrepancy between the physiology of TINs and bystanders suggests that the root cause is specific to neurons injected with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> protein. Such restricted changes could arise from direct manipulation of TINs by the injected parasite proteins or selective microglial/macrophage recognition and phagocytosis of TINs, consistent with what was observed in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Liberto et al., 2018</xref>). Another possibility, as noted above, is that the immune response is tightly regulated and confined, such that the destruction leveled by this response is limited to a very small area around TINs. Such a possibility is consistent with prior work showing that partial abrogation of astrocytic TGF-β signaling led to de-regulation of the CNS immune response to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and higher levels of neuronal loss without changing the CNS parasite burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cekanaviciute et al., 2014</xref>). Future studies will determine what factors drive this abnormal physiology.</p><p>Finally, our finding of an approximately 90% decrease in TINs by 8 wpi suggests that we need to re-evaluate our understanding of how and why microbes persist in or even infect neurons. Microbes with the capability to infect multiple cell types are commonly found in neurons, not astrocytes (e.g., <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, WNV, measles virus). This neuronal preference has been explained by the idea that—given the long-lived, relatively non-regenerative nature of neurons—neuron survival must be ensured at almost any cost. Thus, rather than initiating an immune response that might result in neuron death, neurons survive infection through non-cytolytic clearance of microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Binder and Griffin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patterson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Samuel and Diamond, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller et al., 2016</xref>) and/or pushing the infecting microbes to enter a latent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Speck and Simmons, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferguson and Hutchison, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2016</xref>). The death of TINs directly challenges this model, suggesting that the battle to persist in neurons is far more nuanced than previously recognized. For example, given that &gt;90% of TINs are expected to be uninfected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koshy et al., 2012</xref>), we would predict that many uninfected neurons are dying. What is the advantage of uninfected, parasite-manipulated neurons dying? One possibility is that these TINs are so abnormal (from either direct manipulation by parasites or because of neuron-immune cell interactions) that global brain function is better preserved with the removal of these neurons. Such a possibility is consistent with the altered gene expression identified in neurons that cleared an attenuated rabies virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gomme et al., 2012</xref>). Another possibility is that the death of TINs—both infected and uninfected—is essential for parasite control and perhaps the death of uninfected TINs is simply collateral damage. Or the death of uninfected TINs might divert immune attention from the rare, persistently infected neuron. Regardless of whether this death benefits the host or microbe (or both), based upon the data presented here and previously, we offer an alternative model for neuron-tropic microbes: neurons mount appropriate immune responses to both cytokines and infections such that persistent infection is a rare outcome, rather than a universal one. Limited data in a murine model of measles virus infection is consistent with this possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller et al., 2019</xref>), though future studies using other neurotropic pathogens will be required to definitively determine how universal this model is.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>T<italic>oxoplasma</italic> gondii</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Type II (Prugniaud)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koshy et al., 2012</xref></td><td valign="top">II-Cre</td><td valign="top">Expresses mCherry and Cre recombinase</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>T<italic>oxoplasma</italic> gondii</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Type III (CEP)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christian et al., 2014</xref></td><td valign="top">III-Cre</td><td valign="top">Expresses mCherry and Cre recombinase</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Ai6 mouse, ZsGreen1</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratories</td><td valign="top">Stock #

For primary antibodies, the following were incubated for 15–18 hr at 4°C in PBS with 0.3% Triton-X and 5% goat serum: mouse biotin conjugated anti-NeuN B-clone A60 (Millipore, MAB377, 1:500), rabbit anti-calbindin (Sigma-Aldrich, C2724, 1:500), rabbit anti-parvalbumin (Abcam, ab11427, 1:1000), rabbit anti-FoxP2 (Abcam, ab16046, 1:1000), rabbit anti-DARPP32 (Abcam, ab40801, 1:500). Following incubation in the appropriate antibody, sections were then incubated for 2 hr in the following secondaries: goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen, A11011, 1:500), Cy5 streptavidin (Invitrogen, SA1011, 1:500), and all sections were counterstained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:1000).</p><p>For filled MSNs, sections were processed as discussed below. For staining, sections with filled MSNs were permeabilized with 0.6% Triton-X in PBS, then incubated with DARPP32 antibody in 5% goat serum, 0.6% Triton-X in PBS for 48 hr at 4°C. Sections were washed then incubated with Cy5 streptavidin (1:500) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 (1:500) for 24 hr at 4°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electrophysiology of MSNs</title><p>Mouse brain slice electrophysiology recording was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nisenbaum et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dorris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Willett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haubensak et al., 2010</xref>). Mice were sacrificed with CO<sub>2</sub>, after which the descending aorta was clamped and the mice were intracardially perfused with ice-cold oxygenated artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF) containing 126 mM NaCl, 1.6 mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 18 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11 mM glucose. After the olfactory bulbs and the cerebellum were removed, the brain was transferred to a vibratome stage that contained ice-cold ACSF oxygenated with carbogen (95% O<sub>2</sub> balanced with CO<sub>2</sub>); 200 μm coronal sections were then generated with the vibratome (Leica, VT1000S). Brain slices were immediately transferred to oxygenated NMDG-HEPES recovery solution (93 mM NMDG, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 30 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20 mM HEPES, 25 mM glucose, 5 mM sodium ascorbate, 2 mM thiourea, 3 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 300–310 mOsm, titrated with 10 N HCl to adjust pH to 7.3–7.4) and were allowed to recover for 15 min at 32–34°C. After the recovery portion, brain slices were then transferred to room temperature oxygenated ACSF for 1 hr. After the rest period, recordings were performed in a rig equipped with a MultiClamp 700B, a Digidata 1550A1 (Molecular Devices), and a fluorescent microscope (Olympus BX51) that was used to visualize sections and identify TINs. Patch pipettes were pulled with P-97 Sutter micropipette puller to achieve a resistance of 8–16 MΩ, after which they were filled with an intracellular solution (135 mM potassium gluconate, 5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgATP, and 0.1 mM GTP, pH 7.3–7.4, 290–300 mOsm). Recording data were sampled at 10 kHz, filtered at 3 kHz, and analyzed (Molecular Devices, pCLAMP, 10.7). For bystander neurons and neurons in uninfected mice, the classification as an MSN was based on the firing pattern in response to the current injections as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmidt and Perkel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farries and Perkel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding and Perkel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ding et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Willett et al., 2016</xref>). For filling experiments, once data from a 200 μm section were recorded, the recorded neurons were filled with 0.6% neurobiotin (Vector Labs, SP1120). Filled sections were then stored in 4% PFA for 24 hr followed by cryopreservation in cryoprotective media until stained as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Microscopy and quantification</title><p>Slides for localization data were imaged on a Leica DMI6000 with a motorized stage, using Leica Application Suite X (LAS X) at 10× magnification. Base background subtraction and white balance was maintained throughout individual cohorts. Image stitching was done automatically through LAS X with a 10% overlap and images stored as Leica image file format (lif). Lif images were then processed on a custom MATLAB code for image transformation onto the Allen Institute reference atlas, followed by semi-automated quantification, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mendez et al., 2018</xref>.

For co-localization studies, 8–10 sections/mouse were imaged. Images were captured on a Zeiss LSM880 inverted confocal microscope (Marley Microscopy Core, UA). Images were captured with a 20× objective, with 1× PMT zoom, all settings were the same across specific staining runs.

Significant regional differences in parasite tropism, as well as selectivity for different neuronal subtypes were observed. Significantly, parasite-affected neurons exhibited severe defects in electrophysiology and may subsequently die, while neighboring uninfected neurons display only minor changes in physiology. These findings highlight the extent to which Toxoplasma interacts with neurons and suggest that even transient or aborted infections can lead to neuronal clearance. This paper will be of interest to those studying parasite infections and host-pathogen interactions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> injected neurons localize to the cortex and striatum and have altered firing&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Figure 5 shows significance between neurons in uninfected mice and bystander neurons (Figure 5A).

The electrophysiology of TINS does seem drastically different however the simplification of the bystander data may be missing important biology. The equivalent of Figure 5B-G is not shown. Because TINs required hyperpolarization to confirm their neuronal status and to measure anything, it is possible that the electrophysiology data alone is not able to detect more subtle differences in neuronal physiology such as a cell that is in a quiescent state?

There is constant speculation that Toxoplasma infection causes neurological disease. This work would definitely suggest that it is not a benign infection and has serious consequences. Although bold statements are not needed for good science there could be more links to the broader biology of neurotropic infections in the discussion as nicely alluded to in the introduction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67681.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

The finding that bystander TINs had a detectable change in electrophysiology (compared to neurons in uninfected mice) was considered to be a significant finding. Could the authors comment or expand on the significance of the electrophysiological changes observed in the by-stander neurons in infected mice compared to neurons in uninfected mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended our discussion to highlight that while the bystander physiology is relatively normal compared to TINs physiology, it is still abnormal. In addition, we have also included a new figure (Supp Figure 6) which shows an expected consequence of the depolarized nature of bystanders; they require less input current to trigger the first action potential. In the discussion, we have noted that such changes in other neurons (e.g., cortical neurons) might lead to an increase in seizures— which is seen in patients with symptomatic toxoplasmosis (ie. congenital and recrudescent infections)— or even the various behavioral changes observed in rodents. We have expanded our discussion to include such possibilities but have stressed that these findings are speculations that require further studies to confirm or negate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Consider normalizing TIN numbers to host nuclei rather than tissue area in considering distribution across tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s pointing out that neuron density may play a role in where we find TINs. For example, the limited number of neuron nuclei in/near white matter tracts is almost certainly what accounts for the “under enrichment” of TINs in white matter tracts (in a sense it is a nice built-in control that our system is working). We have noted this explanation in the results.</p><p>We also agree that neuron density could explain why TINs somas are enriched in deeper cortical layers and not in more superficial cortical layers. We will incorporate such considerations into future studies/analyses but feel that such re-analysis is beyond the scope of this paper for several reasons. First, prior <italic>T. gondii</italic> studies that have quantified cyst locations have used region size for normalization (Berenreiterova et al., 2011; Boillat et al., 2020). Thus, by using size ourselves, we could be consistent with these papers and draw connections to them. Second, for most of the major brain regions, relative size correlates with the number of TINs found in those regions, suggesting that size may adequately explain why a certain percentage of TINs is found in those regions (even without accounting for nuclei density). From a statistical standpoint, for both type II and type III infection, size does not correlate with the number of TINs for only two regions beyond the white matter tracts: the cortex and cerebellum. Given that the cerebellum is a relatively large brain region and has a high density of neurons in the granular layer— the lack of TINs here suggests that some unknown factor (such as difference in vascular permeability (Daniels et al., 2017)) rather than area size or neuron density accounts for the cerebellum’s relative resistance to infection. Third, unlike brain region size where the Allen Institute Mouse Brain Atlas is accepted as a standard, there is no accepted standard for neuron density, in part because counts vary widely (reviewed in Keller et al., 2018, Tables 1-4). Given the lack of standard counts, the most appropriate way to normalize would be to do our own counts of host nuclei in each region and ideally in both uninfected and infected mice. Counting host nuclei in infected tissue becomes complicated because of the infiltrating immune cells and dividing glia, an issue that cannot be solved by counting only neurons because of a loss of antigenicity for multiple neuron markers in inflamed brain tissue (Cekanaviciute et al., 2014; David et al., 2016). Pursuing such counts in uninfected tissue alone leads to a technical issue for us: when trying to count cells with high numbers using our program (Mendez, Potter et al., 2018), our processing system cannot not handle the workload (i.e., the program crashes). Thus, at this time, we feel that normalizing by size is an appropriate first step and will use the recommended normalization in subsequent work which will pursue defining the mechanisms that lead to enrichment of TINs in the cortex and a lack of TINs in the cerebellum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Comment or provide information on the extent to which TINs correspond to successful versus aborted infections.</p></disp-quote><p>With the current Cre system, in vivo, we cannot distinguish between aborted invasion and invasion followed by intracellular killing of the parasite. In addition, as many cysts are in distal neuronal processes (Cabral, Tuladhar et al., 2016), we often cannot determine if a TIN is infected unless we do a full neuron reconstruction, which requires thick sections rather than the 40 micron sections we used for the immunohistochemical studies. For this reason, we do not make distinctions about infection status or how an uninfected but injected TIN arose. We clarified this issue in the text (i.e. TINs refers to both infected and uninfected, injected neurons) as well as included a new figure that more clearly explains this concept. In addition, we have noted that our prior work suggests that &gt;90% of these TINs are not infected, which is consistent with our findings in thick sections where we have done whole neuron reconstructions (unpublished data.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Many people now identify specific neuron populations by fluorescent protein expression and such issues have not been noted. In addition, as we were concerned that inflammation plus fluorescent protein expression might cause an issue, we pursued patch-clamping of cortical neurons in infected thy1-YFP mice (Jax 003709; Feng et al., 2000). We did not find TINs-like electrophysiology abnormalities in the YFP<sup>+</sup> cortical neurons (new Figure 6- supplemental figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Several studies by different labs shed light on some of this complexity. Hermes et al., 2008 found no differences in neuronal density at 1 year post infection. Parlog et al., 2014 identified subtle region-specific differences on MRI and showed a mild amount of neuron degeneration (which might be TINs death or bystander death), but most neurons were intact. Of note, both referenced studies used a a type II <italic>T. gondii</italic> strain that is known to cause more inflammation and result in higher cyst numbers compared to the type II strain we used. For these reasons, it is unclear how well those studies would correlate to ours. Finally, while NeuN, MAP2, and β-III tubulin staining distinctly decreases in infected mice (Cekanaviciute et al., 2014, David et al., 2016), nissl staining suggests these neurons are still intact (David et al., 2016). This discrepancy between nissl staining and other neuron-specific antibodies in the setting of inflammation is consistent with the idea that neurons in the inflamed brain can lose some antigenicity— the significance of which we currently do not know. We continue to ponder ways in which to answer this important question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Of note, given that Figure 5 and Figure 6 use different statistical tests (Figure 5 has 2 groups, Figure 6 has 3), the p-values are different.</p><p>In regard to the death of TINs, we are actively pursuing these studies (in a COVID delayed manner) but have nothing to report at this time in terms of cell death in relation to infection and/or the type of cell death the TINs are undergoing. Our preliminary data suggests TINs do not co-localize with staining for cleaved Caspase 3 but these data are too preliminary for publication. Staining for RIPK1 and MLKL are best described in cell culture and are affected by fixative (Samson et al., Cell Death and Differentiation 2021). Unfortunately, the fixative that works best (methanol), kills the GFP signal in such a way that even post-fixation anti-GFP (really antiZsGreen) antibodies (which work with PFA fixed tissue), no longer identify the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (we’ve tried). The RIPK3 antibody maybe a possibility but we have not started those experiments yet. Trying to antibody stain thick tissue (which is what would be needed to define if the TIN is infected or not) will then represent the next hurdle. In short, we are using multiple methods to try to address this question, but, currently, we have no reliable data to address the Reviewer’s comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

While we agree that the loss of neurons would not be considered benign, an actual global/functional consequence of losing these neurons remains to be shown. As the consequences of Toxoplasma infection— especially in humans— has been overstated by the media compared to the data (please see Johnson, Koshy mBio 2020), we have refrained from making statements about the nature of this neuronal loss. We have expanded our discussion of how our data might relate to behavior changes in rodents (bystanders) and affect how we think about neurotropic infections. We hope the Reviewer will feel that we sufficiently “connected the dots” for how our findings have important and broad implications.
