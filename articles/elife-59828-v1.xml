initiate (mt)DNA repair mechanisms and use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) as energy source. Prolonged PARP activity can drain cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> reserves, leading to de-regulation of important molecular processes. Here, we provide evidence of a pathophysiological mechanism that connects mtDNA damage to cardiac dysfunction via reduced NAD<sup>+</sup> levels and loss of mitochondrial function and communication. Using a transgenic model, we demonstrate that high levels of mice cardiomyocyte mtDNA damage cause a reduction in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels due to extreme DNA repair activity, causing impaired activation of NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent SIRT3. In addition, we show that myocardial mtDNA damage in combination with high dosages of nicotinamideriboside (NR) causes an inhibition of sirtuin activity due to accumulation of nicotinamide (NAM), in addition to irregular cardiac mitochondrial morphology. Consequently, high doses of NR should be used with caution, especially when cardiomyopathic symptoms are caused by mitochondrial dysfunction and instability of mtDNA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondrial dna</kwd><kwd>NAD<sup>+</sup></kwd><kwd>cardiovascular disease</kwd><kwd>nicotinamide riboside</kwd><kwd>SIRT3</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013263</institution-id><institution>Nasjonalforeningen for Folkehelsen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lauritzen</surname><given-names>Knut H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006095</institution-id><institution>Helse Sør-Øst RHF</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lauritzen</surname><given-names>Knut H</given-names></name><name><surname>Aukrust</surname><given-names>Pål</given-names></name><name><surname>Yndestad</surname><given-names>Arne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norges Forskningsråd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Halvorsen</surname><given-names>Bente</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transgenic mice and cell models provide evidence of a pathophysiological mechanism that connects mtDNA damage to cardiac dysfunction via reduced NAD<sup>+</sup> levels and loss of mitochondrial function and communication.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myocardial dysfunction ultimately leading to heart failure (HF) is an increasing health concern worldwide. Although HF treatment has improved during the past few decades, the mortality and morbidity of this disorder is still high, suggesting that important pathogenic mechanisms are not fully modified by the current treatment modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marzetti et al., 2013</xref>). Mitochondria are critical for the high energy demand of the heart, and defects in energy metabolism in cardiac mitochondria are seen in various forms of myocardial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ren et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, mitochondria are an important source of cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Whereas ROS are involved in physiological signaling cascades regulating various cellular and organ functions, enhanced production may induce oxidative DNA damage that could promote development of cardiomyopathy and HF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fleming et al., 2017</xref>). In fact, dysfunction of cardiomyocyte mitochondria is increasingly believed to be an important feature of progression of various forms of cardiac disease, and mitochondrial morphological disorganization and dysfunction have been found in HF patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Unno et al., 2009</xref>). Mitochondria contain their own genome (mtDNA), and even though it is uncertain how instability of mtDNA affects mitochondrial function during development of myocardial dysfunction, it is vital that mtDNA remains relatively damage‐free for proper mitochondrial function as shown by the evolution of mtDNA specific repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gredilla et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>DNA damage in the form of apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites increases the risk of single-strand DNA breaks and is predominantly recognized by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes that again initiate repair mechanisms. PARP activity is dependent on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)<sup>+</sup> as a substrate and localizes to the mitochondria as well as the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rossi et al., 2009</xref>). High PARP activity has been speculated to drain NAD<sup>+</sup> reserves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karamanlidis et al., 2013</xref>). NAD<sup>+</sup> is found in all living cells, and serves as a crucial coenzyme for enzymes that fuel reduction-oxidation reactions, carrying electrons from one metabolic intermediate to another, and as a substrate for enzymes such as PARPs and sirtuins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Verdin, 2015</xref>). SIRT1-5 are deacetylases that are central in the cellular defense against DNA damage and oxidative stress, by increasing antioxidant pathways and by facilitating DNA damage repair. Accordingly, sirtuins are shown to promote longevity and can mitigate many diseases related to aging and cardiovascular disease such as HF. As a consequence, depletion of the NAD<sup>+</sup> pool would cause cellular harm due to loss of sirtuin activity and a dysregulation of a number of protective pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karamanlidis et al., 2013</xref>). SIRT3 resides in mitochondria where it regulates a number of mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>), and loss of its activity due to suboptimal NAD<sup>+</sup> levels leads to de-regulation of important and varied molecular processes, including antioxidant systems, mtDNA repair, and mitochondrial dynamics. Thus, whereas NAD<sup>+</sup> is an important co-factor for enzymes related to antioxidant defense and repair mechanisms, increased PARP activity may in itself deplete NAD<sup>+</sup> stores. Agents that could maintain NAD<sup>+</sup> levels could therefore be an attractive therapeutic approach in disorders where increased PARP activity and decreased SIRT activity drive impaired mitochondrial function and increased mtDNA damage and ultimately cellular and tissue failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karamanlidis et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A recent study showed that supplementation with the NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) can partially normalize NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratios, and thereby restore SIRT3 activity and consequently mitochondrial function in mice with HF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karamanlidis et al., 2013</xref>). Also, studies using nicotinamide riboside (NR) as a means to boost NAD<sup>+</sup> levels have recently shown beneficial effects for several physiological functions, including cardiac function in mice with dilated cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diguet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). However, the therapeutic benefit and safety of these compounds are far from clear, and if and how NR supplementation improves cardiac function needs to be further elucidated.</p><p>In this study, we show a direct link between mtDNA damage to loss of mitochondrial function and communication, with cardiac hypertrophy as a consequence. We used a previously characterized transgenic mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lauritzen et al., 2015</xref>), where a mutated DNA repair enzyme (termed mutUNG1) under control of the Tet-on system creates high levels of AP sites specifically in the mtDNA of cardiomyocytes. We demonstrate that high levels of cardiomyocyte mtDNA damage cause a reduction in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in heart tissue due to highly active DNA repair, and consequently mitochondrial dysfunction due to loss of activation of crucial proteins involved in mitochondrial homeostasis. In addition, we show that treatment with a high dose of NR as a tool to increase NAD<sup>+</sup> levels may inhibit rather than increase sirtuin activity due to accumulation of nicotinamide (NAM). Our findings suggest that NR might have disadvantageous effects on cardiomyocyte mitochondria, at least in high dosages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Elevated PARP activity depletes cardiac NAD<sup>+</sup> levels and increases mitochondrial protein acetylation</title><p>We utilized a mouse model where high levels of mtDNA damage in the form of AP sites are generated specifically in cardiomyocytes. These mice develop cardiac hypertrophy and die of HF ~8 weeks after mtDNA damage initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lauritzen et al., 2015</xref>). AP sites increase the risk of single-strand DNA breaks, which are recognized by PARP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caldecott, 2008</xref>). PARP initiates DNA repair and uses NAD<sup>+</sup> as a substrate for its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>). We hypothesized that strongly increased PARP activity would deplete NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, which again would impair the function of other crucial NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent proteins such as sirtuins. Indeed, we found increased PARP levels in isolated mitochondria from heart tissue from mutUNG1-expressing mice compared to wild-type (Wt) littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>), accompanied by reduced total NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in cardiac tissue as assessed by HPLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Sirtuins are also dependent on NAD<sup>+</sup> and SIRT3 is the major mitochondrial isoform that controls the activity of a number of different proteins through deacetylation. Whereas we saw an increase in SIRT3 protein levels in mitochondrial extracts from mutUNG1 cardiac tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>), the overall protein acetylation status was increased in mitochondrial extract from mutUNG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>), indicating lower SIRT3 activity. This was also seen in the acetylation status of SOD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref>), which is dependent on SIRT3 activity. Impaired SOD2 function could contribute to weakened antioxidant defenses with enhanced oxidative DNA damage as a potential consequence. Importantly, increased damage will increase PARP activity, representing a potential vicious circle in these mice.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Elevated PARP activity depletes cardiac NAD<sup>+</sup> levels and reduces mitochondrial protein deactylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot showing PARP levels in cardiac mitochondrial extract from mutUNG1-expressing mice and wild-type littermates.

By investigating the acetylation status of OPA1, we saw an increase in acetylation of immunprecipitated OPA1 in mutUNG1-expressing mice compared to Wt littermates in total cardiac tissue. This indicates that a loss of OPA1 activity and regulation play a part in the observed impaired mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–K</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Elevation of NAD<sup>+</sup> levels through NR treatment does not mitigate cardiac hypertrophy in mutUNG1-expressing mice</title><p>To test if replenishment of NAD<sup>+</sup> levels could reverse the cardiac phenotype in mutUNG1-expressing mice, we included NR in their diet (referred to as chow-NR). NR enters the ‘NAD salvage pathway’ through nicotinamide riboside kinase 1 which metabolizes NR into NMN. NR can thereby be used as a means to boost NAD<sup>+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braidy et al., 2019</xref>). The dose (400 mg/kg chow) was chosen from the literature and is considered a medium dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gariani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). To investigate if NR did boost NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in the animals, we first measured NAD<sup>+</sup> levels using HPLC in the myocardium. Even though we did reconfirm lower levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> in heart tissue in mutUNG1-expressing mice, we did not see any increase in cardiac NAD<sup>+</sup> levels with NR supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, others have noted that it is difficult to achieve increase in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in heart tissue, possibly due to very high metabolic turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Trammell et al., 2016</xref>). However, these authors found NR to increase hepatic NAD<sup>+</sup> levels. Indeed, we did detect an increase in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in the livers of mutUNG1-expressing mice, suggesting that NR treatment does increase cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> in this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), albeit in a potential tissue-specific manner. Nevertheless, NR supplementation did not lead to any significant changes in the cardiac phenotype of mutUNG1-expressing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–K</xref>). Physical and echocardiographic measurements show cardiac hypertrophy, with increased mass of both left and right ventricular size in mutUNG1-expressing mice compared to Wt littermates, but with no significant difference between mutUNG1-expressing mice fed chow with or without NR supplement.

Whereas heart mitochondria from mice without NR treatment are tethered together with visible contact points, mitochondria in mice fed chow-NR seemed to have a rounder shape and to be organized in a more solitary fashion with less obvious contact points with neighboring mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> illustrates cristae structure of the cardiomyocyte mitochondria. Recent morphological studies have shown that adjacent mitochondria can interact through specialized regulated inter-mitochondrial junction (IMJ) sites, where cristae membranes become organized into coordinated pairs across organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Picard et al., 2015</xref>). This was also seen in our Wt mice, and highlighted in panel (ii) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, where there is a clear alignment of cristae structures of three neighboring mitochondria with visible contact points between mitochondria (indicated with red arrowheads). This, however, was not as prominent in Wt animals fed chow-NR, where the mitochondria have a rounder shape without tethering of neighboring organelles. The IMJs seem to be lost to a large extent, resulting in failing of cristae structures to align between neighboring mitochondria. As observed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lauritzen et al., 2015</xref>), the cristae structure in mutUNG1-expressing mice is heavily unorganized and damaged, and NR treatment did not alleviate this impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Nicotinamde riboside (NR) treatment does not alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction in mutUNG1-expressing mice, but does alter mitochondrial morphology in wild-type mitochondria.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Electron microscope images of wild-type and mutUNG1-expressing mice fed chow with and without NR.

This was particularly surprising regarding Wt mice on an NR supplement, and we speculate that lower levels of IMJ are caused by the change of mitochondrial shape with a higher degree of circularity that leads to a loss of organelle tethering and thereby contact points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Proteom analyses support structural effects of NR treatment on mitochondria</title><p>Mitofusin 2 (MFN2), dynamin-related protein (DRP1), and peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1a) are proteins typically involved in mitochondrial morphogenesis and biogenesis.

As mitochondria interact with other organelles, one could expect some contamination of non-mitochondria proteins in these extracts.

Whereas the acetylation was high in mutUNG1-expressing mice compared to Wt littermates, NR supplementation had no effect on the acetylation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). To investigate if the NR dose was too low to have any effect on SIRT3 activity, we fed the animals with a higher NR dose (1000 mg/chow). This gave a small, non-significant increase in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). To our surprise, a high dose of NR caused an even higher overall mitochondrial protein acetylation than the lower dose, at least in heart tissue of the mutUNG1-expressing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). However, this was not seen in liver tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). During deacetylation, sirtuins release NAM from their substrate NAD<sup>+</sup>, and it has been shown that this can inhibit sirtuin activity as a negative feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avalos et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore next measured NAM levels using HPLC and notably, there was a significant increase in NAM levels in cardiac tissue of mutUNG1-expressing mice, but not in Wt littermates fed chow-NR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In liver tissue, NR-chow induced an increase in NAM levels in both genotypes, illustrating the complexity of NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism and tissue differences in turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). No regulation of cardiac gene expression was found for NAMPT and NMAT1-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>), indicating that accumulation of NAM is not caused by alterations in gene expression of components involved the salvage pathway in this context. Thus, it is possible that higher NR doses lead to an accumulation of NAM, and that this may result in inhibition rather than enhancement of SIRT3 activity, with an increase in the overall mitochondrial protein acetylation as a consequence.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Nicotinamde riboside (NR) treatment does not counteract mitochondrial protein acetylation in cardiomyocytes but causes accumulation of nicotinamide.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot of protein acetylation levels in cardiac mitochondrial extract from mutUNG1-expressing mice and wild-type littermates fed chow with or without medium dose of NR.

To further investigate this issue, we utilized a stably transfected cell line where mutUNG1 is expressed and under control of the Tet-on system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lauritzen et al., 2010</xref>). As seen in heart tissue, the cells expressed PARP in mitochondria with a significantly higher level in mutUNG1-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). Interestingly, the highest levels of PARP were in mutUNG1-expressing cells treated with NR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Herein, we show that an increase in PARP activity in response to increased mtDNA damage depleted NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in mutUNG1 mice. These interactions resulted in decreased mitochondrial deacetylation, most likely due to impaired SIRT3 activity, which promoted further mitochondrial dysfunction, potentially representing a pathogenic loop in the progression of cardiac remodeling in these mice. While NR has been suggested to restore NAD<sup>+</sup> levels and thereby improve mitochondrial function and SIRT3 activity, we show that NR, particularly at high doses, had the opposite effects in cardiac tissue potentially secondary to enhanced NAM levels that would inhibit SIRT3 activity. Moreover, detailed studies of the mitochondria show that NR promoted disorganization of mitochondrial structures, involving impaired activation of OPA1, a key regulator of mitochondrial inner membrane structure. Our findings show the importance of PARP, NAD<sup>+</sup>, and SIRT3 as well as their complex interactions in the development of mitochondrial dysfunction during deterioration of myocardial function. These data also suggest that the use of NR in rescuing these cardiac events should be reevaluated, in particular at higher dosages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Illustration of the concept behind effect of loss of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) due to overactive (mt).</title><p>DNA damage repair and consequences of nicotinamide (NAM) accumulation in cardiac tissue.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59828-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We wanted to investigate the correlation between loss of mtDNA integrity, mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyopathy, and utilized a previously characterized mouse model where mtDNA damage in the form of AP sites is induced specifically in cardiomyocytes in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lauritzen et al., 2015</xref>). AP sites increase the risk of single-strand breaks, which are recognized by PARP that initiates NAD<sup>+</sup> consuming repair of this lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caldecott, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vida et al., 2017</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that loss of NAD<sup>+</sup> could be a driving force in the fatal phenotype in this model. Interestingly, PARP (over)activation has been shown to contribute to HF induced by the anticancer anthracycline drug, doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pacher et al., 2002</xref>), and in vitro and in vivo studies with PARP inhibitors diminished this cytotoxic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Damiani et al., 2018</xref>). However, we found that NR supplementation with the intention to increase NAD<sup>+</sup> levels failed to improve the cardiac protein deacetylation status and phenotype in the mutUNG1 mice. In fact, a higher dosage of NR even worsened the cardiac deacetylation status in these mice. Importantly, NR caused a marked increase in NAM in both cardiac and liver tissue, and this compound has been shown to inhibit sirtuin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avalos et al., 2005</xref>). It is therefore likely that NAM-mediated inhibition of sirtuin activity in the myocardium during NR supplementation results in impaired rather than improved cardiac protein deacetylation and function. An earlier study showed that even though the nuclear and cytoplasmic NAD<sup>+</sup> levels were reduced after genotoxic stress, the mitochondrial NAD<sup>+</sup> pool remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). We however speculate that specific mtDNA damage like AP sites (with concomitant PARP activation) will affect the mitochondrial NAD<sup>+</sup> levels as well.</p><p>Depletion of the cellular and mitochondrial NAD<sup>+</sup> pool can cause inhibition of important NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent proteins, especially the sirtuins. This seems to be the situation in our model, where there is a reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in cardiac tissue of mutUNG1 expressing mice and a loss of mitochondrial deacetylation. Even though there seems to be elevated protein levels of SIRT3 in these mice, this might be a cellular compensatory strategy due to reduced deacetylation activity, even though the regulation of mitochondrial proteins through acetylation seems to be complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fisher-Wellman et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, <italic>SIRT3</italic> transcription is stimulated by ROS, and the increased levels of SIRT3 might be a reflection of elevated ROS production in mutUNG1-expressing mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lauritzen et al., 2015</xref>). Since SIRT3 regulates the activity of a number of molecular processes, including the antioxidant function of SOD2, a loss of SOD2 activation, as shown in mitochondrial extract from mutUNG1-expressing cardiac tissue, would lead to a further increase in mtDNA damage and ROS production, causing a negative spiral that would be detrimental to the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, SIRT3 controls OPA1 activity through deacetylation, and is thereby an important part in the regulation of mitochondrial structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Samant et al., 2014</xref>). The lack of activity and control of OPA1 could cause dysfunction of overall mitochondrial homeostasis in cardiac tissue, and illustrates the importance of functional SIRT3 levels in cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, it was recently shown that adjacent cardiomyocyte mitochondria exhibit sites of membrane contact and inter-organelle alignment of cristae structures, suggesting a means of intracellular communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Picard et al., 2015</xref>). Owing to the central role of OPA1 in maintaining inner mitochondrial structure, reduced OPA1 activity due to loss of acetylation could therefore cause severe cardiac impairment by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction, which is exemplified in the mutUNG1-expressing mice. In the present study, we confirm our previous data on a disorganized mitochondrial structure in the mutUNG1 myocardium, and we now show that this disorganization most likely involves (de)acetylated OPA1. Our findings underscore the role of intact mitochondrial organization for mitochondrial function and point to a possible mechanism for the harmful effect of cardiac mitochondria in mutUNG1-expressing mice.</p><p>NR has recently become a popular tool for boosting NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, and has been reported to have anti-aging properties and suggested as a treatment for patients suffering from brain disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gong et al., 2013</xref>). However, in our study, NR does not seem to have overall positive effects. On the contrary, NR supplementation induced a failing of cristae structures to align between neighboring mitochondria and the IMJ sites seemed to be lost. The metabolic dynamics are tightly connected to mitochondrial structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Picard et al., 2015</xref>), and F1Fi-ATP synthase, the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS), and OPA1 are three membrane-shaping components exhibiting crucial roles in cristae biology. NR supplementation induced metabolic changes as shown by altered protein levels for proteins involved in FA (fatty acid) metabolism, TCA cycle, and OXPHOS (oxidative phosphorylation), including components of F1Fi-ATP synthase. Further, Mic60, -19, and -26 of the MICOS complex were all upregulated. Upregulation of these proteins could be a compensatory mechanism initiated by the metabolic stress. Interestingly, a recent published article found increased levels of Mic60 when knocking out OPA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Stephan et al., 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, these mitochondria lacking OPA1 had a similar appearance to NR-treated Wt mitochondria, with a circular shape and less ordered cristae structure. Additionally, also in line with fragmented mitochondrial structure, proteomic analysis showed that both mutUNG1-expressing and Wt mice treated with NR had increased levels of mitochondrial fission one protein (FIS1), an important regulator of mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Samant et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The consequence of this might be more severe in cardiac than in neuronal tissue, since mitochondria behave and communicate in a completely different manner in the two tissues. Whereas in neurons the mitochondria move quite dynamically in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tang et al., 2019</xref>), cardiac mitochondria are much more fixed in the cell within the myofibril fiber lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Picard et al., 2015</xref>). This means that the contact points between the mitochondria, where inter-organelle communication takes place, are particularly important in cardiac tissue. If NR thereby causes the cardiac mitochondria to change shape in such way that they lose this inter-organelle communication, this could prove harmful for the heart. Based on our data, one should therefore use NR with care clinically, and it is important to obtain more information about the correct dose that should be used. More importantly, if the patient is believed to have cardiomyopathies caused by mitochondrial dysregulation and mtDNA irregularities, for example, by using anthracycline regiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lebrecht and Walker, 2007</xref>), extra care of NR supplementation should be considered.</p><p>The present study has some limitations. Not all findings were statistically significant, and these data must be interpreted with caution. Association does not necessarily mean any causal relationship and additional experimental studies are needed to fully support our conclusion. Moreover, the relevance of these studies to human pathology is still uncertain.</p><p>In conclusion, high levels of mtDNA damage can cause a drop in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels through increased PARP activity, which ultimately causes a breakdown of function and communication in cardiac mitochondria. Treatment with NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors such as NR might not get the desired effect of re-establishing the activity of NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent proteins due to irregularities in the NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism, which can cause negative feedback mechanisms, including high levels of the sirtuin inhibitor NAM. This may lead to disturbances in mitochondrial and cellular pathways including a disorganization of mitochondrial structure. Our data suggest that the use of NR in cardiac disorders should be examined more closely, in particular at higher dosages.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

mutUNG1 mouse model (mU1) was designed and characterized as previously described. Here, a transgene consisting of a human version of Uracil-DNA glycosylase 1 (Ung1) (HGNC ID:12572) with a substitution mutation (Tyr147Ala) has been introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lauritzen et al., 2015</xref>). Expression of mutUNG1 was induced by addition of doxycycline to the diet corresponding to 6 mg doxycycline/g chow (manufactured by Special Diets Services) when the mice were 8 weeks of age. The mice were sacrificed after 8 weeks of mutUNG1 induction. NR (Niagen from Chromadex) was added to the diet, either as 400 mg/kg chow (medium dose) or 1000 mg/kg chow (high dose), after 6 weeks of mutUNG1 induction (with a total of 2 weeks of NR treatment). These numbers were chosen based on the parameters that a mouse in average weighs 30 g, and eat 3 g chow per day, and published experiments performed by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gariani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).

The proteins were precipitated with TCA/acetone in −20°C overnight. The precipitated proteins were dissolved with 6 M urea in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, reduced with DTT, and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Then, the proteins were in-solution digested by diluting the urea concentration to 1 M followed by digestion with trypsin overnight in 37°C. The resulting peptides were desalted and concentrated before mass spectrometry by the STAGE-TIP method using a C18 resin disk (3M Empore). Each peptide mixture was analyzed by an nEASY-LC coupled to QExactive Plus (ThermoElectron, Bremen, Germany) with EASY Spray PepMapRSLC column (C18, 2 µL, 100 Å, 75 µM × 50 cm) using a 60 min LC separation gradient. The resulting MS raw files were submitted to the MaxQuant software version 1.6.1.0 for protein identification and label-free quantification. Carbamidomethyl (C) was set as a fixed modification and acetyl (K), carbamyl (N-term), and oxidation (M) were set as variable modifications. First search peptide tolerance of 20 ppm and main search error of 4.5 ppm were used. Trypsin without proline restriction enzyme option was used, with two allowed miscleavages. The minimal unique+razor peptides number was set to 1, and the allowed FDR was 0.01 (1%) for peptide and protein identification. Label-free quantitation was employed with default settings.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Tinna V Stevnsner as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Joseph A Baur (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Lauritzen et al., report that, in a transgenic mouse model expressing a mutation in a mitochondrial DNA repair enzyme in heart, prolonged PARP activation during mtDNA repair is associated with reductions in NAD+, a cofactor necessary for PARP activity.</p><p>The authors also show that, in this context, sirtuins activity is reduced as a potential consequence of PARP-induced NAD+ reductions, resulting in subsequent elevations in protein acetylation. Given the role of acetylation in the regulation of key mitochondrial proteins, such as OPA1, the authors argue that these alterations in acetylation could be behind some of the mitochondrial structural defects shown in their mtUNG1 mouse model. Surprisingly, and in contrast to results from other groups using other models of heart failure, supplementing NAD with NR does not improve cardiac function or NAD content. Moreover, it alters mitochondrial morphology in wt hearts and at a high dose, increases acetylation of mitochondrial proteins in mutant hearts, and can induce mitochondrial responses in liver tissues, and further sirtuin inhibition by the accumulation of NAM.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting report with the potential to shed light into the failure of NAD+ supplementation treatments in the context of diseases that result in bioenergetic defects. The manuscript is in general well written. However, before the manuscript is acceptable for publication, a major revision is required were several points need to be addressed and substantial new data is required.</p><p>– The author's conclusions are not fully supported by the data. Most of the results presented are essentially association of phenotypes. Thus, rescue experiments are necessary to further support the authors' statements.</p><p>– It is well known that the metabolism of NAD+ is extremely complex and linked to major energetic pathways, including glycolysis, TCA, FA oxidation, ketone body metabolism, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, reductions in NAD+ in the context of mutUNG1 can be due to mitochondrial respiratory defects, and/or alterations in glycolysis, TCA cycle, or even in the function of NADH/NAD+ transporters. Therefore, the authors need to test for the contribution of these pathways in their models. The authors should also contemplate the fact that redox reactions are readily reversible, and they do not contribute directly to changes in the total NAD pool in a specific subcellular compartment. NAD+ and NADH interconvert but are not irreversibly consumed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is some question of the dosing used as the authors state &quot;400 mg/kg food/day&quot; but cite papers that use 400 mg/kg of mouse/day (i.e., ~7 fold higher dosing). It is presumed that the dose was actually based on body weight after reading the wording in the methods, but if this is not the case, it needs to be clarified and a higher dose should be examined.</p><p>2) In Figure 1 the authors show the association between increases in PARP, reductions in NAD+ and alterations in sirtuin activity. This association does not prove causation. A series of rescue experiments are necessary to support a direct causal link between these molecular events. (e.g. silencing or inhibition of PARP and rescue acetylation and/or mitochondrial morphology).</p><p>Likewise, alterations in the acetylation of OPA1 do not suffice to link this defect to the alterations in mitochondrial morphology observed in mutUNG1 tissues. Please check for MFN2 levels or DRP1 localization, expression of PGC1- α, and/or ratio of mtDNA/ nDNA in the conditions and tissues under study.</p><p>Could other organs compensate for the loss of cardiac NAD+?</p><p>3) The model proposed is that PARP1 localized to mitochondria senses mtDNA damage and depletes mitochondrial NAD. Yang et al. (Cell 103: 1095, 2007) suggests that PARP1 activation spares mitochondrial NAD.

It is presumed that the dose was actually based on body weight after reading the wording in the methods, but if this is not the case, it needs to be clarified and a higher dose should be examined.</p></disp-quote><p>In both the cited papers regarding NR doses (Gariani et al., 2016 and Zhang et al., 2016), they write: “NR-treated animals were fed pellets containing vehicle … or NR (400mg/kg/day) for … weeks…”. After carefully reading their manuscript we interpreted this statement as the NR calculations were based on mg/kg food/day (not mg/ kg mouse/day) as we explain in the manuscript. To achieve specific NR doses to the each individual mouse based on weight would acquire other means of NR administration than mixing it in the food, like gavage or injections, which are methods that should be avoided if necessary due to animal welfare and the high level of discomfort. Nonetheless, we have also tested higher doses of NR in the manuscript, especially the experiments regarding stably transfected cells (Figure 6).</p><p>Notwithstanding, we apologize for making this part of the manuscript uncertain and this issue has now been more clearly stated in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1 the authors show the association between increases in PARP, reductions in NAD+ and alterations in sirtuin activity. This association does not prove causation. A series of rescue experiments are necessary to support a direct causal link between these molecular events. (e.g. silencing or inhibition of PARP and rescue acetylation and/or mitochondrial morphology).</p><p>Likewise, alterations in the acetylation of OPA1 do not suffice to link this defect to the alterations in mitochondrial morphology observed in mutUNG1 tissues. Please check for MFN2 levels or DRP1 localization, expression of PGC1- α, and/or ratio of mtDNA/ nDNA in the conditions and tissues under study.</p><p>Could other organs compensate for the loss of cardiac NAD+?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these valuable suggestions regarding increased PARP activity, reduced NAD+ and alterations in sirtuin activity. To accommodate the Reviewer´s important concerns we have now treated the mutUNG1 cell model with the PARP inhibitor olaparib and NR (now Figure 6E-H). Olaparib inhibited parylation/PARP-activity successfully, and the acetylation levels were lower in the groups treated with PARP inhibitor, indicating a link between PARP-activity and deacetylase activity i.e., sirtuin activity.</p><p>We have now also checked the protein levels of MFN2, DRP1 and PGC1a (Figure 4 – supplement 1A-C), and we found no differences between mutUNG1 expressing mice and Wt mice, indicating that increased levels of these protein does not play a noticeable part in the mitochondrial morphology observed in mutUNG1 mice. Moreover, there was a decrease in mtDNA copy number in mutUNG1 expressing mice (as seen previously: Lauritzen KH, et al., 2015) and as demonstrated in the new experiment, NR treatment did not increase the mtDNA numbers up to Wt levels (Figure 4 – supplement 2).</p><p>All these new experiments, as suggested by the Reviewer, have now been included in the revised manuscript, and we believe that these data more strongly support a link between PARP and Sirtuin activity as an important pathway that are modulated in mutUNG1 mice as well as a role for altered OPA1 acetylation in the altered mitochondrial morphology in these mice.</p><p>Finally, we have now also measured protein acetylation levels in the liver with and without NR, and there were no significant differences between the groups suggesting that at least the liver do not compensate for the loss of cardiac NAD+ (Figure 5 – supplement 2). These new data have now been included in the revised manuscript and we have also underscored that we cannot exclude that other tissues could at least partly compensate for the loss of cardiac NAD+.</p><p>For clarity, we also chose to remove (originally labeled) Figure 5E-F regarding acetylation of Opa1 in the cell model from the manuscript, since we present no figures/data regarding mitochondrial morphology in this cell line and the cell line was used to substantiate data from the mouse model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The model proposed is that PARP1 localized to mitochondria senses mtDNA damage and depletes mitochondrial NAD. Yang et al. (Cell 103: 1095, 2007) suggests that PARP1 activation spares mitochondrial NAD. In addition, numerous studies have demonstrated that damaged mtDNA can be released into the cytosol and circulation – how is the alternative hypothesis excluded that damaged mtDNA is released and activates nuclear PARP1? Is PARylation increased in nuclear extracts? Is acetylation? The evidence that the entire system is taking place inside the mitochondria is very sparse even though this conclusion is heavily implied. The authors at least need to demonstrate that their mitochondrial extracts are free of nuclear/cytosolic proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>To accommodate the Reviewer´s valuable concern, we have performed two additional experiments (Figure 6C-D in the main manuscript), regarding parylation levels.</p><p>To evaluate the mitochondrial extracts used in this study we utilized the proteomic analysis and performed a bioinformatic evaluation linking all proteins to cellular compartments by gene ontology (GO) terms. From the 812 proteins, 28 were not linked to a GO term and excluded. From the 784 proteins left, 40 proteins could from their GO terms be connected to nucleus. Among these 40 proteins, 23 proteins did also have a GO-term linking them to mitochondria, leaving 17 proteins connected to nucleus. Most of these could be further linked to the nuclear envelope. As mitochondria interact with other organelles one could expect some contamination of non-mitochondria proteins in these extracts. However, as the level of nuclear proteins were very low (2.2%), and mainly linked to the nuclear membrane, we considered the mitochondrial purity of this extract to be satisfactory. Nuclear proteins detected in this analysis are now listed in Supplementary file 1.</p><p>We have in addition included the interesting article that was cited by the Reviewer in the revised reference list, and briefly discussed the import issue that was raised by the Reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please, check acetylation levels in WT liver after high dose of NR supplementation to understand the association between NAM levels and sirtuin inhibition.

However, in contrast to the protein acetylation levels in heart tissue, we did not observe significant differences in liver tissue.</p><p>Due to technical and experimental issues and current logistical restraints, we could not perform SIRT3 knock down using CRISPR in our lab at this moment. However, we did test SIRT3-dependence by knocking down SIRT3 expression using siRNA technology, which showed more than 50% reduction in SIRT3 protein levels in the cell model (Figure 6I-J). Protein acetylation assays did show a higher degree of protein acetylation in cells treated siRNA for SIRT3 knock down and NR, and this new experiment demonstrates that SIRT3 does indeed influence the acetylation status when high levels of NR are introduced (Figure 6K-L).</p><p>Finally, we have now measured acetyl CoA levels in heart tissue from mutUNG1 and Wt mice treated with and without NR, and no effect of NR were found in either of the genotypes (Figure 5 – supplement 4), indicating that acetylation of CoA is not implicated in the differences between the genotypes or in the effect of NR in these mice. These new experiments have now been included in the revised manuscript and briefly commented on.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors propose that reductions in NAD+ can result into mitochondria defects via sirtuin inactivation. However, NAD supplementation does not rescue mitochondrial morphological defects in mutant tissues, nor it rescues sirtuin activity.

As previously reported by us, there was a decrease in mitochondrial respiration in mutUNG1 expressing mice (as seen previously: Lauritzen KH, et al., 2015), and as shown in the revised manuscript, NR treatment did not increase the respiration up to Wt levels (Figure 4 – supplement 3). Thus, at least NR supplementation, as a tool to increase NAD+ levels, did not rescue the mitochondrial morphology defect or the impaired mitochondrial respiration in mutUNG1 mice. These new data have now been included in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The implication that the NR effects on mitochondria in wt hearts are detrimental is based mainly on morphology.

In addition, this is accompanied with a (now) separate and updated figure (Figure 4). Thus, in the revised manuscript we have included updated versions of the figures interpreting the proteomatic data (Figure 4A), as well as an illustration showing important regulators of the cristae structure, highlighting selected DEPs (differentially expressed proteins) from the dataset (Figure 4B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Increases in NAM in heart after high dose of NR supplementation suggest that NAD+ is being metabolized at heart and converted into NAM.

First, we measured NAD+ levels in heart tissue after high dose NR, and there is indeed a tendency to an increase in NAD+ levels, however, not significant (Figure 5 – supplement 1). Next, we measured gene expression levels NAMPT and NMAT 1-3 with qPCR in heart tissue of mutUNG1 expressing mice and Wt controls, and no significant differences were found between the two genotypes with and without NR treatment.</p><p>Our findings therefore indicate that accumulation of NAM is not caused by reductions in the salvage pathway, but that it might, at least in Wt mice, be related to high sirtuin activity (Figure 5 – supplement 3A-D).
