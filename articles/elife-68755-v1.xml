inflammatory sites where their coordinated migration forms clusters, a process termed neutrophil swarming. The factors that modulate early stages of neutrophil swarming are not fully understood, requiring the development of new in vivo models. Using transgenic zebrafish larvae to study endogenous neutrophil migration in a tissue damage model, we demonstrate that neutrophil swarming is a conserved process in zebrafish immunity, sharing essential features with mammalian systems. We show that neutrophil swarms initially develop around an individual pioneer neutrophil. We observed the violent release of extracellular cytoplasmic and nuclear fragments by the pioneer and early swarming neutrophils. By combining in vitro and in vivo approaches to study essential components of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), we provide in-depth characterisation and high-resolution imaging of the composition and morphology of these release events. Using a photoconversion approach to track neutrophils within developing swarms, we identify that the fate of swarm-initiating pioneer neutrophils involves extracellular chromatin release and that the key NET components gasdermin, neutrophil elastase, and myeloperoxidase are required for the swarming process. Together our findings demonstrate that release of cellular components by pioneer neutrophils is an initial step in neutrophil swarming at sites of tissue injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neutrophil</kwd><kwd>neutrophil swarming</kwd><kwd>NETs</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/M004864/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Renshaw</surname><given-names>Stephen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0700091</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Renshaw</surname><given-names>Stephen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>B/R015457/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Renshaw</surname><given-names>Stephen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>105570/Z/14/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elks</surname><given-names>Philip M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1044754</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lieschke</surname><given-names>Graham J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1086020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lieschke</surname><given-names>Graham J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neutrophil swarms form around a single endogenous pioneer neutrophil in vivo, mediated by DNA release from pioneer neutrophils.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A robust inflammatory response against invading pathogens or endogenous danger signals requires the coordination of multiple cellular and immune components. Neutrophils are one of the first responders to tissue inflammation and rapidly home to inflamed tissue within hours of injury. Within inflamed tissue, neutrophils destroy pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Urban et al., 2006</xref>) and clear wound debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang, 2018</xref>), ultimately leading to the restoration of tissue homeostasis. The anti-microbial repertoire of neutrophils can cause substantial secondary tissue damage and cell death; therefore, neutrophil recruitment to inflammatory sites must be tightly controlled.</p><p>Neutrophils are recruited to sites of inflammation through a series of well-defined molecular events during which they are primed by pro-inflammatory signals including growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, and chemoattractants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Woodfin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nourshargh and Alon, 2014</xref>). Neutrophils are capable of integrating host- and pathogen-derived environmental signals, resulting in their polarisation and migration towards the initiating inflammatory stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McDonald and Kubes, 2010</xref>). Within the interstitium, neutrophils can rapidly coordinate their migration patterns towards sterile inflammation and infection to form clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reátegui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lämmermann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chtanova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peters et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun and Shi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Uderhardt et al., 2019</xref>). The parallels between these cellular behaviours and migration patterns seen in insects have led to the use of the term ‘neutrophil swarming’.</p><p>A series of sequential phases leading to neutrophil swarm formation has been described in murine models: the initial migration of ‘pioneer’ neutrophils close to the inflammatory site (scouting phase) is followed by large-scale synchronised migration of neutrophils from more distant regions (amplification phase) leading to neutrophil clustering (stabilisation phase) and eventual resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reátegui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lämmermann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chtanova et al., 2008</xref>). The initial arrest and death of early recruited pioneer neutrophils correlates with the onset of neutrophil swarming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lämmermann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Uderhardt et al., 2019</xref>) and is mediated by lipid and protein chemoattractants including leukotriene B4 (LTB4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reátegui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lämmermann et al., 2013</xref>). In zebrafish, LTB4 is produced via arachidonic acid metabolism downstream of a sustained calcium wave induced upon neutrophil contact with damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released by necrotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poplimont et al., 2020</xref>). Swarming neutrophils propagate this local calcium ‘alarm signal’ through connexin-43, Cx43, which amplifies local chemoattractant release and directs migration of neutrophils to form swarms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poplimont et al., 2020</xref>). The precise nature of endogenous pioneer neutrophil behaviours and the mechanisms of swarming have yet to be determined in vivo.</p><p>At sites of inflammation, neutrophil behaviour can be modulated by extracellular stimuli such as proinflammatory cytokines, pathogens, toxic tissue constituents, and platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iba et al., 2013</xref>). The final fate of all neutrophils is death, but the mode of cell death can differ depending on stimuli and can show unique macroscopic morphological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galluzzi et al., 2018</xref>). Controlled cell death, by apoptosis for example, does not cause surrounding tissue damage, whilst uncontrolled neutrophil death, such as necrosis, results in the spilling of cellular contents containing DAMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poplimont et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Labbé and Saleh, 2008</xref>). Neutrophils are able to produce extracellular traps (NETs) into surrounding tissues, composed of DNA and histones embedded with granular and cytoplasmic proteins, which are able to capture and kill pathogens extracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brinkmann et al., 2004</xref>). Neutrophils release NETs following a series of intracellular changes, resulting in chromatin decondensation, breakdown of the nuclear envelope, and mixing of DNA with granular and cytoplasmic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Remijsen et al., 2011</xref>). The cellular uptake of propidium iodide and the expulsion of intracellular components from pioneer neutrophils precede the onset of swarming in murine models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Uderhardt et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that extracellular DNA release during cell death is a possible mechanism of swarm initiation by pioneer cells. The processes of NET release and neutrophil swarming have been recently demonstrated to be linked, with swarming neutrophils releasing NETs to restrict fungal growth of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> clusters on in vitro arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hopke et al., 2020</xref>). Further investigation of neutrophil swarming and NET release using in vivo models is required to dissect the molecular mechanisms involved in complex tissue environments.</p><p>The zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) is a powerful model organism that has been extensively used to study neutrophil function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robertson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Loynes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Niethammer et al., 2009</xref>). The optical transparency of zebrafish embryos and ease of generating fluorescent transgenic reporter lines allow for the tracking of endogenous neutrophils from the time of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Renshaw et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate using intravital imaging that a single pioneer neutrophil becomes the focal point of migration for swarming neutrophils within damaged tissue. Prior to swarming onset, the pioneer neutrophil adopts a rounded, non-motile morphology distinct from other neutrophils within the inflamed tissue, but is not undergoing apoptosis. Pioneer and early swarming neutrophils release intracellular components including chromatin, into tissues, reminiscent of NET release. We show that neutrophil extracellular chromatin release in zebrafish shares key features of mammalian NETs: they form in response to a range of chemical stimuli and share essential structural features. Inhibition of NET components gasdermin D, neutrophil elastase, and myeloperoxidase is able to reduce the swarming process, indicating an important role for release of nuclear contents from pioneer neutrophils in the swarming response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neutrophils swarm following injury and infection in vivo</title><p>We first investigated neutrophil mobilisation to injury and infectious stimuli.

Apoptotic neutrophils can also exclude PI; therefore, a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based reporter for neutrophil apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tyas et al., 2000</xref>) was used to determine whether pioneer neutrophils were undergoing apoptosis. Analysis of pioneer neutrophils prior to swarming in <italic>Tg(mpx:CFP-DEVD-YFP)sh237</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Robertson et al., 2016</xref>) identified that despite the rounded, non-motile morphology, a FRET signal was present during both the scouting and initiation phases in all pioneer neutrophils studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>, n = 6 neutrophils from five experimental repeats), indicating that caspase cleavage did not occur and that pioneer neutrophils were therefore not apoptotic.

We distinguish the pioneer neutrophil from other scouting neutrophilsand propose that the pioneer neutrophil release extracellular DNA that precedes consolidation of swarm formation through an aggregation phase.</p><p>Neutrophil responses to tissue injury in mammalian systems are bi-phasic and are modulated in part by the lipid LTB4, which acts as a signal-relay molecule to amplify initial signals produced at inflammatory sites including formyl peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reátegui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lämmermann et al., 2013</xref>). We demonstrate that zebrafish neutrophil recruitment to tail fin inflammation is also bi-phasic and requires intact <italic>lta4h</italic> and <italic>blt1</italic>. In recent findings, LTB4 biosynthesis is increased by swarming neutrophils following a sustained calcium alarm signal during neutrophil swarming, further demonstrating a conserved role of LTB4 in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poplimont et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We observed that pioneer neutrophils are surrounded by debris and extracellular DNA. This is consistent with the recent identification that early swarming neutrophils sense DAMPs, including ATP released by necrotic tissue, which causes a sustained calcium wave, translocation of 5-LO, and subsequent metabolism of arachidonic acid to LTB4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poplimont et al., 2020</xref>). We demonstrate that a caspase-3-sensitive FRET reporter fluorescence was intact during the swarm initiation phase and caspase inhibition had no effect on swarming outcomes, suggesting that swarm initiating pioneer neutrophils were not undergoing neutrophil apoptosis prior to swarming, despite adopting a characteristic rounded morphology. Here we show that pioneer neutrophils are propidium iodide negative, suggesting that the plasma membrane remains intact, something that has been difficult to conclusively show in other models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lämmermann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Uderhardt et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, the distinct release of large balloon-like structures, which become positive for propidium iodide, have been recently identified in zebrafish models of laser-induced tissue injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poplimont et al., 2020</xref>), as well as mechanical tissue injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manley et al., 2020</xref>). Our data build on this observation, identifying that extracellular DNA is released from pioneer and scouting neutrophils during early swarming, in a catapult-like fashion reminiscent of mammalian NET release.</p><p>Here we show that zebrafish neutrophils can release NET components using mammalian NET-inducing stimuli PMA and calcium ionophore, as well as more physiologically relevant microbial infection. We confirm that zebrafish NETs contained chromatin and myeloperoxidase, providing some of the first evidence that zebrafish neutrophils can release NETs and contain multiple components observed in mammalian systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brinkmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Whilst imaging of NETs in vivo is advancing, the understanding of the kinetics of DNA release from neutrophils remains limited. Here, we have developed in vivo zebrafish reporter transgenic lines for live imaging of chromatin release using fluorescent protein-tagged histones. Imaging data from other groups corroborate our identification that NET releasing neutrophils undergo distinct morphological changes involving the stretching of neutrophil cytoplasm and production of large extracellular DNA containing vesicles and cellular debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pilsczek et al., 2010</xref>). Following LPS stimulation, murine neutrophils expel extracellular DNA in large, balloon-like cytoplasmic vesicles, similar to our observations in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>). In human neutrophils infected with <italic>S aureus</italic>, vesicles containing DNA are released into the extracellular space where they lyse and release their contents to form NETs, consistent with our observation that cytoplasmic balloon-like structures containing extracellular DNA are released by neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pilsczek et al., 2010</xref>). The catapult-like release of DNA and histones by neutrophils observed in our experiments is consistent with in vitro evidence that DNA release by eosinophils is catapult-like in its expulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yousefi et al., 2008</xref>). We show that zebrafish NETs contain granular proteins consistent with those observed in mammalian neutrophils, adding to the evidence that NET release is found in zebrafish in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Palić et al., 2007</xref>). Our experiments enable the morphology of NET-releasing neutrophils to be observed in vivo, in real time, providing new insight into the morphological changes associated with NET release.</p><p>We set out to determine the mechanism of NET release in relation to swarming. The gold standard for NET depletion in vitro is the addition of exogenous DNase to degrade NET DNA. Administration of a range of DNase1 concentrations by incubation in the water of larvae was highly toxic to live zebrafish (data not shown); hence, we were not able to assess the role of extracellular DNA in swarm formation in this way. We therefore targeted components of the NETosis pathway to investigate the relationship between NET release and swarming. NET release is mediated by MPO activation, and release of NE into the cytoplasm. This leads to chromatin decondensation and nuclear membrane breakdown, resulting in the mixing of nuclear chromatin with granular and cytoplasmic proteins. DNA release in NET formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sollberger et al., 2018</xref>), and other forms of lytic release (e.g. pyroptosis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2021</xref>), requires gasdermin proteins that forms pores in the nuclear and plasma membranes to allow lytic release of intracellular components. Humans possess six isoforms (GSDMA, GSDMB, GSDMC, GSDMD, GSDME, and PJVK) and in zebrafish <italic>pjvk</italic>, <italic>gsdmea</italic>, and <italic>gsdmeb</italic> have been identified as orthologues. A recent zebrafish study identified that activation of neutrophil pyroptosis is essential for NET formation during hemolysin-overexpressing <italic>E. piscicida</italic> (EthA<sup>+</sup>) <italic>E. piscicida</italic> infection and that this is mediated by the caspy2-GSDMEb axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). By inhibiting pore-forming gasdermins, we found that the swarming response was reduced linking gasdermin-mediated chromatin release to neutrophil swarming in vivo. Neutrophil elastase-deficient mice have defective NET formation, although some reports suggest that they can still be made in response to strong stimuli such as PMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martinod et al., 2016</xref>). Humans have a large repertoire of elastase proteins (CELA1, CELA2A, CELA2B, CELA3A, CELA3B, ELANE, AZU1, CTRC, and PRTN3. CELA1 to CELA3B), of which PRTN3, ELANE, and AZU1 are in neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wright et al., 2013</xref>). Zebrafish have orthologues of <italic>cela</italic>, <italic>ela</italic>, and <italic>prtn3</italic> genes, but have multiple copies of each annotated on the genome (<italic>cela1.1</italic>, <italic>cela1.2</italic>, <italic>cela1.3</italic>, <italic>cela1.4</italic>, <italic>cela1.5</italic>, <italic>cela1.6</italic>, <italic>ela2</italic>, and <italic>ela2l</italic>), rendering genetic approaches unfeasible. By targeting NE pharmacologically, we identified a reduction in neutrophil swarming in zebrafish, further supporting a functional role of NE in the swarming response. These findings contribute important in vivo data to growing evidence that NETs contribute to neutrophil swarming. NET release is observed at sites of alum injection-associated with neutrophil swarming in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stephen et al., 2017</xref>), and NET formation facilitates neutrophil aggregation at sites of fungal infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byrd et al., 2013</xref>). Neutrophil swarming in zebrafish has recently been shown to be mediated by a sustained calcium alarm signal following sensing of danger signals including ATP, which are propagated by neutrophils via Cx43 connexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poplimont et al., 2020</xref>). Deciphering the intricate modulation of NET release, danger signal release, and calcium signalling in swarm formation requires further mechanistic studies in complementary models.</p><p>Interestingly, inhibition of caspases did not appear to contribute to swarm frequency in our zebrafish studies. Our images and videos strongly suggest a form of lytic cell death of pioneer neutrophils is occurring, leading to cell debris and death of the cell body, not consistent with some reports of vital NET formation in other models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lelliott et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Desai et al., 2016</xref>). However, the mode of this cell death remains undefined and challenging to address in vivo due to lack of available tools to define this. In mammalian systems an important, but not critical, player in the onset of NET forming pathways is NADPH-oxidase-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Papayannopoulos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuchs et al., 2007</xref>). ROS inhibition via DPI did not decrease swarm frequency in the zebrafish model. This is consistent with recent findings that DPI does not inhibit the formation of neutrophil swarms in synchronised in vitro swarm arrays. However, DPI did decrease swarm stability around foci of fungal infections in swarm arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hopke et al., 2020</xref>); therefore, understanding the roles of NADPH-oxidase in the different phases of swarming requires further investigation in vivo.</p><p>Our findings in this study implicate a role for endogenous pioneer neutrophil NET release in swarming. Our zebrafish data demonstrate that it is possible to dissect mechanisms of NET and swarm formation in vivo, mechanisms that have been challenging to uncover in endogenous neutrophils in mammalian models. Understanding why swarms are initiated is important for understanding the signals that control the coordination of neutrophil migration within interstitial tissue, which ultimately could lead to the identification of novel therapeutic avenues to target excessive inflammation for the treatment of chronic inflammatory disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Genomic DNA extraction was performed on larvae at 2 dpf. Larvae were placed individually in 0.2 ml PCR tubes in 90 µl 50 mM NaOH and boiled at 95° for 20 min. Ten microlitre Tris–HCL ph8 was added as a reaction buffer and mixed thoroughly. Gene-specific primers were designed using the Primer three web tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://primer3.ut.ee/">http://primer3.ut.ee/</ext-link>).

PCR were performed in a LightCycler instrument (Bio-Rad) using 96-well plates. The two-step reaction protocol was as follows: 95°C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 58°C for 30 s, 72°C for 20 s. The second stage of the protocol was 95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 60 s, 65°C for 10 s. The temperature then increased by 0.02°C/s until 95°C for 10 s.

A loss of FRET signal in this system provides a read out of apoptosis specifically in neutrophils in vivo in real time. To visualise apoptotic events in the context of neutrophil swarming, 3 dpf <italic>TgBAC(mpx:CFP-DEVD-YFP)sh237</italic> larvae were injured and mounted in a 1% agarose solution containing 0.168 mg/ml tricaine and covered with 500 μl of a clear E3 solution containing tricaine to prevent dehydration. FRET imaging was performed from 30 min post-injury for 5 hr using a 20× objective lens on an UltraVIEWVoX spinning disk confocal laser imaging system (Perkin Elmer) with acquisition every 2 min. Ten z-planes were captured per larvae over a focal range of 100 μm using the following filters: a donor CFP channel (440 nm for excitation, 485 nm for detection), an acceptor YFP channel (514 nm for excitation and 587 nm for detection), and a FRET channel (440 nm for excitation and 587 nm for detection). An Ultraview dichroic mirror passes 405,440,515,640 was used to increase imaging speed using these filter blocks. Volocity software was used to calculate normalised FRET values (nFRET). To compensate for the bleed through of the CFP and YFP fluorophores into the FRET channel, FRET bleed through constants were calculated. Control samples containing HeLa cells transfected with CFP alone or YFP alone were imaged using the same settings used for data acquisition of the mpx:FRET zebrafish reporter line. ROIs were drawn around a population of cells in the frame and Volocity software calculated FRET bleed through values as the mean intensity of the recipient channel (FRET) divided by the mean intensity of the source (CFP or YFP). These FRET constants were then used by Volocity to calculate a normalised FRET value. Neutrophil apoptosis was observed by overlaying the YFP and nFRET channels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Generation of histone transgenic reporter line</title><p>For the generation of H2A transgenic reporter line, the Gateway cloning toolkit was used to generate a construct, where by the neutrophil-specific lyzozyme C promoter (<italic>lyz</italic>) drives mCherry expression fused to the zebrafish H2az2a protein. The gateway components used to assemble this were a 5’ vector p5E-MCS lyz containing 6.6 kb of the lysozyme C promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kwan et al., 2007</xref>), a middle entry vector pME-h2a-mCherry containing zebrafish histone H2az2a fused to mCherry, and a 3’ vector containing a polyadenylation site p3E-polyA.

DAPI: For DNA staining of sh530 larvae, 2 dpf larvae were fixed in 1 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature for 30 min, washed in PBST, and transferred to 100% MeOH overnight at −20°C. Samples were washed in PBST twice before permeabilisation using proteinase K (10 µg/ml) for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were fixed for 20 min in 4% PFA at room temperature and washed twice in PBST. Samples were stained in a 0.1% DAPI (Sigma Aldrich) solution in 1× PBS for 20 min and kept in the dark. Samples were washed in PBST, and imaging was performed. Immunohistochemistry: primary antibodies were rabbit anti mpx 1:200 (GeneTex 128379) and chicken anti-EGFP 1:2000 (Abcam ab13970). Secondary antibodies were used 1:1000 from Jackson ImmunoResearch (goat anti-rabbit Alexafluor 647 and goat anti-chicken Alexafluor 488). For antibody staining, paraformaldehyde-fixed (2%) whole embryos were washed twice in PBS-Tx for 30 min and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C.

At 3 dpf larvae were anaesthetised and injured using the minor tail fin nick and mounted immediately in a 1% LMP agarose solution containing tricaine. At 10 min post-injury, a region of interest was drawn around the neutrophil nearest to the injury site for photoconversion from green to red fluorescence. Photoconverting of Kaede-labelled neutrophils at the wound site was performed using an UltraVIEWPhotoKinesis device (Perkin Elmer and Analytical Sciences) on an UltraVIEWVoX spinning disk confocal laser imaging system (Perkin Elmer). The photokinesis device was calibrated using a coverslip covered in photobleachable substrate (Stabilo Boss, Berks, UK).

describes the different phases of neutrophil swarming response upon infection via live imaging analysis, using a model of zebrafish larvae and a combination of transgenic reporter lines. Importantly, the authors propose the release of NET occurring in pioneer neutrophils as a critical signal for the initiation of the swarming response.

We would thus be interested in receiving a new paper when you are able to obtain additional data to address fully the concerns raised in the reviews. As you will recognize from the comments below, one of the main criticisms centers on whether NETosis of the pioneer neutrophil indeed drives neutrophils swarming.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Isles and colleagues identify pioneer neutrophils as the initiators of neutrophil swarming. Specifically, the authors make use of the zebrafish model to visualize the early events in response to tail fin transection or infection in the otic vesicle. Using this approach, they identify morphological and behavioral changes – round morphology and reduced motility – in the first neutrophil responding to the injury. This precedes neutrophils swarming. Furthermore, the morphological and behavioral changes are not the consequence of apoptosis, as measured by a reporter line. By contrast the authors identify that pioneer neutrophils release fragments that are positive for DNA and Histones, suggesting that the pioneer neutrophils die by NETosis. The authors also confirmed the requirement of LTB4 signaling in neutrophil recruitment at later stages of the response. In summary, the authors propose that death by NETosis of pioneer neutrophil initiates neutrophil swarming. Overall this is a very interesting manuscript that describes the neutrophil response to injury and infection with high resolution as a result of using an ideal and optically transparent organism.</p><p>My main suggestion to strengthen the connection between the proposed role of NETosis in initiating neutrophils swarming would be to interfere with NETosis (either using inhibitors or genetic approaches) and test whether the initial changes in response to injury and/or infection are halted or delayed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The study of Isles et al. with the title „Endogenous pioneer neutrophils release extracellular traps during the swarming response&quot; provides the first comprehensive and systematic study of neutrophil swarming in zebrafish larvae. It confirms the multistep nature of neutrophil swarm formation and a functional contribution of the lipid LTB4 during this response, thus confirming earlier findings in the mouse model. This goes beyond earlier studies in zebrafish where the swarm-like behavior of neutrophils has been briefly mentioned in the context of bacterial infections (Deng/Huttenlocher, J Leuk Biol 2013). In the mammalian system a correlation between the death of early recruited neutrophils as an amplifying signal for swarm formation was shown, but the mechanisms behind it remained difficult to address and are still unknown (Lämmermann/Germain, Nature 2013). By using the power of the zebrafish system (less neutrophils, less complex), this study attempted to dissect an underlying mechanism. The authors make two observations: (1) One pioneer neutrophil undergoes shape changes before they appear to become the center of a developing swarm, (2) Swarm centers show signs of lytic neutrophil cell death, some of which likely due to NETosis.</p><p>Overall, the study tries to imply that &quot;chemoattractant signals released by pioneer neutrophils undergoing NETosis could drive the swarming response&quot; (Line 232-234) (see also tentative title). This would indeed be an interesting novel aspect of neutrophil swarm formation worth publishing in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the current data does not provide solid proof to support this hypothesis (see substantive concerns). The authors are probably aware of the limitations in their data sets, as they use very cautious wording for many of their conclusions on if/how NETosis might influence swarm dynamics.</p><p>Unfortunately, this study does not provide enough novel mechanistic insight and go beyond earlier observations on neutrophil swarming.</p><p>In their impact statement the authors correctly summarize their findings: &quot;Neutrophils swarm around a single pioneer neutrophil in a zebrafish in vivo model of inflammation AND undergo cell death releasing their cellular components in extracellular traps.&quot; However, the authors are missing data that clearly functionally link both processes (which would justify publication in <italic>eLife</italic>). If both events occur completely independently from another, this study would be of minor interest for the general readership.</p><p>The authors do show that zebrafish neutrophils can undergo NETosis (Figure 8, Suppl. Figure 8). However, a clear cause-effect relationship that NETosis by pioneer neutrophils drives neutrophil swarming could not be proven. There are a number of question marks regarding the current data sets:</p><p>1) The authors refer to &quot;neutrophil fragments that appear around developing neutrophil swarm clusters, sometimes accompanied by large cytoplasmic clusters (Figure 7, Suppl. Figure 6, 7). Together with PI stainings, they later suggest that these events reflect NETosis as potential trigger for neutrophil swarming. However, Supplementary Videos 10-12 do not show a clear cause-effect relationship between dying cells and additional recruitment of neutrophils in the course of amplified swarm growth. In all videos, it even appears as if two different forms of cell death are occurring: (a) neutrophils that release fragments and (b) neutrophils that instantly swell and burst. Only the swelling cells incorporate PI as sign of NETosis (Video 11), but do not appear to become the center of a developing swarm (all videos). Moreover, not only the first (pioneer) neutrophils seem to undergo a lytic form of cell death, but also following (scouting) neutrophils – how can the authors distinguish between the effects of cell death in one or the other neutrophil population? From the data and videos provided it seems that swarming neutrophils in general undergo NETosis, even after initiation of the swarming process.</p><p>2) The authors have a strong bias toward suggesting a functional role of NETosis for neutrophil swarming. Necrosis and most forms of NETosis are lytic forms of cell death that could release cellular contents with potential attractive function for neutrophils. The additional release of extracellular DNA (the hallmark of NETosis) may only be a side-effect and not contribute at all to any chemotactic processes during swarming. I would even expect that the disruption of extracellular DNA (by DNAseI treatment, gold standard method to prove NETs in mammals) does not influence swarming. Can the authors rigorously distinguish between necrotic and NETotic death in their system? If not, the authors should tone down many of their statements on NETosis and refer more general to lytic cell death. In mammalian cells, the major (but not exclusive) mechanism to induce NET formation is through NADPH-oxidase and can be blocked by ROS scavenging or NADPH oxidase deficiencies. Would functional interference in a similar manner influence neutrophil swarming in zebrafish larvae?</p><p>3) As another method to show neutrophil death by NETosis, the authors use transgenic zebrafish line with fluorescently tagged histones. In Figure 9 and 10, they refer to a catapult-like release of NETs or of histones from the nucleus, but do not show a convincing accompanying video. Moreover, it remains unclear if these were neutrophils in the middle of a neutrophil cluster. Is this histone release also seen with pioneer neutrophils? If so, how many pioneer neutrophils would show such NET release? And how is this then correlated with the recruitment of novel neutrophils and amplification of swarm growth (Video missing)? This is in line with point1 showing a clear cause-effect relation between dying pioneer neutrophils and additional recruitment of neutrophils.</p><p>4) In the mammalian system also &quot;viable NETosis&quot; has been observed (Yipp/Kubes, Nat Med 2012); neutrophils stay alive while expelling their extracellular DNA. From the presented data in this manuscript one would argue that this &quot;silent&quot; form of NETosis should not lead to swarming? Do they authors observe this?</p><p>5) The authors show that bacterial infections also cause neutrophil swarms even more prominent than during sterile tissue injury. Which neutrophils are dying in the bacteria infection model? Is NETosis also seen with pioneer neutrophils (and other neutrophils)? How does cell death influence this swarming response?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the following manuscript, Isles HM and colleagues examine the neutrophil swarming response upon infection using a model of zebrafish larvae.

They focus on two observations: (1) neutrophil swarms initiate around individual neutrophils, referred to as pioneer neutrophils, (2) pioneer and early recruited neutrophils release chromatin reminiscent of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) in neutrophil clusters. The authors propose a functional link between both events with impact on the neutrophil swarming response.</p><p>Strengths of this manuscript: The authors convincingly show that zebrafish neutrophils can release extracellular DNA after treatment with known NET stimuli. Genetic and chemical interference with key NET components including gasdermin, neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase show a functional requirement of these components in the neutrophil swarming process. The manuscript promotes the release of chromatin from pioneer or early recruited neutrophils as an important event for swarming. They provide live imaging data showing the lytic death of neutrophils as balloon-like structures, including the use of novel transgenic fish lines.</p><p>Weaknesses of this manuscript: The authors fail to present their methods in the context of the two most closely related studies to this subject (Poplimont et al., Current Biology 2020; Hopke et al., Nature Communications 2020) and do not cite these studies. Poplimont et al. 2020 (PMID: 32502410) recently revealed a mechanism that pioneer neutrophils undergoing calcium bursts initiate the swarming cascade in the zebrafish model. Dying neutrophils in form of balloon-like structures were also described in detail in this study (Poplimont et al., Video S3 as an example), but could not be correlated to contribute to the initiating events of neutrophil swarm formation. Hopke et al. 2020 (PMID: 32341348) showed an involvement of NET components during swarm formation of human neutrophils in vitro. Interference with NET components in this study (e.g. myeloperoxidase inhibition) did not interfere with initial swarm recruitment, but rather later phases of the neutrophil swarm response. From these two studies, it appears that the two processes of swarm initiation and the potential role of extracellular NET components are separate processes during neutrophil swarm formation. The provided manuscript of Isles et al. does not provide convincing data that clearly link these two events.</p><p>Overall, Isles et al. provide a comprehensive study on neutrophil swarming in the zebrafish system. They confirm the multistep nature of the swarming response in zebrafish, which was known for other species, including the involvement of LTB4. Their experiments also make a strong argument for a functional role of extracellular NET components during neutrophil swarm growth. However, it remains unclear from the presented data which phases (early vs. late) of neutrophil swarm growth are controlled by these components. Time-resolved analysis of the findings in Figure 7 could provide answers to this open question.</p><p>Unfortunately, the presented data – together with published work (e.g. Poplimont et al. 2020) – do not support a number of statements of the manuscript, e.g. &quot;our findings demonstrate that an individual pioneer neutrophil initiates the swarm and releases chromatin, a process followed by the directed migration of swarming neutrophils.&quot; or &quot;we propose that the pioneer neutrophil is able.… to release extracellular DNA that amplifies chemoattraction&quot;. The release of chromatin does not always and not exclusively occur only in pioneer neutrophils. The initiation of swarming may involve another mechanism, which likely do not rely on the release of chromatin.</p><p>The functional contribution of neutrophil cell death to the swarming response is an important question to the field of inflammation, as it may explain why some neutrophil infiltrates continue growing, while others will shrink again over time. Neutrophil death inducing conditions (e.g. bacteria-induced cell lysis) may further exacerbate swarm growth. As the swarming response is pretty conserved among species, findings from the zebrafish model are likely to be also relevant for inflammatory processes in mammals, including humans.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68755.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

The mechanistic link between NET release and swarming is really important and something we have been working hard on. We have now addressed this using a range of inhibitors and genetic approaches and believe this has greatly improved the manuscript and now provides the first in vivo mechanistic link between NET release and swarming. We found that inhibition of key players in NET formation leads to a decrease in the occurrence of neutrophil swarming. For Gasdermin D (GSDM) (Sollberger et al., Science Immunology, 2018) and neutrophil elastase (Papayannopoulos et al., J Cell Biol, 2010) we chose an inhibitor approach as the inhibitors are well characterised (and the genetics of the fish orthologues of these are excessively complex to effectively unpick using genetic approaches, outlined on lines 318-326 and 328-342). We found that treatment with the pore blocking gasdermin inhibitor with LDC7559, or treatment with MeOSu-AAPV-CMK to block leukocyte elastase, significantly decreased swarm occurrence, compared to DMSO treated controls (new Figure 7A-B). We also targeted myeloperoxidase, necessary for NET formation (Metzler et al., Blood, 2011). We chose a genetic approach, using CRISPR-Cas9 targeting the myeloperoxidase promoter/start site to knockdown mpx (zebrafish MPO equivalent), showing that this also decreased the level of swarm formation (new figure 7C-D). Taken together, these new data demonstrate a functional link between NET release and swarm formation, not previously demonstrated during in vivo inflammation and adds further novelty and impact to our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Overall, the study tries to imply that &quot;chemoattractant signals released by pioneer neutrophils undergoing NETosis could drive the swarming response&quot; (Line 232-234) (see also tentative title).

We do not use the term NETosis and refer instead to NET release. To address exactly what type of cell death is occurring is extremely technically challenging in vivo due to a lack of available tools. We do however add further mechanistic insight that narrows down what type of lytic death may be occurring. We have added evidence that the pioneer neutrophil is not undergoing caspase dependent cell death, using FRET reporter and Caspase inhibition (in new Figure 3G) which is an important question in the swarm field, especially in vivo. Furthermore we show that Gasdermin D, myeloperoxidase and neutrophil elastase are required (new Figure 7 and see response to reviewer 1 above). We agree with the reviewer that early swarming neutrophils, alongside the pioneer are releasing NETs and have changed the text to make this point more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors have a strong bias toward suggesting a functional role of NETosis for neutrophil swarming.

Zebrafish larvae are amenable to drug treatments, both by addition to the embryo water or by microinjection into the circulation. We attempted to deliver of a range of DNAse 1 concentrations by both methods and found it to be incredibly toxic to the larvae, killing the fish within a few hours. We could therefore not use this in vitro method in vivo. Instead, we focused on disrupting NET components using multiple methods outlined in the response to reviewer one, which we believe is a more elegant approach with fewer off-target effects in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors rigorously distinguish between necrotic and NETotic death in their system?

We therefore used the NADPH-oxidase inhibitor Diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) to inhibit ROS production in an attempt to modulate swarming. ROS production has been shown to be critical for the onset on neutrophil recruitment (Niethammer et al., Nature, 2009), and, corroborating this, we showed that DPI treatment from 1 hour before tailfin wound inhibited neutrophil recruitment to the wound at 4hpw. However, if initial recruitment was allowed to happen before treatment with DPI at 1hpw, then neutrophil numbers at 4hpw were no different to control DMSO treated larvae allowing us to assess the effects on swarming directly. We then assessed whether these two DPI treatment windows affected the frequency of swarm formation. Treatment from 1 hour before wounding led to a decrease in swarm formation compared to DMSO controls, however treatment from 1hpw showed no difference in swarm frequency compare to controls. When corrected for total neutrophil numbers at the wound, the frequency of swarming per 100 neutrophils was not significantly altered with either timepoint of DPI treatment. These data indicate that swarming is not manipulated by inhibition of ROS at these timepoints. However, we cannot rule out a time-specific contribution of ROS to the process and as such we have decided not to include this data in the main revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) As another method to show neutrophil death by NETosis, the authors use transgenic zebrafish line with fluorescently tagged histones. In Figure 9 and 10, they refer to a catapult-like release of NETs or of histones from the nucleus, but do not show a convincing accompanying video. Moreover, it remains unclear if these were neutrophils in the middle of a neutrophil cluster. Is this histone release also seen with pioneer neutrophils? If so, how many pioneer neutrophils would show such NET release? And how is this then correlated with the recruitment of novel neutrophils and amplification of swarm growth (Video missing)? This is in line with point1 showing a clear cause-effect relation between dying pioneer neutrophils and additional recruitment of neutrophils.</p></disp-quote><p>We describe the histone release is catapult-like due to existing nomenclature, a term defined from in vitro observations where neutrophils throw out large NETs that are flat in structure due to them being on a glass surface. However, in vivo we believe NETs look quite different, exhibiting a “balloon-like” morphology, a terminology we use in the revised manuscript. We do however believe a more subtle “catapult-like” action is happening, as in in vitro observations but due to the 3D tissue nature of the in vivo biology this is less obvious. The original neutrophil is very hard to image as, in order to identify the pioneer neutrophil, we have to look retrospectively once it has formed a swarm, after which it is quickly surrounded by swarming neutrophils shielding it from imaging. We have addressed in Figure 4F that the pioneer neutrophil releases cytoplasmic balloons, however, the Kaede transgenic line technology is not compatible with the histone transgenic due to an overlap in red fluorescence. The number of neutrophils releasing NETs is likely to be variable across different swarms and the packed nature of early swarms make imaging accurately counting individual neutrophils within the swarm technically extremely challenging. In the new manuscript we propose that more than one pioneer neutrophil releases the NETs into early swarms, as suggested by this reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the mammalian system also &quot;viable NETosis&quot; has been observed (Yipp/Kubes, Nat Med 2012); neutrophils stay alive while expelling their extracellular DNA. From the presented data in this manuscript one would argue that this &quot;silent&quot; form of NETosis should not lead to swarming? Do they authors observe this?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not seen this type of NETosis in vivo. It appears to us that lytic cell death is occurring, because we lose fluorescence from the original cell body and the end product is neutrophil cell debris (new Figure 4D). This is highly characteristic of lytic death and we have no evidence that suggests that the cell body remains alive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors show that bacterial infections also cause neutrophil swarms even more prominent than during sterile tissue injury. Which neutrophils are dying in the bacteria infection model? Is NETosis also seen with pioneer neutrophils (and other neutrophils)? How does cell death influence this swarming response?</p></disp-quote><p>The focus of this manuscript is inflammatory neutrophils at a sterile tailfin wound. The infection data is included for completeness, as part of descriptive work on swarms. We would like to follow up on infection observations in future studies, but believe this to be out of the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1. the novelty of this contribution is somewhat limited since most of the conclusions reported have been already described in mouse experimental models (The dependency of neutrophils swarming from LTB4 signalling – Lammermann T et al. 2013, the neutrophil swarm upon <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection – Ania Bogoslowski et al., PNAS 2018, the different phases of neutrophil swarming – Ng LG et al., 2011, the distinction between pioneer and scouting neutrophils – Chtanova T et al., 2008 as well as the presence of cell death in few neutrophils at the damage site and the onset of the second phase of the swarming response – Lammermann T et al. 2013) and, additionally, some of the data presented have been already reported in zebrafish models (reviewed in Harvie EA et al., 2015 and Kienle K et al., 2016).

The process of swarming in zebrafish, although mentioned incidentally in some recent manuscripts has not been described in detail, and we believe this is the first account that confirms that the process is mechanistically similar (ie, LTB4 dependent, to infection and injury and involving lytic cell death). The comparison to existing murine data is a strength of our manuscript and important to ascertain before our novel findings on the endogenous pioneers and mechanistic links to NET release.

Additionally, the identification of the triggers of NETosis in pioneer neutrophils may provide additional insight into the mechanisms leading to swarm regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now addressed this point to add further in vivo mechanistic insight to our manuscript (see first response to reviewer 1). In the new manuscript we address that inhibition of neutrophil elastase or myeloperoxidase inhibition decreases swarm formation in vivo. On the point of PAD4, the situation in zebrafish is less clear as the exact homologue is not well established. The gene <italic>padi2</italic> has been identified as the putative homologue for human PADI 2 and 4 in zebrafish, and has recently been shown to play key roles in inflammation at the tailfin wound (Goenberg et al., 2020). To modulate Padi2 we used the pan-PAD inhibitor Clamidine that irreversibly inactivates PADs (Silvestre-Roig et al., 2019). Cl<sup>-</sup>amidine was found to significantly increase the frequency of zebrafish with swarms. This finding is contradictory in terms of the predicted roles of Padi2 in neutrophil swarming, but correlates with the recent finding in zebrafish that <italic>padi2</italic> knockout increases neutrophil numbers by increased recruitment to the tailfin wound (Golenberg et al., J Cell Biol, 2020). We were able to recapitulate this increased recruitment using Cl<sup>-</sup>amide, which we believe explains why the swarming rate is increased and, due to this unrelated mechanism, we have not included these data in the new manuscript. The data from ourselves and Golenberg et al., indicate a role outside of NET formation for <italic>padi2</italic> in zebrafish neutrophils, illustrating that the effects of citrullination on neutrophilic inflammation in vivo may be more complex than anticipated from in vitro observations.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to relate their findings to the two most closely related studies to this subject (Poplimont/Sarris, Current Biology 2020; Hopke/Irimia, Nature Communications 2020).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for this oversight during the redrafting process and agree this is very important to address.

We believe our new data confirm the mechanistic link between swarm formation and NET release, although we agree that it is not necessarily the chromatin itself which is responsible. Our data in figure 7 show that targeting of a number of different proteins related to the release of chromatin/NETs leads to a decrease in swarm frequency, thereby confirming functional linkage between the two processes. We believe this to be strong evidence of a functional link between NET release and swarming using multiple approaches and strands of evidence. We do however concede that, unlike the Hopke/Irimia in vitro study, we have not temporally addressed the effects of these compounds on swarm initiation versus later swarm processes. Due to the complex and stochastic nature of swarm formation in vivo we believe this to be out of the scope of the current study. We have changed our statements on chromatin/NET release via the proteins tested (Gasdermin D, elastase and myeloperoxidase) being responsible for “swarm formation” to “swarming” and toned down some of our stronger statements in response to this comment. The Hopke/Irimia study adds in vitro support for our findings of a direct role for NET release in the modulation of swarming. Further elucidation of these mechanisms will require investigation using complementary models and approaches outwith the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A time-resolved analysis of Figure 7 could further help delineate a role for NET components for early or late phases of swarming.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there remains much to understand about NET component release and swarming.

Poplimont et al. 2020 (PMID: 32502410) recently revealed a mechanism that pioneer neutrophils undergoing calcium bursts initiate the swarming cascade in the zebrafish model. Dying neutrophils in form of balloon-like structures were also described in detail in this study (Poplimont et al., Video S3 as an example), but could not be correlated to contribute to the initiating events of neutrophil swarm formation. Hopke et al. 2020 (PMID: 32341348) showed an involvement of NET components during swarm formation of human neutrophils in vitro. Interference with NET components in this study (e.g. myeloperoxidase inhibition) did not interfere with initial swarm recruitment, but rather later phases of the neutrophil swarm response. From these two studies, it appears that the two processes of swarm initiation and the potential role of extracellular NET components are separate processes during neutrophil swarm formation. The provided manuscript of Isles et al. does not provide convincing data that clearly link these two events.</p></disp-quote><p>We mentioned the following in response to Essential Revision #1 but we include our response here as well for convenience.

They confirm the multistep nature of the swarming response in zebrafish, which was known for other species, including the involvement of LTB4. Their experiments also make a strong argument for a functional role of extracellular NET components during neutrophil swarm growth. However, it remains unclear from the presented data which phases (early vs. late) of neutrophil swarm growth are controlled by these components. Time-resolved analysis of the findings in Figure 7 could provide answers to this open question.</p></disp-quote><p>We mentioned the following in response to Essential Revision #3 but we include our response here as well for convenience.

The release of chromatin does not always and not exclusively occur only in pioneer neutrophils. The initiation of swarming may involve another mechanism, which likely do not rely on the release of chromatin.</p></disp-quote><p>We mentioned some of the following in response to Essential Revision #2 but we include our response here as well for convenience. We do not believe the findings we report here are mutually exclusive to the findings reported in Poplimont et al., 2020. It is likely that swarming neutrophils are in the process of responding to DAMPs released by the wound as part of the recruitment process (possibly including ATP from necrotic tissue, as indicated in Poplimont et al., 2020, though we do not address this here) but this does not preclude that factors released by pioneer neutrophils are also important in the swarming response. The linear wound produced by tailfin transection in our manuscript is larger than the laser wound performed in Poplimont et al., 2020. The linear nature of the wound led us to the observation that swarms form at any point on the ventral/dorsal axis along the long linear tailfin wound, but always form around a pioneer neutrophil, strongly indicative that signals from pioneer neutrophils are playing an important role in swarming in this model, while not excluding that necrotic signals from the wound itself may also play a role. We believe our new data confirm the mechanistic link between swarm formation and NET release, although we agree that it is not necessarily the chromatin itself which is responsible, and have toned down the statements highlighted by the reviewer. Our data in figure 7 show that targeting of a number of different proteins related to the release of chromatin/NETs leads to a decrease in swarm frequency, thereby confirming functional linkage between the two processes. We believe this to be strong evidence of a functional link between NET release and swarming using multiple approaches and strands of evidence.

The Hopke/Irimia study adds in vitro support for our findings of a direct role for NET release in the modulation of swarming. Further elucidation of these mechanisms will require investigation using complementary models and approaches outwith the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The functional contribution of neutrophil cell death to the swarming response is an important question to the field of inflammation, as it may explain why some neutrophil infiltrates continue growing, while others will shrink again over time. Neutrophil death inducing conditions (e.g. bacteria-induced cell lysis) may further exacerbate swarm growth. As the swarming response is pretty conserved among species, findings from the zebrafish model are likely to be also relevant for inflammatory processes in mammals, including humans.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for their insightful comments during the revision process. We are very much in agreement that neutrophil swarming is an exciting and emerging process in the inflammation and infections fields, and integration of the zebrafish model into our understanding of the process will add to our in vivo knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved.</p></body></sub-article></article>
