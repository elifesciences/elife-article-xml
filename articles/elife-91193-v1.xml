However, little is known about how habitat loss and fragmentation per se alters the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF relationship) in the natural landscape context. Based on 130 landscapes identified by a stratified random sampling in the agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China, we investigated the effects of landscape context (habitat loss and fragmentation per se) on plant richness, above-ground biomass, and the relationship between them in grassland communities using a structural equation model. We found that habitat loss directly decreased plant richness and hence decreased above-ground biomass, while fragmentation per se directly increased plant richness and hence increased above-ground biomass. Fragmentation per se also directly decreased soil water content and hence decreased above-ground biomass. Meanwhile, habitat loss decreased the magnitude of the positive relationship between plant richness and above-ground biomass by reducing the percentage of grassland specialists in the community, while fragmentation per se had no significant modulating effect on this relationship. These results demonstrate that habitat loss and fragmentation per se have inconsistent effects on BEF, with the BEF relationship being modulated by landscape context. Our findings emphasise that habitat loss rather than fragmentation per se can weaken the positive BEF relationship by decreasing the degree of habitat specialisation of the community.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BEF relationship</kwd><kwd>biodiversity</kwd><kwd>ecosystem function</kwd><kwd>fragmentation per se</kwd><kwd>habitat loss</kwd><kwd>modulating effect</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32071582</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Qing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Science and Technology Plan Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021GG0392</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Qing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023ZD24</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Qing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Habitat loss rather than fragmentation per se can weaken the positive BEF relationship by reducing the percentage of grassland specialists in the community.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Evidence from biodiversityâecosystem function (BEF hereafter) experiments during the past 30 years generally show positive relationships between biodiversity and productivity, soil carbon storage, decomposition rates, and other ecosystem functions in experimental communities, revealing the importance of biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tilman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Plas, 2019</xref>). When research expands from experiments to natural systems, however, BEF relationships remain unclear in the natural assembled communities, with significant context dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hagan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Plas, 2019</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duffy et al., 2017</xref>). One of the main reasons for these differences is because the landscape context surrounding natural communities regulates BEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonzalez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Consideration of the impacts of landscape context on surrounding communities is key to understand complex BEF relationships in natural systems.</p><p>Human activities have modified natural ecosystems globally, with fragmented landscape contexts becoming increasingly widespread around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chase et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maxwell et al., 2016</xref>). For example, at least 1.5 billion hectares of natural habitats on Earth have been converted to human-modified land since 2014, breaking apart continuous habitat into smaller and isolated fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">IPBES, 2019</xref>). Fragmented landscape context typically involves different processes, such as habitat loss, that is, reducing habitat amount in the landscape, and fragmentation per se, that is, breaking apart of habitat for a given habitat amount in the landscape, including decreased mean size of habitat patches, increased number of habitat patches, increased isolation among habitat patches, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fahrig, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">IbÃ¡Ã±ez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Habitat loss is often considered the major near-term threat to the biodiversity of terrestrial ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chase et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haddad et al., 2015</xref>), while the impact of fragmentation per se remains debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fletcher et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller-Rushing et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, habitat loss and fragmentation per se may have inconsistent ecological consequences and should be considered simultaneously to establish effective conservation strategies in fragmented landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fahrig et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fletcher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller-Rushing et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Fragmented landscape context can also affect BEF relationships. Previous studies have found that the magnitude and direction of BEF relationships vary across fragmented landscapes, including positive, negative, and non-significant relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Godbold et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hagan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rolo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zirbel et al., 2019</xref>). However, few studies have been conducted on how habitat loss and fragmentation per se regulate BEF relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>). This lack of studies hampers our understanding of complex BEF relationships in fragmented natural ecosystems. In theory, habitat loss and fragmentation per se can regulate ecosystem function and the BEF relationship by altering species composition, interactions, and spatial asynchrony regardless of changes in species richness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thompson and Gonzalez, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tscharntke et al., 2012</xref>). This is because species in communities are not ecologically equivalent and may respond differently to habitat loss and fragmentation per se, and contribute unequally to ecosystem function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Devictor et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wardle and Zackrisson, 2005</xref>). Therefore, considering changes in species composition can help to understand how habitat loss and fragmentation per se regulate BEF relationships.</p><p>The degree of habitat specialisation is a key ecological characteristic determining responses of species to habitat loss and fragmentation per se and the slope of BEF relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clavel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gravel et al., 2011</xref>). In fragmented landscapes, species with low levels of habitat specialisation (generalists) can use resources from different land covers, including focal habitat and non-habitat matrix, and thus are not sensitive to habitat loss and fragmentation per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matthews et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, species with high levels of habitat specialisation (specialists) depend highly on resources in specific habitats, and thus are vulnerable to adverse effects from habitat loss and fragmentation per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matthews et al., 2014</xref>). In communities, specialists with specialised niches in resource use may contribute complementary roles to ecosystem functioning, whereas generalists with unspecialised niches in resource use may contribute redundant roles to ecosystem functioning due to overlapping niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dehling et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denelle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gravel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilsey et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, communities composed of specialists should have a higher niche complementarity effect in maintaining ecosystem functions and a more significant BEF relationship than communities composed of generalists. Habitat loss and fragmentation per se are often predicted to decrease the degree of habitat specialisation (the replacement of specialists in communities by generalists), possibly resulting in functional homogenisation of communities and reduced BEF relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clavel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matthews, 2021</xref>). However, few studies have evaluated this process in fragmented landscapes.</p><p>Currently, research on habitat loss and fragmentation per se focusses primarily on forest ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fardila et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haddad et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma et al., 2023</xref>). Grasslands have received considerably less attention, despite being one of the largest terrestrial ecosystems, and suffering severe fragmentation due to human activities, such as agricultural reclamation and urbanisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fardila et al., 2017</xref>). The agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China is a typical anthropogenically fragmented grassland landscape caused by historical agricultural reclamation, especially in the late Qing Dynasty (about 1840â1912). Due to land policy reforms, the region has experienced a rapid expansion of farmland since the 1960s, converting continuous natural grasslands into smaller and isolated fragments, seriously threatening the conservation of BEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Based on 130 landscapes with different fragmentation levels in the agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we investigated how fragmented landscape context (habitat loss and fragmentation per se) impact the relationship between grassland plant diversity and above-ground productivity in the community. Specifically, we aimed to evaluate whether habitat loss and fragmentation per se would weaken the positive relationship between grassland plant diversity and above-ground productivity by reducing the habitat specialisation of the community.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Map of study area in the Tabu River Basin, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, northern China.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Location of the 130 survey sites in the study area.

Our study evaluated the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation per se on grassland plant diversity and above-ground productivity in the context of fragmented landscapes in the agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China, with our results showing the effects of these two facets to not be consistent.</p><p>Consistent with previous studies, we found habitat loss significantly reduced grassland plant diversity, suggesting that habitat loss is a major threat to the biodiversity conservation of fragmented landscapes in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chase et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haddad et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">IbÃ¡Ã±ez et al., 2014</xref>). While for fragmentation per se, we found a positive effect on grassland plant diversity, in accordance with some recent evidence, the effects of fragmentation per se on biodiversity are more likely positive than negative for a given amount of habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gestich et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palmeirim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riva and Fahrig, 2023</xref>). Our study suggests that biodiversity conservation strategies for fragmented landscapes should consider optimising the habitat configuration in the landscape in addition to preventing habitat loss, such as increasing the number of habitat patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arroyo-RodrÃ­guez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fahrig, 2017</xref>). However, it is important to stress that the observed positive effect of fragmentation per se does not imply that increasing the isolation of grassland patches would promote biodiversity, as the metric of fragmentation per se used in our study was more related to patch density, edge density, and mean patch area while relatively less related to patch isolation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The potential threats from isolation still needs to be carefully considered in the conservation of biodiversity in fragmented landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haddad et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our results showed for a metric of ecosystem function that landscape context affected above-ground productivity indirectly by influencing plant diversity and environment factors, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies in fragmented landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rippel et al., 2020</xref>). And we found fragmentation per se mediated the effect of habitat loss on environmental factors. A possible reason for this finding is fragmentation per se could directly alter environmental factors through enhanced edge effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laurance et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). In our study, fragmentation per se could lead to ecosystem drought and thus limit above-ground productivity in grassland ecosystems. This is mainly because enhanced edge effects due to fragmentation per se could lead to greater desiccation and evapotranspiration rates in remaining habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tuff et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, our study suggests that habitat loss and fragmentation per se have inconsistent consequences on plant diversity and ecosystem function, which should be considered explicitly in developing conservation strategies in fragmented landscapes.</p><p>In our study, a possible mechanism for the positive impacts of fragmentation per se on plant diversity and above-ground productivity (indirect positive impact via plant diversity) is that fragmentation per se increases the habitat heterogeneity in the landscape, which can promote biodiversity through spatial asynchrony and spatial insurance effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tscharntke et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies indicated that heterogeneity typically has nonlinear effects on BEF, as moderate heterogeneity can maximise spatial asynchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Redon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wilcox et al., 2017</xref>). However, our study did not observe nonlinear patterns between fragmentation per se and plant diversity and above-ground productivity. This may be due to the low spatial heterogeneity of this area as a result of agricultural intensification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). The gradient of fragmentation per se in our study may not cover the optimal heterogeneity levels for maximising plant diversity and above-ground productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thompson and Gonzalez, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Habitat loss rather than fragmentation per se weakened the magnitude of the positive relationship between plant diversity and ecosystem function</title><p>Understanding the direction and magnitude of BEF relationships in fragmented landscapes is essential to understanding the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem function in the changing world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonzalez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Plas, 2019</xref>). In naturally assembled communities, ecosystem functions may be dominated by complex environmental factors and landscape context, showing a weak or even negative correlation with biodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grace et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hagan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zirbel et al., 2019</xref>). Our study found grassland plant diversity showed a stronger positive impact on above-ground productivity than landscape context and environmental factors. This result is consistent with findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duffy et al., 2017</xref> in natural ecosystems, indicating grassland plant diversity has an important role in maintaining grassland ecosystem functions in the fragmented landscapes of the agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China.</p><p>Consistent with theoretical model predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), our study found that fragmented landscape context significantly modulated the BEF relationship. We further found that habitat loss weakened the magnitude of the BEF relationship through decreasing the percentage of specialists in grassland communities, as specialists were more vulnerable to the negative effect of habitat loss and more associated with above-ground productivity than generalists. These findings indicate reducing the degree of habitat specialisation may be the mechanism of fragmented landscape context weakening the BEF relationship in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clavel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gravel et al., 2011</xref>). Meanwhile, our study demonstrates that habitat loss, rather than fragmentation per se, can decrease the degree of habitat specialisation by leading to the replacement of specialists by generalists in the community, thus weakening the BEF relationship. This is mainly because fragmentation per se did not decrease the grassland specialist richness in this region, whereas habitat loss decreased the grassland specialist richness and led to the invasion of more weeds from the surrounding farmland into the grassland community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yan et al., 2023</xref>). Our findings suggest further expansion of farmland in the agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China would decrease the grassland plant diversity and its importance to above-ground productivity.</p><p>In addition, our study found that the BEF relationship showed a nonlinear pattern with increasing levels of fragmentation per se. For a given level of habitat loss, the positive BEF relationship was strongest at moderate fragmentation per se level and became neutral at high fragmentation per se level. This can be explained by the increased spatial asynchrony at moderate fragmentation per se level, which can promote niche complementary among species in the community and thus strengthen the BEF relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gonzalez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thompson and Gonzalez, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tscharntke et al., 2012</xref>). The neutral BEF relationship at high fragmentation per se level may be due to edge effects enhancing environmental filtering, thereby leading to functional redundancy among species and decoupling the BEF relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fetzer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zambrano et al., 2019</xref>). However, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hertzog et al., 2019</xref> on temperate forest ecosystems found that the positive relationship between plant diversity and ecosystem multifunctionality strengthened with increasing forest fragmentation and peaked at the high level of forest fragmentation. This inconsistency can be explained by trade-offs between different ecosystem functions that may differ in their response to fragmentation per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banks-Leite et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, future studies are needed to focus on multiple ecosystem functions, such as below-ground productivity, litter decomposition, and soil carbon stocks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study area</title><p>Our study area is in the agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China, the Tabu River Basin in Siziwang Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The mean annual temperature ranges from 1.5 to 5.0Â°C, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 225 to 322 mm. The type of soil is light chestnut soil. This area is a typical fragmented grassland landscape caused by agricultural intensification. Grassland is the dominant natural habitat type in this area, accounting for about 40.8% of the total area, with the dominant plant species being <italic>Stipa krylovii</italic> and S. <italic>breviflora</italic>. Farmland is the dominant matrix type in this area, accounting for about 30.6% of the total area, with the main crops grown being potatoes and maize.

Grassland was defined as the focal habitat. Habitat amount was represented by the percentage of grassland cover in the landscape. Habitat loss was represented by the loss of grassland amount in the landscape. As the remaining grassland fragments in this region were mainly caused by grassland loss due to human activities such as cropland expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2020</xref>), the percentage of non-grassland cover in the landscape was used in our study to represent habitat loss. Fragmentation per se was estimated by calculating four landscape indices that reflect the different fragmentation processes for a given amount of habitat in the landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fahrig, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fahrig, 2017</xref>): (1) patch density metric, representing an increase in the number of grassland patches in the landscape; (2) edge density metric, representing an increase in the grassland edges in the landscape; (3) mean patch area metric, representing a decrease in the mean size of grassland patches in the landscape; and (4) mean nearest-neighbour distance metric, representing an increase in the isolation among grassland patches in the landscape. The patch density metric reflects the breaking apart of habitat in the landscape, which is a direct reflection of the definition of fragmentation per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fahrig et al., 2019</xref>). The edge density metric reflects the magnitude of the edge effect caused by fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fahrig, 2017</xref>). The mean patch area metric and the mean nearest-neighbour distance metric are associated with the area and distance effects of island biogeography, respectively, reflecting the processes of local extinction and dispersal of species in the landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fletcher et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Given that habitat amount (or habitat loss) and fragmentation per se are typically highly correlated in natural landscapes, it is hard to disentangle their relative effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fahrig, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore used a quasi-experimental method to select sampling landscapes across the relative independent spatial gradient of habitat amount and fragmentation per se, which can reduce collinearity between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butsic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pasher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reynolds et al., 2018</xref>). To do so, we first used the moving window method (window size: 500 m radius buffer) to quantify grassland amount and the four landscape indices (patch density, edge density, mean patch area, and mean nearest-neighbour distance metric) surrounding all grassland cells. The 500 m radius buffer was used because our previous studies showed this buffer includes the optimal scale of spatial processes influencing grassland plant diversity in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Second, to quantify the fragmentation per se level, we derived the first principal component (PC1) of the four landscape indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hertzog et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rolo et al., 2018</xref>). We took the inverse of the PC1 as a single fragmentation per se index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), which was positively correlated with patch density, edge density, mean nearest-neighbour distance metric, and negatively with mean patch area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p><p>Based on the quartiles of grassland amount and single fragmentation per se index, we ranked these grassland cells into nine types: highâhigh, highâmoderate, highâlow, moderateâhigh, moderateâmoderate, moderateâlow, lowâhigh, lowâmoderate, lowâlow grassland amount, and fragmentation per se (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Given landscapes with a high grassland amount and high fragmentation are scarce in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>), we did not consider this type of landscape. Finally, we selected at least 20 grassland landscapes with a minimum distance condition using stratified sampling from each of the remaining eight grassland types as alternative sites for field surveys. The minimum distance between each landscape was at least 1000 m to prevent overlapping landscapes and potential spatial autocorrelation.</p><p>The land-cover data used to quantify grassland fragmentation were obtained via supervised classification on a cloud-free Landsat 8 TOA composite image (30 m resolution) from 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yan et al., 2022</xref>). We used the random forest classifier in the Google Earth Engine platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gorelick et al., 2017</xref>) for the supervised classification.

In order to exclude the impact of historical agricultural activities, the habitat type of the established sites was natural grasslands with regional vegetation characteristics. Each site was not abandoned agricultural land, and there was no sign of agricultural reclamation.</p><p>At the 10 m Ã 10 m centre of each site, we randomly set up three 1 m Ã 1 m plots in a flat topographic area to investigate grassland vascular plant diversity and above-ground productivity. Plant diversity was obtained by recording the number of vascular plant species in each plot. The above-ground productivity was obtained by harvesting the above-ground biomass of the plants in each plot and drying biomass at 65Â°C to a constant weight. We also investigated two environmental factors related to water and temperature (SWC and LST) in each site to consider their potential impact on plant diversity and ecosystem function. The SWC (%) was obtained by measuring the weight of wet soil samples before and after oven-drying at 105Â°C to a constant weight. The wet soil samples were collected from three 30 cm deep cores using a 5-cm diameter soil auger within three plots of each site. The LST (Â°C) was extracted from MODIS Land Surface Temperature/Emissivity daily product (MOD11A1) using the Google Earth Engine platform. For each site, the average daily LST of late July to mid-August 2020 was used in the following data analysis.</p><p>As grassland is the dominant habitat type in the fragmented landscape and farmland is the dominant matrix type, the specialists and generalists in this study were grouped as grassland specialists, that is, species that occur only in grassland, and weeds, that is, species that occur in both grassland and farmland. The classification of grassland specialists and weeds in this study was based on our experience with plant surveys in this region, the List of Main Crop Weeds in China, and available information in the Flora of China (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iplant.cn/frps">http://www.iplant.cn/frps</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>For each site, we calculated the mean vascular plant richness of the three 1 m Ã 1 m plots, representing the vascular plant diversity, and the mean above-ground biomass of the three 1 m Ã 1 m plots, representing the above-ground productivity. The mean vascular plant richness and the mean above-ground biomass were assessed to be normally distributed by a ShapiroâWilk normality test. The degree of habitat specialisation was represented by the percentage of grassland specialists in the community. Landscape context includes habitat loss and fragmentation per se. Habitat loss was represented by the percentage of non-grassland cover in the landscape and fragmentation per se was represented by the inverse of the PC1 of the four landscape indices (mean grassland patch area, mean nearest-neighbour distance among grassland patch, grassland patch density, and grassland patch edge). Environmental factors were LST and SWC.</p><p>First, to investigate the overall pattern between landscape context and grassland vascular plant diversity and above-ground productivity in this region, we used scatter plots and Pearson correlation analyses to present the pairwise relationship of habitat loss and fragmentation per se with plant richness (including grassland specialist richness and weed richness) and above-ground biomass.</p><p>Second, to investigate the relative importance of landscape context, grassland vascular plant diversity, and environmental factors on above-ground productivity, we used the multi-model-averaging method based on the Akaike information criterion corrected (AICc) for a small sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harrison et al., 2018</xref>). We first constructed linear regression models, including the response variable (above-ground biomass) and all combinations of the predictor variables (habitat loss, fragmentation per se, grassland specialist richness, weed richness, LST, and SWC). The models with the lowest AICc value and a difference of less than two âAICc from the lowest AICc value were selected as optimal models. We then calculated the model-averaged standardised parameter estimate based on the optimal models as the relative effect of each influencing factor on above-ground biomass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harrison et al., 2018</xref>). Before the analysis, we calculated the variance inflation factors (VIF) for each predictor variable to assess multicollinearity. The VIF of all explanatory variables was less than four (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), suggesting no significant multicollinearity in the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carrara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dormann et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to investigate how landscape context impacts the relationship between grassland plant diversity and above-ground productivity, we first used linear regression models to evaluate relationship between plant richness and above-ground biomass at low, moderate, and high levels of habitat loss and fragmentation per se, respectively. We then assessed the significance of interaction terms between habitat loss and fragmentation per se and plant richness in the linear regression models to evaluate whether they modulate the relationship between plant richness and above-ground biomass. Furthermore, we used a piecewise structural equation model to investigate the specific pathways in which habitat loss and fragmentation per se modulate the relationship between plant richness and above-ground biomass.</p><p>To do so, we first constructed a hypothetical conceptual model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

As habitat loss is often the main cause of fragmentation per se in natural landscapes, we hypothesised a causal relationship between habitat loss and fragmentation per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Didham et al., 2012</xref>). We also hypothesised that habitat loss and fragmentation per se could both decrease the impact of plant richness on above-ground biomass by decreasing the percentage of grassland specialists in the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clavel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gravel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2018</xref>).

The authors use a stratified random sampling to select 130 study sites located within 500 m - radius landscapes varying along gradients of habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se. In these study sites, the authors measure grassland specialist and generalist plant richness via field surveys, as well as above-ground biomass by harvesting and dry-weighting the grass communities in each 3 x 1m2 plots of the 130 study sites. The authors find that habitat loss and fragmentation per se have different effects on biodiversity, ecosystem function and the BEF relationship: whereas habitat loss was associated with a decrease in plant richness, fragmentation per se was not; and whereas fragmentation per se was associated with a decrease in above-ground biomass, habitat loss was not.

We are grateful to you for the recognition. We have carefully analyzed all comments of the editors and reviewers and revised our manuscript to address them. All comments and recommendations are helpfully and constructive for improving our manuscript. We have described in detail our response to each of comment below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to the reviewers' assessments, we have the following comments on your paper.</p><p>(1) Some of the results are not consistent between figures. The relationships between overall species richness and fragmentation per se are not consistent between Figs. 3 and 5. The relationships between aboveground biomass and habitat loss are not consistent between Figs. 4 and 5. How shall we interpret these inconsistent results?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thanks for your insightful comments. The reason for these inconsistencies is that the linear regression model did not take into account the complex causal relationships (including direct and indirect effects) among the different influencing factors. The results in Figures 3 and 4 just represent the pairwise relationship pattern and relative importance, respectively. The causal effects of habitat loss and fragmentation per se on plant richness and above-ground biomass should be interpreted based on the structural equation model results (Figure 6). We have revised the data analysis to clear these inconsistent results. Line 225-228</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have added the interpretation for these inconsistent results. The inconsistent effects between Figures 3 and 6 suggest that fragmentation per se actually had a positive effect on plant richness after accounting for the effects of habitat loss and environmental factors simultaneously.</p><p>The inconsistent effects between Figures 4 and 6 are because the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation per se on above-ground biomass were mainly mediated by plant richness and environmental factors, which had no significant direct effect (Figure 6). Thus, habitat loss and fragmentation per se showed no significant relative effects on above-ground biomass after controlling the effects of plant richness and environmental factors (Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) One of the fragmentation indices, mean patch area metric, seems to be more appropriate as a measure of habitat loss, because it represents &quot;a decrease in grassland patch area in the landscape&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thanks for your insightful comments. We apologize for causing this confusion. The mean patch area metric in our study represents the mean size of grassland patches in the landscape for a given grassland amount. Previous studies have often used the mean patch metric as a measure of fragmentation, which can reflect the processes of local extinction in the landscape (Fahrig, 2003; Fletcher et al., 2018). We have revised the definition of the mean patch area metric and added its ecological implication in the revised manuscript to clarify this confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is important to show both the mean and 95% CI (or standard error) of the slope coefficients regarding to Figs. 3 and 6.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thanks for your suggestions. We have added the 95% confidence intervals to the Figure 3 and Figure 6 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It would be great to clarify what patch-level and landscape-level studies are in lines 302-306. Note that this study assesses the effects of landscape context on patch-level variables (i.e., plot-based plant richness and plot-based grassland biomass) rather than landscape-level variables (i.e., the average or total amount of biomass in a landscape).</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thanks for your insightful comment. We agree with your point that our study investigated the effect of fragmented landscape context (habitat loss and fragmentation per se) on plot-based plant richness and plot-based above-ground biomass rather than landscape-level variables.</p><p>Therefore, we no longer discussed the differences between the patch-level and landscape-level studies here, instead focusing on the different ecological impacts of habitat loss and fragmentation per se in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Line 369-374:</p><p>âAlthough habitat loss and fragmentation per se are generally highly associated in natural landscapes, they are distinct ecological processes that determine decisions on effective conservation strategies (Fahrig, 2017; Valente et al., 2023).

In these study sites, the authors measure grassland specialist and generalist plant richness via field surveys, as well as above-ground biomass by harvesting and dry-weighting the grass communities in each 3 x 1m2 plots of the 130 study sites. The authors find that habitat loss and fragmentation per se have different effects on biodiversity, ecosystem function and the BEF relationship: whereas habitat loss was associated with a decrease in plant richness, fragmentation per se was not; and whereas fragmentation per se was associated with a decrease in above-ground biomass, habitat loss was not. Finally, habitat loss, but not fragmentation per se was linked to a decrease in the magnitude of the positive biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship, by reducing the percentage of grassland specialists in the community.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study by Yan et al. is an exceptionally well-designed, well-written, clear and concise study shedding light on a longstanding, important question in landscape ecology and biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research. Via a stratified random sampling approach (cf. also &quot;quasi-experimental design&quot; Butsic et al. 2017), Yan et al. create an ideal set of study sites, where habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se (usually highly correlated) are decorrelated and hence, separate effects of each of these facets on biodiversity and ecosystem function can be assessed statistically in &quot;real-world&quot; (and not experimental, cf. Duffy et al. 2017) communities. The authors use adequate and well-described methods to investigate their questions. The findings of this study add important empirical evidence from real-world grassland ecosystems that help to advance our theoretical understanding of landscape-moderation of biodiversity effects and provide important guidelines for conservation management.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I found only a few minor issues, mostly unclear descriptions in the study that could be revised for more clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thanks very much for your review of the manuscript.

I think it would be good to discuss this fact and the consequences of it, that your definition of fragmentation is focused more on edge density, patch density and mean patch area, and less on patch isolation in your Discussion section?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thanks for your insightful comment and suggestion. We agree with your point. We have discussed this fact and its implications for understanding the effects of fragmentation per se in our study.</p><p>Line 384-389:</p><p>âHowever, it is important to stress that the observed positive effect of fragmentation per se does not imply that increasing the isolation of grassland patches would promote biodiversity, as the metric of fragmentation per se used in our study was more related to patch density, edge density and mean patch area while relatively less related to patch isolation (Appendix Table A1). The potential threats from isolation still need to be carefully considered in the conservation of biodiversity in fragmented landscapes (Haddad et al., 2015).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) Also, from your PCA in Figure A1, it seems that positive values of PC1 mean &quot;low fragmentation&quot;, whereas high values of PC1 mean &quot;high fragmentation&quot;, however, in Figure A2, the inverse is shown (low values of PC1 = low fragmentation, high values of PC1 = high fragmentation). Could you clarify in the Methods section, if you scaled or normalized the PC1 to match this directionality?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We apologize for making this confusion. In order to be consistent with the direction of change in fragmentation per se, we took the inverse of the PC1 as a single fragmentation per se index, which was positively correlated with patch density, edge density, mean nearest-neighbor distance metric, and negatively with mean patch area (Appendix Figure A1 and Table A1). We have clarified this point in the Method section.</p><p>Line 160-163:</p><p>âWe took the inverse of the PC1 as a single fragmentation per se index, which was positively correlated with patch density, edge density, mean nearest-neighbor distance metric, and negatively with mean patch area (Appendix Figure A1 and Table A1).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) On line 155 you describe that you selected at least 20 landscapes using stratified sampling from each of the eight groups of habitat amount and fragmentation combination.

In your study, it seems that the effects of habitat amount and fragmentation per se on biodiversity and ecosystem function are quite linear, which contrasts previous research highlighting that intermediate levels of fragmentation/heterogeneity could maximise spatial asynchrony, biodiversity and ecosystem function (e.g. Redon et al. 2014, Thompson &amp; Gonzalez 2016, Tscharntke et al. 2012, Wilcox et al. 2017). I think it would add depth to your study if you discussed your finding of linear effects of habitat amount and fragmentation on biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and BEF. For example:</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thanks for your constructive suggestions. We have carefully studied the literature (e.g. Redon et al. 2014, Thompson &amp; Gonzalez 2016, Tscharntke et al. 2012, Wilcox et al. 2017), which highlights that intermediate levels of fragmentation/heterogeneity could maximise spatial asynchrony, biodiversity and ecosystem function.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have added the discussion about the linear positive effects of fragmentation on plant diversity and above-ground productivity and discussed possible reasons for this linear effect.</p><p>Line 402-413:</p><p>âIn our study, a possible mechanism for the positive impacts of fragmentation per se on plant diversity and above-ground productivity (indirect positive impact via plant diversity) is that fragmentation per se increases the habitat heterogeneity in the landscape, which can promote biodiversity through spatial asynchrony and spatial insurance effects (Tscharntke et al., 2012). Previous studies indicated that heterogeneity typically has nonlinear effects on biodiversity and ecosystem function, as moderate heterogeneity can maximise spatial asynchrony (Redon et al., 2014; Wilcox et al., 2017). However, our study did not observe nonlinear patterns between fragmentation per se and plant diversity and above-ground productivity. This may be due to the low spatial heterogeneity of this area as a result of agricultural intensification (Benton et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2019). The gradient of fragmentation per se in our study may not cover the optimal heterogeneity levels for maximising plant diversity and above-ground productivity (Thompson and Gonzalez, 2016).â</p><p>Meanwhile, we also discussed the nonlinear pattern of the BEF relationship with increasing levels of fragmentation per se to add depth to the discussion.</p><p>Line 442-451:</p><p>âIn addition, our study found that the BEF relationship showed a nonlinear pattern with increasing levels of fragmentation per se.

The neutral BEF relationship at high fragmentation per se level may be due to edge effects enhancing environmental filtering, thereby leading to functional redundancy among species and decoupling the BEF relationship (Fetzer et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2016; Zambrano et al., 2019).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(a) Line 74-75: I was wondering if you also thought of spatial insurance effects or spatial asynchrony effects that can emerge with habitat fragmentation, which could lead to increased ecosystem functioning as well?

We have rephrased the two sentences to improve their logic.</p><p>Line 74-79:</p><p>âIn theory, habitat loss and fragmentation per se can regulate ecosystem function and the BEF relationship by altering species composition, interactions, and spatial asynchrony regardless of changes in species richness (Liu et al., 2018; Thompson and Gonzalez, 2016; Tscharntke et al., 2012). This is because species in communities are not ecologically equivalent and may respond differently to habitat loss and fragmentation per se, and contribute unequally to ecosystem function (Devictor et al., 2008; Wardle and Zackrisson, 2005).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) L97. Are grasslands really the largest terrestrial ecosystem? Isn't it the forest?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We apologize for making this confusion. We have rephrased this sentence here.</p><p>Line 101-104:</p><p>âGrasslands have received considerably less attention, despite being one of the largest terrestrial ecosystems, and suffering severe fragmentation due to human activities, such as agricultural reclamation and urbanisation (Fardila et al., 2017).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Fig.1, whether the four sample plots presented in panel b are from panel a. Please add the scale bar in panel b.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thanks for your comment. The four sample plots presented in panel b are from panel a in Figure 1. We have also added the scale bar in panel b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) L105. This statement is too specific. Please remove and consider merging this paragraph with the next.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thanks for your suggestion. We have removed this sentence and merged this paragraph with the next.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) L157. The accuracy and kappa value of the supervised classification should be given.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thanks for your suggestion. We have added the accuracy and kappa value of the supervised classification in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Line 176-177:</p><p>âThe overall classification accuracy was 84.3 %, and the kappa coefficient was 0.81.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) I would recommend the authors provide the list of generalists and specialists surveyed in the supplementary. Readers may not be familiar with the plant species composition in this area.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thanks for your suggestion. We agree with your point. We have provided the list of generalists and specialists surveyed in the Appendix Table A4.</p><p>Line 282-283:</p><p>âA total of 130 vascular plant species were identified in our study sites, including 91 grassland specialists and 39 weeds (Appendix Table A4).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Fig.4, it is better to add the results of variation partition to present the relative contribution of habitat fragmentation, environmental factors, and plant diversity.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thanks for your suggestion. We have integrated the landscape context, environmental factors, and plant diversity into the multi-model averaging analysis and redraw Figure 4 to present their relative importance for above-ground biomass.</p><p>Line 313-319:</p><fig id="sa4fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Standardised parameter estimates and 95% confidence intervals for landscape context, plant diversity, and environmental factors affecting above-ground biomass from 130 landscapes in the Tabu River Basin, a typical agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China.</title><p>Standardised estimates and 95% confidence intervals are calculated by the multi-model averaging method based on the four optimal models affecting above-ground biomass (Appendix Table A3). ** represent significance at the 0.01 level.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91193-sa4-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Please redraw Fig.2 and Fig.5 to integrate the environmental factors. Add the R-square to Fig 5.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thanks for your suggestion. We have integrated two environmental factors into the structural equation model and redraw Figure 2 and Figure 5 in the revised manuscript. And we have added the R-square to the Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) L354. The authors should be careful to claim that habitat loss could reduce the importance of plant diversity to ecosystem function. This pattern observed may depend on the type of ecosystem function studied.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thanks for your suggestion. We have avoided this claim in the revised manuscript and explicitly discussed the importance of simultaneously focusing on multiple ecosystem functions, such as below-ground productivity, litter decomposition, soil carbon stocks, etc.</p><p>Line 454-457:</p><p>âThis inconsistency can be explained by trade-offs between different ecosystem functions that may differ in their response to fragmentation per se (Banks-Leite et al., 2020). Therefore, future studies are needed to focus on multiple ecosystem functions, such as below-ground productivity, litter decomposition, soil carbon stocks, etc.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
