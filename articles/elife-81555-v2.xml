the rsfMRI signal. In the meantime, as a crucial physiologic process, respiration can directly drive neural activity change in the brain, and may thereby modulate the rsfMRI signal. Nonetheless, this potential neural component in the respiration–fMRI relationship is largely unexplored. To elucidate this issue, here we simultaneously recorded the electrophysiology, rsfMRI, and respiration signals in rats. Our data show that respiration is indeed associated with neural activity changes, evidenced by a phase-locking relationship between slow respiration variations and the gamma-band power of the electrophysiological signal recorded in the anterior cingulate cortex. Intriguingly, slow respiration variations are also linked to a characteristic rsfMRI network, which is mediated by gamma-band neural activity. In addition, this respiration-related brain network disappears when brain-wide neural activity is silenced at an isoelectrical state, while the respiration is maintained, further confirming the necessary role of neural activity in this network. Taken together, this study identifies a respiration-related brain network underpinned by neural activity, which represents a novel component in the respiration–rsfMRI relationship that is distinct from respiration-related rsfMRI artifacts. It opens a new avenue for investigating the interactions between respiration, neural activity, and resting-state brain networks in both healthy and diseased conditions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>What does the brain do when we breathe? Humans and other animals with lungs depend on breathing to supply their cells with oxygen for energy production. Neurons in the brain are supplied oxygen through an intricate system of blood vessels. When active, neurons consume a lot of energy and require a steady supply of oxygen-rich blood. In fact, this relationship between blood vessels and activity of neurons in the brain is so tightly linked that to study neuron activity researchers and clinicians often use an approach called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to analyze the flow of oxygenated blood in the brain.</p><p>This imaging technique allows scientists to map how active different parts of the brain are at any given time without the need for an invasive medical procedure. Unfortunately, fMRI results are affected by the cycles of inhalation and exhalation that take place while breathing, even when an individual is at rest. This is because the rate and depth of respiration can vary, resulting in the body moving unpredictably and in CO<sub>2</sub> levels fluctuating in the brain, which can lead to changes in fMRI signals that do not correlate with neuron activity. Such misleading measurements are called ‘artifacts’. The assumption that these fMRI results do not represent real brain activity has meant that the effects of breathing on neuron activity in different parts of the brain is poorly understood.</p><p>To solve this issue, Tu and Zhang performed fMRI on rats and combined the results with measurements of the depth and rate of respiration, and with electrophysiology, an approach that allowed them to directly record the electrical properties of neurons. This allowed them to map out the network of neurons that become active in response to breathing.</p><p>The results show that breathing leads to a specific fMRI signal that can be distinguished from the artifacts introduced by fluctuating CO<sub>2</sub> levels and body movements<bold>.</bold> The signal correlates with the activity of neurons measured using electrophysiology and with breathing patterns, and it disappears when the electrical activity of neurons in the brain is suppressed, even if the rats are still breathing. This suggests that breathing affects brain activity that is independent of the previously described artifacts.</p><p>Future studies may focus on how the brain responds to breathing or how respiration itself is controlled by the brain, with the methods developed allowing researchers to explore regions of the brain that increase their activity while breathing. This clears the path towards investigating the neural mechanisms underlying therapies and exercises that focus on breathing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>respiration</kwd><kwd>resting-state fMRI</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>rat</kwd><kwd>physiological artifact</kwd><kwd>RVT</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS085200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Nanyin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1MH114224</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Nanyin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM141792</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Nanyin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Using simultaneous recordings of electrophysiology, respiration, and resting-state fMRI, a respiration-associated neural network is identified.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI), which measures spontaneous blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal, is a powerful tool for non-invasively investigating brain-wide functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biswal et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fox and Raichle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). Due to its hemodynamic nature, the rsfMRI signal is susceptible to systemic physiological changes such as respiration and cardiac pulsations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murphy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caballero-Gaudes and Reynolds, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), and these effects are usually treated as non-neuronal artifacts in rsfMRI data.</p><p>Respiration is a major physiological process that drives fluctuations in cerebral blood flow and oxygenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu, 2016</xref>).

Slowly varying changes (typically below 0.15 Hz) in breathing rate and depth, which can be quantified as respiration volume per time (RVT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birn et al., 2006</xref>), covary with arterial CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wise et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang and Glover, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoiland et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) and affect the BOLD signal via vasodilatory effects and/or autonomic influences of the vessel tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duyn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Picchioni et al., 2022</xref>). On the other hand, faster respiratory cycles (i.e., periodic inspiration and expiration), accompanied by the corresponding chest and neck movement, can induce changes in the static magnetic field, which in turn lead to BOLD signal changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glover et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raj et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Windischberger et al., 2002</xref>). Both effects can be effectively mitigated/removed by standard rsfMRI preprocessing methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glover et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the well-characterized respiration-related non-neural artifacts, there is evidence hinting a possible neural component in the respiration–rsfMRI interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yuan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shams et al., 2021</xref>). First, respiration can directly drive brain-wide neuronal oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tort et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kay et al., 2009</xref>) not only in the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adrian, 1942</xref>) and piriform cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fontanini et al., 2003</xref>)—brain regions directly related to breathing—but also in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), somatosensory cortex, and hippocampus, and this effect has been consistently found across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yanovsky et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biskamp et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zelano et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, respiration changes can be associated with arousal and/or emotion-related brain state changes, which covary with cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yackle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shea, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Homma and Masaoka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Folschweiller and Sauer, 2021</xref>). Therefore, in addition to the artifactual effects aforementioned, respiration may affect the rsfMRI signal by directly modulating the neural activity. However, this potential neural component in the respiration–fMRI relationship is largely unexplored.</p><p>To gain a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between respiration, neuronal activity, and rsfMRI signal, here we simultaneously acquired rsfMRI, electrophysiology, and respiration data in anesthetized rats. Anesthesia was used to ensure our results are not confounded by the animal’s motion, which affects all three signals. Based on these measures, an RVT-correlated rsfMRI network was identified. Importantly, regressing out gamma activity or silencing neural activity across the brain disrupted this respiration-related network, suggesting that this respiration–rsfMRI relationship is mediated by neural activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To determine the potential role of neural activity in the respiration–rsfMRI relationship, we simultaneously recorded the electrophysiology and respiration signals along with rsfMRI data in rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The respiration signal was recorded by a respiration sensor placed under the animal’s chest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Representative raw respiration signal, the respiration rate distribution across all scans, and the averaged respiration power are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>. Slow respiration variations are quantified by RVT, calculated as the difference of consecutive peaks of inspiration and expiration divided by the time interval between the two adjacent signal maxima (or minima) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birn et al., 2006</xref>). The electrophysiology signal was recorded using an MR-compatible electrode implanted in the right side of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The ACC was selected given its critical role in respiratory modulation, evidenced by early studies showing that ACC was activated during breathlessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liotti et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans et al., 2002</xref>). More recent research further demonstrates the role of ACC in respiratory control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tort et al., 2018b</xref>). For example, electrophysiology recordings in humans showed that ACC exhibited different neural responses to separate respirational tasks including breath-holding, voluntary deep breathing, and hypercapnia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holton et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, the ACC is a key region in the rodent default-mode network (DMN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tu et al., 2021a</xref>), which has been linked to respiration-related fMRI signal changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birn et al., 2006</xref>). The location of the electrode was confirmed by T2-weighted structural images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Note that this calculation is different from the method we used to identify respiration-related neural network, which directly correlated the RVT with the rsfMRI signal. Our data show that the slow respiration-related rsfMRI artifact is distinct from the respiration-related neural network. First, the slow respiration-related rsfMRI artifact is dominantly located around the ventricles and large veins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>), whereas the respiration-related neural network is mostly located at the gray matter with a distinct spatial pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>).

Importantly, we confirmed the neural underpinning of this network, indicated by the phase-locking relationship between the RVT and gamma-band power in the ACC—a node in this network. Regressing out the gamma-band power disrupted the respiration network, suggesting a mediating role of neural activity in this network. To further validate this finding, we experimentally silenced the neural activity across the brain but maintained the respiration in the animal. In this condition, we again failed to observe the respiration-related brain network, confirming the neural underpinning of the network. Lastly, we showed that the respiration-related neural network is distinct from respiration-related rsfMRI artifacts. Overall, our study maps brain-wide neural responses related to respiration. These data provide new insight into understanding the neural activity-mediated respiratory effects on resting-state functional networks. Importantly, this breathing-related brain network might be altered in brain disorders, and thus our findings might potentially provide important clinical value.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The respiration network is very likely linked to respiration-entrained brain-wide neural oscillations</title><p>Respiration-induced neuronal oscillations have been consistently observed across multiple species including rats, mice, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yanovsky et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zelano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lockmann et al., 2016</xref>). This phenomenon also seems to be robust in various physiological and behavioral states including freely moving awake and immobile awake conditions, as well as anesthetized states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fontanini et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhong et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, previous studies found that respiration specifically modulated the amplitude of gamma activity in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rojas-Líbano and Kay, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fontanini and Bower, 2005</xref>), consistent with our finding of band-specific coherence between the gamma power in the ACC and RVT. Notably, gamma power is generally believed to relate to the BOLD signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Winder et al., 2017</xref>), which is also demonstrated in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These results suggest that respiration is associated with gamma oscillations, which is necessary for BOLD signal changes in the respiration network. This notion is further supported by our data that regressing out gamma-band LFP signals tremendously reduced the correlation between RVT and fMRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>), although it is still possible that if there are non-neural hemodynamic effects of respiration on the rsfMRI signal that occur at zero lag (i.e., a non-neural hemodynamic factor that are synchronized with gamma LFP), regressing out gamma LFP could also reduce these effects.</p><p>In addition to the mPFC, previous work has shown that respiration-generated neuronal oscillations are phase locked to the breath rhythm across distributed brain regions including the olfactory bulb, primary piriform cortex, hippocampus, and somatosensory barrel cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fontanini et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yanovsky et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biskamp et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herrero et al., 2018</xref>). Those regions are highly consistent with brain regions in the respiration network we observed. Furthermore, the piriform cortex is anatomically connected to the mPFC, ACC, and orbital cortex, all of which are parts of the respiration network in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmahmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Illig, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">García-Cabezas and Barbas, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carmichael et al., 1994</xref>). Taken together, the spatial pattern of the respiration network reported here well agrees with brain regions exhibiting neural oscillation changes driven by respiration.</p><p>Previous work also demonstrates that respiration-induced neuronal oscillations do not result from the movement of the muscle or electrode. For instance, the oscillations are different in the laminar amplitude along the hippocampus, with the maximal amplitude in the dentate gyrus (DG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yanovsky et al., 2014</xref>). This finding well agrees with our data, displaying more prominent involvement of the DG than other parts of the hippocampus in the respiration network. In addition, our data show that only the gamma-band power, not other LFP bands, is coherent with slow variations of respiration, whereas the movement of electrode or muscle would lead to increased coherence across multiple frequency bands. Taken together, the respiration-related functional network we observed is very likely linked to the respiration-entrained gamma-band oscillations in regions involved in the network.</p><p>Notably, regressing out the respirational signal does not abolish the RSFC measured by rsfMRI data, suggesting that the respiration does not account for all the effects of the RSFC measured. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> shows the differences of ACC seedmaps and ACC gamma activity-derived correlation maps before and after regressing out the RVT. Although RVT regression reduced ACC RSFC particularly in brain regions involved in the respiration network as expected, the major RSFC pattern remains consistent, indicating that a dominant component of RSFC is not ascribed by the respiration effect.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Respiration and arousal changes</title><p>It is possible that the neural contribution to the respiration-related brain network is mediated by arousal changes, which is associated with both neural excitability and respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yackle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shea, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan et al., 2012</xref>). The cerebral blood flow can be regulated by the innervation from the basal forebrain and locus coeruleus, and both regions are directly related to arousal changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yackle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lecrux and Hamel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Melnychuk et al., 2018</xref>). Previous studies in humans demonstrated correlations among the fMRI signal, low-frequency fluctuations of respiration, and EEG alpha power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yuan et al., 2013</xref>). The fMRI–respiration correlate was stronger at the eye-closing resting state with a greater arousal-level change than the eye-open state. In addition, strong association was identified between alpha wave and alertness level. These data together suggest that the correlations between low-frequency fluctuations of respiration, alpha EEG power, and the fMRI signal might be related to the fluctuation of wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yuan et al., 2013</xref>). However, we do not believe the arousal level plays a dominant role in our results, given that our study was performed in anesthetized animals. Accordingly, we did not observe any coherence between alpha-band power and the slow variations of respiration, suggesting the respiration-related fMRI network we observed might be attributed to a different mechanism than arousal.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The association between neural activity and respiration in human studies</title><p>The findings in the present study to a large extent echo the results reported in human studies. Previous research demonstrated bidirectional interplay between respiration and neural activity in humans. Neural activity in brainstem regions such as the preBötzinger complex directly controls the respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baertsch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith et al., 1991</xref>). In addition, respiration-induced LFP oscillations were observed in multiple human brain regions such as the piriform cortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zelano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herrero et al., 2018</xref>), consistent with our data. McKay et al. also found that voluntary hyperpnea was related to the neural activity of various brain regions including the primary sensory and motor cortices, supplementary motor area, caudate nucleus, and globus pallidum, which largely agree with the respiration-related brain network we identified in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKay et al., 2003</xref>). Importantly, respiration-mediated neural activity was found to modulate brain function. For example, respiration is shown to modulate visual perceptual sensitivity, mediated by alpha power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kluger et al., 2021</xref>). Respiration is also the key component in mindfulness meditation, which has been repeatedly shown to have modulatory effects on brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doll et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the coupling between neural activity and respiration may facilitate our understanding of brain disease. Hyam et al. stimulated the pedunculopontine region (PPNr) and observed improvement in upper airway function in Parkinson’s patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hyam et al., 2019</xref>). Loss of neurons in the preBötzinger complex was found to cause sleep-disordered breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McKay et al., 2005</xref>). Taken together, those findings indicate that the respiration-related brain network might be conserved across species and represent a general phenomenon in the mammalian brain, and this brain network might play an important role in normal and diseased brain function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Potential pitfalls</title><p>In the current study, we performed the experiment in lightly sedated animals to ensure the results were not confounded by the animal’s motion. Indeed, animals’ motion, particularly respiration-correlated motion, can induce systematic variation in the rsfMRI signal that potentially leads to an artifactual correlation pattern. Such a correlation pattern is difficult to be parceled out in our respiration-associated brain network. However, it has to be recognized that anesthesia might be a potential confounder by itself, as it may affect the respiration, as well as respiration-induced neural and vascular activities. For instance, anesthetics can reduce the respiration rate and affect LFP by increasing the low-frequency power and decreasing the high-frequency power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Purdon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">You et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastos et al., 2021</xref>). Our rationale for choosing combined low-dose isoflurane and dexmedetomidine as our anesthesia protocol is as follows: Isoflurane is a vasodilator, which can attenuate the BOLD signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwinn et al., 1990</xref>), whereas the dexmedetomidine is a vasoconstrictor, which can counteract the vasodilatory effect from isoflurane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Talke and Anderson, 2018</xref>). This anesthesia protocol has been shown to minimize the confounding effects on the BOLD response and maintain the functional connectivity across both cortical and subcortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grandjean et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benveniste et al., 2017</xref>). Despite the potential confounding effects of anesthesia, previous studies demonstrated that similar respiration-coupled LFP oscillations were observed in both anesthetized and awake states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yanovsky et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lockmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nguyen Chi et al., 2016</xref>). As the relationship between respiration and neural activity is preserved under anesthesia, our results obtained in anesthetized rats should remain valid. However, it has to be noted that the neural contributions in the respiration-related network may be different in signal amplitude and/or spatial pattern between the awake and anesthetized states, and other potential neural contributions, such as those mediated by emotional or arousal changes, may only be present in the awake state. Such factors warrant further investigation in awake animal studies. Another potential pitfall is that the number of animals in the present study is limited, and the reported effects are dominated by the number of scans/imaging sessions, rather than the number of individual rats. However, as main results are highly reproducible across animals as demonstrated in Results, we believe this issue should not be a major concern.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The present study was approved by the Pennsylvania State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, protocol #: PRAMS201343583).

The rat was anesthetized with an injection of ketamine (40 mg/kg) and xylazine (12 mg/kg), and remained anesthetized throughout the surgery by 0.75% isoflurane delivered through an endotracheal catheter intubated (PhysioSuite, Kent Scientific Corporaition). Antibiotics baytril (2.5 mg/kg) and long-acting analgesic drug buprenorphine were intramuscularly administered. During surgery, the temperature was monitored and maintained by a warming pad (PhysioSuite, Kent Scientific Corporaition). Heart rate and SpO<sub>2</sub> were monitored with a pulse oximetry (MouseSTAT Jr, Kent Scientific Corporation). An MR-compatible electrode (MRCM16LP, NeuroNexus Inc) was unilaterally implanted into the ACC (coordinates: anterior/posterior +1.5, medial/lateral +0.5, dorsal/ventral −2.8). The reference wire and grounding wire from the electrode were both connected to a silver wire placed in the cerebellum. After surgery, the animal was returned to the home cage and allowed to recover for at least 1 week.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Simultaneous rsfMRI, respiration, and electrophysiology recordings</title><p>rsfMRI experiments were performed on a 7T Bruker 70/30 BioSpec running ParaVision 6.0.1 (Bruker, Billerica, MA) with a homemade single loop surface coil at the high-field MRI facility at the Pennsylvania State University. T2*-weighted gradient-echo rsfMRI images were acquired using an echo planar imaging sequence with following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 1 s; echo time (TE) = 15 ms; matrix size = 64 × 64; field of view = 3.2 × 3.2 cm<sup>2</sup>; slice number = 20; slice thickness = 1 mm; volume number = 1200. T2-weighted structural images were also obtained using a rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence with the following parameters: TR = 3000 ms; TE = 40 ms; matrix size = 256 × 256; field of view = 3.2 × 3.2 cm<sup>2</sup>; slice number = 20; slice thickness = 1 mm; repetition number = 6.</p><p>During imaging, the animal was maintained in one of two anesthetized states: light sedation and isoelectric state. For imaging sessions under light sedation, animals were anesthetized with the combination of dexmedetomidine (initial bolus of 0.05 mg/kg followed by constant infusion at 0.1 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> hr<sup>−1</sup>) and isoflurane (0.3%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grandjean et al., 2014</xref>), and spontaneous respiration was maintained in animals. For imaging sessions under the isoelectric state, sodium pentobarbital was administered with a 30 mg/kg bolus followed by continuous infusion (70 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> hr<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Du et al., 2008</xref>). Before imaging, the rat was intubated via tracheal, and the respiration was controlled by a ventilator (PhysioSuite, Kent Scientific Corporaition) throughout the entire imaging session. Three rats were in the light sedation group with a total of 51 scans and four rats were in the isoelectric state group with a total of 48 scans. During all imaging sessions, the temperature was measured by a rectal thermometer and maintained at 37°C with warm air. Eyes of the animal were protected from dryness using artificial tear.</p><p>During rsfMRI acquisition, the respiration signal was simultaneously recorded at the sampling rate of 225 Hz by a respiration sensor placed under the animal’s chest. Electrophysiology recording started 10 min before the beginning of rsfMRI acquisition and continued throughout the whole imaging session using a TDT recording system including an MR-compatible LP16CH headstage, PZ5 neurodigitizer amplifier, RZ2 BioAmp Processor and WS8 workstation (Tucker Davis Technologies Inc, Alachua, FL). The electrophysiology signal was sampled at 24,414 Hz and the unfiltered raw signal was used for further data processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data preprocessing</title><p>rsfMRI data were preprocessed using a pipeline described in our previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tu et al., 2021b</xref>). Briefly, rsfMRI images were first motion scrubbed based on relative framewise displacement (FD). Volumes with FD &gt;0.25 mm and their adjacent preceding and following volumes were removed. Subsequently, data were preprocessed by performing motion correction (SPM12), co-registration to a defined atlas, spatial smoothing, as well as voxel-wise nuisance regression of motion parameters and the signals of the white matter and ventricles.</p><p>Electrophysiology data were preprocessed to remove MR artifacts using a template regression method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). Specifically, raw electrophysiology signal was first temporally aligned with the corresponding rsfMRI scan. The potential phase differences across 16 electrophysiology channels were corrected by calculating cross-correlations of electrophysiology time series between channels, and the corrected signals from all 16 channels were summed. This summed signal was then segmented for each individual rsfMRI slice acquisition. Subsequently, an MRI interference template for each fMRI slice was estimated by averaging raw electrophysiology data across all segments corresponding the same slice acquisition from all rsfMRI volumes. The template was then aligned to each slice acquisition using cross-correlation. The final templates of all slices were linearly regressed out from the raw electrophysiology data to remove MR-induced artifacts, followed by a series of notch filters for harmonics of the power supply (60 Hz and multiples of 60 Hz) and slice acquisition (20 Hz and multiples of 20 Hz). Lastly, the continuous LFP was bandpass filtered (0.1–300 Hz). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> shows an example of raw electrophysiology signals before denoising of MRI artifacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), an example of the MRI artifact template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), as well as the LFP signal after MRI artifact denoising (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>The LFP spectrogram was computed using the MATLAB function <italic>spectrogram</italic> with window size = 1 s, step size = 0.1 s, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>To determine the relationship between slow variations of respiration and the rsfMRI signal, Pearson correlation was voxel-wise calculated between the rsfMRI signal and RVT, which was calculated by the difference between consecutive peaks of inspiration and expiration divided by the time interval between the two peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birn et al., 2006</xref>).

Sinusoids were constructed based on TR relative to the phase of the respiratory cycles. For each brain voxel, the predicted fast respiration regressor was estimated by the linear combination of sinusoids that best fits to the voxel time series.</p><p>The phase-locking relationship between the respiratory rhythm and the LFP oscillations was determined by calculating the magnitude squared coherence between the two signals. We also assessed the relationship between the frequency band-specific power of the LFP signal and slow variations of respiration. LFP band power was obtained using the MATLAB function <italic>spectrogram</italic> with window size = 1 s, step size = 0.1 s based on the conventional LFP band definition from previous studies (delta: 1–4 Hz, theta: 4–7 Hz, alpha: 7–13 Hz, beta: 13–30 Hz, gamma: 40–100 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Magri et al., 2012</xref>).

I find it compelling, and I do not wish to burden the authors with additional work that may only remotely nuance their excellent work.</p><p>If anything, I am not sure the statement below (and other similar later in the discussion) are sufficiently substantiated. Γ oscillations are correlated with respiration in this study. Other tests to further establish causality would be required, such as comparing spontaneous vs mechanical respiration. Personally, I can think of other mechanisms to explain the results, such as predictive encoding of respiration-associated outputs in the cingulate area.</p><p>&quot;These results suggest that respiration can drive γ oscillations, which further lead to BOLD signal changes in the respiration network&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The sample size is small -- the study hasn't been pre-registered nor has a formal sample size calculation been provided. This does mean that a number of analyses could have been tried before coming out with this result. With calls for ever increasing numbers of participants in human studies, a sample size of 7 seems difficult to justify.</p><p>2) Stronger justification for the use of the ACC as electrode location is essential. The Liotti paper gave CO2 inhalation to healthy humans and reported which areas of the brain showed increased cerebral blood flow, but interpreted the findings in the context of breathlessness. There is a lot more recent work from a range of laboratories done in a much more controlled manner that would justify better the use of the ACC as a component of the respiratory network. There are other areas consistently identified in respiration (e.g. anterior insula, prefrontal cortex etc) that could have been chosen so it's important here not to make the conclusions too ACC specific (in the most part the authors have done this)</p><p>3) The effects of anaesthesia are, in my view, a major potential confound. In addition to direct effects on BOLD responsiveness, isoflurane, pentobarbital and (particularly) buprenorphine will depress respiration, raising arterial CO2 and dampening BOLD responsiveness. Ketamine may stimulate respiration doing the opposite. Interaction effects between the different drugs are highly likely and difficult to predict how they would affect BOLD responses.</p><p>4) Why was RVT used as the measure of minute ventilation when it would have been possible to take direct measures of breathing via the endotracheal tube? This would be considerably more accurate.</p><p>5) Novelty – with such a small sample size it's difficult to know what is truly new. For example Alexander Green's group in Oxford report EEG changes (in α band) in patients with deep brain stimulator electrodes during various respiratory manoeuvres. Of course those studies are also limited by small sample size and diseased patients so comparison is difficult.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) As mentioned in the public review, the statistics of RVT in the isoelectric condition are not reported (unless I have missed it), so it is not clear whether the corresponding decrease in correlation with fMRI could be due to reduced temporal variation in RVT. I would therefore recommend reporting the magnitude of respiratory volume and rate variation and the RVT power spectrum, comparing both the light anesthesia and isoelectric states, in order to determine if this is the case. If RVT is indeed found to be less variable in this condition, it would strengthen the study if the authors are able to perform additional experiments that induce variations in breathing (if that is a possibility).</p><p>2) Relatedly, further support could be provided if the authors observe that the isoelectric state selectively disrupts the potential neuronal component (instantaneous fMRI correlation with RVT), but preserves the non-neural CO2 effect on BOLD (assessed by convolving RVT with the respiration response function).</p><p>3) To my understanding, RVT was correlated with fMRI at zero time-lag. However, when γ power was correlated with fMRI, it was first convolved with a standard hemodynamic response function. It was not clear to me why RVT was also not convolved with a hemodynamic response function to assess potential neural correlations with fMRI, especially given that it has highest coherence with the γ power signal at zero phase lag.</p><p>4) It is shown that the fMRI spatial maps that correlate with ACC γ power resemble the maps of the seed-based correlation from the ACC fMRI signal. For completeness, it would be useful to also report the temporal correlation between the fMRI and γ power signals measured in the ACC.</p><p>5) It is mentioned on p.2, line 85, that anesthesia was used to ensure that results are not confounded by motion. Though animals were only lightly sedated, it would be helpful to explain in the discussion whether this level of anesthesia might also impact fMRI and/or electrophysiological signals, to help readers better interpret the findings.</p><p>6) One analysis supporting the possible neural origin of RVT correlation in fMRI data is that regressing out neural (γ-band LFP) signals reduced the correlation between RVT and fMRI. This is indeed promising, though I suppose that if there are any non-neural hemodynamic effects of respiration on brain vasculature closer to zero lag (and which therefore also correlate with γ LFP), these would also be reduced when regressing out γ LFP. It would be helpful to include a discussion of whether any non-neural hemodynamic effects in fMRI could occur at zero lag.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Neural underpinning of a respiration-associated resting-state fMRI network&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>In the Response to Reviewers, the authors present arguments that their anaesthesia protocol has minimal disruption on neurovascular coupling. Unfortunately, though, this does not come through in the discussion added to the paper itself, which focuses on respiration-LFP coupling. Given that the effects of anaesthesia on neurovascular coupling were very specifically raised by Reviewers 2 and 3 (and will be shared by many readers), please add a brief discussion along the lines of the response to Reviewer 2 Comment 3.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81555.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Tempering of language purporting to establish a causal relationship between respiration and the observed γ oscillations.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate and agree with this suggestion.

[In consultation between the reviewers, it has been pointed out that the reported effects are based on statistical tests driven by the number of timepoints, rather than the number of individual rodents.]</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s comment is well accepted. We completely acknowledge that the number of animals in the present study is limited, and the reported effects are dominated by the number of scans/imaging sessions, rather than the number of individual rats. In our revised manuscript, we added statements to discuss this issue.</p><p>We would like to further clarify that the number of animals used was based on the conventional sample size of electrophysiology-fMRI experiments, typically in the range of 5-10 animals <sup>1-5</sup> (7 animals in our study). In electrophysiology recordings, a large number of data points are collected and the results are generally reproducible across animals. To compensate for lower sensitivity/higher variability of fMRI data, unlike conventional fMRI studies, here in each animal we acquired a great number of scans on separate days (total scan number = 99, ~14 scans per animal, 1200 fMRI volumes per scan, 51 scans at the light sedation state and 48 scans at the isoelectric state). This method can significantly reduce the variability of results obtained from individual animals. Below are four figures we added to the revised manuscript demonstrating major results from individual animals. Indeed, all major findings are reproducible across animals, and therefore, we believe this method can significantly mitigate the issue of the small sample size of animals in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Discussion of the potential effects of anaesthesia on the study conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. In the revised manuscript, we added a paragraph to discuss the potential effects of anesthesia on our results, quoted below.</p><p>“In the current study, we performed the experiment in lightly sedated animals to ensure the results were not confounded by the animal’s motion. Animals’ motion, particularly respiration-correlated motion, can induce systematic variation in the rsfMRI signal that potentially leads to an artefactual correlation pattern. Such a correlation pattern is difficult to be parceled out in our respiration-associated brain network. However, it has to be recognized that anesthesia might be a potential confounder by itself, as it may affect the respiration, as well as respiration-induced neural and vascular activities. For instance, anesthetics can reduce the respiration rate and affect LFP by increasing the low frequency power and decreasing the high frequency power <sup>6-8</sup>. However, previous studies have demonstrated that similar respiration-coupled LFP oscillations were observed in both anesthetized and awake states <sup>9-11</sup>. As the relationship between respiration and neural activity is preserved under anesthesia, our results obtained in anesthetized rats should remain valid. It has to be noted that the neural contributions in the respiration-related network may be different in signal amplitude and/or spatial pattern between the awake and anesthetized states, and other potential neural contributions, such as those mediated by emotional or arousal changes, may only be present in the awake state. Such factors warrant further investigation in awake animal studies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Placing results in the context of related human studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We added more discussions of our results in the context of related human studies, quoted below.</p><p>“The findings in the present study to a large extent echo the results reported in human studies. Previous research demonstrated bidirectional interplay between respiration and neural activity in humans. Neural activity in brainstem regions such as the preBötzinger complex directly controls the respiration<sup>12,13</sup>. In addition, respiration-induced LFP oscillations were observed in multiple human brain regions such as the piriform cortex and hippocampus<sup>14,15</sup>, consistent with our data. McKay and colleagues also found that voluntary hyperpnea was related to the neural activity of various brain regions including the primary sensory and motor cortices, supplementary motor area, caudate nucleus, and globus pallidum, which largely agree with the respiration-related brain network we identified in rats<sup>16</sup>. Importantly, respiration-mediated neural activity was found to modulate brain function. For example, respiration is shown to modulate visual perceptual sensitivity, mediated by α power<sup>17</sup>. Respiration is also the key component in mindfulness meditation, which has been repeatedly shown to have modulatory effects on brain function<sup>18</sup>. Furthermore, the coupling between neural activity and respiration may facilitate our understanding of brain disease. Hyam <italic>et al.</italic> stimulated the pedunculopontine region (PPNr) and observed improvement in upper airway function in Parkinson’s patients<sup>19</sup>. Loss of neurons in the preBötzinger complex was found to cause sleep-disordered breathing<sup>20</sup>. Taken together, those findings indicate that the respiration-related brain network might be conserved across species and represent a general phenomenon in the mammalian brain, and this brain network might play an important role in normal and diseased brain function.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Analysis of RVT estimates (variance) in the isoelectric state.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the suggestion. We calculated the respiration rate (Figure 5D) as well as the standard deviation (SD) and power spectrum of RVT across animals. We did not observe any significant difference in the SD of the respiration rate (Figure 5E, two-sample t-test, t = -1.0, p = 0.32) or the SD of RVT (Figure 5F, two-sample t-test, t = -0.87, p = 0.39) between the light-sedation and isoelectric states, suggesting that the temporal variance of respiration is similar between the two states. Interestingly, we observed a characteristic 1/f pattern in the RVT power during light sedation, but this pattern was not present at the isoelectric state (Figure 5G). This difference is consistent to the ACC BOLD signal power spectra in the light-sedation and isoelectric states (Figure 5I). The new results and figure are added to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>As indicated in the public review, I don't find anything that is lacking in the study.

With calls for ever increasing numbers of participants in human studies, a sample size of 7 seems difficult to justify.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to the response to Comment 2 in the section of Essential revisions from Reviewing Editor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Stronger justification for the use of the ACC as electrode location is essential. The Liotti paper gave CO2 inhalation to healthy humans and reported which areas of the brain showed increased cerebral blood flow, but interpreted the findings in the context of breathlessness. There is a lot more recent work from a range of laboratories done in a much more controlled manner that would justify better the use of the ACC as a component of the respiratory network. There are other areas consistently identified in respiration (e.g. anterior insula, prefrontal cortex etc) that could have been chosen so it's important here not to make the conclusions too ACC specific (in the most part the authors have done this)</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we added more rationale and references from recent studies supporting the vital role of the ACC in the respiration network, quoted below.</p><p>“The ACC was selected given its critical role in respiratory modulation, evidenced by early studies showing that ACC was activated during breathlessness<sup>21,22</sup>. More recent research further demonstrates the role of ACC in respiratory control<sup>23-25</sup>. For example, electrophysiology recordings in humans showed that ACC exhibited different neural responses to separate respirational tasks including breath-holding, voluntary deep breathing and hypercapnia<sup>25</sup>. In addition, the ACC is a key region in the rodent default-mode network (DMN) <sup>26,27</sup>, which has been linked to respiration-related fMRI signal changes <sup>28</sup>.”</p><p>We completely agree with the reviewer that a number of other regions are also involved in the respiration network, and our results are indeed not ACC specific. In fact, the main finding of our paper is that we identified a network of brain regions whose neural activities are associated with respiration (also evident from the title), and ACC is one node of this network, through which the network is identified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The effects of anaesthesia are, in my view, a major potential confound. In addition to direct effects on BOLD responsiveness, isoflurane, pentobarbital and (particularly) buprenorphine will depress respiration, raising arterial CO2 and dampening BOLD responsiveness. Ketamine may stimulate respiration doing the opposite. Interaction effects between the different drugs are highly likely and difficult to predict how they would affect BOLD responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this valuable comment. Please refer to the response to Comment 3 in the section of Essential revisions from Reviewing Editor for our general response to the potential impact of anesthesia. Below are the more specific responses to the potential effects of different anesthetic drugs the reviewer mentioned.</p><p>First, we would like to clarify that we only used the combination of low-dose isoflurane and low-dose dexmedetomidine to induce the light sedation state in animals during simultaneous fMRI, electrophysiology and respiration recordings. Our rationale for choosing this anesthesia is as follows: isoflurane is a vasodilator, which can attenuate the BOLD signal <sup>29</sup>, whereas the dexmedetomidine is a vasoconstrictor, which can counteract the vasodilatory effect from isoflurane<sup>30</sup>. This type of anesthesia has been shown to minimize the confounding effects in the BOLD response and maintain the functional connectivity across both cortical and subcortical regions<sup>31,32</sup>. Pentobarbital was used in separate experiments to induce the isoelectric state. This control experiment allows us to determine the necessary role of neural activity in the respiration-related brain network identified in our study.</p><p>Ketamine and buprenorphine were not used in any experiment, but only used during the surgery for electrode implantation. The animals were allowed to recover for at least one week after surgery. The drugs should have been fully metabolized by the time of fMRI imaging, so effects from those drugs would not affect our results.</p><p>Overall, we agree with the reviewer that anesthesia is a potential confound. In the revised manuscript we have discussed this potential pitfall, quoted below.</p><p>“In the current study, we performed the experiment in lightly sedated animals to ensure the results were not confounded by the animal’s motion. Indeed, animals’ motion, particularly respiration-correlated motion, can induce systematic variation in the rsfMRI signal that potentially leads to an artefactual correlation pattern. Such a correlation pattern is difficult to be parceled out in our respiration-associated brain network. However, it has to be recognized that anesthesia might be a potential confounder by itself, as it may affect the respiration, as well as respiration-induced neural and vascular activities. For instance, anesthetics can reduce the respiration rate and affect local field potential by increasing the low-frequency power and decreasing the high-frequency power<sup>6-8</sup>. However, previous studies demonstrated that similar respiration-coupled LFP oscillations were observed in both anesthetized and awake states<sup>9-11</sup>. As the relationship between respiration and neural activity is preserved under anesthesia, our results obtained in anesthetized rats should remain valid. Notably, the neural contributions in the respiration-related network may be different in signal amplitude and/or spatial pattern between the awake and anesthetized states, and other potential neural contributions, mediated by emotional or arousal changes, are only present in awake state. Such factors warrant further investigation in future awake animal studies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Why was RVT used as the measure of minute ventilation when it would have been possible to take direct measures of breathing via the endotracheal tube? This would be considerably more accurate.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that respiration can also be measured via the endotracheal tube in animals that were ventilated in the isoelectric state. However, the respiration in animals during light sedation, which were not intubated, can only be measured using the respiration pads. As we need to maintain a consistent way to measure respiration across conditions for comparison, we used the respiration pad in our study. This method also provides an accurate measurement of respiration and RVT <sup>33,34</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Novelty – with such a small sample size it's difficult to know what is truly new. For example Alexander Green's group in Oxford report EEG changes (in α band) in patients with deep brain stimulator electrodes during various respiratory manoeuvres. Of course those studies are also limited by small sample size and diseased patients so comparison is difficult.</p></disp-quote><p>The major novelty of the present study is the finding of a network of brain regions whose neural activities are associated with respiration. We achieved this goal by simultaneously recording electrophysiology, whole-brain fMRI, and respiration signals. This is distinct from most other human (or animal) studies that only focused on the role of a (or a few) specific brain region(s). For instance, the study by Alexander Green's group mentioned by reviewer <sup>19</sup> found that stimulation of the pedunculopontine region (PPNr) improved upper airway function in parkinson’s disease patients. The α power in PPNr increased during forced respiratory maneuvers. Their study is important for understanding the potential role of neural activity of one region (PPNr) in respiration control, which is very different from our study.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we added the discussion for our results in relation to human studies, quoted below:</p><p>“The findings in the present study to a large extent echo the results reported in human studies. Previous research demonstrated bidirectional interplay between respiration and neural activity in humans. Neural activity in brainstem regions such as the preBötzinger complex directly controls the respiration<sup>12,13</sup>. In addition, respiration-induced LFP oscillation was observed in multiple human brain regions such as the piriform cortex and hippocampus<sup>14,15</sup>, which is consistent with our data. McKay and colleagues also found that voluntary hyperpnea was related to the neural activity of various brain regions including the primary sensory and motor cortices, supplementary motor area, caudate nucleus, and globus pallidum, which largely agreeing with the respiration-related brain network we identified in rats<sup>16</sup>. Importantly, respiration-mediated neural activity was found to modulate brain function. For example, respiration is shown to modulate visual perceptual sensitivity, mediated by α power<sup>17</sup>. Respiration is also the key component in mindfulness meditation, which has been repeatedly shown to have modulatory effects on brain function <sup>18</sup>. Furthermore, the coupling between neural activity and respiration may facilitate our understanding of brain disease. Hyam <italic>et al.</italic> stimulated the pedunculopontine region (PPNr) and observed improvement in upper airway function in Parkinson’s patients <sup>19</sup>. Loss of neurons in the preBötzinger complex was found to cause sleep-disordered breathing <sup>20</sup>. Taken together, those findings indicate that the respiration-related brain network might be conserved across species and represent a general phenomenon in the mammalian brain, and this brain network might play an important role in normal and diseased brain function.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) As mentioned in the public review, the statistics of RVT in the isoelectric condition are not reported (unless I have missed it), so it is not clear whether the corresponding decrease in correlation with fMRI could be due to reduced temporal variation in RVT. I would therefore recommend reporting the magnitude of respiratory volume and rate variation and the RVT power spectrum, comparing both the light anesthesia and isoelectric states, in order to determine if this is the case. If RVT is indeed found to be less variable in this condition, it would strengthen the study if the authors are able to perform additional experiments that induce variations in breathing (if that is a possibility).</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to the response to Comment 5 in the section of Essential Revisions from Reviewing Editor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Relatedly, further support could be provided if the authors observe that the isoelectric state selectively disrupts the potential neuronal component (instantaneous fMRI correlation with RVT), but preserves the non-neural CO2 effect on BOLD (assessed by convolving RVT with the respiration response function).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point. The non-neural CO2 effect on the BOLD signal in the isoelectric state, estimated by convolving RVT with the respiration response function and then voxel-wise correlating to the BOLD signal, appeared to be weaker than the light-sedation state (Figure 4 —figure supplement 3), as shown below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, left). This is likely attributed to the fact that the metabolic rate was much lower in the isoelectric state (approximately half) <sup>35</sup>, resulting in weaker fluctuations in the CO2 level during respiration, which can explain less appreciable CO2 effect on the BOLD signal in the isoelectric state. However, statistical comparison of the respiration artifactual pattern between the light-sedation and isoelectric states did not reveal any significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, middle, t-test, threshold p = 0.05, FDR corrected), in sharp contrast to the statistical comparison of the respiration network pattern between the light-sedation and isoelectric states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, right, t-test, p &lt; 0.05, FDR corrected). These data indicate that the artefactual effects of respiration were more or less similar between the two states, but the respiration-related brain network activity was substantially suppressed at the isoelectric state.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Left, voxel-wise correlations between the estimated time course of respirational artifact, estimated by convolving RVT with the respiration response function, and rsfMRI signals at the isoelectric state.</title><p>The same artifactual pattern during light sedation is shown in Figure 4 —figure supplement 3.

However, when γ power was correlated with fMRI, it was first convolved with a standard hemodynamic response function. It was not clear to me why RVT was also not convolved with a hemodynamic response function to assess potential neural correlations with fMRI, especially given that it has highest coherence with the γ power signal at zero phase lag.</p></disp-quote><p>The hemodynamic response function (HRF) referred herein by definition represents the transfer function between neural activity and fMRI signal. It is effectively a low-pass filter that transfers fast neural activity to slower fMRI signal. Because HRF is not the transfer function between RVT and fMRI signal, it would not be appropriate to convolve RVT with HRF. In fact, as the RVT itself represents low-frequency fluctuations of respiration (the peak coherence between RVT and γ power is at a low frequency (0.035Hz)), convolving RVT with HRF should not significantly alter the RVT waveform. Indeed, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> we show the voxel-wise correlation pattern between rsfMRI signal and the time course after convolving RVT with HRF. The pattern is very similar to the RVT-rsfMRI correlation pattern we obtained (Figure 4B).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Voxel-wise correlations between rsfMRI signals and the time course obtained by convolving RVT with HRF.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81555-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is shown that the fMRI spatial maps that correlate with ACC γ power resemble the maps of the seed-based correlation from the ACC fMRI signal. For completeness, it would be useful to also report the temporal correlation between the fMRI and γ power signals measured in the ACC.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion, we have reported the correlation between fMRI signal of ACC and γ power (r = 0.086, p = 0.003) in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is mentioned on p.2, line 85, that anesthesia was used to ensure that results are not confounded by motion. Though animals were only lightly sedated, it would be helpful to explain in the discussion whether this level of anesthesia might also impact fMRI and/or electrophysiological signals, to help readers better interpret the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our response to Comment 3 in the section of Essential Revisions from Reviewing Editor, as well as our response to Comment 3 for Reviewer #2 for the issue of the potential impact of anesthesia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) One analysis supporting the possible neural origin of RVT correlation in fMRI data is that regressing out neural (γ-band LFP) signals reduced the correlation between RVT and fMRI. This is indeed promising, though I suppose that if there are any non-neural hemodynamic effects of respiration on brain vasculature closer to zero lag (and which therefore also correlate with γ LFP), these would also be reduced when regressing out γ LFP. It would be helpful to include a discussion of whether any non-neural hemodynamic effects in fMRI could occur at zero lag.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. Although we cannot think of any non-neural hemodynamic effects of respiration on the rsfMRI signal that could occur at zero lag, we do agree with the reviewer that regressing out γ LFP will reduce these effects. We have discussed this possibility in our revised manuscript, quoted below.</p><p>“This notion is further supported by our data that regressing out γ-band LFP signals tremendously reduced the correlation between RVT and fMRI (Figure 4D-E), although it is still possible that if there are non-neural hemodynamic effects of respiration on the rsfMRI signal that occur at zero lag (i.e. a non-neural hemodynamic factor that are synchronized with γ LFP), regressing out γ LFP could also reduce these effects.”</p><p>References</p><p>1.
