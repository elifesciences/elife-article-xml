The chemoreceptor cluster, a core component of the chemotaxis pathway, is assembled from hundreds of proteins. The unipolar distribution of receptor clusters has long been recognized, yet the precise mechanism governing their assembly remains elusive. Here, we directly observed the relative positions of the flagellar motor and chemoreceptor cluster using flagellar filament labeling and gene editing techniques. Surprisingly, we found that both are located at the same cell pole, with the distribution pattern controlled by the polar anchor protein FlhF. Additionally, the efficient assembly of the chemoreceptor cluster is partially dependent on the integrity of the motor structure. Furthermore, we discovered that overexpression of the chemotaxis regulatory protein CheY leads to high intracellular levels of the second messenger c-di-GMP, triggering cell aggregation. Therefore, the colocalization of the chemoreceptor cluster and flagellum in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> serves to avoid cross-pathway signaling interference, enabling cells to conduct various physiological activities in an orderly manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic></kwd><kwd>chemotaxis</kwd><kwd>flagellar

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In biological systems, the process by which proteins self-assemble into organized complex structures is widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Halatek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thanbichler and Shapiro, 2008</xref>). Pole-to-pole protein oscillations in the <italic>Min</italic> system ensure that the FtsZ ring, a crucial component of cell division, is placed precisely in the middle of the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Loose et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rothfield et al., 2005</xref>). In response to antibiotic treatment and heat stress, some bacteria generate multiple protein foci throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fay and Glickman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vaubourgeix et al., 2015</xref>). The polar localization of the secretion system, such as the type VI secretion system, is mediated by targeting proteins and potentially facilitates host-pathogen interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Low et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, spontaneous assembly is accompanied by the formation of spatial patterns that organize the intracellular environment.</p><p>To grow and colonize in various ecological niches, bacteria have evolved a mechanism for migrating towards more favorable environments. The locomotion organ (the flagellar motor) and the chemotaxis pathway play crucial roles in achieving this goal. The former provides physical drive, while the latter offers directional guidance. The initiation of cell reorientation is controlled by motor switching, which is governed by the chemotaxis two-component signaling pathway. This pathway comprises transmembrane chemoreceptors, a histidine kinase CheA, an adaptor protein CheW, a response regulator CheY, and two adaptation proteins, CheB and CheR. Receptors collaborate with CheA and CheW to form a chemotaxis complex in a hexagonal pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briegel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Upon phosphorylation of CheY by the kinase at the complex, it freely diffuses to the motor and binds to FliM, a component of the motor switch complex, to affect motor switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cluzel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sourjik and Berg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Welch et al., 1993</xref>). It is worth noting that there exists diversity among different bacterial species in the placement of flagellar motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schuhmacher et al., 2015</xref>), whereas chemoreceptor clusters are typically found at one or both ends of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones and Armitage, 2015</xref>). These two structural units are functionally connected. However, it remains unclear whether there is an interaction in their spatial distribution and what the specific regulatory mechanism might be.</p><p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, a common human opportunistic pathogen, possesses four chemosensory pathways that perform distinct functions and are stimulated by signal binding to 26 chemoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matilla et al., 2021</xref>). Among them, the proteins encoded by chemotaxis-related genes collectively constitute the F6 pathway. Previous studies have suggested that the receptors involved in this pathway localize to the old cell pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Güvener et al., 2006</xref>), similar to the flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amako and Umeda, 1982</xref>), implying colocalization of the receptors and the flagellum at the same pole; however, direct evidence for this colocalization is still lacking. Furthermore, the polar anchor protein FlhF has been reported to guide the flagellum to grow at the cell pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schniederberend et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murray and Kazmierczak, 2006</xref>). However, the mechanism by which chemotaxis complex-related proteins aggregate and self-assemble at the cell pole is controversial. The distribution of the chemotaxis complex in the peritrichous bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> has been extensively studied and attributed to several mechanisms, including stochastic self-assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Greenfield et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thiem and Sourjik, 2008</xref>), membrane curvature sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strahl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Draper and Liphardt, 2017</xref>), and inefficient clustering in the lateral region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koler et al., 2018</xref>). However, these mechanisms cannot explain the unipolar distribution pattern observed in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Unlike <italic>E. coli</italic>, specific genes responsible for the placement of the chemotaxis complex have been identified in several bacterial species. In <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, chemotaxis complex assembles at the new cell pole with the help of TipN and TipF proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huitema et al., 2006</xref>). A tripartite ParC-ParP-CheA interaction network was reported to promote polar localization of chemotaxis complex in <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ringgaard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ringgaard et al., 2014</xref>). However, as there are no related genes in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, the mechanism of its chemotaxis complex distribution remains a mystery.</p><p>Here, we combined gene editing and in vivo fluorescence imaging of flagellar filaments to directly observe the distribution of chemotaxis complex and flagellar motors, proposing a cooperative construction model of chemotaxis network and flagella during the entire division cycle of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The core focus of this study is to clarify the regulatory mechanism of its chemotaxis complex distribution. We found a substantial association between the assembly of the flagellar motor and the chemotaxis complex. The assembly efficiency of the receptor complex is influenced by core flagellar motor components, particularly the C-ring and MS-ring structures, while its assembly site is also affected by the polar anchor protein FlhF. Furthermore, by introducing exogenously expressed CheY protein, we found that this triggers the expression of c-di-GMP at a high level. From this, we infer that the colocalization of the chemotaxis complex and the flagellum in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> avoids the cross-pathway interference of signaling molecules, thus providing a guarantee for the coexistence of multiple chemosensory pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Robust generation of daughter cell with both chemotaxis network and flagellar motor</title><p>CheY has been shown to colocalize with chemoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Güvener et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sourjik and Berg, 2000</xref>). To visualize the distribution of chemotaxis complex in cells, we fused the gene encoding the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) to the <italic>cheY</italic> gene in the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All genetic modifications were carried out at the native position on the chromosome, allowing the expression of chemotaxis proteins in precise stoichiometry from their natural promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The mutant strain with <italic>cheY-eyfp</italic> was able to moderately expand on soft agar plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Güvener et al., 2006</xref>), proving that its chemotaxis behavior was not notably affected, so it was selected for subsequent experiments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, CheY-eYFP was mainly located at the cell pole, suggesting that CheA, CheW, and CheY in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> form a signal transduction complex that was primarily distributed at the cell pole, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Güvener et al., 2006</xref>). Representative large-field images containing many cells are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. Additionally, we constructed a plasmid expressing CheA-CFP and electroporated it into the <italic>cheY-eyfp</italic> strain. Fluorescence imaging revealed a high degree of spatial overlap between CheA-CFP and CheY-EYFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), confirming that CheY-EYFP accurately marks the location of the chemoreceptor complex. From our measurements, nearly 90% (332/372) of cells contain obvious receptor clusters, and factors such as fluorescence bleaching may have caused the loss of fluorescent spots in some cells. In addition, we observed the presence of fluorescent spots at both ends of some cells with a large aspect ratio (probably approaching cell division), indicating that the newly generated progeny cells will have a complete chemotaxis network. Next, we sought to observe the distribution of the flagella in cells simultaneously to understand the motility of future progeny.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spatial distribution of the chemotaxis complex and flagellar motor in wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic></title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the chemotaxis signal transduction network and flagellar motor of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.

The two ends of the length accounted for 10% each, which we called the precise-polar domains, the middle 50% became the mid-cell domain, and the rest was called the near-polar domain.

This structure includes multiple components such as the inner-membrane MS ring, the cytoplasmic C ring, and the internal protein secretion system, all of which exhibit strong similarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Minamino and Imada, 2015</xref>). This suggests that the core structure of the flagellar motor is highly conserved. The MS ring, composed of 26 FliF proteins, forms the foundation of the flagellar structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Suzuki et al., 2004</xref>). In addition to serving as a mounting platform for the C ring, the MS ring also acts as a protective shell for the internal protein secretion machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Minamino et al., 2008</xref>). FliG, the main component protein of the C ring, binds directly to the cytoplasmic surface of FliF in a 1:1 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levenson et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the efficient assembly of the C ring requires preassembly of the MS ring. To observe the distribution of the chemotaxis complex following the disruption of the C ring and MS ring, we constructed Δ<italic>fliG</italic> and Δ<italic>fliF</italic> mutants.</p><p>We performed fluorescence observation on the Δ<italic>fliG</italic> mutant, which has a disrupted flagellar motor C ring. The results showed that the proportion of Δ<italic>fliG</italic> cells with obvious chemoreceptor clusters decreased significantly compared to the wild-type cells (59.8%, 140/234), although the chemotaxis complex remained at a single cell pole. We also examined the Δ<italic>fliF</italic> mutant, which has a disrupted flagellar motor MS ring. Similar to the Δ<italic>fliG</italic> mutant, the proportion of individuals with obvious chemotaxis complex decreased significantly (62.5%, 202/323). Subsequently, we constructed a Δ<italic>flhF</italic>Δ<italic>fliF</italic> mutant and observed that the proportion of individuals with obvious chemoreceptor clusters further decreased (50.7%, 341/672). To ascertain whether it is motor integrity rather than functionality that influences the efficiency of chemotaxis complex assembly, we constructed a stator mutant (Δ<italic>motA</italic>Δ<italic>motCD</italic>). In this mutant, the motor is completely stalled while the structure remains intact. We found that the mutant performed similarly to the wild-type strain in terms of chemotaxis complex assembly (84.3% of individuals with obvious clusters, 204/242). The fluorescence imaging of receptor clusters for multiple mutants in this section is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, and corresponding large-field images are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. We utilized Western blotting to measure the expression levels of CheY, which were found to be similar across the different strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These further substantiated that the observed phenomenon is based on the structural integrity of the motor rather than the protein expression level. In contrast, the <italic>cheA</italic> knockout strain was constructed to disrupt the assembly of the chemoreceptor complex. We fluorescently labeled its flagellar filaments and found that its phenotype was no different from that of the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the assembly of the chemotactic receptor complex does not affect the flagellar assembly efficiency.

This spatial arrangement effectively confines high CheY-P levels to the pole region. When the motor is also localized at the cell pole, the need for elevated CheY-P concentrations throughout the cytoplasm is reduced. Therefore, the colocalization of chemotaxis complex and flagellar motor facilitates the precise regulation of cell swimming direction within the low intracellular CheY-P concentration threshold, using locally distributed CheY-P molecules. This helps to avoid the occurrence of the aforementioned cross-pathway interference.

A similar active regulation phenomenon was previously reported in <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, with the corresponding molecular regulation mechanism detailed extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ringgaard et al., 2014</xref>). The flagella and chemotaxis complex of newborn <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cells are located at the old cell pole, with the polar anchor protein HubP distributed at both cell poles. As the cell grows, HubP recruits the ParA homologue ParC. Subsequently, ParC recruits ParP to assemble a new chemotaxis complex at the new cell pole. Upon cell division, HubP relocates to the middle of the cell, ensuring its robust presences at both poles of the daughter cells. Here, HubP recruits ParA homologues, including FlhG, which influence flagellar motor assembly. However, previous experiments confirmed that the cell cycle-dependent polar localization of ParC and chemotactic proteins is independent of the flagellar position regulatory protein FlhF. This suggests that the localization of flagellar motors and chemotaxis complex in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is controlled separately through different pathways. In contrast, flagellar motors were no longer robustly distributed at the cell pole after <italic>flhF</italic> was knocked out in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, whereas the assembly site of chemotaxis complex and flagellar motor remained remarkably consistent. This suggests that FlhF regulates the distribution patterns of both and implies an interaction between them.</p><p>We further constructed Δ<italic>fliG</italic> and Δ<italic>fliF</italic> mutants, which disrupted the assembly of the flagellar motor. Surprisingly, we observed that the assembly of chemotaxis complex was impaired under these conditions, with a significant decrease in the proportion of individuals exhibiting obvious Che protein fluorescent bright spots. In contrast, the chemotaxis complex assembly in the stator mutant (Δ<italic>motA</italic>Δ<italic>motCD</italic>) was similar to that of the wild-type strain. It should be noted that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> has a four-tiered transcriptional regulatory circuit controlling flagellar biogenesis, in which FliG and FliF belong to class II and are regulated by the master transcriptional regulator FleQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dasgupta et al., 2003</xref>). Chemotaxis complex-related genes (<italic>cheA</italic>, <italic>cheW</italic>, etc.) are regulated by intracellular free FliA proteins. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, FliA is bound and inhibited by FlgM, and upon hook assembly, FlgM is secreted outside the cell, allowing FliA to trigger transcription of class III genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chilcott and Hughes, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beeby et al., 2020</xref>), which include the chemosensory genes. This implies that if the hook is not assembled, late genes (including chemoreceptors) should not be expressed. However, Kaplan et al. reported that chemotaxis complexes were observed in <italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic> Δ<italic>fliF</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaplan et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting a different assembly process from that of <italic>E. coli</italic>.

Since most experiments in this study focused on CheY, we performed Western blotting to measure CheY expression levels in wild-type, Δ<italic>fliF</italic> and Δ<italic>fliG</italic> strains, and found no significant differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These results suggest that the observed decrease in the proportion of chemotaxis complexes after knocking out <italic>fliF</italic> and <italic>fliG</italic> should be attributed to the lack of motor assembly rather than changes in Che protein expression levels. To eliminate the potential confounding effects of FlhF and flagellar motors, we constructed a Δ<italic>flhF</italic>Δ<italic>fliF</italic> mutant strain. Under this condition, the proportion of individuals with obvious Che protein fluorescent bright spots dropped to ~50%, indicating that passive regulation based on membrane curvature may still exist in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, albeit to a lesser degree.</p><p>Is the remarkable consistency in the spatial distribution of these two independent structural units an unintentional outcome or a hidden mystery? Given that Kulasekara et al. previously proposed that CheA and its phosphorylation state can cause c-di-GMP heterogeneity among individual <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells through a specific PDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kulasekara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kulasekara, 2013</xref>), we sought to verify whether the phenotypic differences induced by CheY here are closely related to changes in the overall population level of c-di-GMP. We introduced a c-di-GMP monitoring system at the single-cell level and discovered that overexpression of CheY substantially increases the intracellular c-di-GMP concentration. Previous studies generally believed that CheY-P, as a chemotactic regulatory protein, only influences flagellar motor switching. Here, we found that CheY-P, as a signaling molecule, can accomplish threshold-limited cross-pathway regulation. At low CheY-P concentrations, it is conservatively involved in motor switching regulation, as confirmed by previous studies. At high CheY-P concentrations, cell motility is suppressed, and c-di-GMP is triggered to express, though its specific mechanism needs further exploration. Unlike CheA, a structural protein of the chemotaxis complex, CheY is a protein that can shuttle in the cytoplasm and can also regulate the intracellular c-di-GMP level. This finding expands our understanding of the connection between the internal chemotaxis network and the c-di-GMP pathway. The intracellular environment is highly crowded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>), and the proximal growth pattern shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> has multiple physiological significances. On one hand, chemotaxis-related proteins can precisely regulate cell motility with minimal synthesis costs. On the other hand, the chemotactic network and the flagellar motor are spatially integrated within the cell, ensuring their robust existence within the cell body and preventing mutual interference with collateral pathways.</p><p>Many bacteria possess multiple signal transduction pathways. The orderly operation of each pathway within the micrometer-scale space presents a fascinating scientific problem. Here, we utilized the well-known chemotaxis network as a starting point to shed light on this problem, providing inspiration for future in-depth understanding of related issues.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and cell culture</title><p>The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

The final pellet was adjusted to a volume of ~100 µl that concentrated the bacterial 10-fold. Alexa Fluor 568 maleimide (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) was added to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml, and labeling was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature with gyration at 80 rpm. Unused dye was then removed by washing the cells with MB three times, and the final pellet was resuspended in MB.</p><p>For fluorescence imaging, 50 μl of cells were added to the chamber (constructed with two double-sticky tapes, a glass slide, and a poly-L-Lysine coated-coverslip), incubated for 3 min, and rinsed with 100 μl MB. The boundary of the chamber was then sealed with Apiezon vacuum grease. The chamber was placed on a Nikon Ti-E inverted fluorescence microscope with a 100× oil-immersion objective and a sCMOS camera (Primer95B, Photometrics). The flagellar filament and chemotaxis complex of cells were observed separately with corresponding filter set, using a 200 ms exposure time.

The exact amount of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was blocked with 50 mg/mL skim milk in TBST buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl [pH 7.4], 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 hr at room temperature. Since the N-terminal sequence of EYFP is almost identical to that of GFP, a rabbit anti-GFP antibody (1:2000, Yeasen Biotechnology Co., Ltd) and a mouse anti-β-actin antibody (1:2000, Invitrogen) were added and incubated at 4 °C overnight.

The average fluorescence intensity of a single cell was calculated by dividing the total fluorescence intensity of a single cell by the cell volume. Bacteria were simplified to a hollow cylindrical trunk with hollow hemispherical caps at both ends. The cell volume can be calculated by taking the length of the short axis of the cell body as the diameter of the sphere and the length of the long axis as the sum of the height of the cylinder and the diameter of the sphere.

They discovered that a certain protein (FlhF) is required for the polar localization of the chemosensory cluster while core motor structures are necessary for the assembly of the cluster. They found that flagella and chemosensory clusters always co-localize in the cell; either at the cell pole in wild type cells or randomly-located in the cell in FlhF mutant cells. They hypothesize that this co-localization is required to keep the level of another protein (CheY-P), which controls motor switching, at low levels as the presence of high-levels of this protein (if the flagella and chemosensory clusters were not co-localized) is associated with high-levels of c-di-GMP and cell aggregations.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript is clearly-written and straightforward. The authors applied multiple techniques to study the bacterial motility system including fluorescence light microscopy and gene editing. In general, the work enhances our understanding of the subtlety of interaction between the chemosensory cluster and the flagellar motor to regulate cell motility.

Based mainly on fluorescence microscopy images, the authors aim to demonstrate that the two structures that account for bacterial motility, the chemotaxis complex and the flagella, colocalize to the same pole in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> cells and to expose the regulation underlying their spatial organization and functioning.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have addressed all major and minor points that I raised in a satisfying way during the revision process. The work can now be regarded as complete, the assumptions were clarified, the results are convincing, the conclusions are justified, and the novelty has been made clear.</p><p>This manuscript will be of interest to cell biologists, mainly those studying bacteria, but not only.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Here, the authors studied the molecular mechanisms by which the chemoreceptor cluster and flagella motor of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (PA) are spatially organized in the cell. They argue that FlhF is involved in localizing the receptors-motor to the cell pole, and even without FlhF, the two are colocalized. Finally, the authors argue that the functional reason for this colocalization is to insulate chemotactic signaling from other signaling pathways, such as cyclic-di-GMP signaling.</p><p>Strength:</p><p>The experiments and data are high quality. It is clear that the motor and receptors co-localize, and that elevated CheY levels lead to elevated c-di-GMP.</p><p>Weakness:</p><p>The explanation for the functional importance of receptor-motor colocalization is plausible but is still not conclusively demonstrated. Colocalization might reduce CheY levels throughout the cell in order to reduce cross-talk with c-di-GMP. This would mean that if physiologically-relevant levels of CheYp near the pole were present throughout the cell, c-di-GMP levels would be elevated to a point that is problematic for the cell. Clearly demonstrating this seems challenging.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that directly proving the necessity of colocalization to prevent problematic c-di-GMP elevation is experimentally challenging, as it would require creating a system where CheY-P is artificially distributed throughout the cell at physiologically relevant concentrations while maintaining normal chemotaxis function.</p><p>However, our data provide several lines of evidence supporting this model. First, we show that CheY overexpression leads to substantial c-di-GMP elevation (71.8% increase) and cell aggregation, demonstrating that elevated CheY levels can indeed cause problematic cross-pathway interference. Second, previous work has shown that CheY-P levels near the pole are an order of magnitude higher than in the rest of the cell (ref. 46). If this elevated CheY-P concentration near the pole were present throughout the cell, our data suggest that c-di-GMP levels would be elevated sufficiently to cause cell aggregation (Fig. 4A), thereby disabling normal motility and chemotaxis. Third, the dose-dependent relationship between CheY concentration and aggregation phenotype supports the idea that precise spatial regulation of CheY levels is functionally important for avoiding cross-pathway interference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors investigated the assembly and polar localization of the chemosensory cluster in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. They discovered that a certain protein (FlhF) is required for the polar localization of the chemosensory cluster while a fully-assembled motor is necessary for the assembly of the cluster. They found that flagella and chemosensory clusters always co-localize in the cell; either at the cell pole in wild type cells or randomly-located in the cell in FlhF mutant cells. They hypothesize that this co-localization is required to keep the level of another protein (CheY-P), which controls motor switching, at low levels as the presence of high-levels of this protein (if the flagella and chemosensory clusters were not co-localized) is associated with high-levels of c-di-GMP and cell aggregations.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript is clearly written and straightforward. The authors applied multiple techniques to study the bacterial motility system including fluorescence light microscopy and gene editing. In general, the work enhances our understanding of the subtlety of interaction between the chemosensory cluster and the flagellar motor to regulate cell motility.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The major weakness for me in this paper is that the authors never discussed how the flagellar genes expression is controlled in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. For example, in <italic>E. coli</italic> there is a transcriptional hierarchy for the flagellar genes (early, middle, and late genes, see Chilcott and Hughes, 2000). Similarly, Campylobacter and Helicobacter have a different regulatory cascade for their flagellar genes (See Lertsethtakarn, Ottemann, and Hendrixson, 2011). How does the expression of flagellar genes in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> compare to other species? how many classes are there for these genes? is there a hierarchy in their expression and how does this affect the results of the FliF and FliG mutants? In other words, if FliF and FliG are in class I (as in <italic>E. coli</italic>) then their absence might affect the expression of other later flagellar genes in subsequent classes (i.e., chemosensory genes). Also, in both FliF and FliG mutants no assembly intermediates of the flagellar motor are present in the cell as FliG is required for the assembly of FliF (see Hiroyuki Terashima et al. 2020, Kaplan et al. 2019, Kaplan et al. 2022). It could be argued that when the motor is not assembled then this will affect the expression of the other genes (e.g., those of the chemosensory cluster) which might play a role in the decreased level of chemosensory clusters the authors find in these mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestions. In the revised manuscript, we have further elaborated on the regulatory control of flagellar genes expression in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (see our response to comment #4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>I believe the authors have performed additional experiments that improved their manuscript and they have answered many of my comments and those of the other reviewers. I am supportive of publishing this manuscript, but I still find the following points that are not clear to me (probably I am misunderstanding some points; the authors can clarify).</p><p>(1) In response to reviewer 1, the authors say that they &quot;analyzed and categorized the distribution of the chemotaxis complex in both wild-type and flhF mutant strains into three patterns: precise-polar, near-polar, and mid-cell localization.&quot; I can see what they mean by polar and mid-cell, but near-polar sounds a bit elusive? Can they provide examples of this stage and mention how accurately they can identify it? Also, do the pie charts they show in Figure S4 really show &quot;significant alterations&quot;? There is a difference between 98% and 85% as they mention in their response to reviewer 1, but I am not sure that this is significant? Probably they can explain/change the language in the text? Also, the number of cells they counted for FlhF mutant is more than the double of other strains (WT and FlhF FliF mutant)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestions. To clarify, we divided the intracellular area along the cell's long axis into three domains: the two ends each representing 10% of the length as the precise-polar domain, the central 50% as the mid-cell domain, and the remaining regions between these as the near-polar domain. The localization pattern of the chemotaxis complex was assigned based on the position of the fluorescence intensity centroid within these domains.</p><p>Regarding the significance of the changes, you are correct to question our language. When flhF was knocked out, the proportion of chemotaxis complexes with precise-polar distribution decreased from 98% to 85% - a 13% reduction. While this represents a measurable shift in localization pattern, describing this as &quot;significant alterations&quot; was probably imprecise. We have revised this language to more accurately reflect the magnitude of the change (lines 169-177).</p><p>For the cell counting, we increased the sample size for the flhF mutant because this strain exhibited the appearance of mid-cell localization (approximately 5% of cells), which was not observed in wild-type or flhF fliF double mutant strains. To accurately quantify this rare phenotype and ensure statistical reliability, we analyzed more cells for this particular strain. This explains why the flhF mutant dataset contains approximately double the number of cells compared to the other strains.</p><p>We have redrawn Figure S4 to include a clear schematic diagram of the cell partitioning method and provided representative examples of each localization pattern (precise-polar, near-polar, and mid-cell) to better illustrate how we distinguished between these categories.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) One thing that also confused me is the following: One point that the authors stress is that FlhF localizes both the flagellum and the chemoreceptors to the pole. However, if I look at Figure 2B, the flagellum and the chemoreceptors still co-localize together (although not at the pole). If FlhF was responsible for co-localizing both of them to the pole, then wouldn't one expect them to be randomly localized in this mutant and by that I mean that they do not co-localize but that each of them (the flagellum and the chemoreceptors) are located in a different random location of the cell (not co-localized). The fact that they are still co-localized together in this mutant could also be interpreted by, for example, that FlhF localizes the flagellum to the pole and another mechanism localizes the chemoreceptors to the flagellum, hence, they still co-localize in this mutant because the chemoreceptors follow the flagellum by another mechanism to wherever it goes?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this insightful observation. You are correct that our current experimental results do not definitively establish that FlhF directly localizes both the flagellum and chemoreceptors to the pole independently. The persistent colocalization of flagella and chemoreceptors in the DflhF mutant, even when both are mislocalized away from the pole, actually suggests a more complex regulatory mechanism than we initially proposed.</p><p>This observation highlights an important distinction between polar targeting and colocalization maintenance. Our data suggest that FlhF influences the polar targeting of the flagellum-chemoreceptor assembly, but the colocalization itself appears to be governed by a different mechanism that operates independently of FlhF. This could involve direct protein-protein interactions between flagellar and chemotaxis components, or shared assembly machinery that we have yet to identify.</p><p>To better reflect this interpretation, we have revised the subsection title (line 150). We have also modified the relevant discussion (line 180) to more accurately describe FlhF’s role in polar targeting rather than claiming it directly controls chemoreceptor localization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In the response to reviewers, the authors mention &quot;suggesting that the assembly of the receptor complex is likely influenced mainly by the C-ring and MS-ring structures rather than by the P ring&quot;. However, in the article, they still write &quot;The complete assembly of the motor serves as a partial prerequisite for the assembly of the chemotaxis complex, and its assembly site is also regulated by the polar anchor protein FlhF&quot; despite their FlgI results which is not in accordance with this statement? Also, As I mentioned in my previous report, in FliG and FliF mutant the motor does not assemble (see Hiroyuki Terashima et al. 2020., and Kaplan et al., 2022).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions and acknowledge the contradictions in our original text. You are correct that in DfliF and DfliG mutants, the flagellar motor does not assemble, while the P ring (FlgI) functions as a bushing for the peptidoglycan layer and its absence does not prevent motor assembly.</p><p>Our DflgI results, which showed normal chemotaxis complex assembly similar to wild-type, clearly demonstrate that the P ring is not required for chemoreceptor complex formation. This contradicts our original statement that &quot;complete assembly of the motor serves as a partial prerequisite for the assembly of the chemotaxis complex.&quot;</p><p>We have corrected this inconsistency by: (1) Revising the subsection title (line 186) to more accurately reflect that core motor structures, rather than complete motor assembly, influences chemoreceptor complex formation. (2) Modifying sentences in the introduction (lines 97-98) to better align with our experimental findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors have said in their response to my point &quot;and currently, there is no evidence that FliA activity is influenced by proteins like FliG&quot;. I just want to clarify what I meant in my previous report: In <italic>E. coli</italic>, FliA binds to FlgM, and when the hook is assembled FlgM is secreted outside the cell allowing FliA to trigger the transcription of class III genes, which include the chemosensory genes (see Figure 5 in Beeby et al, 2020 in FEMS Microbiology, and Chilcott and Hughes, 2000). This implies that if the hook is not built, then late genes (including the chemoreceptors) should not be present. However, in Kaplan et al., 2019, the authors imaged a FliF mutant in Shewanella oneidensis (Figure S3) and still saw that chemoreceptors are present (I believe the authors must highlight this). This suggests that species such as Shewanella and Pseudomonas have a different assembly process than that <italic>E. coli</italic>, and although the authors say that in the text, I believe they still can refine this part more in the spirit of what I wrote here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the important clarification regarding the differences in transcriptional regulation among bacterial species. We agree that the observation of chemoreceptors in Shewanella oneidensis DfliF mutants (Kaplan et al., 2019) represents a significant deviation from the well-characterized <italic>E. coli</italic> model and merits stronger emphasis. In response, we have expanded the discussion to more clearly highlight the critical distinctions in the transcriptional regulatory circuits governing flagellar and chemoreceptor biogenesis between <italic>E. coli</italic> and species such as Shewanella oneidensis and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (lines 351-363).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I do not like to ask for additional experiments in the second round of review, so for me if the authors modify the text to tackle these points and allow for probable alternative explanations/ highlight gaps/ modify language used for some claims, then that is fine with me.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>It is plausible that colocalization reduces CheY levels throughout the cell in order to reduce cross-talk with c-di-GMP.
