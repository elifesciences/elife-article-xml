Activated cells rapidly generate a heterogeneous progenitor population that regenerates the damaged tissues. While the transcriptional cadence that generates heterogeneity is known, the metabolic pathways influencing the transcriptional machinery to establish a heterogeneous progenitor population remains unclear. Here, we describe a novel pathway downstream of mitochondrial glutamine metabolism that confers stem cell heterogeneity and establishes differentiation competence by countering post-mitotic self-renewal machinery. We discovered that mitochondrial glutamine metabolism induces CBP/EP300-dependent acetylation of stem cell-specific kinase, PAS domain-containing kinase (PASK), resulting in its release from cytoplasmic granules and subsequent nuclear migration. In the nucleus, PASK catalytically outcompetes mitotic WDR5-anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) interaction resulting in the loss of post-mitotic Pax7 expression and exit from self-renewal. In concordance with these findings, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PASK or glutamine metabolism upregulated Pax7 expression, reduced stem cell heterogeneity<italic>,</italic> and blocked myogenesis in vitro and muscle regeneration in mice. These results explain a mechanism whereby stem cells co-opt the proliferative functions of glutamine metabolism to generate transcriptional heterogeneity and establish differentiation competence by countering the mitotic self-renewal network via nuclear PASK.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Pax7</kwd><kwd>self-renewal</kwd><kwd>PASK</kwd><kwd>glutamine</kwd><kwd>myogenesis</kwd><kwd>Wdr5</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AR073906-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kikani</surname><given-names>Chintan K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG066653-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Ramon C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM124958</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banaszynski</surname><given-names>Laura A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F99CA264165</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Lyndsay EA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>134230-RSG-20-043-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banaszynski</surname><given-names>Laura A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HD109239</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banaszynski</surname><given-names>Laura A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Stem cell heterogeneity is progressively built in proliferating population by the action of mitochondrial glutamine metabolism that opposes the cell cycle-linked self-renewal network to generate differentiation-competent progenitors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell identity is a dynamic feature that must be continually reestablished in proliferating stem cells. To preserve stem cell identity, self-renewing stem cells rapidly reactivate the expression of genes linked with cell identity following cell division. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the post-mitotic reactivation of lineage-defining genes, including the mitotic recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) by WDR5 to transcriptional start sites of genes regulating pluripotency and H3K27ac mitotic bookmarking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pelham-Webb et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Oh et al., 2020</xref>). During mitosis, the WDR5-APC/C interaction is enhanced, and transient disruption of this interaction causes loss of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Oh et al., 2020</xref>). However, how differentiation signals counter mitotic self-renewal machinery remains poorly understood.</p><p>Expression of PAS domain-containing kinase (PASK), a kinase involved in cellular energy balance and metabolic control, positively correlates with the undifferentiated, proliferative state of ESCs and adult stem cells. Functionally, PASK is required for the onset of ESC and adult stem cell differentiation programs downstream of nutrient signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kikani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kikani et al., 2016</xref>). In adult muscles, PASK is required to induce an early regenerative myogenesis program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kikani et al., 2016</xref>). During muscle regeneration, normally quiescent Pax7+ muscle stem cells (MuSCs) enter the cell cycle and undergo proliferative bursts, resulting in the generation of a heterogeneous, activated, self-renewing myoblast population (Pax7<sup>+/-</sup>, MyoD<sup>+/-</sup>, Myf5<sup>+/-</sup>). Signaling cues stimulate the generation of a committed progenitor population (MyoD<sup>+</sup>, MyoG<sup>+</sup>), which orchestrates the myogenesis program. We and others have shown that PASK is required to generate the MyoD<sup>+</sup>, MyoG<sup>+</sup> committed progenitor population during myogenesis. Mechanistically, PASK phosphorylates WDR5, a member of the histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase (H3K4me3) complexes, in response to differentiation signaling. This phosphorylation sets in motion chromatin remodeling at the <italic>Myog</italic> promoter and its transcriptional activation resulting in the onset of myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kikani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kikani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Karakkat et al., 2019</xref>). This entire pathway is downstream of nutrient-activated mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of PASK, which stimulates the PASK-WDR5 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kikani et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, the PASK function is specifically required to establish the initial committed myoblast progenitor population but is dispensable to sustain myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kikani et al., 2019</xref>). Since PASK functions at the critical decision point between self-renewal and differentiation, understanding signals that regulate PASK activity and subcellular distribution could provide mechanistic insight into how the exit from self-renewal is regulated in stem cells to generate the committed progenitor population.</p><p>Signaling cues from the early regenerating niche play critical regulatory roles in facilitating the transition from quiescent, non-proliferative MuSCs to activated, hyper-proliferative myoblasts during the early stages of tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ryall et al., 2015</xref>). Mitochondrial uptake of glutamine is thought to play an essential role in sustaining stem cell proliferation by generating ATP and maintaining redox balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). During muscle regeneration, glutamine secreted by macrophages sustains myoblast proliferation and promotes differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shang et al., 2020</xref>); however, the precise mechanistic function of glutamine metabolism in driving myoblast differentiation is unclear. <italic>Our</italic> results discovered a novel mitochondrial-nuclear signaling axis that connects glutamine metabolism in the mitochondria with the mitotic self-renewal network in the nucleus. In this pathway, glutamine metabolic signaling is required to generate a differentiation-primed progenitor population by disrupting the cell cycle-linked WDR5-APC/C interaction via PASK acetylation and nuclear localization. This axis provides new insights into the regulation of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation and identifies key signaling pathways that could be targeted to enhance tissue regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PASK inhibition preserves self-renewal and sustains the proliferation of adult stem cells and ESCs</title><p>PASK is highly expressed in proliferating pluripotent, embryonic, and adult stem cells from mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kikani et al., 2016</xref>). It is rapidly downregulated following the onset of the differentiation program in all systems resulting in the near absence of PASK expression in most adult tissues under normal physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kikani et al., 2016</xref>). Functionally, PASK is required for the onset of terminal differentiation program in embryonic and adult mouse stem cells; however, the role of PASK in self-renewal and stemness properties of stem cells remains unclear. To answer these questions, we cultured mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in the 2i+LIF (2i) condition designed to maintain pluripotency and subsequently replaced the 2i media with PASKi (PASK inhibitor, BioE-1197, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kikani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wu et al., 2014</xref>)+LIF (PASKi) to assess if PASKi can sustain pluripotency after the withdrawal of 2i. Strikingly, replacing 2i media with PASKi in mESCs resulted in a further increase in the expression of genes associated with self-renewal and stemness (<italic>Pou5f1, Sox2,</italic> and <italic>Prex1</italic> mRNA) when compared with mESCs cultured in the 2i conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, using a Rex1-GFP reporter mESC line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wray et al., 2011</xref>), we observed that cells cultured in PASKi maintained GFP reporter expression at levels comparable to those cultured in 2i (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To compare the differentiation competence of 2i vs. PASKi cultured mESCs, we performed an embryoid body (EB) formation assay of cells grown in 2i or PASKi. Cells grown in the 2i culture condition differentiate well, as seen from the emergence of several fluid-filled cavitated structures after the withdrawal of 2i. Remarkably, PASKi cultured cells showed a substantial increase in the numbers and size of fluid-filled cavitated structures compared with 2i pretreated cells (~52% for PASKi versus ~12% for 2i-treated cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) after PASKi withdrawal. Consistent with our previous study, the presence of PASKi during EB formation attenuated differentiation as assessed morphologically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kikani et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, PASK inhibition in ESCs preserved self-renewal and enhanced differentiation potential upon PASK inhibitor withdrawal.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of PAS domain-containing kinase (PASK) preserves pluripotency, decreases muscle stem cell (MuSC) heterogeneity, and inhibits precocious differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RT-qPCR analysis of indicated transcript levels from 2i+LIF cultured mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) after transitioning into 2i+LIF or PASKi+LIF conditions and cultured for 4 days. <italic>*</italic>p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.05<italic>,</italic> error bars ± SD.

Adult MuSCs undergo successive transitions through quiescence, activation, commitment, and differentiation during regeneration in vivo and in culture upon their isolation. While PASK is expressed at negligible levels in adult quiescent MuSCs, its expression increases rapidly as MuSCs are activated and begin to proliferate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kikani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). To test if PASK inhibition during in vitro activation of MuSCs affects self-renewal, stemness, and differentiation dynamics of adult stem cells, we isolated primary myoblasts from hindlimbs of uninjured mice using flow cytometry-based sorting of Sca-1<sup>-</sup>, CD31<sup>-</sup>, CD45<sup>-</sup>, VCAM1+, α7-Integrin+ cells and cultured them in the presence or absence of PASKi. PASK inhibition was well tolerated by isolated primary myoblasts and caused no apparent proliferation defect. On the other hand, PASKi robustly blocked the precocious myogenesis observed in the control myoblasts for as long as 4 days post-isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that PASK inhibition preserves the self-renewal property of cultured ESCs and adult MuSCs and prevents their precocious differentiation.</p><p>To mechanistically understand how PASK functions during the onset of myoblast differentiation, we isolated primary myoblasts from <italic>Pask<sup>WT</sup></italic> and <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> animals using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). MuSCs isolated from <italic>Pask<sup>WT</sup></italic> or <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> were indistinguishable in size 12 hr post-isolation and did not show overt proliferation defects, which is consistent with our previous results and the notion that PASK is not expressed or required for the maintenance or release from a quiescent state. Finally, while <italic>Pask<sup>WT</sup></italic> cells began to form nascent myotubes by 48 hr post-isolation, <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> cells continued to proliferate and showed little signs of myotube formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Thus, genetic or pharmacological loss of PASK results in continued self-renewal of adult myoblasts and impaired differentiation.</p><p>Quiescent MuSCs express Pax7 but lack MyoD or Myf5 protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Upon their isolation, Pax7+ MuSCs rapidly activate MyoD mRNA translation, and by 48 hr, Pax7+/MyoD+ SCs diverge into a heterogeneous population expressing a combination of Pax7, MyoD, and/or Myf5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rocheteau et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> MuSCs showed an increased percentage of Pax7<sup>+</sup> myoblasts numbers compared with control (~83% for <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> vs. 30% for <italic>Pask<sup>WT</sup></italic>) during 48 hr of culture. Similarly, loss of PASK resulted in reduced levels of MyoD+ myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). Furthermore, the increased proportion of Pax7+ myoblasts observed in <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> is independent of the method chosen for stem cell isolation (FACS, magnetic-activated cell sorting [MACS], and pronase-based method) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>). Finally, <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> myoblasts showed a marked reduction in committed MyoG-expressing cells and myogenesis, as measured by the fusion index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). Thus, genetic loss of PASK increases self-renewing Pax7+ myoblast numbers and decreases the generation of committed (MyoD+/MyoG+) myoblasts in vitro. During adult muscle regeneration, Pax7+ myoblasts begin to proliferate and generate MyoD+/MyoG+ committed progenitor population by 3 days post-injury. These cells begin the regenerative myogenesis program, marked by the emergence of embryonic myosin (eMHC) expression. Loss of PASK severely affected the progression through the regenerative myogenesis program, as seen from decreased eMHC+ myofiber numbers in <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> animals compared with littermate controls 5 days post-injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref>). Furthermore, loss of PASK resulted in a significant expansion of Pax7+ MuSC numbers in <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> muscles compared to the littermate control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–L</xref>). Combined with decreased MyoD+ myoblasts numbers and loss of MyoG expression in cells isolated from these animals in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>), our results indicate delayed generation of committed progenitor population in <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> animals. Thus, the loss of PASK impairs the transition from Pax7+ stem cells to the MyoD+/MyoG+ committed progenitor population required for the onset of the differentiation program.</p><p>The increase in Pax7+ cell numbers seen in isolated myoblasts in <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> or PASKi-treated cells could be attributed to the suppression of differentiation by the loss of active PASK. Thus, we turned to non-transformed, cultured myoblasts such as C2C12, which can be maintained in a proliferative state for an extended duration under appropriate culture conditions. Furthermore, C2C12 cells express low levels of Pax7 compared with isolated myoblasts and show increased heterogeneity in Pax7 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Olguin and Olwin, 2004</xref>). Thus, the C2C12 system has been employed to discover cell-intrinsic pathways regulating Pax7 expression and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Olguin and Olwin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McKinnell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sincennes et al., 2021</xref>). Using this system, we asked if PASKi treatment during the proliferative phase affects the expression of genes associated with stemness and self-renewal in cultured myoblasts. We performed RNAseq analysis of C2C12 myoblasts treated with PASKi during proliferative, early differentiating, and late differentiating conditions. Our global transcriptomic analysis revealed a strong enrichment of genes associated with stemness and self-renewal at all time-points when PASK is inhibited, starting with the proliferative condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Furthermore, PASK inhibition preserved self-renewal and stemness despite culture conditions that otherwise stimulate differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Our results in ESCs and MuSCs show that the PASK inhibition is a viable strategy to preserve in vitro self-renewal and pluripotency of ESCs and adult stem cells and is indicative of its functional role in balancing stemness and pluripotency with differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PASK is dynamically redistributed from cytoplasmic granules to the nucleus in a cellular heterogeneity-dependent manner</title><p>To mechanistically understand how PASK inhibition sustains stem cell proliferation, we examined PASK subcellular distribution in proliferating versus early differentiating myoblasts. In proliferating C2C12 myoblasts (day 0), most of the PASK is localized in the cytosol and excluded from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Curiously, PASK appears to be localized into cytoplasmic granules in cultured myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, inset). Upon induction of the differentiation program, a significant loss of the cytoplasmic granular staining pattern occurs, and a large fraction of PASK was redistributed into the nucleus, as seen by overlapping intensities of the PASK signal with the nuclear marker DAPI and by biochemical fractionation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next asked if the subcellular distribution of PASK affects Pax7 expression in isolated primary myoblasts. Similar to cultured myoblasts, isolated primary myoblasts showed a strong granular staining pattern of PASK in proliferating myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, nearly all cells in which PASK was localized into the cytoplasmic granules were strongly positive for Pax7 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, cells with any extent of nuclear-localized PASK lacked Pax7 expression, even under proliferating conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition, in nascent myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, marked by arrow), the PASK localization pattern is switched from within cytoplasmic granules to diffused nuclear, which correlated with the loss of Pax7 positivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These results suggest that nuclear translocation of PASK might be associated with heterogeneity in Pax7+ cell numbers seen in proliferating myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Consistent with this, under proliferating conditions, Pax7<sup>hi</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, yellow arrow indicates cells with stronger nuclear levels of Pax7) cells are more frequently associated with cytoplasmic PASK presence, and Pax7<sup>L0</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, white arrows indicate cells with relatively weaker nuclear levels of Pax7) or Pax7<sup>ab</sup> (cells lacking nuclear Pax7) are more frequently seen in cells with noticeable nuclear PASK presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>). Interestingly, we noticed asymmetric nuclear distribution of PASK in rapidly dividing myoblasts wherein a cell that asymmetrically retained nuclear PASK exhibited the loss of Pax7 expression post-mitosis, thereby creating heterogeneity in Pax7 expression in culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–J</xref>).

To directly test this hypothesis, we asked whether forced nuclear retention of PASK could inhibit Pax7 expression and drive exit from self-renewal. To do that, we first fused a powerful SV40 Nuclear Localization Sequence (PKKKRKV, NLS) to GFP-tagged human PASK. To our surprise, NLS-tagging was insufficient to drive PASK into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating the possible presence of a powerful nuclear export sequence (NES) in PASK that ensures cytoplasmic localization of PASK in proliferating cells.

Thus, we considered the possibility that PASK is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein containing one or more NES and that regulated import and/or export may result in its nuclear localization at the onset of differentiation. Proteins smaller than 60 kDa could migrate to the nucleus by diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nigg, 1997</xref>). Considering this size limitation, we performed a series of C-terminal truncations in PASK to identify the region that mediates PASK nuclear export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Scoring for cells showing at least some nuclear GFP presence, we found that the GFP-WT-PASK (MW=~200 kDa) and GFP-1–737 (MW=~115 kDa) fragment remained predominantly cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). A smaller fragment, GFP-1–660 (MW=~100 kDa) showed nuclear GFP expression in ~22% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), while fragment GFP-1–400 (MW=~70 kDa) showed increased nuclear localization of PASK with ~67% of cells showing at least some nuclear GFP presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These results suggested the presence of NES between amino acids 400 and 660 and between amino acids 660 and 737. We used multiple bioinformatic tools to identify L401–L409 (NES1) and L666–L671 (NES2) as putative NES in PASK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1 fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 1 and 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). The NES1 residues are similar to an experimentally verified NES in PGC1-α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2010</xref>), and the NES2 residues are similar to the NES of PDK1 that we previously discovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lim et al., 2003</xref>). We found that mutation of either NES1 or NES2 residues resulted in a modest but statistically significant increase in the number of cells with nuclear PASK localization compared to WT-PASK or NLS-PASK in the absence of LMB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Combined mutation of NES1 and NES2 resulted in a significantly increased proportion of cells that contain nuclear PASK, with the extent of nuclear PASK in each cell similar to what we observed for PASK during myogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). However, incomplete nuclear retention of NES1+NES2 mutated PASK prompted us to examine if the nuclear import of PASK might be rate-limiting, preventing stronger PASK nuclear accumulation despite NES1 and NES2 mutations (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref> for a list of mutant nomenclature in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with that, while mutations of individual NES1 or NES2 in NLS-PASK improved nuclear retention of NLS-PASK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), mutating both NES1 and NES2 together in NLS-PASK resulted in robust nuclear retention of NLS-PASK in nearly 100% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These results conclusively show that NES1 and NES2 are functional for exporting PASK from the nucleus, and their loss interferes with the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of PASK.</p><p>Since the nuclear accumulation of PASK was induced by differentiation signaling cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we asked if signaling pathways could target the nuclear export machinery (NES) to retain PASK in the nucleus. To test this, we used the WT version of NLS-hPASK to circumvent any regulatory import mechanisms that may be present (used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We serum-starved HEK293T cells expressing NLS-PASK and treated them with LMB in the presence or absence of acute serum stimulation for 2 hr. Remarkably, NLS-PASK was excluded from the nucleus in serum-starved cells despite LMB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). In contrast, acute serum stimulation increased nuclear accumulation of NLS-PASK even without LMB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Furthermore, serum stimulation improved the effectiveness of LMB treatment, as seen from stronger nuclear retention of PASK (in nearly 100% of cells), similar to what was observed with NES1+NES2 mutated NLS-PASK. The improved effectiveness of LMB in blocking PASK nuclear export suggests that serum stimulation weakens the effectiveness of the NES1 and/or NES2 sequences to reduce the nuclear export rate of PASK.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Glutamine-dependent acetylation of PASK stimulates its nuclear accumulation</title><p>We next asked if serum stimulation can trigger the nuclear translocation of endogenous and overexpressed GFP-tagged WT-PASK. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, we observed significant nuclear accumulation of GFP-hPASK by 2 hr of serum stimulation. In addition, endogenous mouse PASK was also translocated to the nucleus in response to acute serum stimulation in C2C12 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We have previously shown that PASK is phosphorylated and activated by mTORC1 in response to serum stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kikani et al., 2019</xref>). This phosphorylation activates PASK to stimulate the myogenesis program. Two of the mTOR phosphorylation sites on PASK, Ser<sup>640</sup> and Thr<sup>642</sup>, are juxtaposed to NES2 (L666–L671) residues. Therefore, we tested if mTOR signaling mediates the nuclear translocation of WT-PASK in response to serum stimulation. However, inhibiting mTORC1 by rapamycin did not consistently or significantly block serum-induced nuclear translocation of WT-hPASK. This suggests that mTORC1 alone is insufficient for driving the nuclear translocation of PASK in response to serum stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and that a separate signaling input controls its nuclear translocation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mitochondrial glutamine metabolism stimulates CBP/EP300-dependent acetylation of PAS domain-containing kinase (PASK) to drive its nuclear translocation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HEK-293T cells stably expressing GFP-tagged full-length WT PASK (aa 1–1323) were serum-starved (0.1% serum) for 12 hr and then stimulated for 2 hr with 20% serum.

To determine if endogenous PASK is acetylated, we treated C2C12 myoblasts with trichostatin A, a broad-spectrum histone deacetylase inhibitor. Probing the purified acetylome with an anti-PASK antibody revealed strong enrichment of acetylated endogenous mouse PASK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

To test this, we first sought to identify upstream acetyltransferase for PASK. Kat2a and EP300 are two major histone acetyltransferases upregulated in MuSCs during regeneration and are known to induce the acetylation of non-histone proteins during myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Das et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Puri et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Puri et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sartorelli et al., 1999</xref>). siRNA-mediated knockdown of Kat2a did not affect serum-induced acetylation of PASK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In contrast, the pretreatment of cells with a highly selective CBP/P300 inhibitor, A-485 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lasko et al., 2017</xref>), nearly completely blocked serum-induced PASK acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) in HEK293T cells. Furthermore, the knockdown of EP300 in C2C12 cells completely inhibited endogenous PASK acetylation induced by serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Finally, serum-induced PASK nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) was blocked by the pretreatment of cells with A-485. Thus, PASK is a novel acetylation target of CBP/EP300 that drives its nuclear translocation in response to serum stimulation.</p><p>To connect CBP/EP300-driven PASK acetylation to upstream signaling pathways, we measured serum-induced PASK acetylation in the presence of various signaling kinase inhibitors. However, serum-induced PASK acetylation was independent of inputs from signaling kinases, as inhibition of PI-3K, mTOR, or Akt did not prevent serum-induced PASK acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Therefore, we explored the involvement of metabolic pathways in driving PASK acetylation. Acetyl-CoA, a substrate for acetyltransferases, is generated from glucose (via mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation) and glutamine (via glutaminolysis). Strikingly, inhibition of the mitochondrial pyruvate complex (MPC1) by UK5099 stimulated PASK acetylation more than serum alone, perhaps due to a compensatory increase in glutaminolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this, inhibition of mitochondrial glutaminolysis by a GLS1-specific inhibitor, BPTES, resulted in a near-complete loss of serum-induced PASK acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Furthermore, only glutamine added back to cells cultured in glutamine- and serum-free media conditions was sufficient to stimulate PASK acetylation as much as serum induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), which was further inhibited by BPTES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Finally, glutamine metabolism drives PASK acetylation via CBP/P300 since pretreatment of serum-stimulated cells with BPTES or glutamine-stimulated cells with the A-485 markedly blunted the PASK acetylation in isolated primary MuSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>Next, we asked if glutamine metabolism performs a signaling function to propel PASK nuclear translocation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, glutamine starvation resulted in the nuclear exclusion of PASK. On the other hand, glutamine addition alone in serum- and glutamine-free media stimulated robust nuclear translocation of PASK, which was blocked by CBP/EP300 inhibition (A-485), but not by mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Thus, our results show that glutamine signaling to CBP/EP300, but not to mTOR, regulates PASK nuclear translocation via acetylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Selective glutamine withdrawal triggers the preservation of stemness in MuSCs</title><p>The critical role of glutamine in stimulating PASK nuclear translocation prompted us to examine the role of glutamine metabolism at various stages of self-renewal and differentiation. First, leveraging the heterogeneity of cultured myoblasts in terms of Pax7 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Olguin and Olwin, 2004</xref>), we asked if glutamine withdrawal affects myoblast proliferation and self-renewal. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahsan et al., 2020</xref>), glutamine withdrawal significantly reduced the proliferation rate of cultured myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, the glutamine-withdrawn cells were greatly enlarged and remained alive in cell culture for at least 4 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). Furthermore, cells grown in glutamine-replete media exhibited a lower proportion of Pax7+ myoblasts, consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Olguin and Olwin, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, acute glutamine withdrawal resulted in a significantly reduced heterogeneity in Pax7 expression due to a significant increase in the percentage of Pax7+ myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>). To test if glutamine depletion plays a similar role in isolated primary myoblasts, we subjected FACS-sorted primary myoblasts to glutamine depletion after 24 hr of culture in standard myoblast proliferation media, allowing them to grow for an additional 48 hr. Consistent with results from cultured myoblasts, isolated primary myoblasts cells grown in glutamine-replete media exhibited a decreased proportion of Pax7+ myoblasts. In contrast, glutamine-depleted cells showed a marked increase in the percent Pax7+ myoblasts, resulting in reduced myoblast heterogeneity in terms of Pax7 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>).

To evaluate the connection between Pax7+ myoblast heterogeneity and cell proliferation with glutamine signaling in a cell-autonomous setting, we determined the extent of Pax7 nuclear staining in BrdU+ and BrdU- populations of isolated primary myoblasts under normal or glutamine-depleted culture conditions. BrdU+ cells (proliferating cells) in glutamine-rich media were smaller in size and displayed heterogeneity in the level of nuclear Pax7 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G</xref>). We also noticed a significant Pax7<sup>L0</sup> and Pax7<sup>ab</sup> population among the BrdU+ cycling stem cells grown in glutamine-replete media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G</xref>). In contrast, glutamine withdrawal blunted BrdU incorporation yet resulted in a robust increase in the proportion of Pax7<sup>hi</sup> cells due to increased Pax7 staining intensity within individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>). Since the ratio of Pax7+/BrdU+ nuclei is increased by glutamine withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), our results indicate that glutamine withdrawal results in a reactivation of Pax7 expression in Pax7<sup>lo</sup> MuSCs in the absence of cell proliferation. Consistent with this, <italic>Pax7</italic> mRNA levels were significantly increased when glutamine was withdrawn, whereas mRNA levels for proliferation marker <italic>MKi67</italic> were nearly completely blunted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition to <italic>Pax7</italic>, transcript levels of uncommitted myoblast markers, such as <italic>Cd34</italic>, <italic>Myf5</italic>, and <italic>Myod1</italic>, were also significantly elevated upon glutamine deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also noticed a significant increase in the expression of <italic>Foxo3</italic>, a marker for MuSC quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), perhaps reflective of reduced proliferation due to glutamine withdrawal. These results suggested that glutamine withdrawal enforces the stemness preservation program and induces quiescence in vitro in a cell-autonomous manner. Finally, glutamine withdrawal also resulted in a near-complete loss of <italic>Myog</italic>, indicating a dependence on glutamine metabolism to generate the committed progenitor population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We validated these functions of glutamine in cultured myoblasts as glutamine withdrawal or inhibition of Gls1 by BPTES treatment increased Pax7 mRNA levels in C2C12 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

According to a recent report, a quiescent, self-renewing population is established after this early wave of the myogenesis program has largely concluded (days 5–7 post-injury) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cutler et al., 2021</xref>). Our results show that acute glutamine withdrawal resulted in the reactivation of Pax7 expression, decreased proliferation, and increased expression of the quiescence marker, <italic>Foxo3</italic>, in isolated MuSCs. Therefore, we asked if the withdrawal of glutamine signaling due to niche remodeling could contribute to the reactivation of Pax7 transcription and expand the self-renewing stem cell population after the early wave of the myogenesis program is completed. To test this, we injured the TA muscles from WT mice and allowed them to undergo regenerative myogenesis up to day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). This ensures normal progression through the early myogenesis program. On day 5, we intramuscularly injected 10 µM BPTES or DMSO every day for 3 days to directly introduce Gls1 inhibitor into the regenerating niche, followed by 1 day of no additional treatment to allow for clonal expansion of cell populations. We then harvested TA muscles and quantified Pax7+ stem cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–K</xref>). After early myogenesis, 3 days of BPTES treatment did not appear to affect regenerative myofiber sizes (laminin A staining, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). In contrast, we saw a significant increase in Pax7+ cell numbers in BPTES-treated compared with DMSO-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–K</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to identify the metabolic intermediates downstream of glutamine metabolism that regulates Pax7 levels in myoblasts. We first performed unbiased whole-cell metabolomics of proliferative vs. differentiating myoblasts. Compared with proliferating cells, early differentiating myoblasts show significantly increased intracellular glutamine levels and their associated downstream metabolites, glutamate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and aspartate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>). Under glutamine-depleted conditions where proliferation is inhibited but stemness is enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>), we noticed a significant reduction in alpha-ketoglutarate, citrate, and malate levels, indicating a possible reliance on reductive carboxylation from alpha-ketoglutarate in proliferative myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L–N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). Consistent with this, the addition of cell-permeable alpha-ketoglutarate reversed the increased Pax7+ cell numbers in glutamine-depleted culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O–P</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that glutamine metabolism links proliferation with the passage from Pax7<sup>hi</sup> stem cells to Pax7<sup>L0/Ab</sup> progenitors, progressively establishing a commitment to differentiate (MyoG+).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Glutamine disrupts the WDR5-APC/C interaction during mitosis to drive exit from self-renewal via PASK nuclear translocation</title><p>As a downstream target of glutamine metabolism, we sought to determine if PASK mediates the function of glutamine metabolism in regulating Pax7 expression. Unlike glutamine withdrawal, PASK inhibition did not affect cell proliferation rate or size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) in isolated MuSCs. Nevertheless, similar to glutamine withdrawal, PASK inhibition significantly increased Pax7+ myoblast numbers and reduced the heterogeneity of Pax7 nuclear-staining intensities across the field in isolated MuSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). These results suggest that PASK plays a specific role downstream of glutamine metabolism in regulating the self-renewal program but not cell proliferation machinery. To test that, we performed a BrdU incorporation assay in PASKi-treated isolated primary myoblasts. Interestingly, while PASKi did not affect BrdU incorporation, PASKi treatment resulted in increased Pax7+ MuSCs numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>).

After the initial wave of myogenesis is completed, the self-renewing population is reestablished, and the Pax7+ MuSCs number begins to return to its pre-injury levels. Interestingly, as with acute Gls1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–K</xref>), <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> mice showed elevated Pax7+ MuSCs numbers even 14 days after injury, whereas Pax7+ MuSCs numbers decline in <italic>Pask<sup>WT</sup></italic> muscles during that time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>).

In our experimental model, the addition of cell-permeable alpha-ketoglutarate reversed the increase in Pax7+ stem cell numbers caused by glutamine depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O–P</xref>). To determine if this function of alpha-ketoglutarate is dependent on PASK activity and separate from its epigenetic functions, we measured the effectiveness of alpha-ketoglutarate in reversing Pax7+ myoblast numbers in the presence of PASKi. Interestingly, PASK inhibition rendered alpha-ketoglutarate ineffective in reducing Pax7+ stem cell numbers in glutamine-depleted media conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–G</xref>). These results suggest that the glutamine-dependent nuclear translocation of PASK is an additional pathway that drives myoblast exit from self-renewal. In support of this hypothesis, we show that glutamine depletion results in increased cytoplasmic retention of PASK in isolated myoblasts, with a concomitant increase in Pax7+ myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–I</xref>). Thus, we propose that glutamine metabolism targets PASK subcellular distribution to generate a Pax7-negative population.</p><p>Consistent with this, an increase in Pax7+ cell numbers observed due to PASK silencing in cultured myoblasts could be reversed by the expression of either WT or nuclear hPASK (nPASK [NLS-PASK-NES1+2-GFP], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J–K</xref>), but not by GFP control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D-E</xref>). In contrast, only nuclear PASK effectively reversed the increased Pax7+ myoblasts numbers due to glutamine depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L–M</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that PASK is a downstream target of glutamine metabolism in activated myoblasts that counters Pax7 expression.</p><p>We have previously reported an increased association between PASK and WDR5, a member of the histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase complex at the onset of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kikani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Karakkat et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, WDR5 interacts with Pax7 and epigenetically maintains myoblast self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McKinnell et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, we asked if the PASK-WDR5 association contributes to the downregulation of Pax7 expression downstream of glutamine metabolism. To further expand the biochemical understanding of the PASK-WDR5 association, we searched for a canonical WDR5 interaction motif (WIN) sequence within PASK exhibiting a high degree of sequence similarity with other WIN motif-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The multiple alignments identified R942 as a conserved residue within the WIN motif that interacts directly with WDR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Mutation of Arg<sup>942</sup>Gly (R942G) within the WIN motif ablated the interaction between hPASK and Flag-tagged mouse WDR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

In stem cells, WDR5 is reported to interact with the cell cycle-linked E3 ubiquitin ligase, APC/C via a WIN motif. This interaction is strengthened during mitosis and is required for the rapid transcriptional reactivation of self-renewal and lineage commitment genes following mitosis in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Oh et al., 2020</xref>). Disruption of the WDR5-APC/C interaction reduces stem cell pluripotency. However, the upstream signal that regulates the WDR5-APC/C interaction remains unknown.</p><p>We have noticed rapid nuclear entry of human PASK during mitosis, prior to nuclear membrane breakdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, as an upstream regulator of WDR5, we asked if PASK disrupts the WDR5-APC/C interaction during mitosis to suppress Pax7 expression. Since APC2 was demonstrated to be the only APC/C complex member that binds directly with WDR5 when the proteins are purified in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Oh et al., 2020</xref>), we focused our co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments on APC2 and CDC20, two members of the endogenous APC/C complex that interact with WDR5 during mitosis. The presence of WT-PASK significantly disrupted WDR5-APC/C, as indicated by reduced co-precipitation of WDR5 with APC2 and CDC20 compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). PASK<sup>WIN</sup> mutant, on the other hand, significantly strengthened the WDR5-APC/C interaction, suggesting that the interaction of PASK with WDR5 disrupts the WDR5-APC/C interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Since the WDR5-APC/C interaction is specifically strengthened during mitosis, we studied the role of various PASK mutants, including a catalytically dead version (KD, K1028R), in regulating the WDR5-APC/C interaction during mitosis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, co-expression of WT-PASK with WDR5 significantly reduced the WDR5-APC/C interaction. However, co-expression of either kinase-dead (K1028R) or WIN mutant (R942G) PASK resulted in strengthened WDR5-APC/C interaction when compared to the expression of WT PASK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Expression of PASK<sup>S949E</sup>, on the other hand, further reduced the WDR5-APC/C interaction compared with WT-PASK, consistent with the stronger PASK-WDR5 association and increased PASK activity resulting from phosphorylation at the Ser949 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We previously showed that PASK phosphorylated WDR5 at S49 and that the phosphomimetic mutant of WDR5, S49E, dramatically reduced Pax7 expression and induced precocious myogenesis under proliferating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kikani et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, we find that WDR5<sup>S49E</sup> completely disrupted the WDR5-APC/C interaction during mitosis, suggesting that the catalytic function of PASK regulates the WDR5-APC/C interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Glutamine depletion suppressed proliferation while stimulating Pax7 expression and the preservation of stemness. That raises the possibility that glutamine metabolism stimulated nuclear PASK associates with WDR5 to downregulate Pax7 transcription and orchestrate the exit from self-renewal. Consistent with this, acute glutamine stimulation strengthened the PASK-WDR5 interaction in proliferating myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To test directly if glutamine metabolism, functioning via PASK, modulates the WDR5-APC/C interaction, we allowed cells to be synchronized to the G1-S boundary in media containing glutamine since the WDR5-APC/C interaction is specifically strengthened during mitosis. We then released and arrested cells at the G2/M boundary in media containing or lacking glutamine supplementation in the presence or absence of PASKi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). This allowed for G2/M phase-specific analysis of the role of glutamine metabolism in modulating the WDR5-APC/C interaction in stem cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, PASKi treatment strengthened the WDR5-APC/C interaction in glutamine-containing media during mitosis. Interestingly, glutamine withdrawal during mitosis was sufficient to strengthen the WDR5-APC/C interaction, and the addition of PASKi in the glutamine-depleted condition did not have further additive effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). This result suggests that the WDR5-APC/C interaction is a target of glutamine metabolism during mitosis in stem cells and that PASK relays the glutamine signaling to WDR5-APC/C.</p><p>Cells that asymmetrically retain PASK in the nucleus exhibit loss of Pax7 expression in proliferating myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Heterogeneity in the nuclear expression of PASK underlies heterogeneity in Pax7 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–J</xref>), which can be reversed by catalytic inhibition of PASK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of glutamine metabolism reduces proliferation, inhibits PASK nuclear translocation, strengthens WDR5-APC/C interaction, and reduces heterogeneity in Pax7 expression. Therefore, we asked if APC/C activity underlies the re-establishment of Pax7 transcription after mitosis in isolated primary myoblasts. Strikingly, APC/C inhibition using the specific inhibitor proTAME resulted in a significant reduction in the number of Pax7+ cells after at least one round of the cell cycle (30 hr of treatment) compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–H</xref>). Within this timeframe, PASKi treatment significantly increased Pax7+ cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–H</xref>). Additionally, WT-PASK effectively downregulated Pax7 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I–J</xref>) while mutation of WIN (R942G), which abolishes the PASK-WDR5 interaction and strengthened WDR5-APC/C interaction, resulted in a near-complete failure in suppressing Pax7 expression with both WT and nuclear versions of PASK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). Finally, acute inhibition of APC/C resulted in the transcriptional induction of the committed progenitor and differentiation markers, <italic>Myog</italic> and <italic>Mylpf</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In contrast, inhibition of WDR5 or PASK, alone or in combination with APC/C inhibitor, prevented the establishment of the committed progenitor population and blocked differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These results suggest multifaceted functions of PASK and WDR5 that act in conjunction with APC/C to regulate the generation of committed progenitors and indicate that proper temporal transition of cell identity is required for successful terminal differentiation. Therefore, we provide a novel signaling role of PASK in connecting glutamine metabolism with the WDR5-APC/C complex interaction to control stem cell fate. Our results suggest that the proliferative functions of glutamine metabolism are co-opted by stem cells to establish stem cell fate via PASK in response to the changing metabolic landscape.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Through comprehensive studies in this manuscript, we identify PASK as a novel sensory kinase that integrates hormonal (via mTOR) and metabolic signals (via glutamine) into the post-mitotic machinery to counter the reestablishment of stem cell identity. Our data support a model where glutamine stimulates the proliferation of activated myoblasts to bring activated stem cells into mitosis. Furthermore, glutamine induces concomitant acetylation of PASK to drive its nuclear translocation and guide the exit from self-renewal, establishing the committed progenitor pool during early muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, as a metabolic sensory kinase enriched in stem cells, PASK functions to integrate metabolic (via glutamine) and nutrient signaling (via mTOR) inputs to orchestrate exit from self-renewal and promote the onset of the terminal differentiation program.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Role of glutamine metabolism in PASK nuclear localization</title><p>Our data suggest that PASK subcellular localization in stem cells must be carefully regulated to prevent unintended differentiation. In agreement, our results indicate that nuclear accumulation of PASK is signal-regulated. Serum-induced PASK nuclear localization was independent of mTOR but dependent upon CBP/P300-induced acetylation. Interestingly, CBP/P300 has been reported to other acetylate non-histone proteins, mainly transcription regulatory factors, during myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Puri et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Puri et al., 1997b</xref>). Our results suggest that PASK is a novel kinase target of CBP/P300 in MuSCs that drives differentiation by coordinating exit from self-renewal.</p><p>The cellular fuel source that produces acetyl-coA connects the nutrient environment with stem cell fate. Our data conclusively shows that mitochondrial glutamine metabolism is the primary source of acetyl-CoA for driving both PASK acetylation and nuclear translocation. Furthermore, glutamine is a major fuel early during the myogenesis program, which coincides with the temporal point at which PASK expression is at its highest in regenerating muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kikani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shang et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we propose that increased glutamine influx from the regenerating niche induces PASK acetylation and nuclear translocation to promote the onset of the myogenesis program early during regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Control of self-renewal by glutamine and PASK</title><p>Acute loss of glutamine arrested cell proliferation but augmented the transcription <italic>Pax7</italic> and increased the percent Pax7+ SC numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly, inhibition of PASK with PASKi increased Pax7<sup>hi</sup> cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>), and <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> animals exhibited increased Pax7+ cell numbers during regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1K–L</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C–D</xref>). These data suggest that glutamine and PASK act on the same downstream mechanisms to regulate self-renewal.</p><p>To understand how PASK inhibition promotes stem cell self-renewal, we focused on the interactome of its downstream target, WDR5, and its involvement in stem cell fate. Our previous work found that phosphorylation of WDR5 by PASK at Ser49 is sufficient for driving myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kikani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kikani et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, WDR5 is required to maintain self-renewal in ESCs and adult MuSCs via its association with Oct4 and Pax7 transcription factors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McKinnell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ang et al., 2011</xref>). WDR5 also serves as a substrate adaptor by associating with APC/C during mitosis to ubiquitylate histone H2B via K11/K48-branched chains to maintain the open chromatin architecture necessary for the rapid transcription of self-renewal and pluripotency-associated genes following mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Oh et al., 2020</xref>). Our results suggest that, in response to glutamine signaling, PASK disrupts the WDR5-APC/C interaction during mitosis, which is required for downregulating Pax7 expression and coordinating exit from self-renewal.</p><p>Therefore, our studies provide a new model for connecting the role of the metabolic environment with the intracellular, mechanistic control of stem cell fate. Our parallel results in ES cells further suggest the generalizability of PASK function to stem cells of varied tissue origins since the downstream target of PASK function, the WDR5-APC/C interaction, is a conserved feature among both mESCs and MuSCs. Transient inhibition of PASK in both mESCs and MuSCs increases the differentiation-capable progenitor population, providing a potential rationale for PASKi to be used for future therapeutic applications for the maintenance of stem cell function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Early passage, mycoplasma-free cells were stored in a liquid-nitrogen vapor phase and used for all experiments. Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination using a PCR-based mycoplasma detection kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, J66117-AMJ). HEK293T cells were authenticated by functional tests, proliferative performance, and epithelial morphological characteristics. C2C12 cells were routinely maintained at low confluency (&lt;60%) and replenished with growth media containing freshly added serum daily. Cells were authenticated by measuring the myogenic potential (%MyoG+ cells and myofiber fusion index after 3 and 7 days of differentiation). New vials of cells were started every 4 weeks and tested for myogenic potential, as described above. Cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (pen-strep) at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were passaged every 2 days. For glutamine and serum withdrawal experiments, cells were washed once with 1× phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and cultured for 12 hr in DMEM lacking glutamine or serum (Gibco), before re-stimulation with glutamine or serum for the time period indicated. For differentiation experiments, DMEM containing 2% horse serum and 1% pen-strep was used to induce differentiation of C2C12 mouse myoblasts.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Apurva Sarin (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The core ideas of the manuscript by Xiao et al., are of interest. However, substantial issues – outlined below – remain to be addressed. Suggestions for experiments and analysis are provided. Key concerns relate to the purity of primary cells isolated from mice, arising from the method adopted for isolation and subsequent characterisation. This section of the work requires fresh experiments (summarised in #1&amp; 2) to be performed, with careful attention to methodology. Characterization of the mouse model with the genetic ablation of PASK is also required.</p><p>1. The method by which cells are isolated is yielding a heterogenous cell population, which is likely contaminated by fibroblasts. While pre-plating can be used to isolate muscle stem cells and culture them as myoblasts, it takes days of growth and multiple rounds of passaging in order to get a more pure population of myogenic cells. This would account for the high number of Pax7 negative cells in the primary myoblast experiments (~50% in some conditions) as they are most likely fibroblasts, which can be confirmed by staining for fibroblast markers. The increase in Pax7 cells in certain conditions could also simply be due to the loss of contaminating cell types due to the treatment. The experiments using myoblasts must be redone using a more appropriate cell isolation method (i.e. FACS-based analysis) or by culturing these isolated cells for a much longer period of time to eventually get a more pure cell population as confirmed by analysis of specific markers.</p><p>2. The characterization of the PASK knockout model is incomplete and a characterization is required. Basic muscle functional experiments such as EDU incorporation for proliferation and fusion index for differentiation should be provided in WT and KO cells to assess the effects of the loss of PASK. Further, since the PASK KO can regenerate muscle post-injury, it suggests that PASK is not necessary for the establishment of the progenitor population. The text may be modified to indicate this. Isolating EDL myofibers and stain for PASK and PAX7 at 0, 24, 48, and 72-hour post isolation will allow tracking changes in PASK expression and cell localization, as well as confirm the number of muscle stem cells in WT and KO mice, during quiescence and during the process of muscle stem cell activation, proliferation and differentiation in a near in vivo context. In general, performing repeated intramuscular injections into regenerating muscle is not recommended as the injections will re-damage the muscle. If this could be avoided and injected elsewhere that would be preferable.</p><p>3. In the data shown in Supp 2A western blot of PASK a significant fraction of PASK is localized in the nucleus. Can the author explain the discrepancies?</p><p>4. In figure 4, the author showed that upon glutamine addition, it was sufficient for PASK to be acetylated. However, would the author clarify if experiments have been performed in glutamine deficient medium? It would be helpful to provide data for serum depletion conditions as well. In Supp 4D, authors claim that a significant fraction of mouse PASK is acetylated during regeneration on days 3 and 5 post-injury. However, the bands are weak with a lot of noise and don't look convincing. Can they explain the huge noise in such blots?</p><p>5. In Figure 1A, Rex1 is described as being significantly higher in the PASKi condition, yet they look very similar. Figure 1C legend says that the cells were treated for 4 days but the images are only up to 48 hours. An image of the later time point may be included with staining for MyHC or myogenin.</p><p>6. In Figure 2A individual channels may be shown. In Figure 2B, the data are not internally consistent. The DAPI intensity, which should be a control is highly variable. This whole panel could be removed and better visualized using Panel A with individual channels. In Figure 2C, the DAPI channel would be a good addition In Figure 2D, the Y-axis is inappropriate. The data could be shown in two graphs, with % of MyoG+ cells, plotted separately from % of PASK localization / Myog+ cells. The events of exclusion of Pax7 from daughter mitotic cells with asymmetric nuclear localization of PASK in 2G should be quantified and presented as a bar graph. Further, it would be important to stain for a cell membrane protein to definitively show that this is a dividing cell instead of just 2 cells that are very close to one another.</p><p>7. Can the authors elaborate on the data in 4B? It is interesting that the acetylation of PASK is transient. Does this mean that the acetylation is only necessary for the PASK to enter the nucleus but afterwards is deacetylated? Or are these cells only getting nuclear PASK very transiently and then the PASK returns to the cytoplasm? Fractionation of these cells to see if the nuclear PASK is still acetylated would be interesting. Figure 4 D+I, the control does not have an error like the other conditions do.</p><p>8. In Figure 5F does the Y-Axis mean the number of double positive Pax7 and Brdu cells, or does it mean % of Pax7+ cells compared to BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells? The data may be shown as % of double positive Pax7/BrdU cells over all cells for greater clarity. Similarly, panel I in the same figure may be replotted such that the y-axis is # Pax7+ cells/mm2, as the observer's field of view is not known. In panels H<sup>+</sup>I, the number of satellite cells in the DMSO condition appears to be extremely low, especially for an injured muscle.</p><p>9. The legend to Figure 6D states that the scale bar is 20 um, but it's a bar graph and has no scale bar. The y-axis should be Pax7 cells/mm2. Data on the control siRNA and percent knock-down is missing in the experiment shown in 6G-H. A qPCR needs to be done to establish the efficacy of siRNA treatments, or alternatively, a 3 colour stain of GFP, PASK, and PAX7 should be performed. Figure 6H<sup>+</sup>J the y-axis should be % of Pax7+ cells.</p><p>10. In Figure 7, mTOR phosphorylation is presented as a requirement for PASK association with Wdr5. While experiments show that glutamine tunes this association, it would be important to understand if PASK acetylation directly impacts PASK- Wdr5 interactions. Further, The legend in this figure skips J and goes directly to K.</p><p>General comments</p><p>11. In numerous figure panels, the y-axis represents the # of cells, rather than a percentage or ratio. This is uninformative as the number of cells will never be the same between conditions and experiments. Please replace these panels with a more appropriate y-axis (each will be identified individually in the minor concern section).</p><p>12. Indicating molecular weight markers and showing complete immunoblots (particularly in the case of immunoprecipitation) would be helpful. Please state the number of experiments (n) performed for all IP blot and Western blot experiments in legends.</p><p>13. Listing the number of replicates and types of replicates(biological/technical) performed for each experiment (for both blot data and imaging experiments) would be helpful.</p><p>14. In multiple legends it says that the error bar represents SD, but in the statistical methods, it says that error bars are SEM. SD is preferable.</p><p>15. Line 344-348 refers to C2C12 myoblasts as Pax7+ stem cells. C2C12s are not stem cells and should never be labelled as such.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Listed below are some points of concern for the authors' consideration</p><p>1. Indicating molecular weight markers and showing complete immunoblots (particularly in the case of immunoprecipitation) is required for better visualization of the data.</p><p>2. There is a mismatch in the description of the text (lines 97-101) and the figure/ extended legends.</p><p>3. Which construct does WT NLS-hPASK recombinant (line 196) refer to? A table listing the mutants generated in the study would be a useful reference for a reader.</p><p>4. Data on the control siRNA is missing in the experiment shown in Figure 6G-H.</p><p>5. The analysis of the sequences regulating PASK functions is quite comprehensive. However, the amino-acid residue(s) that are targets of acetylation are not identified. Are these known?</p><p>6. In Figure 7, mTOR phosphorylation is presented as a requirement for PASK association with Wdr5. While experiments show that glutamine tunes this association, it would be important to understand if PASK acetylation directly impacts PASK- Wdr5 interactions.</p><p>7. Confirming glutamine regulation of PASK-Wdr5 interactions in primary myoblasts (endogenous proteins) will strengthen the conclusions of this otherwise detailed and comprehensive study.</p><p>8. Pharmacological inhibitors have been relied on for most experiments. In this context, verifying key observations using additional specific inhibitors (with specificity controls) and/or gene silencing should be considered. GLS1 and CBP/p300 can be readily tested using siRNA in the experimental systems in the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Supp 2A western blot of PASK doesn't show convincing data that a significant fraction of PASK is localized in the nucleus. Can the author explain the discrepancies?</p><p>2) Can authors also quantify the events of exclusion of Pax7 from daughter mitotic cells with asymmetric nuclear localization of PASK in 2G and present it in a bar graph?</p><p>3) In Supp 4D, authors claim that a significant fraction of mouse PASK is acetylated during regeneration on days 3 and 5 post-injury. However, the bands are weak with a lot of noise and don't look convincing. Can they explain the huge noise in such blots?</p><p>4) Can the authors also add the number of experiments (n=?) they have performed for all IP blot and Western blot experiments?</p><p>5) The authors can improve on the current paper by listing the number of replicates and types of replicates(biological/technical) performed for each experiment (for both blot data and imaging experiments).</p><p>6) In figure 4, the author showed that upon glutamine addition, it was sufficient for PASK to be acetylated. However, would the author clarify if experiments have been performed in glutamine deficient medium?</p><p>7) When they did the experiment where they looked at the acetylation level by western blot (figure 4). It would be really helpful to have that for serum depletion conditions as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have underutilized the mouse model of Pask.</p><p>The authors should follow standard FACS protocol for high-purity isolation of muscle stem cells. their current method will likely introduce a vast amount of contamination of fibroblasts which can make the conclusion drawn from the study questionable.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;PASK links cellular energy metabolism with a mitotic self-renewal network to establish differentiation competence&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers agree that the authors have addressed many of the issues raised by the reviewers. Notably, fibroblast contamination has been addressed in the resubmission using different protocols for the purification of myoblasts.</p><p>While the work remains of interest, the use of myoblasts with low levels (30% or less) Pax7+ in the analysis (to verify and extend observations made in C2C12 cells), remains a significant concern. This has remained unaddressed in the revised manuscript. The loss of Pax7 expression in myoblasts on culture is unexpected and discordant with current observations in the field and raises concerns about the myogenic status of the cells employed. Confirmation of key observations in demonstrably Pax7-positive myoblasts is essential for concerns to be comprehensively addressed.</p><p>Additional comments.</p><p>– WT Pax7 levels do not match in the image and plot shown in Figure 1 panels K-L.</p><p>– Lines 205-208 in the results probably refer to data shown in Figure 2 and not Figure 1.</p><p>– In Figure 5A, the legend to the colour-coded trace is missing.</p><p>– The age of mice used in the study is to be indicated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81717.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The core ideas of the manuscript by Xiao et al., are of interest.

Moreover, our experimental approach of control treatments, a test of cell viability, proliferation measurement, and transcriptional analysis ensured accurate measurement of cellular heterogeneity in vitro in response to biochemical manipulations of pronase-isolated cells. However, the reviewers' concerns are valid, and to improve the scientific rigor and confidence in our data; we performed several key experiments to compare and reproduce results from two muscle stem cell (MuSC) isolation methods to achieve highly pure Pax7+ MuSCs:</p><p>FACS: First, we used FACS-based sorting of CD45-, Sca1-, CD31-, VCAM+ MuSCs (Based on the protocol from Dr. Thomas Rando's lab (Liu L et al., 2014)) to isolate MuSCs from <italic>Pask<sup>WT</sup></italic> and <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> animals. We subjected these cells to various treatments and growth conditions as described below and quantified cellular heterogeneity in terms of Pax7+ MuSCs numbers. See Figure 1 and Figure supplement 3 for the new data generated using FACS-based isolation and the gating strategy used to purify MuSCs.</p><p>MACS: We also used a magnetic cell sorting strategy to sort CD45<sup>-</sup>, Sca-1<sup>-</sup>, CD31<sup>-</sup>, and Intregin α7<sup>+</sup> MuSCs. We subjected MuSCs isolated using the MACS method to various culture conditions of PASK and glutamine signaling manipulations and analyzed the percent of Pax7+ SCs number, myogenic commitment, and fusion index.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Fibroblast contamination in our isolation method: We stained mononuclear cells isolated using the pronase, FACS, and MACS methods with Pax7 and vimentin antibodies. Vimentin is a marker for fibroblasts. In addition, we used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from <italic>Pask<sup>WT</sup></italic> and <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> animals as a positive control for fibroblasts. Our data clearly shows no fibroblast contamination in any method used to isolate MuSCs. Thanks to the reviewers' suggestions, our data reinforce the role of glutamine/PASK in establishing the committed progenitor population by promoting heterogeneity in Pax7 levels in myoblasts. These results are replicated regardless of the method of MuSCs isolation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Stem cell heterogeneity and Pax7+ MuSCs numbers: Our data from either of the two antibody based methods for isolating MuSCs are consistent with the original data presented in the manuscript in terms of stem cell heterogeneity upon loss of PASK or glutamine signaling. Thus, genetic loss or pharmacological inhibition of PASK or glutamine signaling reduced heterogeneity in primary myoblasts by increasing the percentage of Pax7+ stem cell numbers in FACS-sorted MuSCs.</p></list-item></list><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

During an extended regeneration time course (past day 21), we noticed two phenotypes. First, we noticed smaller regenerative fiber CSA in <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> mice compared with <italic>Pask<sup>WT</sup></italic> animals (Calculated in Figure 6E). Secondly, we observed elevated percentages of Pax7+ stem cells in <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> animals at mid-point of regeneration, Day 14 post-regeneration, compared with WT animals (Recalculated in Figure 6D). These two phenotypes confirm abnormal progression through the muscle regeneration program when PASK is deleted. While <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> mice appear to have developmentally normal myogenesis, we have previously reported evidence of developmental compensation in whole-body <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> animals in vitro (Kikani et al., 2016). This is likely due to partial compensation of catalytic functions of PASK function by other kinases that share substrate selection preference with PASK (Kikani et al., JBC 2010). We are in the process of generating tamoxifen-inducible Pax7-specific loss or gain of PASK mouse models to generate a MuSC-specific model of acute loss of PASK; however, that is not the focus of the current paper which is investigating biochemical functions of PASK.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Characterization of WT and KO stem cells. We extensively characterize the entire myogenesis program in FACS-sorted MuSCs from <italic>Pask<sup>WT</sup></italic> or <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> animals in Figure 1, as suggested by the reviewer. The manuscript on hand is specifically probing the biochemical functions of PASK in driving the exit from self-renewal in response to metabolic signaling. Because PASK is not expressed in quiescent MuSCs (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2A), we do not anticipate a functional role of PASK in the initial activation of QSC. Therefore, we do not propose that PASK plays a role in maintaining the QSC state or the exit and initial activation of MuSCs following muscle injury. On the other hand, PASK is transcriptionally activated in proliferating myoblasts during regeneration (Kikani et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2016) and upon isolation of MuSCs (Figure 1 - figure supplement 2A). Therefore, we specifically focus on studying the functional role of PASK signaling in <italic>activated (proliferating)</italic> myoblasts isolated from mice or during early regeneration. We have ongoing studies examining the precise temporal kinetics of PASK transcription regulation in Pax7+ MuSCs, and identifying its upstream transcriptional regulators<italic>.</italic> However, we respectfully suggest that these avenues are outside the purview of this current manuscript that explicitly explores the metabolic-signaling interplay that drives the exit from self-renewal in the activated myoblasts.</p></list-item></list><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In the data shown in Supp 2A western blot of PASK a significant fraction of PASK is localized in the nucleus. Can the author explain the discrepancies?</p></disp-quote><p>The western blot in Supp 2A shows nuclear translocation of PASK during early myogenesis in comparison with proliferating myoblasts. When comparing the levels of Parp between the nuclear fractions from proliferating and differentiating cells, it is evident that despite the reduction in the loading levels of Parp, noticeably more PASK is present in the nucleus of differentiating myoblasts compared with proliferating myoblasts. Thus, our biochemical fractionation confirms the microscopic analysis of the nuclear translocation of PASK during myogenesis. In addition, we have previously reported that PASK levels decline once the myogenesis program is underway. Thus, lower levels of PASK in the nuclear fraction in differentiating cells is reflective of declining levels of PASK as myogenesis is progressing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In figure 4, the author showed that upon glutamine addition, it was sufficient for PASK to be acetylated. However, would the author clarify if experiments have been performed in glutamine deficient medium? It would be helpful to provide data for serum depletion conditions as well. In Supp 4D, authors claim that a significant fraction of mouse PASK is acetylated during regeneration on days 3 and 5 post-injury. However, the bands are weak with a lot of noise and don't look convincing. Can they explain the huge noise in such blots?</p></disp-quote><p>For experiments where we specifically tested glutamine-dependent stimulation, cells were starved overnight in media without serum and glutamine (as indicated in Figures 4G and H). The next day, we only added glutamine (no serum was added). Separately, experiments in Figures 4B and 4C show the effect of serum addition on PASK acetylation. In those conditions, we had serum containing glutamine. Finally, data in Figure 4F shows the effect of serum stimulation when glutamine metabolism is specifically inhibited, thus confirming that glutamine in serum stimulates PASK acetylation. Thus, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the effect of serum and glutamine on PASK acetylation.</p><p>PASK acetylation during regeneration: The antibody used to immunoprecipitate the total acetylome is not of high quality for muscle tissue homogenates.

In Figure 1A, Rex1 is described as being significantly higher in the PASKi condition, yet they look very similar.

In Figure 2A individual channels may be shown. In Figure 2B, the data are not internally consistent. The DAPI intensity, which should be a control is highly variable. This whole panel could be removed and better visualized using Panel A with individual channels. In Figure 2C, the DAPI channel would be a good addition In Figure 2D, the Y-axis is inappropriate. The data could be shown in two graphs, with % of MyoG+ cells, plotted separately from % of PASK localization / Myog+ cells. The events of exclusion of Pax7 from daughter mitotic cells with asymmetric nuclear localization of PASK in 2G should be quantified and presented as a bar graph. Further, it would be important to stain for a cell membrane protein to definitively show that this is a dividing cell instead of just 2 cells that are very close to one another.</p></disp-quote><p>We have significantly developed this part of the manuscript in the revised version. We have shown individual channels for Figure 2A and quantified the extent of PASK cytoplasmic vs. nuclear distribution during self-renewal and differentiation. Thanks to isolation of FACS sorted MuSCs which allowes us to begin examining PASK subcellular localization earlier than the Pronase-based method, we discovered that PASK is localized into cytoplasmic granules in proliferating, Pax7+ MuSCs. We further show that PASK localized in the cytoplasmic granules disperses during differentiation in glutamine-dependent manner (Figure 6H) when PASK is localized into the nucleus. In addition, we provide an extensive analysis showing a strong connection between the extent of PASK granular localization with Pax7 expression and a negative correlation between PASK nuclear localization and Pax7 expression. Finally, we could not add cell membrane staining for the post-mitotic cells due to technical difficulties, but we have expanded our analysis by adding more examples and quantifying the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Can the authors elaborate on the data in 4B? It is interesting that the acetylation of PASK is transient. Does this mean that the acetylation is only necessary for the PASK to enter the nucleus but afterwards is deacetylated? Or are these cells only getting nuclear PASK very transiently and then the PASK returns to the cytoplasm? Fractionation of these cells to see if the nuclear PASK is still acetylated would be interesting. Figure 4 D+I, the control does not have an error like the other conditions do.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent forward-looking question, and we thank the reviewers for pointing this out – the kinetics of PASK acetylation and nuclear translocation are intriguing and are part of our follow-up manuscript. It is noteworthy that many protein kinases, including Akt, PDK1, Erk1/2, <italic>JNK</italic>, and p38MAPK, exhibit transient nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling. We have corrected the data in Figure 4 D+I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In Figure 5F does the Y-Axis mean the number of double positive Pax7 and Brdu cells, or does it mean % of Pax7+ cells compared to BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells? The data may be shown as % of double positive Pax7/BrdU cells over all cells for greater clarity.

In Figure 7, mTOR phosphorylation is presented as a requirement for PASK association with Wdr5. While experiments show that glutamine tunes this association, it would be important to understand if PASK acetylation directly impacts PASK- Wdr5 interactions. Further, The legend in this figure skips J and goes directly to K.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great question. The mechanistic convergence of nutrient signaling (via mTOR) and mitochondrial signaling (via glutamine) on PASK-Wdr5 interaction is of great interest to us. To specifically test this, we have ongoing work to identify acetylation sites and how these sites affect the kinetics of nuclear translocation, PASK activation by mTOR, and its association with Wdr5 (also see the response to comment # 7). To answer this question as much as possible, we tested if endogenous PASK-Wdr5 interaction is regulated in response to glutamine stimulation under the same time course where we showed PASK acetylation and nuclear translocation. Excitingly, glutamine signaling, but not serum alone (without glutamine), strengthened the endogenous PASK-Wdr5 interaction in myoblasts, thus, biochemically connecting mitochondrial glutamine signaling to epigenetic complexes via PASK acetylation (Figure 7 - figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General comments</p><p>11.

This has remained unaddressed in the revised manuscript. The loss of Pax7 expression in myoblasts on culture is unexpected and discordant with current observations in the field and raises concerns about the myogenic status of the cells employed. Confirmation of key observations in demonstrably Pax7-positive myoblasts is essential for concerns to be comprehensively addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>There is substantial literature support (discussed and provided below) that isolated primary myoblasts precipitously lose Pax7 expression at population and individual cell levels as myogenic commitment is established. Pax7+ myoblast numbers in our experimental method from control conditions are consistent with considerable evidence in the literature. For example, a relatively recent study in <italic>PNAS</italic> (<italic>PNAS, 2021, 118 (13) e2021093118)</italic> showed that Pax7 protein levels were diminished within 24 hours post-isolation (Figure1A , Zhou S, et al. 2021). Furthermore, using a novel Pax7EGFP experimental model, Foteini Mourkioti’s lab very nicely showed a progressive decline in EGFP fluorescence in culture conditions within 24 hours, with nearly complete loss by 96 hours (Figure 3B, Tichy, E.D., et al. 2018).</p><p>Our manuscript explicitly addresses the mechanistic reasons driving this loss of Pax7 expression as stem cells begin to proliferate and heterogeneity in the myoblast population emerges. In our experimental method, we culture cells for up to 96 hours in the presence of media containing bFGF, with or without PASK inhibitor, or cells isolated from <italic>Pask<sup>KO</sup></italic> animals. We track changes in the Pax7+ population in the presence or absence of PASKi, or due to genetic loss of PASK. Thus, within the experimental time frame (48 to 96 hours, depending upon the experiment), %Pax7+ myoblasts in control animals are consistent with the literature (see Figure 1A, Zhou S, et al. 2021; Figure 3B, Tichy, E.D., et al. 2018).</p><p>To further provide evidence, as requested, that PASK inhibition results in an increased proportion of Pax7+MuSCs in demonstrably Pax7+ population, we generated MuSC-specific expression of ZsGreen using the Pax7<sup>Cre:Rosa26ZsGreen</sup>/+ animals (Pax7<sup>Cre</sup>: Pax7tm1 (Cre)Mrc/J, Jackson lab, stock: 010530, B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm6(CAG-ZsGreen1)Hze, stock: 007906). We isolated quiescent MuSCs from the uninjured TA muscles of these animals by sorting for ZsGreen+ cells and cultured them in standard myoblast proliferation media. In these animals, ZsGreen (GFP channel) is expressed in quiescent MuSCs and will be inherited by all progeny of Pax7+ MuSCs during in vitro culture, regardless of Pax7 expression. Using this model, we show that as MuSCs begin to proliferate, Pax7+ cell numbers decline, and the GFP+ progenitor population increases in vehicle-treated cultures. In contrast, in the presence of PASKi, the increased proportion of cells were positive for both Pax7 and GFP. Thus, catalytic inhibition of PASK preserved Pax7 expression in lineage-traceable proliferating primary myoblasts.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>PASK inhibition preserves Pax7 expression in proliferative myoblasts.</title><p>A.
