Understanding how cGMP differentially triggers mammalian PKG isoforms could lead to new therapeutics that inhibit or activate PKGs, complementing drugs that target nitric oxide synthases and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases in this signaling axis. Alternate splicing of PRKG1 transcripts confers distinct leucine zippers, linkers, and auto-inhibitory (AI) pseudo-substrate sequences to PKG Iα and Iβ that result in isoform-specific activation properties, but the mechanism of enzyme auto-inhibition and its alleviation by cGMP is not well understood. Here, we present a crystal structure of PKG Iβ in which the AI sequence and the cyclic nucleotide-binding (CNB) domains are bound to the catalytic domain, providing a snapshot of the auto-inhibited state. Specific contacts between the PKG Iβ AI sequence and the enzyme active site help explain isoform-specific activation constants and the effects of phosphorylation in the linker. We also present a crystal structure of a PKG I CNB domain with an activating mutation linked to Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Dissections. Similarity of this structure to wildtype cGMP-bound domains and differences with the auto-inhibited enzyme provide a mechanistic basis for constitutive activation. We show that PKG Iβ auto-inhibition is mediated by contacts within each monomer of the native full-length dimeric protein, and using the available structural and biochemical data we develop a model for the regulation and cooperative activation of PKGs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cGMP signaling</kwd><kwd>kinase regulation</kwd><kwd>mammalian signal transduction</kwd><kwd>second messenger</kwd><kwd>protein–protein complex</kwd><kwd>TAAD</kwd><kwd>kinase activation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM090161</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Choel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>He1818/10-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herberg</surname><given-names>Friedrich W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TargetRD</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herberg</surname><given-names>Friedrich W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Federal Ministry of Education and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FKZ: 16GW0270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herberg</surname><given-names>Friedrich W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research grant 389522</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Melacini</surname><given-names>Giuseppe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The crystal structure of a mammalian protein kinase G reveals contacts between the regulatory and catalytic domains, indicates how cGMP binding alters domain conformations and thus domain:domain interactions, and informs a model for enzyme auto-inhibition and cooperative activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) regulates a myriad of physiological processes including cellular growth, smooth muscle contractility, cardiovascular homeostasis, inflammation, sensory transduction, bone growth, and neuronal plasticity and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Battye et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Francis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hammond and Balligand, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klinger and Kadowitz, 2017</xref>). In eukaryotes, cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKGs) transduce intracellular cGMP levels, which change in response to extracellular signals, into phosphorylation of target proteins that control cell activities. PKGs show minimal kinase activity in the apo state but are strongly, cooperatively, and selectively activated by submicromolar concentrations of cGMP. The regulation of PKGs is of fundamental importance to understanding the basis of biological responses to cyclic nucleotides and could reveal therapeutic strategies that would complement current approaches to colon cancer, hypertensive heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, osteoporosis, and chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Browning et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feil et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kalyanaraman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klinger and Kadowitz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>PKGs belong to the AGC family of protein kinases and have N-terminal regulatory (R) and C-terminal catalytic (C) domains. The PKG Iα and Iβ isoforms are splice variants with different N-terminal regions of 89 or 104 residues but the same C-terminal 582 residues that form cyclic nucleotide-binding (CNB) and C-domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Francis and Corbin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hofmann et al., 2009</xref>).

PKG II is produced from a different gene with 63% identity and regulates ERK activation required for bone growth, and trafficking of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pfeifer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rangaswami et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Serulle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vaandrager et al., 1998</xref>). Differences between the isoforms are important to their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schlossmann and Hofmann, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Much of our understanding of the mechanism of action of PKGs derives from studies of isolated domains. The R-domain comprises a leucine zipper (LZ) domain, a linker region with an auto-inhibitory (AI) sequence, and two cyclic nucleotide-binding (CNB-A and -B) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All three PKG isoforms have unique LZ and AI domains. The LZ domains mediate homodimerization and recruit isoform-specific interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casteel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reger et al., 2014</xref>). The isoform-specific AI sequences contain pseudo-substrate motifs with the target S/T replaced by <underline>G</underline> or <underline>A</underline> (RAQ<underline>G</underline>IS in PKG Iα, KRQ<underline>A</underline>IS in PKG Iβ, and AKA<underline>G</underline>VS in PKG II) that bind the catalytic cleft, blocking substrate access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Francis et al., 1996</xref>). The CNB-A and -B domains bind cGMP with differing affinities and selectivities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2011</xref>) and are connected by interdomain helices. Each CNB includes a β-subdomain flanked by helical subdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rehmann et al., 2007</xref>). Cyclic nucleotide pockets comprise the phosphate-binding cassette (PBC), base-binding region (BBR), and capping residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Das et al., 2009</xref>). A PBC arginine that is conserved in all CNBs binds a nonbridging oxygen in the cyclic phosphate. A mutation that causes familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Dissections (TAAD) maps to this arginine of CNB-A (PKG Iα residue 177), and the mutation to glutamine constitutively activates the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2013</xref>). In PKG I, CNB-B includes a BBR arginine that specifically recognizes cGMP over cAMP; CNB-A lacks this arginine and binds either cyclic nucleotide with similarly high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2011</xref>).

In contrast to PKG, activation of the PKA R:C state by cAMP dissociates the AI tetramer into separate R and C subunits. In previous work, we showed that a PKG I R-domain comprising two CNB domains but lacking the dimerization domain makes R:R intermonomer contacts through the cGMP bound at CNB-A and at a kink in the interdomain linker between the two CNBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Disrupting this interface with point mutations increases the activation constant in dimeric full-length PKG Iβ, suggesting a role for the domain:domain contacts that mediate this interface in stabilizing the activated state of the holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2016</xref>) despite the AI sequences tethered in proximity to the C-domains.</p><p>Here, we present the first crystal structure of PKG Iβ in which the regulatory domain is free of cyclic nucleotide and adopts an AI state bound to the catalytic domain. The R:C interface reveals specific contacts between the PKG Iβ AI sequence and the active site that help to explain isoform-specific activation constants and the activating effects of phosphorylation in the linker. Comparison with the structures of isolated PKG R- and C-domains shows that the R-domain undergoes local conformational changes and domain rearrangements to assemble a surface that contacts the catalytic core of the C-domain and inhibits its activity. We also present a high-resolution structure of the CNB-A domain with the TAAD mutation, which reveals a closed cGMP pocket. The similarity of this mutant domain to wildtype cGMP-bound structures and its differences with the open pocket in the AI enzyme explain the constitutive activation of the holoenzyme in TAAD. We show that PKG Iβ auto-inhibition is mediated by contacts within each monomer of the native full-length dimeric protein, and using the available structural and biochemical data we develop a model for the regulation and activation of PKGs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall structure</title><p>The asymmetric unit contains two PKG Iβ 71–686 peptide chains (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for domain structure) without cGMP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The shortest connecting path in the crystal (about 15 Å) could be spanned by a kinked helix to give a dimer inhibited in trans, with the R-domain of one monomer bound to the C-domain of the other, while the alternative path for a cis-inhibited dimer could be spanned by an extended loop (about 35 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

These interactions are unique to PKG Iβ compared to the PKA RIα:C complex. Linker residue P83 stacks with the H420 side chain, which donates a hydrogen bond to the phosphate moiety of pT532 and shields it from solvent, and the T84 side chain hydroxyl and backbone amide donate hydrogen bonds to the phosphate of pT532, which is held in place by two hydrogen bonds from the R498 side chain and one from the T530 side chain (right zoom-in panel of site 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Replacing the analogous PKG Iα phosphorylatable threonine (T517) with alanine results in loss of kinase activity, while replacing it with glutamate retains basal activity, indicating that phosphorylation at this site of the activation loop is required for catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feil et al., 1995</xref>).

Phosphorylated S80 could not be sterically accommodated and would experience charge repulsion with the phosphorylated activation loop and αC helix of the C-domain. At the analogous position in PKG Iα, the phospho-mimetic mutation S65D constitutively activates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Busch et al., 2002</xref>; this mutation can be accommodated in our structure only by adjusting the Q417 rotamer away from the AI and pointing the S65D rotamer away from the C-domain. We note that mutations S65A in PKG Iα and S80A in PKG Iβ both raise basal kinase activity twofold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Busch et al., 2002</xref>), presumably due to loss of the S80 hydroxyl contacts with Q417 and A81 and the associated destabilization of the R:C interface.</p><p>The interdomain helices and the CNB-B αA helix shield the rest of the activation loop from solvent (left zoom-in panel of site 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Loss of this contact explains the decreased cGMP affinity, but it is not obvious why the intact enzyme should be activated.

Since the RQ mutation does not alter folding or prevent adoption of the closed conformation, we propose that the CNB-A sequence is biased to adopt the closed state. Such bias would explain why CNB-A binds cGMP 18-fold tighter than CNB-B despite largely conserved contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim and Sharma, 2021</xref>): CNB-B samples the open state more strongly, so more free energy of binding is needed to drive the equilibrium to the closed state.

PKG Iβ lacking the LZ domain elutes from gel filtration columns as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Richie-Jannetta et al., 2003</xref>), and a monomeric PKG Iβ lacking the first 55 residues has low basal activity in the absence of cGMP, showing that the monomer is capable of auto-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Because auto-inhibition of the native dimeric enzyme might occur in cis or in trans, we used engineered full-length PKG Iβ heterodimers to assess any roles of interchain communication in regulating PKG activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan et al., 2020</xref>). In this method, cells are cotransfected with an untagged ‘active’ PKG and with a Flag-tagged ‘dead’ PKG bearing a point mutation that renders the kinase domain catalytically inactive. When protein is isolated with anti-Flag agarose and eluted with Flag peptide, the resulting purified kinase is a mixture of dead–dead homodimers and dead–active heterodimers; in assays, activity comes only from the heterodimers. In this system, introducing mutations in the dead chain cannot affect the kinase activity of that chain (intrachain effect), since the active site is mutated, so any changes in activity must result from interchain effects. We prepared constructs that mutated K75 and R76 to glutamate (KR/EE), reasoning that this would destabilize the auto-inhibited R:C state through charge repulsion at the active site.</p><p>We performed kinase assays under basal conditions (no cGMP) and activating conditions (10 μM cGMP) using Flag-tag purified protein from four separate cotransfections that pair Flag-tagged kinase-dead PKG Iβ (with or without the KR/EE mutation) with untagged kinase-active PKG Iβ (with or without the KR/EE mutation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). With wildtype active chain, low levels of activity are seen in the absence of cGMP, indicating auto-inhibition, and high levels of activity are seen with cGMP, consistent with activation. When the KR/EE mutation is present on the active chain, similar high activity levels are seen with or without cGMP, indicating that little or no auto-inhibition occurs. We infer that dimeric PKG Iβ undergoes auto-inhibition primarily in cis. The activity of the KR/EE mutant active chain is slightly lower when paired with a wildtype Flag-tagged partner than when paired with the mutant, indicating that the wildtype AI may provide some modest inhibition in trans. The basal kinase activity of the untagged wildtype chain is slightly higher when it is associated with the dead chain bearing the KR/EE mutation (5.4% of maximum) rather than the wildtype AI (3.1% of maximum), suggesting that the presence of a second copy of the AI in trans may modestly enhance auto-inhibition of the heterodimer.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The PKG Iβ AI sequence does not contribute to activation through interchain contributions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Anti-Flag pulldown of a Flag-tagged (blue) catalytically ‘dead’ PKG Iβ (X) permits isolation of heterodimers containing an untagged ‘active’ PKG Iβ (pink) from cotransfected cells.

The Iα-specific LZ, linker, and hinge regions that contribute to cGMP-mediated activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ruth et al., 1997</xref>) might combine to sterically restrict (relative to PKG Iβ) how AI diffusion samples its environment to access the kinase active site cleft.

However, auto-inhibited monomeric PKG Iβ LZ deletion mutants are activated by cGMP without exhibiting cooperativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Døskeland et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wall et al., 2003</xref>), so dimerization is dispensable for auto-inhibition but essential for cooperative activation. We propose that intermonomer interactions in the activated state provide the basis for cGMP cooperative activation. If each monomer of an LZ-mediated dimer has two bound cGMP, the PBC-A and bent interdomain helices of one monomer can associate with the same regions of the other monomer to which it is tethered and assemble into an antiparallel R:R interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). The formation of this interface further stabilizes the activated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, bottom right). This assembly helps sustain kinase activation since it occupies much of the R-domain surface that would otherwise be free to associate with the C-domain; it also shields the bound cGMP from solvent, which reduces the rate at which it might be released and degraded by phosphodiesterases. Fixing the CNB domain orientations in this complex may also influence access of the AI sequence to the kinase active site. Dynamic assembly and disassembly of the R:R interface and release and rebinding of cGMP would allow the occupancy of the R:R state to be coupled to the instantaneous cGMP concentration; when cGMP levels fall, the R:R state will be depopulated, and the R-domain will be available to interact with and inhibit the C-domain.</p><p>In this model of cGMP-mediated PKG activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), the rapid, reversible sampling of states is biased away from the auto-inhibited enzyme default by PBC conformational changes from ‘open’ to ‘closed’ that are coupled to binding of cGMP. Because cAMP can bind to the CNBs and induce the closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">VanSchouwen et al., 2015b</xref>), the model predicts that cAMP will act as a partial agonist for the holoenzyme, especially through binding to CNB-A, which discriminates poorly between cGMP and cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lorenz et al., 2017</xref>). Mutations that favor the PBC ‘closed’ state, or that favor the conformational changes that occur in response to the ‘open’ to ‘closed’ transition, will also favor activation. The activating effect of the CNB-A RQ mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2013</xref>) reflects destabilization of the auto-inhibited state we describe here.</p><p>The model can be expanded by adding states of the holoenzyme, including those with bound inhibitors. The cGMP analog <italic>R<sub>P</sub></italic>-cGMPS is a PKG inhibitor that makes many of the same contacts as cGMP with the isolated CNB-B domain, but the PBC loop does not close to contact the phosphorothioate sulfur, and the adjacent helix does not reposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Binding of <italic>R</italic><sub>P</sub>-cGMPS can therefore occupy the CNB-B site, competing with any cGMP that is present without disrupting the CNB-B αA- and αB-helix contacts with the C-domain, explaining why this cGMP analog does not block basal activity but inhibits activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campbell et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The activation model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) can explain the substrate dependence of the PKG Iβ cGMP activation constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) when its states are expanded to include competition between inter- and intramolecular binding at the active site. Substrate binding, which can occur even in the absence of cGMP when the AI sequence makes a transient excursion, pulls the coupled equilibria of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> to the right. The degree to which the activation constant shifts should depend on the affinity and concentration of the peptide, which determine the bound fraction in competition with binding by the AI sequence. Substrate-induced shifting of the activation curve rules out models in which substrate binding occurs only after activation; the coupled equilibria imply that every species in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> with a free active site cleft can reversibly adopt a corresponding substrate-bound state. Colocalization of PKG Iβ with targets through its isotype-specific N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casteel et al., 2005</xref>) may therefore not only influence the choice of substrate but also enhance the degree to which the enzyme is activated.</p><p>Although the auto-inhibited state described here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, bottom left) fixes the relative positions of the CNBs and C-domain within one monomer, in other states the interdomain linkers may allow a monomer to behave more dynamically, like domain beads on a string. The shorter linker and the distinct LZ and hinge regions of PKG Iα may decrease the opportunities for random diffusion to juxtapose the AI with the active site cleft, resulting in a lower AI effective local concentration at the active cleft for PKG Iα compared to Iβ. This physical rationale would explain why PKG Iα shows minimal substrate dependence in its cGMP activation constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>): substrates will compete better with an AI that more rarely accesses the active site cleft. This rationale may also explain how changes to Iα-specific residues outside the AI impact activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ruth et al., 1997</xref>). Mutation C43S substantially increases the cGMP activation constant for PKG Iα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalyanaraman et al., 2017</xref>), which could be explained by the loss of a C43-mediated disulfide in the LZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qin et al., 2015</xref>) that increases dynamic motions and facilitates AI access to the kinase active site cleft.</p><p>This model and our structure provide rationales for how changes in the AI affect PKG Iα and Iβ isoform cGMP activation constants and fractional basal activities by affecting AI contacts with the active site, but they do not provide detailed insights as to how the sequences and structures of the isoform-specific LZs and other elements in the N-terminal domain might affect access to any of the states in the model. The only explicit role for the LZs in the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> is to promote sampling of the R:R state, whose interacting residues are present in both isoforms; how isoform differences might structurally influence access to this state is not known since the LZs were truncated in the construct crystallized here. Explanations for some of the observed functional differences between the Iα and Iβ isoforms await more detailed models, and perhaps structures of full-length enzyme isoforms in different states of activation or inhibition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construct design, protein expression, and purification of PKG Iβ (71–686)</title><p>The sequence encoding human PKG Iβ (residues 71–686) was cloned into pBlueBacHis2A vector with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease site before coding sequence.

The regulatory interactions in PKG Iβreveal similarities and differences to the way in which the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) regulatory domain inhibits the PKA catalytic subunit. The new structure of the activating PKG Iα R177Q CNB-A domain mutant, which resembles a cGMP-bound wild-type CNB-A domain, provides a nice explanation for how this point mutation activates PKG Iα and leads to the development of the TAAD (Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms and Dissections) syndrome.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79530.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Hunter</surname><given-names>Tony</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03xez1567</institution-id><institution>Salk Institute for Biological Studies</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Hunter</surname><given-names>Tony</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03xez1567</institution-id><institution>Salk Institute for Biological Studies</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Ping</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.04.28.489861">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.28.489861v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Tony Hunter as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ping Zhang (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The three reviewers are in general agreement that your nearly-full-length human PKG1β structure is a significant advance in our understanding of the regulation of PKG by cGMP. No new experimental analysis is essential, although additional structure-function validation would strengthen your conclusions. However, all the reviewers agree that the paper is too long and difficult to read, and needs to be shortened and rewritten so that the main conclusions about how activity is held in check in the absence of cGMP, how cGMP binding activates PKG, and the extent to which the regulation of PKG is similar to and differs from that of the PKA C subunit by the R subunit and cAMP are more clearly articulated in each section. In addition, it would be useful to include some further discussion of why PKG is a dimer and whether there is functional crosstalk between the two monomers in a dimer, if negative regulation of kinase activity can be achieved through purely intramolecular interactions. In addition, a comparison of the human PGK1β structure with that of the full length <italic>P. falciparum</italic> PKG structure (doi: 10.1073/pnas.1905558116) would be informative. Some additional specific suggestions for improvement can be found in the individual reviews. We look forward to receiving a revised version.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The main essential revision is to undertake a major rewrite of the paper to shorten it and make clear the main conclusions in each section regarding the mechanisms of negative regulation of PKG kinase activity in the absence of cGMP and how it is activated upon binding cGMP, and how these mechanisms are similar to and differ from the regulation of the PKA C subunit by the R subunit and cAMP.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper is very long and was a hard slog to read through, and there may be a very limited number of people who will take the trouble to do this. The detailed discussion often obscures the main take home conclusion in each section. When the paper is rewritten and shortened to make the main conclusions clearer, perhaps some of the key interactions could be summarized in a graphic table instead of being described in detail in the text.</p><p>The functional consequences on PKG Iβ kinase activity and cGMP regulation of some additional mutations in key residues proposed to be involved in autoinhibition would strengthen the authors conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript will be very well-suited for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, once the following comments are addressed.</p><p>– The cooperative nature of cGMP binding is mentioned in the introduction (line 58), however in the model (Figure 8), it is not clear of cGMP binding is cooperative only within a R/C dimer, or with two dimers in a full length R2/C2 tetramer. One approach would be to determine Hill coefficients to establish if the binding and activation by cGMP is cooperative in the tetramer.</p><p>It would be interesting to explain and develop further why PKG exists as a R-C:R-C homodimer and whether there is crosstalk between the two R-C monomers. One issue that is not addressed by the manuscript explicitly is the cooperativity of cGMP binding in full-length PKGIβ homodimer. The cooperative nature of cGMP binding is mentioned in the introduction (line 58), however in the model (Figure 8), it is not clear of cGMP binding is cooperative only within a R-C monomer, or with two R-C monomers in a full length R-C:R-C dimer. One approach would be to determine Hill coefficients to establish if the binding and activation by cGMP is cooperative in the R-C:R-C dimer</p><p>One general comment is that the manuscript is very long (over 50 pages when printed, 8 figures). Please consider streamlining the manuscript – you may consider condensing some of the discussion of the interfaces and moving parts of it to a supplementary material section or table.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have no technical/experimental concerns with the work, it appears to be technically sound on all fronts and is an important advance suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Suggestions for improving presentation:</p><p>1. I feel that contrast/compare with PKA is given short shrift. I want to know what is the same and what is different, and it is not easy to get that at a glance. That it looks almost the same as PKA (if indeed it does) does not make the present structure less interesting. Perhaps we could learn this right from the start, in the &quot;overall structure&quot; section?</p><p>2. The authors frequently &quot;bury the lede&quot; as they say in the newspaper trade. For example, the overall structure section starts out talking about individual domains and how they differ from previous structures of isolated domains. Actually, I am not sure they ever get around to describing the overall structure in this section, but there is a picture of it in Figure 1. Why not start with something like: In the autoinhibited state, the cyclic-nucleotide binding domains bind on either side of the kinase C-lobe, positioning the autoinhibitory segment to bind as a pseudosubstrate at the kinase active site. This overall organization is (essentially the same as/ similar to/ reminiscent of) that of protein kinase A….</p><p>3. In figure 1b, it is hard to get a sense of the structure of the kinase domain, and where on the kinase domain the regulatory domain is binding. At a minimum, labeling N- and C-lobes would help. Or perhaps a ribbon representation of the kinase would be better? Maybe with semi-transparent surface?</p><p>4. Would also be nice to get the comparison with PKA into Figure 1. (there is a nice superposition in Figure 3). Certainly up to the authors to decide what to describe/include in their manuscript, but I think it would be interesting and helpful to have a comparison of R:C contacts of PKA vs PKG, perhaps in the form of a sequence alignment with symbols to represent the various interdomain interfaces. What is conserved and what is unique to PKG?</p><p>5. Is there experimental evidence (beyond the prior crystal structure 4Z07) for dimerization of the CNB domain module in the nucleotide-bound state? If not, the text/figures describing the reorientation of these domains between autoinhibited and active (dimerized) states feels over-done.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79530.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The main essential revision is to undertake a major rewrite of the paper to shorten it and make clear the main conclusions in each section regarding the mechanisms of negative regulation of PKG kinase activity in the absence of cGMP and how it is activated upon binding cGMP, and how these mechanisms are similar to and differ from the regulation of the PKA C subunit by the R subunit and cAMP.</p></disp-quote><p>We have significantly shortened the main text and attempted to state the regulation and activation mechanisms mediated by dynamic R-C interactions.

The formation of this interface further stabilizes the activated state (Figure 8, bottom right). This assembly helps sustain kinase activation since it occupies much of the R-domain surface that would otherwise be free to associate with the C-domain; it also shields the bound cGMP from solvent, which reduces the rate at which it might be released and degraded by phospho­diesterases (line 481-488, pp 18-19).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One issue that is not addressed by the manuscript explicitly is the cooperativity of cGMP binding in full-length PKGIβ homodimer.
