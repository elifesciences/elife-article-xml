hypofunction caused by irradiation (IR) therapy for head and neck cancer remains lack of effective treatments. Salivary glands, especially the parotid gland, actively uptake dietary nitrate and secrete it into saliva. Here, we investigated the effect of dietary nitrate on the prevention and treatment of IR-induced parotid gland hypofunction in miniature pigs, and elucidated the underlying mechanism in human parotid gland cells. We found that nitrate administration prevented IR-induced parotid gland damage in a dose-dependent manner, by maintaining the function of irradiated parotid gland tissue. Nitrate could increase sialin expression, a nitrate transporter expressed in the parotid gland, making the nitrate-sialin feedback loop that facilitates nitrate influx into cells for maintaining cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. Furthermore, nitrate enhanced cell proliferation via the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–protein kinase B (AKT)–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in irradiated parotid gland tissue. Collectively, nitrate effectively prevented IR-induced xerostomia via the EGFR–AKT–MAPK signaling pathway. Dietary nitrate supplementation may provide a novel, safe, and effective way to resolve IR-induced xerostomia.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Head and neck cancers are commonly treated using radiotherapy, where a beam of high-energy radiation is targeted at the tumour. This often severely damages the surrounding salivary glands, leading to chronic dry mouth and impairing a patient’s sense of taste, nutrient intake, speech and immune system. Despite this significant impact on quality of life, there is no effective treatment yet for this side effect.</p><p>In the body, salivary glands are one of the primary users of a compound known as nitrate, which is commonly found in the diet. In the glands, it is ushered into cells thanks to a protein known as sialin. The nutrient supports the activity and maintenance of the glands, before it is released in the saliva. Feng, Wu et al. therefore decided to test whether nitrate could offer protection during neck and head radiotherapy.</p><p>The experiments used miniature pigs, which have similar salivary glands to humans. The animals that received sodium nitrate before and after exposure to radiation preserved up to 85% of their saliva production. By comparison, without any additional nitrate, saliva production fell to 20% of pre-radiation levels.</p><p>To understand how this protective effect emerged, Feng, Wu et al. added nitrate to cells from a human salivary gland known as the parotid. This led to the cells producing more sialin, creating a feedback loop which increases the amount of nitrate in the salivary glands. Further examination then showed that the compound promotes growth of cells and reduce their death. These findings therefore suggest that clinical studies may be worthwhile to test if nitrate could be used to prevent dry mouth in head and neck cancer patients who undergo radiotherapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>miniature pig</kwd><kwd>sus scrofa</kwd><kwd>minipig</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd><kwd>Mini pig</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82030031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Songlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91649124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Songlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81600883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Songlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chinese Research Unit of Tooth Development and Regeneration, CAMSI Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 2019-12M-5-031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Songlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009592</institution-id><institution>Beijing Municipal Science &amp; Technology Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. Z181100001718208</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Songlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003213</institution-id><institution>Beijing Municipal Education Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 119207020201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Songlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Beijing Hospitals Authority of Hospitals’ Mission Plan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>code:SML20151401</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Songlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dietary nitrate supplementation could effectively prevent irradiation therapy-induced xerostomia for patients with head and neck cancer, providing a novel, safe, and effective way to resolve this issue.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lindsey et al., 2012</xref>). Irradiation (IR) is an important treatment approach for HNC. Salivary glands, which are often included in the IR field, are highly radiosensitive, and IR often results in salivary gland hypofunction. IR destroys salivary gland acinar cells, the sole site of fluid transport in the gland parenchyma, resulting in xerostomia, which severely impacts quality of life for affected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhide et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies and Thompson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mercadante et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Acinar cells in salivary glands include both serous and mucous cell types. Serous acinar cells are much more radiosensitive than mucous acinar cells. Notably, the parotid gland consists solely of serous acinar cells, which makes the parotid gland more radiosensitive than the submandibular and sublingual gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grundmann et al., 2009</xref>). As such, the parotid gland provides an excellent model organ to study IR-induced salivary gland hypofunction. Many studies have attempted to treat salivary hypofunction using gene transfer, stem cell transplantation, or salivary gland regeneration. These studies have elucidated the mechanisms involved in xerostomia, and allowed for the development of new treatments for xerostomia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vissink et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vissink et al., 2015</xref>). However, most of these treatment modalities are therapeutic and thus beneficial for patients with established xerostomia (i.e., when salivary glands are severely damaged) and have not been adequately resolved IR-induced xerostomia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vissink et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, there have been no studies on the prevention of IR-induced xerostomia. New approaches for the prevention of IR-induced xerostomia are urgently required to maintain the tissue architecture of the parotid gland even after IR treatment.</p><p>Inorganic nitrate is a component of the human diet, and is found in vegetables, fruits, and drinking water. At least 25% of circulating nitrate is actively taken up by salivary glands (via sialin) and secreted into saliva, such that the concentration of nitrate in saliva is approximately tenfold greater than that in blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Omar et al., 2016</xref>). Nitrate has been shown to offer protection against diseases such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gilchrist et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khambata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kina-Tanada et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lundberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McNally et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Omar et al., 2016</xref>). Sialin (<italic>Slc17a5</italic>) is a transmembrane protein expressed most abundantly in the acinar cells of the parotid gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qin et al., 2012</xref>). Sialin transports nitrate and other essential cellular substances such as glutamate and aspartate, and contributes to the maintenance of acinar cells physiological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qin et al., 2012</xref>). It is unclear why sialin is most strongly expressed in the parotid gland and facilitates nitrate influx into the gland. The interaction of sialin and nitrate is unique to the parotid gland and not found in other organs. It is highly likely that the interaction between nitrate and sialin contributes to the maintenance of parotid gland homeostasis.</p><p>The parotid glands of mice and rats are not similar to those of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 1998</xref>). We previously demonstrated that the parotid glands of miniature pigs have similar anatomical and physiological characteristics to those of human parotid glands. Then we established miniature pig model of IR-induced parotid gland hypofunction using single-dose or fractionated IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, we investigated the preventive and therapeutic effects of dietary nitrate supplementation on IR-induced salivary gland hypofunction using an established miniature pig model, and characterized the mechanism underlying these effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nitrate prevents but does not correct IR-induced parotid gland hypofunction in vivo</title><p>First, we investigated whether inorganic nitrate could prevent or treat IR-induced xerostomia.

We found that nitrate supplementation enhanced hPGCs cell proliferation via EGFR–AKT–MAPK signaling pathway. Therefore, dietary nitrate administration may be an effective novel approach for the prevention of IR-induced xerostomia.</p><p>In the present study, nitrate increased serous acinar and ductal cell proliferation rates, and increased MVD. Each of these parameters is crucial for maintenance of salivary gland homeostasis and restoration of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aure et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ekström et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weng et al., 2018</xref>). We showed a close interaction between nitrate and sialin in vivo using a miniature pig model and in vitro using hPGCs, demonstrating a nitrate-sialin feedback loop in which the nitrate increased sialin expression and sialin facilitated nitrate influx into cells. It is the sialin-mediated nitrate transportation that plays a critical role in maintaining proliferation and survival of parotid gland epithelial cells; nitrate plays a dominant role in preventing IR damage and sialin acts as a nitrate transporter. Preventive nitrate administration increased sialin expression, promoted acinar and ductal cell proliferation, and reduced apoptosis via the EGFR–AKT–MAPK signaling pathway. However, nitrate administration could not reverse IR-induced damage when sialin expression was sharply reduced. These findings explained why preventive, but not therapeutic, nitrate administration was effective in our in vivo large animal study.</p><p>Several treatments have shown beneficial effects against IR-induced xerostomia, such as antioxidants (e.g., amifostine), gene transfer of human aquaporin 1 cDNA (<italic>hAQP1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baum et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delporte et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vitolo and Baum, 2002</xref>), fibroblast growth factor-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2014</xref>), or sonic hedgehog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu et al., 2018</xref>), intraperitoneal injection of the immune inhibitor rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>), stem cell transplantation, and salivary gland regeneration.

However, cost, uncertain efficacy, potential side effects, tolerance issues, immunogenicity, and/or ethical issues have delayed translation of these therapeutic strategies to the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grundmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vissink et al., 2015</xref>). Our study showed that administration of inorganic nitrate significantly blunted IR-induced parotid gland hypofunction when administered prior to IR. In miniature pigs, nitrate administration resulted in preservation of approximately 85% of secretory function and maintenance of nearly normal morphology at the highest dose provided in this study (2 mmol/kg∙day). In addition, nitrate administration contributed to maintenance of levels of saliva constituents (e.g., amylase). Furthermore, inorganic nitrate lacks immunogenicity, is not subject to tolerance, is not toxic, and does not induce significant side effects at the doses employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Omar et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although nitrate is a natural substance present in the human diet, it has been regarded as a potential carcinogen for decades, and is generally believed to be harmful. However, recent studies failed to provide evidence for this assumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bryan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hezel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khambata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McNally et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xie et al., 2016</xref>). In 2011, the World Health Organization published a guideline regarding nitrate and nitrite in drinking water which stated that nitrate is not carcinogenic, based on both laboratory animal studies and epidemiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Organization, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Nitrate occurs in two forms: organic and inorganic. Dietary nitrate is in the inorganic form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xia et al., 2015</xref>). Although organic nitrate has been used for the treatment of cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Omar et al., 2016</xref>), it has several notable disadvantages that limit its application in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Omar et al., 2012</xref>), which include poor absorption, low oral bioavailability due to first-pass metabolism in the liver, better effectiveness via sublingual, transdermal, or rectal administration, short half-life, development of tolerance resulting from long-term administration, and side effects such as headache and postural hypotension. Conversely, inorganic nitrate has a simple ionic structure that is easily absorbed, exhibits high oral bioavailability, has a long half-life, and causes no side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khambata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xia et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, inorganic nitrate appears to comprise a safe and effective treatment for IR-induced salivary gland hypofunction.</p><p>The best dose of sodium nitrate used in the miniature pig in the in vivo study was 2 mmol/kg·day. The coefficient of drug administration from pigs to humans was 0.73; thus, the dose converted to human was 1.46 mmol/kg·day. For example, an adult weighing 60 kg might have to take 7 g sodium nitrate per day, which is considered a relatively high dose. However, the parotid gland of miniature pigs received 60 Gy IR doses in our study, and the period of irradiation lasted for only 5 days receiving 7.5 Gy each day. When HNC patients receive IR, the IR period lasts for two months and they receive only 2 Gy daily, and the total dose would not be given to the parotid gland as most doses are focused on the tumor. In this case, the parotid gland of patients with HNC could not receive as strong a dose as the experimental animals in this study. Taken together, although the nitrate intake from diet food was 3–7 mg/kg per day for clinical treatment (an adult weighing 60 kg takes 0.18–0.42 g sodium nitrate per day) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashworth and Bescos, 2017</xref>), it is considered that the dose for clinical treatment could be well tolerated by humans.</p><p>Dietary nitrate can be metabolized into nitric oxide (NO) via the nitrate–nitrite–NO pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lundberg et al., 2008</xref>). NO is an important gaseous signaling molecule that participates in many physiological processes, including stimulation of reparative angiogenesis and reduction of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sengupta et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sessa, 2009</xref>). Under hypoxic or acidic conditions, NO synthesis primarily occurs via the nitrate–nitrite–NO exogenous pathway. Notably, IR induces a hypoxic and acidic environment within salivary glands. Dietary nitrate supplementation results in NO production and reduces hypoxia by inducing a prolonged increase in blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lundberg et al., 2008</xref>), and increased gland microvascularization, which is beneficial for production of saliva by acinar cells. Furthermore, nitrate-mediated NO formation also increases sialin expression and upregulates EGFR-AKT-MAPK signaling pathways, the classical pathways that are responsible for promoting cell proliferation, maintaining cell survival, and preventing cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sabbah et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>However, nitrate is a stable substance that cannot be all metabolized to NO under IR, while sialin expression increases after nitrate administration, which helps sialin transport more nitrate into cells. It is considered that, except for NO, there are other mechanisms involved in preventing IR damage. It has been revealed that nitrate is related to mitochondrial respiration, activation of key metabolic regulatory pathways, and reduction of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lundberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lundberg et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, more detailed mechanisms, including nitrate regulation of mitochondrial functions, should be the focus of future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, nitrate administration preserves miniature pig parotid gland function and protects the parotid gland against IR damage. The underlying mechanism involves the sialin-mediated nitrate transportation that maintains salivary gland homeostasis and prevents IR damage via the EGFR–AKT–MAPK signaling pathways. Dietary nitrate is therefore a potential treatment modality for IR-induced salivary gland hypofunction and it appears worthwhile to test in clinical studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Revisions are suggested by each of the reviewers, including more discussion of limitations of the evidence for the role of EGFR signaling, nitrate signaling and free radicals.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Xerostomia, a frequent side-effect of radiotherapy to the head and neck, can compromise dental health, nutrition and speech. As a result, affected patients often experience a significant decline in their quality of life. Current measures used to prevent or manage radiation-induced xerostomia are often ineffective. In the present study, the authors set out to determine whether dietary supplementation with inorganic nitrate might be a useful approach to the prevention and/or management of this important manifestation of radiation toxicity.</p><p>The in vivo studies were based on the miniature pig, a previously established model of salivary gland dysfunction that recapitulates many of the radiation responses observed in human tissues. Dietary nitrate was administered either prophylactically, prior to irradiation, or therapeutically to irradiated animals. Pre-treatment with nitrate resulted in the preservation of salivary gland function, longitudinally assessed by salivary flow rate and local blood flow, in animals that were subsequently treated with clinically-relevant doses of ionizing radiation. Histologically, these pre-treated animals also exhibited elevated levels of acinar glad proliferation and lower levels of local fibrosis, a late effect of radiotherapy that is observed in human patients. In striking contrast, nitrate supplementation administered after irradiation did not appear to ameliorate these long-term toxicities.</p><p>Molecular analyses of parotid tissues supported these impressive clinical observations, as did in vitro studies of human parotid gland cells. An important finding was the dose-dependent relationship between nitrate administration and the expression of the transmembrane protein sialin. Sialin acts as a local transporter of nitrate and was shown here to enhance proliferation and suppress apoptosis in this cell type, in what the authors describe as a positive feedback loop. This novel hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for the observed clinical and histological effects of nitrate pre-treatment.</p><p>The mechanistic studies of how sialin might trigger cell proliferation were exclusively focused on the activity of the EGFR-AKT-MAPK pathway. The activation of this pathway by sialin and nitrate seemed real, but modest in magnitude. Compared to the other sections, this part was somewhat underdeveloped. From the data presented, it is difficult to conclude that EGFR activation would account for the dramatic clinical and histologic effects of pre-treatment. This is a relatively minor weakness, which could be addressed by adding further context to the discussion. Overall, this was a rigorous study that presents a new, highly translatable approach to radiation-induced xerostomia.</p><p>The question of whether the EGFR-AKT-MAPK is responsible for the observed effects could simply be addressed in a revised discussion. It would suffice to mention the caveat that additional pro-proliferative or anti-apoptotic mechanisms, not addressed in this study, could conceivably be involved.</p><p>Second, it might also be helpful to contextualize the doses of sodium nitrate used in vivo. Would similar dosage in humans be tolerable? What was the level of nitrates in the non-supplemented feed? In the average human diet?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Manuscript of &quot;Dietary nitrate supplementation prevents radiotherapy-induced xerostomia&quot; by Xiaoyu Feng, et al., is an interesting article. The presented data suggest that nitrate, dietary nitrate supplementation, effectively prevented radiotherapy-induced-induced xerostomia via the EGFR-AKT-MAPK signaling pathway, suggesting that dietary nitrate supplementation may provide a novel, simple, safe and effective way to prevent IR-induce xerostomia.

The best dose of sodium nitrate used in the miniature pig in the in vivo study was 2 mmol/kg·day. The coefficient of drug administration from pigs to humans was 0.73; thus, the dose converted to humans was 1.46 mmol/kg·day. For example, for an adult weighing 60 kg, they might have to take 7 g sodium nitrate per day, which is considered a relatively high dose. However, the parotid gland of miniature pigs received 60 Gy irradiation doses in our study, and the period of irradiation lasted for only five days receiving 7.5 Gy each day. When head and neck cancer patients receive irradiation, the irradiation period lasts for two months and they receive only 2 Gy daily, and the total dose would not be given to the parotid gland as most doses are focused on the tumor. In this case, the parotid gland of patients with head and neck cancer could not receive as strong a dose as the experimental animals in this study. Taken together, although the nitrate intake from diet food was 3–7 mg/kg per day for clinical treatment (an adult weighing 60 kg takes 0.18–0.42 g sodium nitrate per day) (Ashworth and Bescos, 2017), it is considered that the dose for clinical treatment could be well tolerated by humans. We have addressed this issue in the Discussion (page 12, lines 1–12) section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Following comments are needed to clarify.</p><p>1.

If authors don't know yet, hope authors can try to understand these in their future study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks very much for the reviewer 2’s comments. Inorganic nitrate can be metabolized into a free radical, nitric oxide (NO), via the nitrate–nitrite–NO pathway, especially under hypoxic or acidic conditions. Irradiation can induce a hypoxic and acidic environment within the salivary glands. Nitrate administration could increase NO levels to exert protective effects of NO.</p><p>However, nitrate is a stable substance that cannot be all metabolized to NO under irradiation, while sialin expression increases after nitrate administration, which helps sialin transport more nitrate into cells. It is considered that, except for NO, there are other mechanisms involved in preventing IR damage. It has been revealed that nitrate is related to mitochondrial respiration, activation of key metabolic regulatory pathways, and reduction of oxidative stress (Lundberg, Carlström, Larsen, and Weitzberg, 2011; Lundberg et al., 2018). Thus, more detailed mechanisms, including nitrate regulation of mitochondrial functions, should be the focus of future studies.</p><p>We have addressed this issue in the Discussion (page 12, lines 25, 26; page 13, lines 1–5) section of the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
