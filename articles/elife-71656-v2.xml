In metazoa, RtcB functions as part of a five-subunit tRNA ligase complex (tRNA-LC) along with Ddx1, Cgi-99, Fam98B, and Ashwin. The human tRNA-LC or its individual subunits have been implicated in additional cellular processes including microRNA maturation, viral replication, DNA double-strand break repair, and mRNA transport. Here, we present a biochemical analysis of the inter-subunit interactions within the human tRNA-LC along with crystal structures of the catalytic subunit RTCB and the N-terminal domain of CGI-99. We show that the core of the human tRNA-LC is assembled from RTCB and the C-terminal alpha-helical regions of DDX1, CGI-99, and FAM98B, all of which are required for complex integrity. The N-terminal domain of CGI-99 displays structural homology to calponin-homology domains, and CGI-99 and FAM98B associate via their N-terminal domains to form a stable subcomplex. The crystal structure of GMP-bound RTCB reveals divalent metal coordination geometry in the active site, providing insights into its catalytic mechanism. Collectively, these findings shed light on the molecular architecture and mechanism of the human tRNA ligase complex and provide a structural framework for understanding its functions in cellular RNA metabolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tRNA splicing</kwd><kwd>ligase</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>helicase</kwd><kwd>x-ray crystallography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kroupova</surname><given-names>Alena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P29888</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Asanović</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name><name><surname>Weitzer</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name><name><surname>Martinez</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006447</institution-id><institution>University of Zurich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FK-18-033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kroupova</surname><given-names>Alena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jinek</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Leitner</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005788</institution-id><institution>Medical University of Vienna</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinez</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007204</institution-id><institution>Vallee Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jinek</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical and structural investigations of the human tRNA ligase complex reveal the details of its molecular assembly and provide insights into the reaction mechanism of its catalytic subunit.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA ligases play critical roles in various cellular processes including tRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lopes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Phizicky and Hopper, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Popow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yoshihisa, 2014</xref>), unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bashir et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Filipowicz, 2014</xref>), RNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burroughs and Aravind, 2016</xref>), and generating U6/LINE-1 chimeric RNA retrotransposition substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moldovan et al., 2019</xref>). Canonical ligases, including bacteriophage T4 RNA ligase 1 or <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> tRNA ligase Trl1, are ATP-dependent enzymes that catalyze the formation of a 3′,5′-phosphodiester linkage between 3′-hydroxyl (3′-OH) and 5′-phosphate (5′-P) RNA termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">El Omari et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Greer et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nandakumar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Peebles et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Peschek and Walter, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Unciuleac et al., 2015</xref>). In tRNA splicing and other processes requiring the joining of RNA ends with a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (2′,3′&gt;P) and a 5′-hydroxyl (5′-OH), these ligases operate as part of a multistep mechanism including separate phosphatase and kinase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Remus et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sawaya et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xu et al., 1990</xref>). By contrast, the RtcB ligases are GTP-dependent enzymes that catalyze the direct joining of RNA strands with terminal 2′,3′&gt;P and 5′-OH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chakravarty et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tanaka and Shuman, 2011</xref>). In contrast to the mechanism of canonical RNA ligases, in which the source of the splice-junction phosphate group is the ATP cofactor, RtcB ligases incorporate the substrate-derived 2′,3′&gt;P into the resulting 3′,5′-phosphodiester bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Filipowicz and Shatkin, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Popow et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>RtcB ligases are present throughout all domains of life with notable absences in plants and some fungi, including the model organisms <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dantuluri et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Popow et al., 2012</xref>). Although their catalytic mechanism is conserved, their substrates and consequently their cellular functions vary considerably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Englert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Popow et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Popow et al., 2012</xref>). In archaea and eukaryotes, RtcB enzymes catalyze the ligation of tRNA exon halves to produce mature tRNAs upon cleavage of precursor tRNA transcripts by the tRNA splicing endonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calvin and Li, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Peebles et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Trotta et al., 1997</xref>). Furthermore, in eukaryotes, RtcB ligases also function as part of the UPR to catalyze splicing of <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA after its stress-induced cleavage by IRE1 (inositol-requiring enzyme 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jurkin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kosmaczewski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). In turn, bacterial RtcB ligases are nonessential enzymes involved in RNA repair, for example, during rescue of ribosomal RNAs cleaved by the MazF ribonuclease of the MazE-MazF toxin-antitoxin system activated upon stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Manwar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Temmel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The RNA ligation mechanism of RtcB enzymes consists of three nucleotidyl transfer steps. First, a nucleophilic attack of an invariant histidine residue in the active site (His428 in human RTCB, His404 in <italic>Pyrococcus horikoshii</italic> RtcB, PhRtcB, and His337 in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RtcB, EcRtcB) on the α-phosphate moiety of guanine-5′-triphosphate (GTP) results in a covalently linked RtcB-GMP intermediate with the concomitant release of inorganic pyrophosphate. Second, the terminal 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate of the 5′ exon is hydrolyzed to 3′-phosphate, which subsequently carries out a nucleophilic attack on the phosphate group of RtcB-GMP conjugate to form an activated RNA-(3′)pp(5′)G intermediate. Finally, the activated 3′ end of the 5′ exon undergoes nucleophilic attack by the 5′-OH of the 3′ exon, resulting in exon ligation and release of GMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakravarty and Shuman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chakravarty et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Desai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Englert et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Crystallographic and biochemical studies of PhRtcB have identified interactions responsible for positioning the 3′ exon and the 5′-OH nucleophile in the final strand-joining step of the ligation reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maughan and Shuman, 2016</xref>); in contrast, the exact positioning of the 5′ exon in the active site remains to be determined. The ligation reaction of RtcB enzymes is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, consistent with the observation of two active site-bound Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions in the crystal structures of PhRtcB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Das et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tanaka and Shuman, 2011</xref>). Some RtcB orthologs, including human RTCB and PhRtcB, require Archease, a dedicated protein cofactor that facilitates the initial guanylation of RtcB and promotes its multiple turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Desai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Popow et al., 2014</xref>). This is thought to involve a conserved metal binding site in Archease that might influence the positioning of the divalent metal cations in the active site of RtcB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Desai et al., 2015</xref>). The catalytic activity of human RTCB was recently shown to be sensitive to copper-mediated oxidative inactivation under aerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asanović et al., 2021</xref>). The inactivation is counteracted by the oxidoreductase PYROXD1, which protects the active site of RTCB by forming a complex with RTCB in the presence of NAD(P)H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asanović et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The human RtcB ligase ortholog RTCB, also referred to as HSPC117 or FAAP, is part of an essential heteropentameric tRNA ligase complex (tRNA-LC), along with the DEAD-box helicase DDX1, as well as FAM98B, CGI-99 (also known as RTRAF or hCLE), and ASHWIN (ASW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Popow et al., 2011</xref>). RTCB is the only subunit of tRNA-LC that is essential and sufficient for RNA ligation, but it requires the protein cofactor Archease for multiple-turnover catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Popow et al., 2014</xref>). DDX1 enhances the RTCB-catalyzed RNA ligation via its RNA-dependent ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Popow et al., 2014</xref>), but it is also involved in other cellular processes including DNA double-strand break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2008</xref>), microRNA maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Han et al., 2014</xref>), regulation of insulin translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2018</xref>), or regulation of viral replication including HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Edgcomb et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fang et al., 2004</xref>), foot-and-mouth disease virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xue et al., 2019</xref>), infectious bronchitis virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2010</xref>), and SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kamel et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, it remains unclear whether these cellular functions are mediated by DDX1 in isolation or within the tRNA-LC. While CGI-99, FAM98B, and ASW have no effect on the RNA ligation activity of tRNA-LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Popow et al., 2011</xref>), CGI-99 was shown to function as a transcription modulator in viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huarte et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rodriguez-Frandsen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rodriguez et al., 2011</xref>). However, its mechanism of action, as well as the functions of FAM98B and ASW, is unknown.</p><p>Despite previous studies on archaeal and bacterial RtcB enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chakravarty et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Das et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Desai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Englert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Englert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maughan and Shuman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Okada et al., 2006</xref>), our understanding of the mechanism of human RTCB function in the context of the tRNA-LC is incomplete. Here, we present a biochemical analysis of the inter-subunit interactions of the human tRNA ligase complex, along with crystal structures of the N-terminal domain of CGI-99 and the catalytic subunit RTCB in complex with guanosine-5′-monophosphate (GMP).

To be able to unambiguously identify the presence of each subunit, DDX1 and FAM98B were fused to mCherry and green fluorescent protein (GFP), respectively. Additionally, RTCB was tagged with a hexahistidine (His<sub>6</sub>) tag, while CGI-99 carried a streptavidin-binding (StrepII) tag and ASW was fused N-terminally with the maltose-binding protein (MBP). Affinity purifications from insect cells infected with expression constructs lacking one of the subunits revealed that deletion of any of RTCB, DDX1, FAM98B, or CGI-99 resulted in failure of the remaining four subunits to form a stable complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Only ASW, a 26 kDa, intrinsically disordered protein with no conserved domains other than a leucine-rich region and two nuclear localization signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Patil et al., 2006</xref>), could be omitted without compromising complex assembly. These results indicate that the integrity of tRNA-LC is dependent on the simultaneous presence of RTCB, DDX1, FAM98B, and CGI-99, suggesting that these subunits form a stable core of tRNA-LC. This conclusion is consistent with the evolutionary conservation of tRNA-LC subunits, whereas DDX1, FAM98B, and CGI-99 display similar phylogenetic distribution, ASW is absent from many organisms where the other subunits of tRNA-LC are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Popow et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, affinity purifications of MBP-tagged ASW or StrepII-tagged CGI-99 revealed that in the absence of either DDX1 or RTCB, ASW forms a complex together with CGI-99 and FAM98B, but not with either of these subunits alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Additionally, CGI-99 and FAM98B were able to form a stable subcomplex in the absence of all other tRNA-LC subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the interaction of ASW with tRNA-LC is dependent on the CGI-99:FAM98B subcomplex and is likely mediated through the CGI-99:FAM98B interface.</p><p>Previous studies showed the conserved cofactor Archease to be essential for the guanylation of RTCB and its enzymatic turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Popow et al., 2014</xref>). Although RTCB binds Archease with nanomolar affinity, Archease does not co-purify with RTCB when the latter is affinity-purified from HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Popow et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that Archease only transiently interacts with the tRNA-LC. To test whether Archease interacts stably with the tRNA-LC in vitro, we analyzed the interaction between recombinant purified Archease and tRNA-LC (containing subunits RTCB, DDX1, FAM98B, and CGI-99) by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In agreement with previous studies, tRNA-LC and Archease eluted in separate peaks, indicating that Archease does not form a stable complex with the tRNA-LC in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Molecular topology of tRNA-LC</title><p>To investigate the molecular architecture and subunit connectivity of tRNA-LC, affinity-purified samples of both the five-subunit full complex and the four-subunit core complex were analyzed using cross-linking coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) to identify subunit regions involved in inter-subunit interactions. To this end, purified complexes were treated with disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) to form covalent cross-links between lysine residues within a distance of approximately 35 Å, and cross-linked peptides were identified by MS. Analyzing two experimental replicates for each complex, we identified 103 or 143 validated intra-subunit and 104 or 141 validated inter-subunit cross-links for the five-subunit full complex and 156 or 146 validated intra-subunit and 102 or 92 validated inter-subunit cross-links for the four-subunit core complex (with a false discovery rate of &lt;5%). Overall, this experiment revealed an extensive network of intra- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and inter-subunit cross-links (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). 66 of the inter-subunit cross-links involving RTCB, DDX1, CGI-99, and FAM98B were detected in both the four-subunit and five-subunit complex samples. The C-terminal region of DDX1 formed numerous cross-links with the remaining subunits of the five-subunit complex, with the exception of FAM98B, suggesting that the interaction of DDX1 with the remaining subunits within tRNA-LC is mediated by the C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For RTCB and FAM98B, the cross-links also mapped mostly to their respective C-terminal regions, while CGI-99 cross-links were spread throughout its primary structure. ASW formed cross-links with all remaining subunits, particularly via its N-terminal region. A notable reduction of cross-links between the C-terminal regions of DDX1 and FAM98B was observed in the five-subunit full complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) as compared to the four-subunit core complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that ASW is positioned between DDX1 and FAM98B or modulates their conformations. It is important to note, however, that formation of cross-links between protein regions depends not only on their spatial proximity but also on their conformational flexibility and the availability of lysine residues within them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tüting et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cross-linking mass spectrometry analysis of the inter-subunit interactions within the five-subunit tRNA-LC (RTCB:DDX1:FAM98B:CGI-99:ASW).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Inter-subunit cross-links between RTCB, DDX1, CGI-99, and FAM98B subunits within the five-subunit full tRNA-LC are shown as dashed lines.

Interestingly, the overall level of overexpressed FAM98B was reduced in the absence of CGI-99, indicating that CGI-99 has a stabilizing effect on FAM98B in the cell. To pinpoint the interacting regions of CGI-99 and FAM98B, we performed co-precipitation assays. As FAM98B could not be expressed and purified in isolation, we instead expressed full-length and truncated FAM98B constructs as N-terminal GFP fusions in HEK293T cells and subsequently incubated cell lysates with purified GST-tagged CGI-99 constructs immobilized on a Glutathione Sepharose resin. The N-terminal domain of CGI-99 (Phe2-Asp101<sup>CGI-99</sup>) was able to co-precipitate a minimal FAM98B construct spanning residues Arg2-Lys184<sup>FAM98B</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), indicating that the CGI-99:FAM98B interaction is dependent on both the N-terminal CH domain and a predicted beta-hairpin motif (residues Glu145-Lys184<sup>FAM98B</sup>) in FAM98B, and the N-terminal CH domain in CGI-99. In contrast, the putative C-terminal coiled-coil regions of CGI-99 and FAM98B were dispensable for the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the formation of the CGI-99:FAM98B heterodimer is mediated by the respective N-terminal regions of the subunits and suggest that the N-terminal CH-like domains of CGI-99 and FAM98B may comprise an independently functioning module within tRNA-LC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>C-terminal regions of DDX1, FAM98B, and CGI-99 mediate the assembly of the core tRNA ligase complex</title><p>DDX1 is an 82 kDa DEAD-box helicase comprising two canonical RecA-like domains (RecA1 and RecA2), an atypical SPRY domain inserted in the N-terminal RecA1 domain and a C-terminal extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kellner and Meinhart, 2015</xref>).

Based on the cross-linking/mass spectrometry analysis (XL-MS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we reasoned that DDX1 interacts with the remaining subunits of tRNA-LC via its C-terminal region. To test this, we coexpressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells full-length RTCB, CGI-99, and FAM98B with a truncated DDX1 construct comprising residues Ser436-Phe740<sup>DDX1</sup>, lacking the RecA1 and SPRY domains. Following affinity purification, SEC analysis confirmed integrity of the complex, indicating that the C-terminal region of DDX1, comprising the RecA2 domain and the C-terminal extension, is sufficient to support tRNA-LC assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The purified complex was subsequently subjected to limited proteolysis with trypsin in order to identify exposed, protease-sensitive regions such as flexibly linked domains or unstructured loops. MS analysis of fragments separated by SEC revealed DDX1 cleavage, resulting in the loss of a fragment spanning residues Ser436-Arg694<sup>DDX1</sup> corresponding to the RecA2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). In light of the previously demonstrated requirement of DDX1 for tRNA-LC integrity, this result implies that the C-terminal extension of DDX1, corresponding to residues Ala695-Phe740<sup>DDX1</sup>, is sufficient to mediate tRNA-LC assembly.</p><p>Guided by these results, we set out to identify the minimal subunit regions sufficient for tRNA-LC assembly. As with the initial deletion analysis of the full-length tRNA-LC subunits, we designed polypromoter constructs for coexpression in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, with the following tagging scheme: His<sub>6</sub>-RTCB, MBP-FLAG-DDX1, mCherry-CGI-99, and GFP-FAM98B. Each set of constructs contained N- or C-terminal truncations of one of the subunits with the others remaining full-length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Co-precipitation experiments revealed that a minimal fragment of DDX1 corresponding to the C-terminal extension (residues Ala696-Phe740<sup>DDX1</sup>) was sufficient for the assembly of the four-subunit core tRNA-LC. In contrast, neither a shorter C-terminal DDX1 construct (residues Leu729-Phe740<sup>DDX1</sup>) nor a DDX1 construct containing the RecA1 and RecA2 domains but lacking the C-terminal extension (residues Ala2-Ala695<sup>DDX1</sup>) were able to support tRNA-LC assembly. For both CGI-99 and FAM98B, we observed that their N-terminal domains, although sufficient for the CGI-99:FAM98B interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), were dispensable for tRNA-LC assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Instead, a CGI-99 fragment spanning residues Ala195-Asp232<sup>CGI-99</sup> was essential and sufficient for the formation of the core complex. The minimal region of FAM98B that was essential and sufficient for tRNA-LC assembly could be mapped to a region spanning residues Asn200-Ser239<sup>FAM98B</sup>. Notably, these regions are predicted to have a propensity for forming alpha-helical coiled coils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lupas et al., 1991</xref>), while the C-terminal extension of DDX1 is predicted to form an alpha-helix.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The C-terminal regions of DDX1, CGI-99, and FAM98B facilitate the formation of the core tRNA ligase complex.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Truncation analysis of the core tRNA-LC (RTCB:DDX1:FAM98B:CGI-99).

Despite considerable progress, there remain gaps in our understanding of its cellular function and its molecular architecture, particularly with respect to the noncatalytic subunits of the complex. In this study, we provide insights into the inter-subunit interactions within tRNA-LC, as well as high-resolution structures of its catalytic subunit RTCB and the N-terminal CH domain of CGI-99.</p><p>Using coexpression experiments complemented with XL-MS, we show that a four-subunit core complex is assembled by the C-terminal regions of DDX1, CGI-99, and FAM98B together with the catalytic domain of the RTCB subunit. Each of the three noncatalytic subunits is required for the integrity of the complex, suggesting that they function synergistically to generate an interaction platform for RTCB. As the C-terminal regions of DDX1, FAM98B, and CGI-99 are predicted to be alpha-helical and, in the case of CGI-99 and FAM98B to form coiled-coils, we hypothesize that they associate to form a helical bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The C-terminal extension of DDX1 required for tRNA-LC assembly is located outside the helicase core comprising the tandem RecA1 and RecA2 domains and the SPRY domain. This suggests that the helicase (DDX1) and ligase (RTCB) modules of tRNA-LC are flexibly linked, which may serve to facilitate interactions with a diverse array of RNA substrates. The molecular architecture of tRNA-LC might also play a role in regulating the enzymatic activity of the ligase subunit RTCB, as suggested by our biochemical analysis of full-length and truncated complexes, and isolated RTCB.</p><p>In addition, the CGI-99 and FAM98B subunits of tRNA-LC form a stable heterodimer through an independent interaction interface involving their N-terminal domains. This heterodimer further serves as an interaction platform for the recruitment of ASW, the fifth tRNA-LC subunit. The existence of CGI-99:FAM98B or CGI-99:FAM98B:ASW subcomplexes in vivo has not been reported to date, and it is currently unclear whether they have a biological role independent from tRNA-LC. CGI-99 was previously shown to form a denaturation-resistant homodimer under certain conditions, although only monomeric CGI-99 is associated with the other subunits of tRNA-LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pérez-González et al., 2014</xref>). Consistently, we have not observed CGI-99 dimerization in vitro.</p><p>Our crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of CGI-99 confirms that it shares similarities with CH domains, which are typically found in a range of signaling and cytoskeletal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gimona et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Korenbaum and Rivero, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yin et al., 2020</xref>). The CH1- and CH2-type CH domains occur in tandem in proteins such as α-actinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shams et al., 2016</xref>), β-III-spectrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avery et al., 2017</xref>), or dystrophin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Singh and Mallela, 2012</xref>) and mediate their binding to F-actin. Contrary to the tandem CH1-CH2 domains, CH3-type occur as stand-alone domains at the N-termini of proteins such as calponin. Apart from actin binding, CH domains have also been found to mediate interactions with microtubules (MT). The end-binding protein 1 (EB-1) regulates microtubule dynamics, with its N-terminal CH domain being essential for its MT interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hayashi and Ikura, 2003</xref>). Similarly, the CH domains of NDC80 and NUF2 in the NDC80 kinetochore complex mediate MT binding, although unlike in EB-1 this is conditional on the formation of the NDC80-NUF2 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ciferri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wei et al., 2007</xref>). Our structural analysis reveals that the CH-like domain of CGI-99 exhibits closest structural homology to the microtubule binding NDC80-like family of CH domains, as proposed by an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schou et al., 2014</xref>). There is, however, no evidence to date to indicate that CGI-99 and FAM98B, or indeed tRNA-LC, interact with MTs or other cytoskeletal proteins. Nevertheless, tRNA-LC has been implicated in several cytoskeleton-related processes, including RNA transport along microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kanai et al., 2004</xref>) and regulation of cell-adhesion dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hu et al., 2008</xref>). CGI-99 was also found to interact with the tubulin binding protein PTPIP51 (protein tyrosine phosphatase interacting protein 51) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brobeil et al., 2012</xref>) and the centrosomal protein ninein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Howng et al., 2004</xref>). Further studies will be necessary to understand whether the CH-like domain of CGI-99, perhaps together with the putative CH N-terminal domain of FAM98B, facilitates a cytoskeleton-related cellular function of tRNA-LC or plays another functional role.</p><p>The crystal structure of human RTCB determined in this study reveals a product-bound state containing GMP and two divalent cobalt ions in the active site. The structure uncovers the disposition of the active site residues, contradicting previous predictions based on homology modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nandy et al., 2017</xref>). The observed metal coordination geometries are also distinct from those found in the crystal structures of the apo and guanylated intermediate states of PhRtcB. The RTCB structure shows that the metal ion A is tetrahedrally coordinated, instead of adopting octahedral coordination as observed in the Mn<sup>2+</sup>-bound PhRtcB structures. Unlike the prokaryotic RtcB orthologs, human RTCB is active in the presence of Co<sup>2+</sup> ions, suggesting that the Co<sup>2+</sup>-bound RTCB structure represents an on-pathway state and not a catalytically inhibited complex. One possible explanation for the discrepancy between the RTCB and PhRtcB structures is that the divalent metal ion coordination geometries dynamically vary throughout the RtcB catalytic mechanism, thereby facilitating the individual reaction steps of enzyme guanylation, 5′-exon activation and exon ligation. Moreover, it is conceivable that active site positions A and B are occupied by nonidentical metal ions under physiological conditions in vivo. The question of metal ion selectivity of RtcB enzymes thus remains unresolved. Additional structural studies of intermediate catalytic states and different metal ion-bound complexes will thus be needed to uncover whether the observed plasticity of metal ion coordination in RtcB active site plays a role in the catalytic mechanism. Finally, both RTCB and the entire tRNA-LC were recently shown to be redox-regulated and to undergo oxidative inactivation in the presence of copper, suggesting that the binding of copper ions in the active site promotes oxidation of the active site cysteine (Cys122<sup>RTCB</sup>), thus precluding proper divalent metal coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asanović et al., 2021</xref>). The NAD(P)H-dependent interaction of RTCB with PYROXD1 counteracts this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asanović et al., 2021</xref>). However, the precise chemical mechanism by which PYROXD1 protects RTCB is currently unknown. Furthermore, the RNA substrate binding mechanism of RTCB is likewise not fully understood. Previous mutational studies of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>P. horikoshii</italic> RtcB enzymes have implicated conflicting sets of amino acid residues in exon RNA recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Englert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maughan and Shuman, 2016</xref>). Although a recent crystal structure of PhRtcB bound to a 5′-OH 3′DNA oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2021</xref>) revealed the residues involved in 3′ exon binding, additional structures of RtcB enzymes bound to the 5′ exon or to both exons simultaneously will be required to pinpoint the precise position of the 2′,3′&gt;P end, to identify the active site residues involved in catalyzing the hydrolysis of the 2′,3′&gt;P into a 3′-P intermediate, thus providing further insights into the latter steps of the ligation reaction beyond the initial guanylation of RtcB.</p><p>In conclusion, this work provides fundamental insights into the molecular architecture of the human tRNA-LC, paving the way for its further structural and mechanistic studies. These will shed light on specific molecular determinants of inter-subunit interactions and the ways in which they support the catalytic activity as well as putative noncatalytic functions of the complex, thereby advancing our understanding of tRNA-LC in metazoan RNA metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression and purification of five-subunit tRNA-LC (RTCB:DDX1:FAM98B:CGI-99:ASW)</title><p>DNA encoding human RTCB (UniProt Q9Y3I0) and CGI-99 (UniProt Q9Y224) was each inserted into the UC Berkeley MacroLab 438A vector (gift from Scott Gradia, Addgene plasmid #55218) using ligation-independent cloning.

All of the reviewers have made suggestions regarding presentation of the work. Please address these as thoroughly as possible. In addition, it was the general consensus that the metal specificity experiments suggested by reviewer 2 would add substantively to the paper.

Indeed, the minimal complex is just as active as RTCB alone (all in the presence of archease). This is a remarkable finding that needs to be discussed and placed in a biological context. Is there a reason for limiting the activity of RTCB by encumbering it in the context of the tRNA ligase complex? Or perhaps the results are a function of the use of an &quot;artificial&quot; substrate in the ligation assays, which score for intramolecular circularization of a 21-mer RNA. I would consider a scenario in which the other components of the complex impart specificity to RtcB for broken tRNA substrates over non-specific RNA with ligatable ends. This is exactly the case for T4 Rnl1, which is 100-fold better at sealing a broken tRNA than at intramolecular circularization (Wang LK et al., 2007 RNA). The upshot is that the authors ought to assay in this study the sealing of a pre-cleaved tRNA substrate by the various forms of the ligase interrogated in supplemental panel B.

I think it is generally accepted that RtcB enzymes require manganese as the divalent cation cofactor. (The ligation assays in the present study are performed in the presence of manganese). The authors note differences in metal coordination geometry between their cobalt structure and previous manganese structures of PhoRtcB, and they suggest that the geometries might be dynamic during the several chemical steps of the RtcB ligation pathway. The critical issue here is whether a cobalt complex is actually off-pathway, insofar as extensive studies of <italic>E. coli</italic> RtcB have shown that cobalt is unable to serve as a cofactor for (i) RtcB reaction with GTP to form the RtcB-GMP intermediate; (ii) GMP transfer to a polynucleotide 3'-phosphate to form the polynucleotide 3'ppG intermediate; or (iv) attack of a 5'-OH strand on the 3'ppG end to complete the ligation reaction. Moreover, and most important, cobalt is inhibitory to each of these reactions in the presence of manganese. These data are most simply explained by cobalt binding to one or both metal sites in a non-productive off-pathway state. Thus, it is critical for the authors to present in this study an experiment that tests whether cobalt can support human RTCB ligation and whether it inhibits in the presence of manganese.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Kroupova and colleagues present the manuscript &quot;Molecular Architecture of human tRNA ligase complex&quot; which describes the first detailed dissection of the structure and assembly of the essential, multi-subunit tRNA ligase complex.

Protein-mediated RNA splicing may date back to the ancient RNA-protein world where it might have served to defend RNA against invading introns. RTCB-like RNA ligases such as found in the human tRNA ligase complex act in numerous cellular pathways including bacterial RNA repair, and they follow a highly interesting and complex but structurally poorly understood mechanism that joins RNA 5'-hydroxyl ends with 3'-ends that carry a 2'-3' cyclic phosphate. Although the components of the human tRNA ligase complex are known and although there is crystal structural information on archaeal RTCB homologs, the function of the non-enzymatic components and the structural organization of the complex are unknown.</p><p>The quality of the data in Kroupova et al., and their presentation in the manuscript is outstanding, which is easy to follow even for general readers. The authors carefully avoid to over-interpret their cross-linking data, although some remarks on this as outlined in my detailed remarks may benefit readers who are less familiar with this method. The methods are described with exceptional detail and information and will be extremely useful to scientists who plan similar approaches for their own protein complexes of choice and especially if these are still too undefined and/or flexible to be amenable for direct structural analysis by X-ray crystallography or single-particle cryo-electron microscopy.</p><p>This is a prime example for an analytic biochemical approach with modern methodology to a challenging problem in structural biology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71656.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All of the reviewers and the reviewing editor found this to be a significant contribution that in principle is suitable for eLife.

We agree that the observation of reduced activity of the fulllength 5- and 4-subunit tRNA-LC complexes when compared with RTCB alone or the minimal tRNALC (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) is intriguing. One the one hand, this could suggest that activity of the 5- or 4-subunit complexes is autoinhibited, and thus potentially regulated, by the non-catalytic subunits via protein regions or domains that are not involved in complex assembly. On the other, this finding could also be explained by a limited stability of the holo- and core complexes under the conditions employed for the ligase activity assay, resulting in reduced specific activities of these species. For this reason, we would prefer to remain cautious so as not to overinterpret the results. We mention this result explicitly on p. 9, lines 241-248, and briefly discuss its potential significance in the Discussion section.</p><p>Autoinhibition of the tRNA-LC would potentially add another layer to its regulation, alongside the recently reported sensitivity to oxidative stress. We tested whether the autoinhibition can be relieved in the presence of ATP to probe whether the ATPase activity of DDX1 is possibly involved. However, the addition of ATP had no effect under the conditions tested, suggesting that DDX1 does not play a role. Although the results shown in Figures S1B and S1C might represent a single snapshot of a more complex regulatory landscape, we believe that a more extensive analysis of the tRNA-LC activity and its regulation falls outside of the scope of the present manuscript.</p><p>Regarding the choice of the substrate, we agree with the Reviewer that it might conceivably impact the experimental outcome, although we have previously shown that the human tRNA-LC is quite nonselective with respect to RNA substrates. We thus chose a cautious interpretation of the presented data in this manuscript, which we would aim to use as a starting point for a future comprehensive study of the regulation of the tRNA-LC aided by our current and ongoing structural work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The structure of human RTCB is of a complex with two cobalt ions in the active site. I think it is generally accepted that RtcB enzymes require manganese as the divalent cation cofactor. (The ligation assays in the present study are performed in the presence of manganese). The authors note differences in metal coordination geometry between their cobalt structure and previous manganese structures of PhoRtcB, and they suggest that the geometries might be dynamic during the several chemical steps of the RtcB ligation pathway.

Thus, it is critical for the authors to present in this study an experiment that tests whether cobalt can support human RTCB ligation and whether it inhibits in the presence of manganese.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that the question of the divalent metal selectivity of human RTCB is important for the correct interpretation of the structural data. To address this issue, we have carried out additional ligase activity assays to determine the selectivity of RTCB and the full-length, 4-subunit tRNA-LC, and present the results in Figure 6 —figure supplement 1 and describe them on p. 10, lines 252-255. Unlike <italic>E. coli</italic> RtcB, human RTCB is highly active in the presence of either Mn<sup>2+</sup> or Co<sup>2+</sup> ions, and detectably active in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>. These results would suggest that the Co<sup>2+</sup> complex captured in the crystal structure depicts an on-pathway state in the catalytic mechanism of RTCB. It is currently unclear whether Mn<sup>2+</sup> or Co<sup>2+</sup> is the physiologically relevant ion in vivo, and we cannot exclude the possibility that the two active site positions are occupied by different divalent cations under physiological conditions (e.g. Mg<sup>2+</sup> in site A and Mn<sup>2+</sup> or Co<sup>2+</sup> in site B), as we note in the Discussion section of the manuscript (p. 13-14, lines 341-357). Despite extensive efforts, we have so far been unable to grow RTCB crystals from a crystallization solution lacking divalent metals, so as to be able to perform metal soaking experiments. We agree that further experiments and experimental approaches, for example inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis of natively-purified tRNA-LC, will be needed to characterize the divalent metal requirements of human RTCB and tRNA-LC but we believe that these studies fall outside of the scope of the current manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
