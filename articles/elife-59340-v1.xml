Programming languages might ‘recycle’ neurocognitive mechanisms originally developed for natural languages. Alternatively, comprehension of code could depend on fronto-parietal networks shared with other culturally-invented symbol systems, such as formal logic and symbolic math such as algebra. Expert programmers (average 11 years of programming experience) performed code comprehension and memory control tasks while undergoing fMRI. The same participants also performed formal logic, symbolic math, executive control, and language localizer tasks. A left-lateralized fronto-parietal network was recruited for code comprehension. Patterns of activity within this network distinguish between ‘for’ loops and ‘if’ conditional code functions. In terms of the underlying neural basis, code comprehension overlapped extensively with formal logic and to a lesser degree math. Overlap with executive processes and language was low, but laterality of language and code covaried across individuals. Cultural symbol systems, including code, depend on a distinctive fronto-parietal cortical network.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>computer programming</kwd><kwd>cultural recycling</kwd><kwd>fronto-parietal</kwd><kwd>logic</kwd><kwd>language</kwd><kwd>executive control</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007880</institution-id><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bedny</surname><given-names>Marina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Computer code comprehension shares neural resources with formal logical inference in the fronto-parietal network.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 1800, only twelve percent of the world’s population knew how to read, while today the world literacy rate is over eighty-five percent (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ourworldindata.org/literacy">https://ourworldindata.org/literacy</ext-link>). The ability to comprehend programming languages may follow a similar trajectory. Although only an estimated 0.5% of the world’s population is currently proficient at computer programming, the number of jobs that require programming continues to grow. Coding is essential in scientific fields and in areas as diverse as artistic design, finance, and healthcare. As many industries incorporate artificial intelligence or other information technologies, more people seek to acquire programming literacy. However, the cognitive and neural mechanisms supporting coding remain largely unknown. Apart from its intrinsic and societal interest, programming is a case study of ‘neural recycling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dehaene and Cohen, 2007</xref>). Computer programming is a very recent cultural invention that the human brain was not evolutionarily adapted to support. Studying the neural basis of code offers an opportunity to investigate how the brain performs novel complex skills.</p><p>Hypotheses about how the human brain accommodates programming range widely. One recently popular view is that code comprehension recycles mechanisms developed for human language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fedorenko et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fitch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pandža, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Portnoff, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Prat et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with this idea, a recent study reported that individual differences in the ability to learn a second language predict aptitude in learning to program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Prat et al., 2020</xref>). Computer languages borrow letters and words from natural language and, in some programming languages like Python, the meanings of the borrowed symbols (e.g. <monospace>if, return, print</monospace>) relate to the meanings of the same symbols in English. As in natural languages, the symbols of code combine generatively according to a set of rules (i.e. a formal grammar). The grammars of language and that of code share common features, including recursive structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fitch et al., 2005</xref>). In natural languages, a phrase can be imbedded within another phrase of the same syntactic category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hauser et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Analogously, in programming languages, data structures, such as lists and trees, can be recursive and a function can call itself. For example, in Python, IF conditionals can be embedded within IF conditionals:<code xml:space="preserve">if (condition_1):
        if (condition_2):
                print('Both conditions are True.')
        else:
                print('Condition_1 is True, condition_2 is False.')
else:
        print('Condition_1 is False. Condition_2 not evaluated.')</code></p><p>To give another textbook example, the factorial of a positive integer N can be computed using a recursive Python function:<code xml:space="preserve">def factorial(N):
        return N*factorial(N-1) if (N &gt; 1) else 1</code></p><p>Here, the function ‘<monospace>factorial</monospace>’ is called in the definition of itself. Given these similarities between programming languages and natural languages, one possibility then is that coding recycles neurocognitive mechanisms involved in producing and comprehending natural language. Other culturally-invented symbol systems, such as formal logic and mathematics do not appear to depend on the same neural network as natural language. Like code, formal logic and mathematics borrow symbols from language and are also hierarchical and recursive (e.g. (7*(7*(3+4)))). Unlike language, however, culturally-invented symbol systems are explicitly taught later in life. Computer coding, mathematics and logic, all involve manipulation of arbitrary variables without inherent meaning (e.g. <monospace>X, Y, input, ii</monospace>) according to a set of learned rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McCoy and Burton, 1988</xref>). While each symbol system has its own conventionalized way of referring to variables and its own set of rules — indeed, these aspects differ somewhat among programming languages — there are nevertheless many common features. For example, conditional and other connectives (e.g. <italic>‘if…then’</italic>, <italic>‘and’</italic>, <italic>‘or’</italic>, <italic>‘not’</italic>) occur in both formal logic and programming languages with closely related meanings. Consider a function containing an <monospace>if</monospace> conditional written in Python, <code xml:space="preserve">def fun(input):
        result = &quot;result: &quot;
        if input[0]=='a':
                result + = input[0].upper()
        return result</code></p><p>The value of the ‘<monospace>result</monospace>’ variable depends on whether the ‘<monospace>input</monospace>’ meets the specific conditions of the <monospace>if</monospace> statement. Similarly, in the logical statement ‘<italic>If both X and Z then not Y</italic>’ the value of the result (<italic>Y</italic>) depends on the truth value of the condition ‘<italic>both X and Z</italic>’. One hypothesis, then, is that coding depends on similar neural resources as other culturally-invented symbol systems, such as formal logic and math.</p><p>Rather than recruiting perisylvian fronto-temporal areas, logic and math recruit a fronto-parietal network, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) as well as putative symbol representations (i.e. numberform area) in inferior temporal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amalric and Dehaene, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coetzee and Monti, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Goel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Monti et al., 2009</xref>). This fronto-parietal network overlaps partially with the so-called central executive/working memory system, which is implicated in a variety of cognitive tasks that involve maintaining and manipulating information in working memory, processes that are part and parcel of understanding and writing code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duncan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Letovsky, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Soloway and Ehrlich, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weinberg, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zanto and Gazzaley, 2013</xref>) (for a review of the cognitive models of code comprehension, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Von Mayrhauser and Vans, 1995</xref>). The central executive system is usually studied using simple rule-based tasks, such as the multisource interference task (MSIT), Stroop task, and spatial or verbal working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banich et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bunge et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bush and Shin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">January et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Milham et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Woolgar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zanto and Gazzaley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Logic and math activate a similar network but also have unique neural signatures. Within the PFC, logic in particular recruits more anterior regions associated with more advanced forms of reasoning and symbol manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coetzee and Monti, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ramnani and Owen, 2004</xref>). The degree to which code comprehension relies on the same network as these other cultural symbol systems is not known.</p><p>Only a handful of previous studies have looked at the neural basis of code processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duraes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Floyd et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ikutani and Uwano, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Peitek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Siegmund et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Two studies observed larger fronto-parietal responses when comparing code writing and editing to prose writing and editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Floyd et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krueger et al., 2020</xref>). When comprehension of code was compared to detection of syntactic errors in code, activity in both fronto-parietal and putative language areas was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Siegmund et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Siegmund, 2017</xref>). None of these prior studies localized neural networks involved in language, or cultural symbol systems such as math and logic, in the same participants — leaving the question of direct neural overlap unanswered.</p><p>The goal of the current study was to ask whether basic computer code comprehension has a consistent neural signature across people, and, if so, whether this signature is more similar to those of other culturally-invented symbol systems (i.e. logic and math) or of natural language.</p><p>A group of expert programmers (average 11 years of programming experience) performed a code comprehension task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We chose a comprehension task partly because it could be analogous to understanding language vignettes and because it is arguably simpler than writing or debugging code. On each <italic>real-code</italic> trial, participants saw a short function definition, followed by an input and a possible output, and judged whether the output was valid. In <italic>fake code</italic> control trials, participants performed a memory task with unstructured text. A fake function was generated by scrambling a real function per line at the level of word/symbol. Each fake function preserved the perceptual and lexical elements of a real function, but was devoid of syntactic structure. The <italic>real-code</italic> condition contained two subtypes or ‘control structures’, for loops and if conditionals. We used multi-voxel-pattern analysis to decode for from if functions to test whether the code-responsive cortical system encodes code-relevant information. Finally, we examined the overlap of code comprehension with language (sentence comprehension), formal logic, and mathematical tasks. We also tested overlap of code with the MSIT to determine whether the overlap with culturally-invented symbol systems (i.e. logic and math) is more extensive than with simpler experimentally defined rule-based tasks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioral results</title><p>Accuracy was similar across <italic>real</italic> and <italic>fake code</italic> trials (<italic>real</italic> M = 92%, SD = 0.045; <italic>fake</italic> M = 0.90, SD = 0.069; binary logistic mixed regression, <italic>real</italic> to <italic>fake</italic> odds ratio β = 1.27; Wald’s z statistic, z = 1.21; p=0.23).

In overlap analyses, the code comprehension network was most similar to the fronto-parietal system involved in formal logical reasoning and to a lesser degree math. By contrast overlap with the perisylvian fronto-temporal language network is low. Notably, in the current study, neural responses associated with language, math and logic were localized partly relative to each other (e.g. logic &gt;language). This approach focuses on networks that are uniquely involved in one domain vs. another. The degree to which areas shared across language, logic, and math are implicated in code comprehension remains to be addressed in future work.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Code overlaps with logic</title><p>Code, logical reasoning, math and the MSIT task all activated aspects of the so-called fronto-parietal executive control system. However, overlap of code with logic was most extensive, followed by math and finally the MSIT. The difference between the MSIT task on the one hand and code comprehension, logic and math on the other, was particularly pronounced in the frontal lobe. There only code, logic and math activated more anterior regions of PFC, including BA 46 and BA 9, although logic-associated activation extended even more anteriorly than code. These findings suggest that neural overlap between logic and code is specific, and not fully accounted for by the general involvement of the central executive system. Note that although the logical reasoning task was more difficult than the language task, larger overlap with logic is unlikely to relate to task difficulty since the current overlap analyses control for the overall number of activated vertices.</p><p>Previous studies also find that the fronto-parietal network, including anterior prefrontal areas, are involved in logical reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Prado et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tsujii et al., 2011</xref>). For example, anterior PFC is active when participants solve formal logical problems with quantifiers (e.g. ‘<underline>all</underline> X are Y; Z is a X; therefore Z is Y’) and connectives (e.g. ‘<underline>if</underline> X then Y; not Y; therefore not X’) and plays a key role in deductive reasoning with variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coetzee and Monti, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Goel and Dolan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Monti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Reverberi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reverberi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rodriguez-Moreno and Hirsch, 2009</xref>).</p><p>A fronto-parietal network has also been consistently implicated in math (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Friedrich and Friederici, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maruyama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Piazza et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wendelken, 2014</xref>). Some of the parietal responses to math have been linked to the processing of quantity information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nieder, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nieder and Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Piazza and Eger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Roitman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tudusciuc and Nieder, 2009</xref>). For example, neurons in the IPS of monkeys, code numerosity of dots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nieder, 2016</xref>). However, much of the same fronto-parietal network is also active during the processing of mathematical statements free of digits and arithmetic operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amalric and Dehaene, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amalric and Dehaene, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wendelken, 2014</xref>). In the current study, both the anterior prefrontal areas and parietal areas involved in math also overlapped with code and logical reasoning. Some of this activation could therefore reflect common operations, such as the manipulation of rules and symbols in working memory. On the other hand, the lower overlap between coding and math, as compared to coding and logic, could stem from math uniquely involving quantitative processing in the current study.</p><p>The present evidence suggests that culturally-invented symbol systems (i.e. code comprehension, formal logic and math) depend on a common fronto-parietal network, including the executive system. As noted in the introduction, although each of these symbol systems has its unique cognitive properties, they also have much in common. All involve the manipulation of abstract arbitrary symbols without inherent semantic content (e.g. <monospace>X, Y, input, result</monospace>) according to explicit rules. In the current logical inference and code experimental tasks, mental representations of several unknown variables are constructed (for logic ‘<italic>X</italic>’, ‘<italic>Y</italic>’, and ‘<italic>Z</italic>’, for code ‘<monospace>input</monospace>’ and ‘<monospace>result</monospace>’) and the relationships between them deduced according to rules of formal logic or code.</p><p>There are also important differences between the rules of logical inference and programming. Take ‘if’ conditional judgement for example again. In formal logic, the statement ‘<italic>if P then Q</italic>’ doesn’t imply anything about what happens when <italic>P</italic> is false. On the contrary, in Python and most other programming languages, the statement.<code xml:space="preserve">if condition == True: 
        do_something()</code></p><p>automatically implies that when the condition is false, the function ‘do_something()” isn’t executed, unless otherwise specified. Learning to program involves acquiring the particular set of conventionalized rules used within programming languages and a syntax that specifies how the programming language in question expresses logical operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dalbey and Linn, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pea and Kurland, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pennington, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Robins et al., 2003</xref>). We speculate that such knowledge is encoded within the fronto-parietal network identified in the current study. It is also worth pointing out that although we found substantive overlap between the neural networks involved in code and logic, it is possible that, at a finer neural scale, these functions dissociate. Future studies comparing coders with different levels of expertise should test whether learning to code modifies circuits within the code-responsive neural network identified in the current study and address whether learning to code leads to specialization of a subset of this network for code in particular. A detailed understanding of the neural basis of code will also require development of cognitive models of code comprehension.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The involvement of the multiple-demand executive control system in code comprehension</title><p>Code comprehension showed partial overlap with the MSIT task, particularly in the parietal cortex and in posterior frontal areas.

In one task-switching study, participants maintained a cued rule in working memory and the level of fronto-parietal activity increased with the complexity of the rule maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bunge et al., 2003</xref>).

Such processes, studied in the context of simple experimental tasks, may also play a role in code comprehension.</p><p>Although culturally-invented formal symbol systems and simple experimental rule-based tasks (e.g. MSIT) share cognitive elements, the latter, unlike the former, involve simple rules that specify stimulus response mappings, rather than mental manipulations of variables. An intriguing possibility is that code comprehension and other culturally-invented symbol systems recycle a subset of the neural machinery that originally evolved for the maintenance and manipulation of simpler variables and rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Qin et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Code comprehension and language</title><p>In the current study, perisylvian fronto-temporal network that is selectively responsive to language had low and variable overlap with the neural network involved in code comprehension. The regions that did show some overlap between language and code (i.e. left inferior frontal and middle temporal gyri), have been implicated in high-level linguistic processing, including sentence-level syntax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Friederici, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hagoort, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pallier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fedorenko and Thompson-Schill, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matchin and Hickok, 2020</xref>). The current results therefore do not rule out the possibility that the language system plays some role in code. Nevertheless, on the whole, the results do not support the hypothesis that the language system is recycled for code comprehension (see also Ivanova et al, in press). Previous studies also find that math and formal logic do not depend on classic language networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amalric and Dehaene, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Monti et al., 2009</xref>).

As noted in the introduction, programming languages borrow letters and words from natural language, and both natural language and code have hierarchical, recursive grammars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fitch et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>One possible explanation for low overlap between the perisylvian fronto-temporal language network and code, is that the language system is evolutionarily predisposed to support natural language processing in particular, and is therefore not generalizable even to similar domains, like computer code and formal logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dehaene-Lambertz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fedorenko et al., 2011</xref>). Timing could also play a role. The perisylvian fronto-temporal language network may have a sensitive period of development during which it is most capable of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mayberry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ferjan Ramirez et al., 2016</xref>) By the time people learn to code, the network may be incapable of taking on new cognitive functions. Indeed, even acquiring a second language late in life leads to lower levels of proficiency and responses outside the perisylvian fronto-temporal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hartshorne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnson and Newport, 1989</xref>; ). These observations suggest that domain-specific systems, like the perisylvian fronto-temporal language network, are not always amenable for ‘recycling’ by cultural inventions. The fronto-parietal system might be inherently more flexible throughout the lifespan and thus more capable of taking on new cultural skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Riley et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite lack of direct overlap, lateralization patterns of language and coding were highly correlated across individuals that is those individuals with highly left-lateralized responses to sentences also showed highly left-lateralized responses to code. This intriguing observation suggests that the relationship between code and language may be ontogenetic as well as phylogenetic. It is hard to imagine how code in its current form could have been invented in the absence of language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fitch et al., 2005</xref>). Ontogenetically, code-relevant neural representations might be enabled by the language system, even though they are distinct from it.</p><p>An analogous example comes from the domain of reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dehaene et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McCandliss et al., 2003</xref>). Reading-relevant regions, such as the visual word form area (VWFA), are co-lateralized with the perisylvian fronto-temporal language network across people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cai et al., 2010</xref>).

Analogously, code comprehension may colonize a left-lateralized portion of the central executive system due to its stronger (i.e. within hemisphere) connectivity with the perisylvian fronto-temporal language network.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Relationship to co-published work by Ivanova and colleagues</title><p>The current results are consistent with the co-published study by Ivanova and colleagues. Like the current study, Ivanova et al report the involvement of a fronto-parietal network in code comprehension and low overlap with fronto-temporal language processing systems. The consistency of these two studies is striking in light of the difference in the study designs. While the current study compared code comprehension to a working memory control task with linguistic symbols, Ivanova et al. compared code comprehension to matched verbal descriptions of program-like algorithms. In the current study, the value of input variables was provided only after function presentation, by contrast, the value was stipulated as part of the function in Ivanova et al. While the current study localized the language network using a passive/active sentence comparison task relative to a math control condition, Ivanova and colleagues compared sentence comprehension to a non-word memory control task. Finally, in addition to examining the neural basis of Python comprehension, Ivanova et al also studied the neural basis of ScratchJr and found partially similar results.</p><p>There are also interesting differences across experiments that may relate to differences in design. Both the current study and Ivanova et al’s Python comprehension tasks revealed robust responses on prefrontal cortices, by contrast prefrontal responses to ScratchJr were weaker. Unlike Python, ScratchJr doesn’t declare variables and update their values. Previous studies have implicated anterior prefrontal cortices in variable manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Monti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Diester and Nieder, 2007</xref>). The degree of prefrontal involvement in code comprehension may therefore depend in part on whether variable manipulation is involved. In the current study, we observed strong left-lateralization of code comprehension and co-lateralization of code comprehension and language across people. By contrast, Ivanova and colleagues did not observe left-lateralization of code comprehension. Since Ivanova and colleagues compared code comprehension to a sentence reading task, left-lateralization may have been obscured by subtracting out a left-lateralized pattern associated with sentence processing. Alternatively, the Ivanova study focused on the so- called ‘syntactic’ aspects of code comprehension rather than the semantics of code by comparing code comprehension to matched sentences describing similar algorithms. It is possible that the semantics or algorithmic aspects of code are more left-lateralized. Notably, since the current sample is relatively small (n = 15), any differences between the current study and the Ivanova findings should be interpreted with caution and replicated in future work.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A fronto-parietal cortical network is consistently engaged in expert programmers during code comprehension.

The correct response was ‘true’ for half of the <italic>real-code</italic> trials and half of the <italic>fake code</italic> trials.</p><p>There were six task runs, each consisting of 20 trials, eight <italic>real</italic> if <italic>code</italic>, eight <italic>real</italic> for <italic>code</italic> and four <italic>fake</italic> code trials. Each participant saw a total of 48 for functions (24 per variant), 48 if functions (24 per variant), and 24 <italic>fake</italic> functions (12 fake for, and 12 fake if functions). After each run of the task, participants saw their overall percent correct and average response time. Participants were divided into two groups such that the variants of the functions were counterbalanced across groups; the same participant never saw different variants of the same function. The order of the presentation of the functions was pseudo-randomized and balanced across participants. In total, 192 <italic>real</italic> functions (96 per group) and 48 <italic>fake</italic> functions (24 per group) were used in the experiment. All the functions are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. We permuted the order of the functions systematically such that each participant saw a unique order (see the subsection ‘algorithm for stimulus permutation’ in the appendix).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Localizer Tasks</title><p>During a separate MRI session, participants took part in two localizer experiments. A single experiment was used to localize responses to formal logic, symbolic math, and language using each condition as the control for the others: logic/math/language localizer. The task design was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Monti et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Monti et al., 2012</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kanjlia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Monti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Monti et al., 2012</xref>). On language trials, participant judged whether two visually presented sentences, one in active and one in passive voice, had the same meaning (e.g. ‘<italic>The child that the babysitter chased ate the apple</italic>’ vs ‘<italic>The apple was eaten by the babysitter that the child chased</italic>’). On math trials, participant judged whether the variable X had the same value across two equations (e.g. ‘<italic>X minus twenty-five equals forty-one</italic>’ vs ‘<italic>X minus fifty-four equals twelve</italic>’). On formal logic trials, participant judged whether two logical statements were consistent, where one statement being true implied the other also being true (e.g. ‘<italic>If either not Z or not Y then X</italic>’ vs ‘<italic>If not X then both Z and Y</italic>’).</p><p>Each trial began with a 1 s fixation cross. One member of a pair appeared first, the other following 3 s later. Both statements remained on the screen for 16 s. Participants pressed the right or left button to indicate true/false. The experiment consisted of 6 runs, each containing 8 trials of each type (language/math/logic) and six rest periods, lasting 5 s each. All 48 statement pairs from each condition were unique and appeared once throughout the experiment. In half of the trials, the correct answer was ‘true’. Order of trials was counterbalanced across participants in two lists.</p><p>Although all of the tasks in the language/math/logic localizer contain language stimuli, previous studies have shown that sentences with content words lead to larger responses in the perisylvian fronto-temporal language network than spoken equations or logical statements with variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kanjlia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Monti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Monti et al., 2012</xref>). The perisylvian fronto-temporal language network shows enhanced activity for stimuli that contain meaningful lexical items <italic>and</italic> sentence-level syntax (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fedorenko et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, previous studies have found that responses to language, logic and math when compared to each other were similar to what was observed for each domain relative to independent control conditions (e.g. sentences relative to lists of non-words for language, and easy vs. hard logic problems; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kanjlia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Monti et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Monti et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The multi-source interference task (MSIT) was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bush and Shin, 2006</xref> to engage executive control processes and localize the multiple-demand network. On each trial, a triplet of digits was shown on the screen, two of which were the same. The participant pressed a button (1, 2, or 3) to indicate the identity of the target digit that was different from the distractors. For example, for ‘131’ the correct response is ‘3’; for ‘233’ it is ‘2’. The participants always pressed buttons ‘1’, ‘2’, and ‘3’ with their index, middle, and ring fingers, respectively.</p><p>MSIT consisted of <italic>interference</italic> blocks and <italic>control</italic> blocks, each containing 24 trials (1.75 s each). On interference trials, the location of the target digit was inconsistent with the identity of the digit (e.g. trials such as ‘133’ or ‘121’ did not occur). On control trials, the distractors were always ‘0’, and the target digit was always at the same location as its identity. In other words, there were only three kinds of control trial, namely ‘100’, ‘020’, and ‘003’.</p><p>Participants performed 2 runs of MSIT. Each run began with 15 s of fixation, followed by four interference blocks and four control blocks interleaved, and ended with another 15 s of fixation. Each block lasted 42 s. The order of the blocks was balanced within and between participants. Trial order was arranged such that all 12 interference trials appeared exactly twice in an interference block, and all three control trials appeared exactly six times in a control block. Identical trials never appeared in succession, and the order of the trials was different across all 8 blocks of the same kind.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data acquisition</title><p>MRI data were acquired at the F.M. Kirby Research Center of Functional Brain Imaging on a 3T Phillips Achieva Multix X-Series scanner. T1-weighted structural images were collected in 150 axial slices with 1 mm isotropic voxels using the magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequence. T2*-weighted functional BOLD scans were collected in 36 axial slices (2.4 × 2.4×3 mm voxels, TR = 2 s). We acquired the data in one code comprehension session (six runs) and one localizer session (2 runs of MSIT followed by 6 runs of language/math/logic), with the acquisition parameters being identical for both sessions.</p><p>The stimuli in both the code comprehension and localizer sessions were presented with custom scripts written in PsychoPy3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.psychopy.org/">https://www.psychopy.org/</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Peirce et al., 2019</xref>). The stimuli were presented visually on a rear projection screen, cut to fit the scanner bore, with an Epson PowerLite 7350 projector. The resolution of the projected image was 1600 × 1200. The participant viewed the screen via a front-silvered, 45°inclined mirror attached to the top of the head coil.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>fMRI data preprocessing and general linear model (GLM) analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using Freesurfer, FSL, HCP workbench, and custom in-house software written in Python (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dale et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">WU-Minn HCP Consortium et al., 2013</xref>). Functional data were motion corrected, high-pass filtered (128 s), mapped to the cortical surface using Freesurfer, spatially smoothed on the surface (6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel), and prewhitened to remove temporal autocorrelation. Covariates of no interest were included to account for confounds related to white matter, cerebral spinal fluid, and motion spikes.</p><p>The four <italic>real-code</italic> (<monospace>for</monospace>1, <monospace>for</monospace>2, <monospace>if</monospace>1, <monospace>if</monospace>2) and corresponding <italic>fake code</italic> conditions were entered as separate predictors in a GLM after convolving with a canonical hemodynamic response function and its first temporal derivative. Only the images acquired during the twenty-four-second <italic>function</italic> phase were modeled.</p><p>For the localizer experiment, a separate predictor was included for each of the three conditions (language, math, and logic) modeling the 16 s during which the statement pair was presented, as well as a rest period (5 s) predictor. In the MSIT task, the interference condition and the control condition were entered as separate predictors.</p><p>Each run was modeled separately, and runs were combined within each subject using a fixed-effects model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dale et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). For the group-level analysis across participants, random-effects models were applied, and the models were corrected for multiple comparisons at vertex level with p&lt;0.05 false discovery rate (FDR) across the whole brain. A nonparametric permutation test was further implemented to cluster-correct at p&lt;0.01 family-wise error rate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>ROI definition</title><p>For each participant, four code-responsive functional ROIs were defined to be used in the MVPA analysis. First, random-effects whole-brain univariate analysis for the <italic>real &gt;fake code</italic> contrast revealed four major clusters in the left hemisphere: the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), the posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), the lateral PFC, and the early visual cortex (Occ). These clusters were used to define group search spaces. Each search space was defined by combining parcels from Schaefer et al. that encompassed each cluster (400-parcel map, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>). Next, individual functional ROIs were defined within these clusters by taking the top 500 active vertices for the <italic>real &gt;fake</italic> contrast within each participant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>MVPA</title><p>MVPA was used to distinguish for and if functions based on the spatial activation pattern in code-responsive ROIs. Specifically, we used the support vector machine (SVM) implemented in the Python toolbox Scikit-learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang and Lin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pedregosa et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>For each participant, the spatial activation pattern for each function was defined as the beta parameter estimation of a GLM with each function entered as a separate predictor. Within each ROI in each participant, the 96 spatial patterns elicited by the real functions were collected. Normalization was carried out separately for the for condition and if condition such that in either condition, across all vertices and all functions, the mean was set to 0 and standard deviation to 1. The purpose of the normalization is to eliminate any difference in the baselines of the two conditions while preserving distinctive spatial patterns.</p><p>The whole dataset was split into a training test (90%, 86 functions) and a testing set (10%, 10 functions), where in each set, half of the patterns came from for functions. A linear SVM (regularization parameter C = 5.0) was trained on the training set and tested on the testing set. Classification was carried out on 100 different train-test splits, and the average accuracy value was recorded as the observed accuracy.</p><p>We tested the classifier performance against chance (50%) using a combined permutation and bootstrapping approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schreiber and Krekelberg, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stelzer et al., 2013</xref>). We derived the t-statistic of the Fisher-z transformed accuracy values against chance (also Fisher-z transformed). The null distribution for each participant was generated by first shuffling the condition labels 1000 times, then computing the mean accuracy derived from the 100 train-test split of each shuffled dataset. Then, a bootstrapping method was used to generate an empirical distribution of the t-statistics. In each of the 10<sup>6</sup> iterations of the bootstrapping phase, one Fisher-z transformed null accuracy value (out of 1,000) per participant was randomly selected, and a one sample t-test was applied to the null sample. The empirical p-value of the real t-statistic was defined as the proportion of the null t-statistics greater than the real value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Overlap analysis</title><p>For each participant, and in each hemisphere, we used cosine similarity to quantify the overlap of the activated vertices between code comprehension and each of the four localizer contrasts: language (language &gt;math), math (math &gt;language), logic (logic &gt;language), and multi-source interference (hard &gt;easy). First, we generated the binary activation map for each contrast. A vertex was assigned the value one if the significance of its activation is above the 0.05 (FDR-corrected) threshold, and 0 otherwise. Each binary map was regarded as a vector, and the cosine similarity between two vectors (e.g. code comprehension and logic) was defined as the inner product of the vectors divided by the product of their respective lengths (norms). Note that this measure controls for overall vector length (i.e. the overall number of active voxels in each contrast). The cosine similarities of code to each of the localizer tasks was then compared using repeated-measure ANOVA and post-hoc pairwise comparisons with false discovery rate (FDR) correction.</p><p>The empirical lower bound was calculated separately for each localizer task to account for differences in the number of activated vertices across tasks. For each participant, for each localizer task, we computed the cosine similarity between the binary map for code comprehension and a shuffled binary map for each localizer task. This step was repeated 100 times to generate the null distribution of the similarity values.</p><p>We used a bootstrapping approach to test whether each observed cosine similarity value was significantly above the empirical lower bound. For each localizer task, we randomly selected one similarity value from the null distribution of one participant and computed a null group mean similarity. This step was repeated 10<sup>6</sup> times to derive the null distribution of the null group mean similarity. The empirical p-value of the real group mean similarity was defined as the proportion of the null values greater than the real value.</p><p>We operationalized the empirical upper bound as the cosine similarity of code comprehension and itself. For each participant, we split the data for code comprehension in half, ran a GLM for each half, and derived two binary maps whose cosine similarity was computed. We averaged all the similarity values resulting from the 10 possible splits of the six runs and across all participants.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Participants gave informed consent according to procedures approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Board.

In each group, the multiplication operator (*) existed in 32 out of the 96 real functions, and 10 of them took a numeric as one of its operands. However, in all these instances, the ‘multiplication’ meant repetition of strings or lists instead of numeric multiplications (e.g. <monospace>‘abc’*3</monospace> results in ‘<monospace>abcabcabc</monospace>’). In each group, 12 out of the 96 real functions contained a comparison to a numeric value, such as ‘<monospace>len(input)&gt;5</monospace>’.</p></sec><sec id="s9" sec-type="appendix"><title>The two variants of each control structure</title><p>We designed two variants to implement each control structure, <monospace>for</monospace> and <monospace>if</monospace>. In the first variant of a <monospace>for</monospace> code, the <monospace>for</monospace> loop was implemented in the canonical way. In the second variant of a <monospace>for</monospace> code, we implemented the loop with a Python-specific expression ‘list comprehension’, where the operation to be performed on each element in a list (or string) was stated before specifying the list to be iterated over. In the first variant of an <monospace>if</monospace> code, the if conditional was implemented in the canonical way. In the second variant of an <monospace>if</monospace> code, the conditional was implemented by first stating the action to take <monospace>if</monospace> a condition is true, then multiplying this action to the true/false judgement statement of the condition. There was not a formal jargon for this kind of implementation, for the sake of convenience, we called it ‘conditional multiplication’ in this study. Please refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for examples of each variant.</p></sec><sec id="s10" sec-type="appendix"><title>The algorithm for stimulus permutation</title><p>In this experiment, there were five conditions, ‘FOR1’, ‘FOR2’, ‘IF1’, ‘IF2’, and ‘FAKE’. For simplicity, from here on we label them as ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, and ‘E’, respectively.</p><p>There were 120 permutations for five distinct labels, such as ‘ABCDE’, ‘BCDEA’, ‘CDEAB’, ‘DEABC’, ‘EABCD’, ‘ACBDE’, ‘CBDEA’, etc. Each run consisted of 20 functions, which was 4 permutations of 5 labels. Therefore, for each run, we drew four permutations out of the 120 possible permutations.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: William Matchin (Reviewer #1); Ina Bornkessel-Schlesewsky (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>First, thank you for taking part in the review process.</p><p>As you know, <italic>eLife</italic> is invested in changing scientific publishing and experimenting to embody that change, even if that involves a degree of risk in order to find workable changes. In this spirit, the remit of the co-submission format is to ask if the scientific community is enriched by the data presented in the co-submitted manuscripts together more so than it would be by the papers apart, or if only one paper was presented to the community. In other words, are the conclusions that can be made are stronger or clearer when the manuscripts are considered together rather than separately? We felt that despite significant concerns with each paper individually, especially regarding the theoretical structures in which the experimental results could be interpreted, that this was the case.</p><p>We want to be very clear that in a non-co-submission case we would have substantial and serious concerns about the interpretability and robustness of the Liu et al. submission given its small sample size. Furthermore, the reviewers' concerns about the suitability of the control task differed substantially between the manuscripts. We share these concerns. However, despite these differences in control task and sample size, the Liu et al., and Ivanova et al. submissions nonetheless replicated each other – the language network was not implicated in processing programming code. The replication substantially mitigates the concerns shared by us and the reviewers about sample size and control tasks. The fact that different control tasks and sample sizes did not change the overall pattern of results, in our view, is affirmation of the robustness of the findings, and the value that both submissions presented together can offer the literature.</p><p>In sum, there were concerns that both submissions were exploratory in nature, lacking a strong theoretical focus, and relied on functional localizers on novel tasks. However, these concerns were mitigated by the following strengths. Both tasks ask a clear and interesting question. The results replicate each other despite task differences. In this way, the two papers strengthen each other. Specifically, the major concerns for each paper individually are ameliorated when considering them as a whole.</p><p>In your revisions, please address the concerns of the reviewers, including, specifically, the limits of interpretation of your results with regard to control task choice, the discussion of relevant literature mentioned by the reviewers, and most crucially, please contextualize your results with regard to the other submission's results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript is clearly written and the methods appear to be rigorous, although the number of subjects (15) is a bit low; however, this does not appear to critically limit interpretation of the results. I appreciated the focused inclusion on expert coders to make a clear comparison to language. I also thought that the inclusion of multiple domains for comparison (logic, math, executive function, and language) was quite informative. The laterality covariance between code and language was also quite interesting. I do have some concerns with the literature review and discussion of present and previous results.</p><p>1) My main concern with this paper is that it does not clearly review previous fMRI studies on code processing. How do the present results compare with previous studies? E.g. Castelhano et al., 2019; Floyd et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2019; Krueger et al., 2020; Siegmund et al., 2017, 2014;) It seems like the localization/lateralization obtained in the present study is largely similar to these previous studies (e.g. Siegmund et al., 2017). If so, this should discussed: a convergence across multiple methods/authors is useful to know. Any discrepancies are also useful to know. The authors suggest that &quot;Moreover, no prior study has directly compared the neural basis of code to other cognitive domains.&quot; However, Krueger et al., (2020) and Huang et al., (2019) appear to have done this.</p><p>2) The authors should point out and discuss the difficulty of understanding the psychological and neural structure of coding in absence of a clear theory of coding, as is the case for language (e.g. Chomsky, 1965; Levelt, 1989; Lewis and Vasishth, 2005). On this point, I appreciate the reference to Fitch et al., (2005) regarding recursion in coding, but I think it would be most helpful to have a clear example of recursion in python code. However, the authors at least focus their results on neural underpinnings without attempting to make strong claims about cognitive underpinnings.</p><p>3) The authors’ report overlap between code comprehension and language in the posterior MTG and IFG. They note that these activations were somewhat inconsistent; yet they did observe this significant overlap. However, the paper discusses the results as if this overlap did not occur, e.g. &quot;We find that the perisylvian fronto-temporal network that is selectively responsive to language, relative to math, does not overlap with the neural network involved in code comprehension.&quot; This is not accurate, as there indeed was overlap. It is important to point out that among language-related regions, these two regions are the most strongly associated with abstract syntax (Friederici, 2017; Hagoort, 2005; Tyler and Marslen-Wilson, 2008; Pallier et al., 2011; Bornkessel-Schlesewsky and Schlesewsky, 2013; Matchin and Hickok, 2019), which very well could be a point of shared resources among code and language (as discussed in Fitch, 2005).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The goal of this fMRI study was to determine which brain systems support coding, by way of extent of overlap of univariate maps with localizer tasks for language, logic, math, and executive functions. The basic conclusion is one we could have anticipated: coding engages a widespread frontoparietal network, with stronger involvement of the left hemisphere. It overlaps with all of the other tasks, but most with the map for logic. This doesn't seem too surprising, but the authors argue convincingly that others wouldn't have predicted that.</p><p>It's unfortunate that there are differences in task difficulty among the tasks, in particular, that the logic task was the most difficult of all (both in terms of accuracy and response times), since that happens to be the one that had the largest number of overlapping voxels with the coding task. We can't know whether coding and language task voxels would have overlapped more if the language task had been more difficult.</p><p>It seems a shame to present data only from highly experienced coders (11+ years of experience); I can imagine that the investigators are planning to write up another study examining effects of expertise, in comparison with less experienced coders. This seems like an initial paper that's laying the groundwork for a more groundbreaking one.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This fMRI study examines an interesting question, namely how computer code – as a &quot;cognitive/cultural invention&quot; – is processed by the human brain. However, I have a number of concerns with regard to how this question was examined in terms of experimental design, including the choice of control condition (fake code) and the way in which localiser tasks were utilised. In addition, the sample size is very small (n=15) and there appear to be large inter-individual differences in coding performance (in spite of the recruitment of expert programmers). In summary, while promising in its aims, the study's conclusions are weakened by these considerations related to its execution.</p><p>1) The control condition</p><p>The experiment contrasted real Python code with fake code in the form of &quot;incomprehensible scrambled Python functions&quot;. Real and fake code also differed in regard to the task performed (code comprehension versus memory) and were distinguished via colour coding. There is a lot to unpack here in regard to how processing might differ between the two different conditions. For example, the real-code blocks required code comprehension as well as computational problem solving (which does not necessarily require the use of code), while the control task requires neither. As a result of the colour coding, it also appears likely that participants will have approached the fake code blocks with a completely different processing strategy than the real-code blocks. These are just a few obvious differences between the conditions but there are likely many more given how different they are. This, in my view, makes it difficult to interpret the basic contrast between real and fake code.</p><p>2) Use of localiser tasks</p><p>A similar concern as for point 1 holds in regard to the localiser tasks that were used in order to examine anatomical overlap (or lack thereof) between code comprehension and language, maths, logical problem solving and multiple-demand executive control, respectively. I am generally somewhat sceptical in regard to the use of functional localisers in view of the assumptions that necessarily enter into the definition of a localiser task. This concern is exacerbated by the way in which localisers were employed in the present study. Firstly, in addition to the definition of the localiser task itself, this study used localiser contrasts to define networks of interest. For example, the contrast language localiser &gt; maths localiser served to define the &quot;language network&quot;. Thus, assumptions about the nature of the localiser itself are compounded with those regarding the nature of the contrast. Secondly, particularly with regard to language, the localiser task was very high level, i.e. requiring participants to judge whether an active and a passive sentence had the same meaning (with both statements remaining on the screen at the same time). While of course requiring language processing, this task is arguably also a problem solving task of sorts. It is certainly more complex than a typical task designed to probe fast and automatic aspects of natural language processing.</p><p>In addition, given that reading is also a cultural invention, is it really fair to say that coding is being compared to the &quot;language network&quot; here rather than to the &quot;reading network&quot; (in view of the visual presentation of the language task)? The possible implications of this for the interpretation of the data should be considered.</p><p>More generally, while an anatomical overlap between networks active during code comprehension and networks recruited during other cognitive tasks may shed some initial light on how the brain processes code, it doesn't support any particularly strong conclusions about the neural mechanisms of code processing in my view. While code comprehension may overlap anatomically with regions involved in executive control and logic, this doesn't mean that the same neuronal populations are recruited in each task nor that the processing mechanisms are comparable between tasks.</p><p>3) Sample size and individual differences</p><p>At n=15, the sample size of this study is quite small, even for a neuroimaging study. This again limits the conclusions that can be drawn from the study results.</p><p>Moreover, the results of the behavioural pre-test – which was commendably included – suggest that participants differed considerably with regard to their Python expertise. For the more difficult exercise in this pre-test, the mean accuracy score was 64.6% with a range from 37.5% to 93.75%. These substantial differences in proficiency weren't taken into account in the analysis of the fMRI data and, indeed, it appears difficult to meaningfully do so in view of the sample size.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59340.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript is clearly written and the methods appear to be rigorous, although the number of subjects (15) is a bit low; however, this does not appear to critically limit interpretation of the results.

We also added a section in the Discussion integrating the current results with the co-published article by Ivanova and colleagues. Overall, the current results are consistent with the findings of Ivanova et al., in finding fronto-parietal responses to code. The convergence and differences among the current article and that of Ivanova is discussed in detail, with regard to lateralization and localization.</p><p>Overall, it seems that the current results are convergent with prior work. However, with regard to studies prior to the Ivanova paper, it is difficult to say conclusively because of the differences between the current study and prior research. The handful of prior studies that have examined the neural bases of coding have used more complex tasks (e.g. writing code, debugging code, evaluating proposed code edits), rather than code comprehension. Control conditions in prior studies are different from the current study (e.g. mental rotation) and often complex (e.g. prose editing). In several cases the contrasts that would enable comparing to the current study are not reported or the methods and analyses are not described in detail, perhaps partly because all prior findings are reported in computer science proceedings journals with different reporting practices. Below we summarize the studies noted by the reviewer in particular.</p><p>Huang et al., (2019) subtracted neural activation associated with the mental rotation of three-dimensional objects from neural activation associated with manipulation of two types of data structures (sequence and binary search tree). For sequences, but not for binary trees, greater fronto-parietal activity was observed the code tasks than the mental rotation task. This study did not directly examine code comprehension per se and did not localize functions, such as language or working memory in the same group of participants.</p><p>Krueger et al., (2020) compared code writing to prose writing, either in a fill-in-the-blank format, or in the format of free writing in response to a prompt. Analyses compared code and prose directly using three contrasts: all code &gt; all prose, fill-in-the-blank code &gt; fill-in-the-blank prose, and free code &gt; free prose. As we now note in the Introduction, this study observed fronto-parietal activity for code relative to prose and is thus generally consistent with the current findings.</p><p>Note that neither Huang et al., (2019) or Krueger et al., (2020) localized specific previously documented neural networks and compared code comprehension to these networks. Therefore, they reported the difference in neural basis between code and other cognitive tasks, but not their shared neural resources.</p><p>Siegmund et al., (2017) compared comprehension of different types of Java code. In particular, they compared comprehension of code with meaningful and meaningless variable and function names and compared code comprehension of both types to detection of syntactic errors within code. These comparisons are not specifically designed to identify networks involved in code comprehension per se. A collection of regions was more responsive during code comprehension than syntactic error detection, some of these regions may overlap with the current fronto-parietal system. However, no coordinate table is reported, and the authors say that some of the areas may overlap with language networks. Direct comparisons are difficult. We now specifically point to the Siegmund et al., 2017 and 2014 papers in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should point out and discuss the difficulty of understanding the psychological and neural structure of coding in absence of a clear theory of coding, as is the case for language (e.g. Chomsky, 1965; Levelt, 1989; Lewis and Vasishth, 2005).

We added text to the Discussion section pointing this out.</p><p>In response to the reviewer’s suggestion, we also added examples of recursion in computer code in the Introduction.

However, in the current study it is also intrinsic to the design. Language is a putatively evolutionarily ancient function that is acquired by children without explicit instruction early in life. By contrast, formal logical reasoning is an explicit skill that requires teaching and is not acquired by most educated adults. Therefore, these cognitive domains differ in difficulty by design. We could make the language task more difficult artificially, for example by constructing complex grammatical sentences. However, such sentences are not representative of the type of processing we typically do with language. More importantly, previous evidence suggests that when language gets difficult in this way, non-language specific networks get recruited for processing. Despite the fact that the language task is easier, large swaths of cortex are responsive more to language than math, suggesting that responses in this particular network are not related to task difficulty per se.</p><p>Finally, because we worried about the same issue, in our analyses we control for the number of overall active vertices in each contrast. Overlap is calculated as the ratio between “the number of overlapping vertices” and “the square root of the product of the numbers of vertices in both the code contrast and each localizer contrast”, thus normalizing for the number of vertices involved in the contrasts. Additionally, we plot the degree of overlap for each task with itself separately and show the degree of overlap with code relative to this measure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems a shame to present data only from highly experienced coders (11+ years of experience); I can imagine that the investigators are planning to write up another study examining effects of expertise, in comparison with less experienced coders.

Since this is one of the first studies to examine code comprehension, the experiment was designed to maximally capture potentially interesting neural structures involved in code comprehension by having a relatively low-level control condition that removes basic reading processes and working memory demands. For this reason, we also presented real-codes and fake codes in different colors such that the participants are not trying to figure out whether the stimulus is or is not real-code, contaminating the neural response to fake codes with attempted code comprehension. We now explicitly point out these goals in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Because the contrast between code and fake code is large, it was also important to show that patterns of activity in the code-sensitive network can distinguish IF and FOR code functions. In future work, it will be important to dig more deeply into the question of what and how the identified network is processing. We now specifically point this out in subsection “Code overlaps with logic”. In particular, as the reviewer correctly points out, the current paper does not determine whether the code-sensitive network identified is involved in computer coding algorithms (what the reviewer calls computational problem solving) or code relevant syntax. In the coding literature this is sometimes referred to as the semantics vs. syntax of code (e.g. citation). Both of these types of processes are part and parcel of code comprehension, although only some of them are unique to code. The results of the Ivanova study speak to this question to some degree.

Nevertheless, the approach has consequences for the inferences that can be made based on the present results. We now talk about this issue in the Discussion section:</p><p>“Notably, in the current study neural responses associated with language, math and logic were localized partly relative to each other (e.g. logic &gt; language).

The degree to which areas shared across language, logic, and math are implicated in code comprehension remains to be addressed in future work.”</p><p>With regard to the reviewer’s specific comment about the language task, we agree that there is a problem solving component. However, this component is present also in the other control tasks (i.e. logic and math) and is matched as closely as possible across the tasks. Furthermore, the language-related responses observed in the current study are consistent with previous studies using other tasks and contrasts, including comparing passive sentence comprehension to a non-word control task (Fedorenko et al., 2011, 2016). Perhaps even more directly relevant, Ivanova and colleagues used a different language localizer task but found results consistent with the current study.

Notably, we have previously done the exact same language task using spoken language stimuli and observed the same neural network responsive to spoken language (Kanjlia et al., 2016). Since the control tasks are also written in English characters, the reading-specific activation is likely similar in the language and control conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More generally, while an anatomical overlap between networks active during code comprehension and networks recruited during other cognitive tasks may shed some initial light on how the brain processes code, it doesn't support any particularly strong conclusions about the neural mechanisms of code processing in my view. While code comprehension may overlap anatomically with regions involved in executive control and logic, this doesn't mean that the same neuronal populations are recruited in each task nor that the processing mechanisms are comparable between tasks.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s point that the current results do not support precise conclusions about the cognitive or neural processes involved in code comprehension, beyond comparison to the tasks described in the study (see also response to reviewer 1, comment 2). In future work we plan to use the findings of the current study as a necessary step towards more detailed understanding of the neural and cognitive basis of code. In particular, we agree that future work will need to examine closely distribution of responses to code within fronto-parietal systems. We now point out in the Discussion that future work will need to examine whether there is sub-specialization within the fronto-parietal network for code as opposed to other functions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Sample size and individual differences</p><p>At n=15, the sample size of this study is quite small, even for a neuroimaging study. This again limits the conclusions that can be drawn from the study results.</p></disp-quote><p>We updated the manuscript to point out the sample size limitation. (Discussion section)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the results of the behavioural pre-test – which was commendably included – suggest that participants differed considerably with regard to their Python expertise. For the more difficult exercise in this pre-test, the mean accuracy score was 64.6% with a range from 37.5% to 93.75%. These substantial differences in proficiency weren't taken into account in the analysis of the fMRI data and, indeed, it appears difficult to meaningfully do so in view of the sample size.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer points out, there is variability among participants’ expertise. Since coding, unlike language, is a cultural invention acquired in adulthood, such variability is to be expected. Absence of variability would likely indicate insensitivity of the testing measurement, rather than absence of variability. We agree with the reviewer, that given the small sample size, the current study is not suited to comprehensively testing effects of expertise level. We did test whether expertise predicted lateralization patterns and it did not. However, this conclusion is limited by the sample size. An investigation into the individual difference in programming expertise, and its influence on the neural response to code comprehension will be one of our future research topics.</p></body></sub-article></article>
