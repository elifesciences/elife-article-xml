To identify functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we performed transcriptomic analyses of cells expressing individual viral proteins. Expression of Nsp14, a protein involved in viral RNA replication, provoked a dramatic remodeling of the transcriptome that strongly resembled that observed following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, Nsp14 expression altered the splicing of more than 1000 genes and resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of circRNAs, which are linked to innate immunity. These effects were independent of the Nsp14 exonuclease activity and required the N7-guanine-methyltransferase domain of the protein. Activation of the NFkB pathway and increased expression of <italic>CXCL8</italic> occurred early upon Nsp14 expression. We identified IMPDH2, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of guanine nucleotides biosynthesis, as a key mediator of these effects. Nsp14 expression caused an increase in GTP cellular levels, and the effect of Nsp14 was strongly decreased in the presence of IMPDH2 inhibitors. Together, our data demonstrate an unknown role for Nsp14 with implications for therapy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses are parasites, relying on the cells they infect to make more of themselves.

As of early February 2022, COVID-19 has caused 5.7 million deaths worldwide. Coronaviruses are enveloped, relatively small (60–140 nm diameter), positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Coronaviridae family. They derive their name from the crown-like appearance (corona means crown in Latin) that results from the spike glycoproteins in their envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">V’kovski et al., 2021</xref>). The SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome is 30 kb long and has 14 open reading frames (ORFs) that encode 29 proteins (16 non-structural proteins, 4 structural proteins, and 9 accessory factors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). During the first step of the viral infection, the spike glycoprotein on the viral envelope mediates attachment and fusion with the cellular membrane. Once the virus is in the cytoplasm of the host cells, the host ribosome machinery is recruited for the synthesis of viral proteins. Non-structural proteins are required for viral genome replication and are generated by proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein encoded by ORF1a and ORF1ab. Once the viral genome is replicated, virions are assembled in the host endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex. Finally, new viral particles are incorporated into vesicles and secreted by the host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">V’kovski et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Viral infection triggers a variety of pathways in the host cells that ultimately lead to the hijacking of the cellular machineries escape from immune surveillance. SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits a peculiar gene expression response that first involves activation of interferon pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Melo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vanderheiden et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wyler et al., 2021</xref>), and then the NFkB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kircheis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hariharan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wyler et al., 2021</xref>), as well as expression of specific cytokines such as IL6 and IL8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Melo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coperchini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Park and Lee, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Recent and intense research on SARS-CoV-2 characterized the role of viral proteins during viral replication and showed that these functions are often conserved across coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">V’kovski et al., 2021</xref>). Less is known about the roles of the individual proteins in modulating host cell pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gordon et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gordon et al., 2020b</xref>). For instance, recent studies have proposed that Nsp16 is a splicing modulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>) and that Nsp1 and Nsp14 are translational repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schubert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hsu, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Nsp14 is a 60 kDa protein conserved among coronaviruses that is involved both in viral replication and in immune surveillance escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ogando et al., 2020</xref>). The N-terminal region of Nsp14 contains an exonuclease (ExoN) domain that excises mismatched nucleotides to ensure accurate replication of the viral genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ogando et al., 2020</xref>). As a result of this proofreading mechanism, coronaviruses have a lower mutation rate than other RNA viruses (error rate of 10<sup>6</sup>–10<sup>7</sup> vs. 10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sanjuán et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robson et al., 2020</xref>). Loss of function of the ExoN domain results in increased sensitivity to the RNA mutagen 5-fluorouracil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eckerle et al., 2010</xref>) and attenuated virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graham et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the interaction with Nsp10 augments Nsp14 ExoN activity up to 35-fold, and inhibition of the interaction between Nsp10 and Nsp14 leads to reduced replication fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Smith et al., 2015</xref>). Nsp14 is also involved in assembly the cap at the 5’ end of the viral RNA genome, which is crucial for evading immune surveillance. The C-terminal region of Nsp14 functions as an <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl methionine-dependent guanine-N7 methyl transferase that is independent of the ExoN activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). Both enzymatic domains are essential for successful viral replication, making Nsp14 an appealing drug target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Otava et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saramago et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Nsp14 is part of the replication complex, therefore it interacts with other SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As for other coronaviruses, replication of SARS-CoV-2 genome takes place in replication organelles that provide a protective environment for the newly synthesized viral genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">V’kovski et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, these organelles are formed in the cytoplasm and present convoluted double layered membranes that likely exchange material with the cytoplasm through pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wolff et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, Nsp14 might mediate immune surveillance escape by activating the interferon pathway and activating the pro-inflammatory response through NFkB transcriptional activity and <italic>CXCL8</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yuen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hsu, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2021</xref>). However, the biological mechanism behind these events has not fully characterized. Furthermore, a global interactome study showed that Nsp14 interacts with the cellular enzyme inosine-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) and that this interaction is conserved also in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gordon et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gordon et al., 2020b</xref>). IMPDH2 catalyzes the conversion of inosine-5'-monophosphate (IMP) to xanthine-5’-monophosphate (XMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hedstrom, 2009</xref>), which is the rate-limiting step of de novo guanine nucleotides biosynthesis. Guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP) is necessary for DNA replication and transcription and is used as energy source for translation and as mediator of signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hesketh and Oliver, 2019</xref>). How the physical interaction between Nsp14 and IMPDH2 impacts the host pathways is not completely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, a recent study has shown that expression of Nsp14 results in global translation inhibition, but it is not clear if this is a direct effect or a downstream consequence of the changes that the expression of this protein provokes to the cellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hsu, 2021</xref>). Indeed, no direct interaction between Nsp14 and ribosomes or a known translational modulator has been reported, suggesting that the potential translational inhibition might be a downstream effect.</p><p>Here, we undertook transcriptome analyses in cells that express each SARS-CoV-2 protein individually. Expression of Nsp14 altered the expression of about 4000 genes, mostly involved in splicing, RNA metabolism, and cell-cycle control. Importantly, the effect of Nsp14 on cellular gene expression resembled the transcriptional changes that occur upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and included the activation of the NFkB pathway and the expression of <italic>CXCL8</italic> (encoding IL8), a marker of acute severe respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adcock et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Melo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kircheis et al., 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, we also detected an increase in circRNAs expression upon Nsp14 expression; recent studies indicate that circRNAs can act as modulators of the innate immune response during viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yan and Chen, 2020</xref>). Moreover, we showed that the cellular enzyme IMPDH2 mediates the gene expression response induced by Nsp14. We found that <italic>IMPDH2</italic> mRNA is downregulated upon Nsp14 expression and that the cellular GTP concentration strongly increases, indicating that Nsp14 might activate IMPDH2 enzymatic activity. In accordance with our hypothesis, we showed that treatment with IMPDH2 inhibitors (mycophenolic acid [MPA] and mizoribine [MZR], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2020a</xref>), partially rescued the changes in gene expression induced by Nsp14.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins specifically remodels the transcriptome</title><p>Infection of cells with SARS-CoV-2 induces strong and specific changes in the transcriptome of host cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Melo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wyler et al., 2021</xref>). It is assumed that this response results from the hijacking of the cellular systems by the virus as well as from the defense by the host. To identify unknown functions of the individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins and to determine how much each protein contributes to the takeover of cellular systems, we determined how the transcriptome changed when we individually express each viral protein in a human cell line. Specifically, we expressed individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gordon et al., 2020b</xref>) in HEK293T cells, and after 48 hr we purified RNA, generated and sequenced 3’ RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries, and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Extensive cell death or changes in morphology did not occur upon expression of individual proteins, as assessed visually.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins alter gene expression distinctively.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of the experimental approach.

Indeed, we detected less than 300 DEGs upon expression of 17 of the 25 tested proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Expression of seven viral proteins, M, Nsp9, E, ORF9b, ORF3a, Nsp13, and Nsp1, modestly altered the transcriptome (between 300 and 700 DEGs). Interestingly, these DEGs tended to be upregulated rather than downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Striking, Nsp14 altered the expression of more than 4000 RNAs (1862 upregulated and 2161 downregulated; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The profound impact of Nsp14 expression on the transcriptome of HEK293T cells suggests that this protein has roles beyond its known functions in viral genome proofreading and immune system escape.</p><p>To identify cellular pathways affected by the expression of the individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the DEGs upon expression of the different viral proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Expression of the viral proteins impacted mRNAs encoding proteins related to different aspects of gene expression (regulation of transcription, translation, and RNA metabolism), cell metabolism, cell division, and innate immunity. For example, expression of Nsp7, an accessory protein of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hillen, 2020</xref>), deregulated expression of genes encoding proteins involved in DNA and RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Expression of Nsp9 and Nsp13, known to bind RNA and to regulate RNA metabolism, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Egloff et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shu et al., 2020</xref>), resulted in the mis-regulation of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in RNA metabolism and translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, expression of the protein ORF3d, known to bind STOML2 mitochondrial protein, may be a unique antigenic target upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gordon et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hachim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nelson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jungreis et al., 2021</xref>), resulted in alteration of genes involved in cell metabolism and immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In general, expression of the viral proteins mainly impacted pathways related to RNA metabolism, translation, and cell metabolism that were previously reported to be affected upon viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Melo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gardinassi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wyler et al., 2021</xref>). Expression of Nsp14 affected the expression of genes involved in RNA splicing, metabolism, and processing, translation, cell-cycle control, and the cytoskeleton.

Strikingly, we found that for genes upregulated upon expression of Nsp14, three of the four most highly enriched GSEA datasets were those of cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Melo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, we observed a smaller but significant enrichment of genes upregulated upon infection with MERS, a related virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Melo et al., 2020</xref>). Further, the mRNAs downregulated upon expression of Nsp14 tended to be strongly enriched for those downregulated following SARS-CoV-2 viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We did not detect enrichment when our dataset were compared to data from cells infected with influenza A virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Melo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results demonstrate that expression of a single viral protein can recapitulate a considerable portion of response of a host cell to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlights the potential importance of Nsp14 in hijacking host gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Nsp14 alters gene expression mostly at the transcriptional level</title><p>To evaluate whether the transcriptome changes were due to alterations at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level or a combination of both, we utilized intronic signals from the total RNA-seq experiment as a proxy for transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2020b</xref>). For each DEG in the 3’ RNA-seq dataset, we determined whether the intronic signal in the total RNA-seq dataset was altered in the same direction. We observed a strong correlation (<italic>R</italic> = 0.73 and p-value = 2.2e<sup>−16</sup>) between these two measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that a large part of the response is transcriptional. For example, of the 1862 genes that were upregulated upon Nsp14 expression, 1006 also had higher intronic signal (at least 20% signal increase), whereas only 57 of the showed decreased intronic signal. Similarly, of the 2161 genes downregulated upon Nsp14 expression, 1242 displayed lower intronic signal (at least 20% signal decrease), whereas only 109 showed higher intronic signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). We then performed a similar analysis using the exonic signal of DEGs in the same total RNA-seq dataset. We obtained an even stronger correlation between the changes in exonic signal and total RNA signal for each gene (<italic>R</italic> = 0.87 and p-value = 2.2e<sup>−16</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In sum, we observed that more than 50% of the changes in the transcriptome upon Nsp14 expression are transcriptional. Notably, this might be an underestimation, as changes in intronic signal could be lower than the steady-state RNA levels or some introns could be very efficiently and quickly removed, so that splicing intermediates are not detected. To further confirm the transcriptional effect, we determined the levels of a subset of DEGs from chromatin-bound nascent RNA from cells transfected with a control or a Nsp14-expressing plasmid. As expected, a pre-mRNA (<italic>pre-TBP</italic>), was enriched in the chromatin-bound fraction, <italic>U6</italic> was abundant in the nuclear compartment (nucleoplasm and chromatin bound), whereas <italic>18S rRNA</italic> and a circRNA (<italic>circVKR1</italic>) were more abundant in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Then, we checked the expression of some genes that were up or down regulated upon Nsp14 expression in our dataset in the chromatin-bound fraction. Genes upregulated upon Nsp14 expression (<italic>FGF-18</italic> and <italic>CXCL8</italic>) were also upregulated in the chromatin-bound fraction, while the downregulated ones (<italic>SH2D2A</italic> and <italic>COL13A</italic>) were downregulated indicating that at least those mRNAs are regulated at the transcriptional level by Nsp14. These results verify the genomic observations and strongly suggest that the gene expression changes observed upon Nsp14 are mainly transcriptional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed that there are more than 1000 genes that display higher intronic signals with no changes in gene expression, indicating that, in addition to the transcriptional effects, Nsp14 might also affect splicing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Nsp14 expression provokes changes in alternative splicing and circRNAs production</title><p>Genes upregulated upon Nsp14 expression are enriched in genes encoding proteins with GO terms related to RNA metabolism and, more specifically, splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, for more than 1000 genes, there were significant increases in intron signal upon expression of Nsp14 without changes in mRNA levels, suggesting that Nsp14 alters the splicing of these pre-mRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>). Indeed, we found that expression of Nsp14 strongly altered the inclusion patterns of almost 2300 exons, with more than 2000 exons displaying lower inclusion in the mature mRNA and 238 showing higher levels of inclusion when we expressed Nsp14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Moreover, we observed an increase in the retention of more than 2000 introns following Nsp14 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>). Although the effects on exon inclusion and use of alternative splice sites clearly indicate that Nsp14 influences splicing, the increase in intron retention could be secondary to changes in transcription. However, as most of the introns with increased retention are within genes that were not differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we reasoned that expression of Nsp14 leads to changes in splicing in this subset of genes as well. Moreover, the effect of Nsp14 on alternative splicing appears to be specific to particular introns and exons in each gene, as the majority (~62%) of identified genes had a single spicing event altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>). Notably, most genes with altered splicing do not show expression changes upon Nsp14 expression, further indicating that the detected alternative splicing events are independent to transcriptional changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Nsp14 expression alters the splicing of a subgroup of genes and increases circRNAs expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Table summarizing splicing analysis comparison between Nsp14 expression and control.

Interestingly, we found that the affected introns tended to be at the 5’ end of the transcript and were embedded in genomic regions with higher-than-average GC content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>). The GC content may be a confounding factor of the location of these introns, as the GC content is higher at the 5’ end of genes and around the transcription start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang, 2004</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that Nsp14 expression has a strong and specific effect on splicing efficiency for a subset of genes.</p><p>Furthermore, most of the affected exons are shorter and have higher GC content around their splice sites than a randomized subset of exons not affected by Nsp14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>). The higher GC content suggests that stable RNA structures form around the splice sites in these exon, which correlates with alternative splicing propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Previous research showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection disrupts splicing, mostly by inducing intron retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>). To check whether the effects on splicing induced by Nsp14 were comparable to the ones that happen during SARS-CoV-2 infection, we re-analyzed a published dataset of total RNA-seq from HEK293T cells expressing human ACE2 and infected with SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). We found that there is a significant overlap (p-value &lt; 0.01, see Materials and methods) between the alternative splicing events during the infection and in our model. Specifically, 10% of the alternative splicing events changing with SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g</xref>) also change (and in the same direction) when we express Nsp14 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>). In sum, we showed that expression of Nsp14 partially recapitulates the gene expression changes, as well as some of the alternative splicing events that occur upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p>As circRNAs are generated by back-splicing, a process that competes with linear pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014</xref>), we checked whether Nsp14 also alters circRNAs expression. Using the total RNA-seq data, we found that there is a strong increase (more than twofold) in the total number of circRNA reads upon Nsp14 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Most of the 246 circRNAs that were differentially expressed upon expression of Nsp14 were upregulated (put the number of upregulated; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1h</xref>). These deregulated circRNAs were contained within 190 loci (some loci host multiple circRNAs). Interestingly, the levels of most of the mRNAs that host these circRNAs were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). Indeed, Nsp14 did not increase the transcription of loci hosting the upregulated circRNAs (we observed increased levels of intronic sequences in only 20 out of the 190 loci with upregulated circRNAs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). Together, these results strongly suggest that the increased circRNA levels are caused by increased biosynthesis or stability of the circRNAs. In sum, our data shows that expression of Nsp14 influences alternative splicing and back-splicing on the host cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The effect of Nsp14 on gene expression is independent of the ExoN activity but requires the N7-guanine-methyltransferase domain</title><p>Nsp14 has two separated enzymatic activities: (1) works as a proofreading ExoN and (2) it is a N7-guanine-methyltransferase required for the modification of the viral RNA cap. To determine whether the ExoN activity is required for the strong effects of Nsp14 on gene expression, we performed two different experiments. First, we tested whether co-expression of Nsp10, which dramatically increases the ExoN activity of Nsp14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouvet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouvet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ma et al., 2015</xref>), resulted in an enhanced effect of Nsp14. Briefly, we transfected HEK293T cells with plasmids for expressing Nsp14 and/or Nsp10. As a control, we used cells transfected with an empty vector. Co-expression of Nsp14 and Nsp10 did not impact levels of Nsp14 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We then prepared RNA from these samples and quantified the expression of some mRNAs that were altered upon expression of Nsp14 alone. For instance, the levels of <italic>FGF-18</italic> increased upon expression of Nsp14 alone, whereas the levels of <italic>SH2D2A</italic> were significantly downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, expression of Nsp10 alone or in combination with Nsp14 did not further alter the levels of any of the mRNAs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To determine whether the effect is global, we prepared and sequenced total RNA from these samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that data from samples expressing Nsp14 alone separated from the data from the sample transfected with the empty plasmid, whereas that the ones from the samples expressing only Nsp10 almost overlapped with the control. Co-expression of Nsp14 and Nsp10 resulted in transcriptional changes like the ones induced by expression of only Nsp14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Unlike expression of Nsp14, which provoked a strong remodeling of the mRNA and circRNA populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), expression of Nsp10 did not considerably alter the gene expression profile (only 88 DEGs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As also suggested by the RT-qPCR experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the gene expression profiles of cells transfected with Nsp14 alone or in combination with Nsp10 are strikingly similar. Indeed, we observed an almost complete overlap between the DEGs resulting from Nsp14 expression and from co-expression of Nsp14 and Nsp10, and there was a very strong correlation between the fold change in DEGs upon Nsp14 expression with and without Nsp10 co-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Moreover, co-expression of Nsp10 did not result in additional differentially expressed mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>) and did not alter of the number of circRNAs reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) compared to expression of Nsp14 alone.

We then performed subcellular fractionation and chromatin purification, followed by Western blot at different time points after transfection, and we showed that Nsp14 localizes in the cytoplasm, and it does not associate with chromatin demonstrating that the transcriptional effect is indirect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we explored the hypothesis that host cellular proteins mediate Nsp14-induced gene expression changes.

One possibility is that Nsp14 activates IMPDH2 which then modulates gene expression directly or indirectly.

To test whether expression of Nsp14 alters IMPDH2 activity, we performed metabolomic analysis of lysates of cells transfected with a plasmid for expression of Nsp14 or a control plasmid.

Briefly, we transfected cells with a Nsp14 or with a control plasmid (eGFP) and 8 hr later treated the cells with MPA, a non-isoform-selective pan-IMPDH inhibitor, or DMSO. We harvested the cells 40 hr after the treatment. We used a concentration of MPA of 0.5 µM to avoid cytotoxic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Qasim et al., 2011</xref>). Although we treated the cells with a low concentration of MPA, MPA treatment could reduce the concentration of cellular GTP, which is the primary energy source for mRNA translation. We confirmed that MPA treatment did not alter Nsp14 or IMPDH2 levels by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>We next performed 3’ RNA-seq on the same samples. Interestingly, we observed that MPA treatment diminishes the effects induced by expression of Nsp14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We detected only 115 DEGs in cells treated with MPA compared to control cells. In cells expressing Nsp14, we detected 3761 DEGs. By contrast, there were only 1245 DEGs in cells expressing Nsp14 that we treated with MPA compared to control cells, demonstrating that about 73% of the changes depends on the activity of IMPDH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Approximately 1000 genes were deregulated in cells expressing Nsp14 with or without MPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In addition, the effect of those genes still differentially expressed was smaller in the presence of MPA. This can be seen by comparing the distribution of fold changes of the DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). When we treated cells expressing Nsp14 with MPA, the distribution of fold change narrowed, indicating that MPA treatment mitigates the effects of Nsp14 even in those mRNAs that are still differentially expressed in the presence of the drug. Moreover, we observed a similar, milder, effect of Nsp14 expression when assaying the levels of a subset of circRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Furthermore, we corroborated these data using MZR, another IMPDH2 inhibitor. As for the MPA treatment, MZR treatment did no alter Nsp14 or IMPDH2 protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>) and partially rescued the expression of the tested mRNAs and circRNAs deregulated by Nsp14 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E and F</xref>).

In the last 2 years, new studies shed light in some unexpected functions of diverse SARS-CoV-2 proteins. For instance, protein interactome experiments defined the interaction map of SARS-CoV-2 proteins with host cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gordon et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gordon et al., 2020b</xref>). Moreover, further studies showed that Nsp1 blocks cellular translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schubert et al., 2020</xref>), whereas RNA immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that Nsp8 and Nsp19 alter protein trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>), and that Nsp16 alters splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used an alternative approach; we performed an expression screen to determine how the individual expression of SARS-CoV-2 proteins influenced host cell gene expression. Nsp14 displayed the most striking effects, deregulating the expression of approximately 4000 mRNAs and altering splicing. While we acknowledge that the conditions under which we performed our experiments might lead to higher levels of Nsp14 than those observed during infection, we are convinced that our findings are highly relevant. Indeed, both the effects on gene expression and alternative splicing significantly overlap with the ones occurring during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, during the infection Nsp14 localizes in the replication organelles that are formed in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">V’kovski et al., 2021</xref>), and in our model we also see that Nsp14 localizes in the cytoplasm. Overall, our data indicate that our model, despite some limitations, recapitulates some gene expression changes that occur during SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p>Regarding the other tested proteins, when expressed individually M, Nsp9, E, ORF9b, ORF3a, Nsp13, and Nsp1 also altered the host cells transcriptome in ways that will require further investigation. Although most of the tested proteins did not dramatically alter gene expression, this does not rule out their roles in remodeling of host cell gene expression. For instance, some may require other viral proteins as co-factors. In the future, it will be interesting to test how different combinations of viral proteins that are known to work in complex may affect host cell gene expression.</p><p>Our findings unrevealed an unexpected function of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 in regulation of host cell transcription, splicing, and circRNAs expression. Notably, we also showed that IMPDH2 mediates these effects, as pharmacological inhibition of this cellular enzyme partially reverts them.</p><p>Our analysis of the transcriptomes of HEK293T cells as a function of time after Nsp14 expression revealed that the transcriptional response is temporarily subdivided into two phases. The early response involves NFkB activation, whereas the later phase includes effects on cellular metabolism, RNA metabolism, and cell-cycle control. Notably, NFkB is one of the first pathways activated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wyler et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, early after transfection of Nsp14, we detected increased <italic>CXCL8</italic> expression, which encodes IL8. IL8 is elevated in plasma of COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanco-Melo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hariharan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2021</xref>) and is a marker of acute severe lung distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adcock et al., 2015</xref>), an inflammatory condition that can lead to severe complications or death, further confirming the relevance of our model in mimicking the molecular events triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Besides, in accordance with our data, a recent study showed that IMPDH2 mediates the activation of <italic>CXCL8</italic> expression and of NFkB transcriptional reporters during Nsp14 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, for a subgroup of genes the response appears to involve alterations of splicing patterns and other post-transcriptional events. Remarkably, splicing is strongly disrupted upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>) and we see a significant overlap between the alternative splicing events induced by Nsp14 and the ones occurring during the infection. Furthermore, Nsp14 affects the expression of genes encoding proteins with functions in RNA processing and splicing. However, unlike the splicing modulation by Nsp16 which has been proposed to be general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>), the effect of Nsp14 seems to be specific to certain exons and introns as, in most cases, only one splicing event is modulated per gene. It is likely that Nsp16 and Nsp14 influence alternative splicing through different mechanisms, although we could not compare the effects of the two proteins as the plasmid for Nsp16 expression was not in the collection we utilized in our screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gordon et al., 2020b</xref>). In any case, while Nsp16 directly binds to pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>), Nsp14 is localized to the cytoplasm, so the latter modifies splicing indirectly, through a cascade of events that culminate in altered splicing patterns. Indeed, our experiments suggest that this might be through altered activity of IMPDH2, which has been shown to enter the nucleus and alter gene expression in other physiological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kozhevnikova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahangari et al., 2021</xref>). Altered splicing events could be a direct effect of IMPDH2 activity or secondary to the gene expression changes, as we showed that Nsp14 alters the expression of several RNA binding proteins and splicing regulators. As both Nsp14 and Nsp16 change the splicing patterns of several genes, further experiments will determine which is the exact contribution of Nsp14 and Nsp16 to the changes in alternative splicing following infection, as well as the cellular proteins mediating the effects of Nsp14.</p><p>Surprisingly, we also detected increased levels of circRNAs upon Nsp14 expression. Specifically, Nsp14 altered the expression of about 10% of the cellular circRNAs. The magnitude of this effect is striking, considering that deletion or knock-down of factors involved in circRNAs production generally affects the expression of smaller percentages of circRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Errichelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Knupp et al., 2021</xref>). We showed that this increase is not due to enhanced transcription of the hosting RNAs, and our results indicate that Nsp14 influences biosynthesis and/or stability of those circRNAs. Published work showed that circRNAs accumulate in non-proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bachmayr-Heyda et al., 2015</xref>). Nsp14 alters the expression of genes regulating cell cycle and proliferation, and this may result in inhibition of pathways related to circRNA degradation or in inhibition of cell division, ultimately leading to circRNAs accumulation. However, this possible explanation will require future investigation.</p><p>Interestingly, recent studies indicate that circRNAs modulate some immune factors by repressing their pro-inflammatory activity in normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu, 2019</xref>). On the contrary, upon viral infection, circRNAs are degraded and these immune factors can orchestrate the appropriate response in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu, 2019</xref>). Indeed, circRNA titer dramatically decreases upon viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). The fact that we detected an increase in levels of certain circRNAs upon Nsp14 expression suggests a possible mechanism for the immune evasion orchestrated by Nsp14.</p><p>Nsp14 is conserved among coronaviruses and it participates to viral replication and immune surveillance escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ogando et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, on the one end it works as an ExoN, important for the correct replication of the viral genome, on the other hand it functions as N7-guanine-methyltransferase for modifying the 5’ cap of the viral genome. Notably, both domains are important for successful viral replication and are considered potential drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Otava et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saramago et al., 2021</xref>). Our data indicate that N7-guanine-methyltransferase domain, but not the ExoN one, is necessary for Nsp14 effects on host gene expression.</p><p>Nsp14 interacts with the replication complex and in proximity with other enzymes, such as Nsp16, involved in the modification of the 5’ cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Romano et al., 2020</xref>). Although we excluded the importance of the co-factor Nsp10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ma et al., 2015</xref>), we did not test how the combination of Nsp14 with other SARS-CoV-2 proteins modulate gene expression in the host cells. As mentioned above, in the future it would be interesting to co-express Nsp14 and Nsp16, since both are involved in the 5’ cap modification (and, as mentioned before, the N7-guanine-methyltransferase domain of Nsp14 is important for the effects on gene expression), and both proteins disrupt splicing of cellular transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Romano et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we showed that IMPDH2 meditates the effects on cell transcriptome, altered splicing, and circRNAs deregulation induced by Nsp14 expression, as pharmacological inhibition of IMPDH2 activity with MPA and MZR mitigated the effects of Nsp14. Intriguingly, MPA is a known immunosuppressant and antiviral agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">To et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dang et al., 2017</xref>), and it inhibits SARS-CoV-2 propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kato et al., 2020</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ideas and speculations</title><p>Although our data clearly indicate that IMPDH2 mediates the effects induced by Nsp14, we still do not know the detailed mechanism. We reported altered expression of genes involved in purine synthesis, including a decrease in <italic>IMPDH2</italic> mRNA levels, and we also detected elevated cellular GTP concentrations upon Nsp14 expression. Taken together, these data suggest that Nsp14 activates IMPDH2. Besides, previous studies showed that Nsp14 interacts with IMPDH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gordon et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gordon et al., 2020b</xref>), but we do not know whether the direct interaction between Nsp14 and IMPDH2 is sufficient for triggering the massive gene expression changes or if this system requires a co-factor.</p><p>Notably, IMPDH2 binds nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McLean et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mortimer and Hedstrom, 2005</xref>) and acts as a TF in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kozhevnikova et al., 2012</xref>). However, although IMPDH2 is conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hedstrom, 2009</xref>) and can localize in the nucleus of mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahangari et al., 2021</xref>), the TF activity of IMPDH2 has not been demonstrated in mammalian cells. Whether Nsp14 triggers cytoplasmic-nuclear shuffle of IMPDH2 in mammalian cells will require further investigation. Intriguingly, a recent study reported that IMPDH2 can bind a circRNA and that this interaction activates IMPDH2 enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). In the future, it will be interesting to check the circRNA binding capacity of IMPDH2 in our model, where circRNAs expression is highly deregulated. Besides, IMPDH2 can also associate with polyribosomes and modulates the translation of specific mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hsu, 2021</xref>).</p><p>In addition, another recent report indicates that Nsp14 blocks the interferon response, which is upstream of the NFkB pathway, by shutting down global translation 24 hr after Nsp14 transfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hsu, 2021</xref>). However, our data indicate that the transcriptional activation of the NFkB pathway occurs very early after transfection. Furthermore, we confirmed that some effects are transcriptional, and we detected alterations on splicing and circRNAs levels, events which are not necessarily downstream to translational inhibition. Moreover, we showed that the transcriptional effects occur soon after Nsp14 expression, as treatment with MPA or MZR 8 hr after transfection partially recovered the gene expression profile of the cells. This indicates that some of the gene expression changes might precede the global translation shutoff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hsu, 2021</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that Nsp14 can alter gene expression by disrupting both the transcriptome and translation. Another possibility is that the transcriptional and the translational effects depend on the levels of Nsp14, that cannot be compared between the two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hsu, 2021</xref> and this study).</p><p>Although we showed that the N7-guanine-methyltransferase domain of Nsp14 is crucial for mediating the gene expression changes in the host cell, previous studies indicated that this domain is important for mediating Nsp14 translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hsu, 2021</xref>). This leads us to further speculate that Nsp14 may disrupt transcription, alternative splicing, and translation. Interestingly, Nsp14 can methylate free GTP in the cell and convert it to m7GTP, that is known to block cap-dependent translation by competing with mRNA for eIF4E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jin et al., 2013</xref>). Our results indicate that Nsp14 increases cellular GTP concentration by activating IMPDH2. Therefore, a compelling model would be that Nsp14 activates IMPDH2, causing not only to altered transcription and splicing, but also to increased cellular GTP, that is then converted to m7GTP by Nsp14, ultimately leading to general translation repression. However, this hypothesis will require further investigation and could only explain only a small fraction of the changes observed when expressing Nsp14, as expression of a viral factor that inhibits protein synthesis directly (Nsp1) altered the levels of a much smaller set of genes.</p><p>To sum up, we here provided novel insights regarding the function of Nsp14 in altering gene expression of the host cell through the interaction with the cellular enzyme IMPDH2 in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene(<italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Nsp14</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">wuhCor1/SARS-CoV-2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgsid=1182551131_fECUKUXV9iK83BDEbaZNiDBkA0aN&amp;db=wuhCor1&amp;position=NC_045512v2%3A18040-19620">NC_045512</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgsid=1182551131_fECUKUXV9iK83BDEbaZNiDBkA0aN&amp;db=wuhCor1&amp;position=NC_045512v2%3A18040-19620">v2</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgsid=1182551131_fECUKUXV9iK83BDEbaZNiDBkA0aN&amp;db=wuhCor1&amp;position=NC_045512v2%3A18040-19620">:</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgsid=1182551131_fECUKUXV9iK83BDEbaZNiDBkA0aN&amp;db=wuhCor1&amp;position=NC_045512v2%3A18040-19620">18040</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgsid=1182551131_fECUKUXV9iK83BDEbaZNiDBkA0aN&amp;db=wuhCor1&amp;position=NC_045512v2%3A18040-19620">–</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?hgsid=1182551131_fECUKUXV9iK83BDEbaZNiDBkA0aN&amp;db=wuhCor1&amp;position=NC_045512v2%3A18040-19620">19620</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">UCSC Genome Browser on SARS-CoV-2 Jan. 2020/NC_045512.2 Assembly (wuhCor1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IMPDH2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">UCSC Genome Browser on Human Feb. 2009 (GRCh37/hg19) Assembly</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NM_000884</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DH5alpha</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rosbash Lab</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Electrocompetent cells used for transformation of cloned plasmids</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293T</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line obtained from Marr Lab Brandeis University.

They are arguing that IMPDH2 is a key mediator of the Nsp14 effect on the host transcriptome, but they only validated the effect of IMPDH2 on the differential gene expression. Since they have already generated the data comparing Nsp14+MPA to Nsp14+DMSO (Figure 6E), it will be worth analyzing the IMPDH2 effect on splicing or circRNA expression that are described here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. How would the data look like when genes under the Nsp14-mediated alternative splicing are presented in Figure 2A together?</p><p>2. Please show less processed data such as scatter or MA plots for Figure 6E.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A major question I have after reading your work is: where is Nsp14?</p><p>Subcellular imaging:</p><p>– Where is Nsp14 in human cells during native infections?</p><p>– Where is Nsp14 in human cells during individual transfection?</p><p>– This would be additionally interesting in the experimental set up of Figure 5 where changes in the DEGs evolve over time and correlating where Nsp14 is with particular sets of genes could be very revealing.</p><p>Whole cell protein levels:</p><p>– How much higher, per cell, is the transfection of Nsp14 than what accumulates during native infections?</p><p>– Again, here, for Figure 5, it would be very important to know WHEN Nsp14 is actually expressed/present in the cell. There are not many changes after 8 hours, but how much Nsp14 have the 293 cells even made at this point?</p><p>The fact that &quot;more than 50% of the changes in the transcriptome upon Nsp14 expression are transcriptional&quot; seems like it warrants a bit of investigation and hopefully some imaging or subcellular fractionation at different time points could at least provide a framework to propose hypotheses for how this is possible in the context of the other mechanisms you're proposing</p><p>– One could also do a chromatin-fractionation to see if Nsp14 sticks to chromatin, better / more complete to do ChIP-seq but this could be overkill for this study</p><p>The circRNA changes are interesting at a high level however it is hard to know how surprising or unique this change is; both that it changes and the magnitudes (number of circRNAs changing). Are there data that this could be compared to? For example, KD, KO, or OE of other splicing factors in experimental or disease conditions that show fewer, similar, or more changes in circRNAs, and importantly how these numbers compare to the changes in the linear mRNA pool.</p><p>The experimental idea in Figure 4, with co-expression is quite nice however limited in scope. This may be ok for this study, but it is hard to know how all these factors work together during a native infection when studying them in isolation. It's convenient that Nsp14 has such a singularly robust impact of the host transcriptome, but one wonders how the combination of the other gene products would better tune or in other ways influence the host cell's state.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 mediates the effects of viral infection on the host cell transcriptome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Although they did not address the comment regarding the role of Nsp14 function in authentic infection, I think that the function of Nsp14 observed upon exogenous expression is well addressed. I do understand the limitation of doing BSL3 experiment. But here I have some questions and suggestions related to their response to this comment.</p><p>1. The authors showed the cytoplasmic localization of exogenous Nsp14 as one of the supporting evidence of resemblance to SARS-COVID-2 infection situation. I wonder how cytoplasmic localization of Nsp14 could be associated with altered splicing events which occur in the nucleus. It would be nice to include any speculation on this in the discussion.</p><p>2. To further support the role of Nsp14 in altered splicing upon the real SARS-CoV-2 infection, I would suggest reinforcing the specificity of Nsp14 on altered splicing. Given that Nsp16 is also known for altered splicing, especially causing intron retention which is the common phenomenon the authors observed with Nsp14, I still wonder how much Nsp14 would explain the altered splicing upon SARS-COVID-2 infection.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors carefully read the initial reviews, extended their work, and I think addressed the major of the conceptual points raised. The additional data and controls included provide better context in some cases and strengthen the mechanistic claims overall. Parts of the news results and Discussion sections I think also better contextualize some of the initial ideas that were less clearly stated in the first draft. As far as I am concerned, I think this manuscript should proceed to publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71945.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Role of Nsp14 function in authentic infection</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing this up. We have now addressed this in the new version of the manuscript by adding several experiments and changing text.</p><p>In the previous version of the manuscript, we reported the surprising finding that expression of Nsp14 recapitulates an important part of the transcriptome changes observed following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have now added additional experiments and analysis to build up on those similarities. More specifically:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We show that Nsp14 localizes in the cytoplasm, similarly to what happens during infection. These results are in the new Figure 6—figure supplement 1A.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We show that at least at the RNA level, the amounts of Nsp14 are comparable between our experiments and infection (See comment 2 to reviewer 2)</p></list-item><list-item><p>During SARS-CoV-2 infection many genes showed altered splicing. Previous research suggested that this is mostly due to Nsp16, that interacts with U1 and U2. However, we also detected alteration of splicing when we express Nsp14, and we showed a significant overlap between the altered splicing events upon infection and Nsp14 expression (about 10% of the events, see Supplementary File 1 and comment 1 to reviewer 1). This suggests that Nsp14 expression contributes also to the alternative splicing events that occur during the infection, although we were not able to dissect the contribution of Nsp14 and Nsp16.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Regarding determining whether the changes in circRNA levels are also observed during infection, we found that this comparison is not possible because circRNA levels are known to globally decrease following viral infection (personal communication Kadener lab, see comment 1 to reviewer 1)</p></list-item></list><p>Furthermore, we have extended the explanation of the similitude between the transcriptional changes observed upon Nsp14 expression in our experimental model and physiological viral infection, and we explained better in the Introduction and Discussion the role of Nsp14 during infection.</p><p>We recognize the limitation of our model in which Nsp14 might be expressed at higher levels than during the physiological infection (despite our observation at the RNA level, see answer to reviewer 2). Nevertheless, similar expression approaches have been used to study the function of other SARS-CoV-2 proteins and explained molecular mechanisms that occur during the infection. Furthermore, we showed that our model recapitulates the gene expression changes, as well as some of the alternative splicing events that occur during SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Rescue experiment for IMPDH2.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing this up.

We repeated the transfection, and we determined Nsp14 levels by Western Blot. We detected Nsp14 protein expression as early as 6h post transfection, and, as expected, Nsp14 levels increased over time (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). This is consistent with the results from the 3’RNAseq experiment and it demonstrates that the observed early response is mediated by Nsp14 protein. We thank the reviewer for bringing this up.</p><p>Besides, we checked also the amount of normalized <italic>Nsp14</italic> reads in our 3’ RNA seq dataset (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). As expected, we detected increasing amount of <italic>Nsp14</italic> normalized reads through our time course (less than 5,000 reads 6h after transfection and more than 15,000 at 48h).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A weakness of this paper is lack of connection among their observations that are described in parallel.

Unfortunately, the generated dataset explained in Figure 6 is a 3’ RNA seq experiment, not suitable for circRNAs detection and alternative splicing analysis, that’s why we now utilized RT-qPCR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

We have now presented the data as suggested in Figure 6—figure supplement 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>A major question I have after reading your work is: where is Nsp14?</p><p>Subcellular imaging:</p><p>– Where is Nsp14 in human cells during native infections?</p><p>– Where is Nsp14 in human cells during individual transfection?</p><p>– This would be additionally interesting in the experimental set up of Figure 5 where changes in the DEGs evolve over time and correlating where Nsp14 is with particular sets of genes could be very revealing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these interesting and important points. Nsp14 is part of the Replication Complex. Recent research showed that, as for other coronaviruses, replication of SARS-CoV-2 genome takes place in replication organelles that provide a protective environment for the newly synthesized viral genome(V’kovski et al. 2021). Interestingly, these organelles are formed in the cytoplasm and present convoluted double layered membranes. A recent EM study showed that these organelles have pores and that likely exchange material with the cytoplasm(Wolff et al. 2020).</p><p>A previous study using the same plasmid we utilized showed that Nsp14 is cytoplasmatic by immunohistochemistry (Gordon, Hiatt, et al. 2020). In any case, we now determined the localization using a complementary approach and performing subcellular fractionation and chromatin isolation at different timepoints after transfection (12h, 24h. 48h). In agreement with previous publication, our results showed that Nsp14 is exclusively cytoplasmic (new Figure 6 – —figure supplement 1A). This strongly indicates that the transcriptional changes induced by Nsp14 are mediated by other cellular factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Whole cell protein levels:</p><p>– How much higher, per cell, is the transfection of Nsp14 than what accumulates during native infections?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the point raised by the reviewer. To partially address this issue, we have compared the levels of the RNA encoding Nsp14 during the infection to the ones obtained following transfection and showed they are comparable (indeed higher during the infection; see (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) ). Specifically, in our total RNA seq we detect about 10<sup>5</sup> normalized reads for <italic>Nsp14</italic> and in the dataset of total RNA seq from HEK293T-hACE2 infected with SARS-CoV-2(Sun et al. 2021) we detected more than 10<sup>6</sup> normalized reads for <italic>Orf1ab</italic> (Nsp14 is generated from proteolytic cleavage of polyprotein Orf1ab) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71945-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We are aware that this is just an approximative comparison since many RNA molecules are not translated but packaged into new viral particles during the infection. We are aware about the limitations of this experiment as it doesn’t determine protein levels and we have stated this clearly in the new version of the manuscript. Nevertheless, we believe that, although the expression levels of Nsp14 are likely higher in the transfection experiments, our results are still very relevant given the strong overlap observed with the gene expression transcriptional profile. Furthermore, in this new version of the manuscript, we re-analyzed a published dataset of infected cells and we showed significant overlap between alternative splicing events that occur during the infection and upon Nsp14 expression, further indicating that our model partially recapitulates what is happing during the infection. Last but not least, our study shows that the effects of Nsp14 are mediated by IMPDH2 (or at least require IMPDH2 activity) because pharmacological inhibitors of IMPDH2 recues gene expression and alternative splicing. Intriguingly, previous work showed that MPA reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication(Gordon, Jang, et al. 2020). In summary, we believe that our model recapitulates some events of SARS-CoV-2 infections, although we are aware of its limitations. In addition, we think that the suggestion of looking into how different pairs of protein work together is a great idea (see below) although outside of the time frame of this work. In response to this idea, we have included a few lines in the discussion about this. We thank the reviewer for bringing up this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Again, here, for Figure 5, it would be very important to know WHEN Nsp14 is actually expressed/present in the cell. There are not many changes after 8 hours, but how much Nsp14 have the 293 cells even made at this point?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer to rise this important point. This is indeed key</p><p>because we observed the first changes that might be important to understand the cascade of events that lead to the effect of Nsp14. We addressed this question in two ways:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We performed WB at different timepoints and observed expression of Nsp14 from the 6-hour post transfection timepoint. These results are shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B. These results are consistent with our 3’RNAseq data showing the first genes differentially expressed upon Nsp14 transfection.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In addition, we determine the normalized number of reads of <italic>Nsp14</italic> in our 3’ RNAseq dataset. The result is reported in Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and show robust expression of <italic>Nsp14</italic> mRNA, even at early timepoints.</p></list-item></list><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The fact that &quot;more than 50% of the changes in the transcriptome upon Nsp14 expression are transcriptional&quot; seems like it warrants a bit of investigation and hopefully some imaging or subcellular fractionation at different time points could at least provide a framework to propose hypotheses for how this is possible in the context of the other mechanisms you're proposing</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this up. We acknowledge that the statement was confusing. We based our assessment of how much of the changes are transcriptional on the amount of intronic signal of the differentially expressed genes in the total RNAseq, but we didn’t imply that Nsp14 acts directly to activate transcription but through the proposed pathways. Indeed, although the hypothesis that Nsp14 works as a transcriptional or nuclear factor would lead to a compelling model, we don’t think that the transcriptional effects are directly due to the binding of Nsp14 to chromatin or even its localization to the nucleus, and we provide now experiments to show that (subcellular fractionation and chromatin isolation at different timepoints showed in Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). Nevertheless, we verified that there is a transcriptional effect for a subset of genes that are deregulated upon Nsp14 expression by performing RT-qPCR from nascent RNA (showed in Figure 2F). We have also provided a much better explanation in the discussion of the possible mechanisms that could make this possible. We are grateful to the reviewer for bringing this up as it was really confusing before, and we feel that it is much clearer now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– One could also do a chromatin-fractionation to see if Nsp14 sticks to chromatin, better / more complete to do ChIP-seq but this could be overkill for this study</p></disp-quote><p>Following this suggestion, we indeed performed subcellular fractionation and chromatin isolation and couldn’t find Nsp14 bound to chromatin or even in the nucleus. Regarding IMPDH2, previous studies showed that IMPDH2 can be found in the nucleus(Ahangari et al. 2021). Although we did not investigate this in more detail, we agree that ChIP might be a good way to test whether Nsp14 alters IMPDH2 localization and nuclear function in the future and have discussed this possibility in the discussion. However, all our evidence points towards a different mechanism of action of Nsp14.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The circRNA changes are interesting at a high level however it is hard to know how surprising or unique this change is; both that it changes and the magnitudes (number of circRNAs changing). Are there data that this could be compared to? For example, KD, KO, or OE of other splicing factors in experimental or disease conditions that show fewer, similar, or more changes in circRNAs, and importantly how these numbers compare to the changes in the linear mRNA pool.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this keen question about circRNAs mis regulation. In our dataset we see about -250 circRNAs upregulated upon Nsp14 expression. This is indeed a large fraction, as we detected about 2,400 circRNAs in the control cells. Intriguingly, most of the upregulated circRNAs do not derive from genes that are also upregulated upon Nsp14 expression suggesting that this is specific regulation of exon circularization rather than the mere consequence of increased transcription from the locus (we now showed these results in Figure 3 and explained in the Result section “Nsp14 expression provokes changes in alternative splicing and circRNAs production”). We have now highlighted this information as it was clearly not well explained before. We hypothesize that accumulation of circRNAs could be linked to changes in the cell cycle or proliferation state of the cell (we have now expanded this on the Discussion). In addition, it is difficult to make a fair comparison between our experimental designs and previously published studies about circRNAs expression in the context of pathologies, but previously published examples of circRNAs altered in disease conditions or upon expression of specific splicing factors, generally report smaller numbers of circRNAs changing.</p><p>Below we show some examples from recent studies which show how different physiological contexts and genetic manipulation of factors involved in circRNAs biogenesis can result in altered expression of global circRNAs:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Bachmayr-Heyda and colleagues reported global reduction of circRNAs in colorectal cancer cell lines and cancer compared to normal tissues. They found 39 circRNAs (out of the predicted 1,812) being mis regulated (11 up and 28down). Furthermore, they discovered a negative correlation of global circRNA expression and cell proliferation, postulating a model about circRNAs accumulation in non-proliferating cells (Bachmayr-Heyda et al. 2015). This is particularly relevant to our case. Indeed, Nsp14 alters the expression of cell cycle controlling genes and this could potentially lead to cell cycle arrest. In the future we would like to assess the impact of Nsp14 on cell cycle and investigate the impact of cell cycle arrest on circRNAs accumulation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Conn and colleagues (Conn et al. 2015) showed that QKI is a crucial factor for circRNA biogenesis in the EMT context. Indeed, they reported that out of 300 abundant circRNAs in mesenchymal human mammary epithelial cells, 105 were decreased in QKI knockdown cells, while only 7 were increased.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Errichielli and colleagues (Errichelli et al. 2017) showed that FUS is important for regulating circRNA expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). In mESC derived from FUS-/- mice, they found 136 deregulated circRNAs, in comparison to cells derived from FUS +/+ mice. Remarkably, 111 out of the 136 circRNAs were downregulated.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Nova 2 is another factor involved in circRNA regulation in the murine brain. Knupp and colleagues reported 78 downregulated and 43 upregulated circRNAs in Nova2-KO brain in respect to the control(Knupp et al. 2021).</p></list-item></list><p>We hope these examples may provide a better idea about the factors and the physiological contexts that induce circRNA deregulation, as well as of the magnitude of the effects. We mentioned some of these examples also in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experimental idea in Figure 4, with co-expression is quite nice however limited in scope. This may be ok for this study, but it is hard to know how all these factors work together during a native infection when studying them in isolation. It's convenient that Nsp14 has such a singularly robust impact of the host transcriptome, but one wonders how the combination of the other gene products would better tune or in other ways influence the host cell's state.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this up. We do agree that it will be very interesting to perform additional co-expression experiments. Indeed, Nsp14 is part of the replication complex and therefore it works with several other viral proteins to provide proofreading activity. Pull down assays showed that Nsp14 interacts with nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 (replicase and its cofactor)(Romano et al. 2020; Subissi et al. 2014). Furthermore, it is also important for the modification of the 5’ cap of the viral RNA, and for this scope it works closely with other proteins involved in this process(Y. Chen et al. 2009). In this context, we agree that could be really informative to dissect the function of these interactions on the cell transcriptome. We have now added this to the discussion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors addressed most of the points raised by reviewers and enhanced the manuscript with compelling data. Although they did not address the comment regarding the role of Nsp14 function in authentic infection, I think that the function of Nsp14 observed upon exogenous expression is well addressed. I do understand the limitation of doing BSL3 experiment. But here I have some questions and suggestions related to their response to this comment.</p><p>1. The authors showed the cytoplasmic localization of exogenous Nsp14 as one of the supporting evidence of resemblance to SARS-COVID-2 infection situation. I wonder how cytoplasmic localization of Nsp14 could be associated with altered splicing events which occur in the nucleus. It would be nice to include any speculation on this in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this puzzling evidence. Based on our evidence, we claimed that Nsp14 does not directly regulate gene expression and alternative splicing in the nucleus but that cellular proteins mediate these effects. For example, we claim that IMPDH2 mediates both gene expression changes and alternative splicing, but we cannot exclude that also other proteins might be involved in the process. We changed the discussion to make this point clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. To further support the role of Nsp14 in altered splicing upon the real SARS-CoV-2 infection, I would suggest reinforcing the specificity of Nsp14 on altered splicing. Given that Nsp16 is also known for altered splicing, especially causing intron retention which is the common phenomenon the authors observed with Nsp14, I still wonder how much Nsp14 would explain the altered splicing upon SARS-COVID-2 infection.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for stressing this interesting point. Indeed, we are very interested in comparing the effect of Nsp14 and Nsp16 to determine which is the contribution of each of them to alternative splicing during SARS-CoV-2. We included in the Discussion possible ways to address this question with future experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors carefully read the initial reviews, extended their work, and I think addressed the major of the conceptual points raised. The additional data and controls included provide better context in some cases and strengthen the mechanistic claims overall. Parts of the news results and Discussion sections I think also better contextualize some of the initial ideas that were less clearly stated in the first draft. As far as I am concerned, I think this manuscript should proceed to publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive feedback.</p><p>Furthermore, we would like to point to the editor and the reviewer’s attention that we modified the following minor points:</p><p>– We updated the acknowledgement section as we realized that we forgot to mention some contributors in the previous version of the manuscript</p><p>– We corrected the founding section</p><p>– We realized that we mentioned ORF3b in the manuscript. However, we found some studies that reported a mistake in the nomenclature of this protein/plasmid (Jungreis et al., Virology 2021 and Nelson et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2020). The sequence cloned in the plasmid for our screening was ORF3d. We changed the figure and the text accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
