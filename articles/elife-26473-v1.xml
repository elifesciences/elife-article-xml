Smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (smMLCK) is a member of a diverse group of serine/threonine kinases that feature cytoskeletal association. Its catalytic activity is triggered by a conformational change upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM) binding. Due to its significant homology with the force-activated titin kinase, smMLCK is suspected to be also regulatable by mechanical stress. In this study, a CaM-independent activation mechanism for smMLCK by mechanical release of the inhibitory elements is investigated via high throughput AFM single-molecule force spectroscopy. The characteristic pattern of transitions between different smMLCK states and their variations in the presence of different substrates and ligands are presented. Interaction between kinase domain and regulatory light chain (RLC) substrate is identified in the absence of CaM, indicating restored substrate-binding capability due to mechanically induced removal of the auto-inhibitory regulatory region.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26473.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26473.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase</kwd><kwd>force-activation</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>auto-inhibition</kwd><kwd>single-molecule force spectroscopy</kwd><kwd>atomic force microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sonderforschungsbereich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB863-A01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baumann</surname><given-names>Fabian</given-names></name><name><surname>Bauer</surname><given-names>Magnus Sebastian</given-names></name><name><surname>Pippig</surname><given-names>Diana Angela</given-names></name><name><surname>Gaub</surname><given-names>Hermann Eduard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC Advanced Grant CelluFuel</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baumann</surname><given-names>Fabian</given-names></name><name><surname>Bauer</surname><given-names>Magnus Sebastian</given-names></name><name><surname>Pippig</surname><given-names>Diana Angela</given-names></name><name><surname>Gaub</surname><given-names>Hermann Eduard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rees</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Alexandrovich</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Gautel</surname><given-names>Mathias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BHF Chair of Molecular Cardiology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rees</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Alexandrovich</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Gautel</surname><given-names>Mathias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Atomic force microscopy based single-molecule force spectroscopy of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase strongly indicates the existence of a mechanically triggerable activation pathway analogous to its well-established biochemical regulation pathway via calcium-loaded calmodulin.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title id="head_1">Introduction</title><p>All cells need to withstand as well as actively generate forces during division, differentiation or for their differentiated function. These mechanically governed adaptive processes require the translation of mechanical signals into physicochemical signals inside the cell that trigger an appropriate biological response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shivashankar et al., 2015</xref>). A number of mechanosensors have evolved for these purposes, including mechanosensitive ion channels. The cytoskeleton, comprising microtubules, intermediate filaments and contractile actin-myosin filaments, plays a key role in maintaining cell shape against internal and external forces, but also emerges as a main hub for mechanosignaling. The regulation of actomyosin contraction differs significantly between the calcium-activated striated muscles and myosin-light chain phosphorylation in smooth and non-muscle cells. Four myosin light chain kinases (MLCK) exist, transcribed from the MYLK1 to 4 genes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (smMLCK) is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase that particularly contributes to the regulation of smooth muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gallagher et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hong et al., 2011</xref>). SmMLCK phosphorylates the regulatory light chain (RLC) of smooth muscle myosin, which in turn triggers ATPase activity of the myosin heads. This activation results in the myosin power stroke – the fundamental process of muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dillon et al., 1981</xref>). Different MLCK homologues exist for skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue, but only in smooth muscle cells the contraction is directly linked to the activity of smMLCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Other regulatory proteins such as troponin are not present in smooth muscle cells. In contrast to skeletal or cardiac MLCK, smMLCK is not restricted to muscle tissue but is expressed in almost all mammalian cells. Further studies have revealed the importance of smMLCK in additional cellular pathways besides muscle contraction such as platelet aggregation, exocytosis, and cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hashimoto et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kumakura et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The most important regulator of smMLCK activity is Ca<sup>2+</sup>-loaded calmodulin (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM). Without external activation, smMLCK’s catalytic turnover is suppressed by a pseudosubstrate mechanism, i.e. its catalytic core is auto-inhibited by a regulatory element that mimics the RLC substrate sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pearson et al., 1988</xref>). Binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, however, initiates a conformational change in this regulatory region and thus removes auto-inhibition. Release of the regulatory sequence facilitates RLC binding and catalytic activity of smMLCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bagchi et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>Several isoforms are encoded by the smMLCK gene (MYLK1) by alternative initiation sites and differential splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lazar and Garcia, 1999</xref>), containing an N-terminal extension in addition to the core catalytic kinase domain. The core sequence is highly conserved in its domains and in their respective order. It comprises immunoglobulin-like domains, a fibronectin-like domain, a proline-rich presumably elastic region as well as the catalytic kinase domain. By homology with other members of the MLCK family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2016</xref>), the kinase domain is composed of a smaller N-terminal lobe that contains the ATP binding site and a larger C-terminal lobe that is responsible for substrate recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gallagher et al., 1997</xref>). The latter is auto-inhibited with respect to RLC binding by the regulatory element with adjacent CaM binding region. The active site is located at the interface between the two lobes. So far, the molecular structure of smMLCK and how it conveys this regulation have not been fully elucidated. However, a high degree of structural similarity to titin kinase (TK) and twitchin kinase – two prominent serine/threonine kinases from the giant muscle protein titin and the titin-like protein twitchin found in invertebrate muscles – as well as to the recently solved MYLK4 can be assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gautel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). The terminal domains of smMLCK are also highly conserved and form binding regions to F-actin (N-terminal) and myosin (C-terminal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sellers and Pato, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gautel, 2011</xref>); longer isoforms (MLCK-210) also seem to interact with other cytoskeletal components through their N-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kudryashov et al., 2004</xref>). Specific binding to myosin presumably increases the affinity between the kinase domain and RLC due to local proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Silver et al., 1997</xref>). The actin-binding domain allows smMLCK to associate along actin filaments and thus enhances its phosphorylation rate in smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 2015</xref>). The fact that these binding sites are located at the termini of the molecule suggests that smMLCK might connect simultaneously with both myosin and actin, and is theoretically capable of bridging thick and thin filaments in smooth muscle due to extensible linker regions in the proline rich repeat segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mabuchi et al., 2010</xref>). This cytoskeletal association of smMLCK could hence significantly contribute to stiffness and passive tension of smooth muscle, or to responses in external stress. An intriguing interplay exists between smMLCK and mechanical forces in some tissues; for example, repeated contractile activation leads to increased contractility in airway smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fairbank et al., 2008</xref>). Such mechanosensitive conformational modulation might be comparable to the role of TK in striated muscle cells. Titin bridges the thick and thin filament systems in the sarcomere in an analogous manner to smMLCK. It may thus act as a muscle mechanosensor, signaling exposure to mechanical tension in the contracting and mechanically stressed sarcomere. TK is also intrasterically regulated by a pseudosubstrate mechanism, but its auto-inhibition is understood to be released upon mechanical stress rather than allosterically by an effector molecule. Single-molecule studies as well as molecular dynamics simulations established that partial unfolding of TK upon external force results in a controlled release of the regulatory segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Puchner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gräter et al., 2005</xref>). This process forms an enzymatically active intermediate capable of ATP binding and subsequent substrate turnover. Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM affinity has also been detected for TK, but its binding shows only a stimulating effect rather than a full activation of its turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mayans et al., 1998</xref>). Due to these striking similarities between smMLCK and TK both in structure and in their actin-myosin association in the muscle, the existence of a comparable Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-independent regulation mechanism for smMLCK is plausible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While the established Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM activation mechanism is the most prominent and best-understood for the activation of smMLCK, other activation/regulatory factors are likely to exist, some of which are already identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stull et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pfitzer, 2001</xref>). In this study, the mechanical response of smMLCK was probed via single-molecule force spectroscopy with an atomic force microscope (AFM) to understand how this cytoskeletal kinase is conformationally modulated by external forces. We investigated the effects of the presence of different ligands such as ATP, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM or RLC peptide substrate or a combination of these on smMLCK’s pathway through its different conformational states until fully unfolded. Ligand interactions and the resulting changes to the smMLCK energy potential give further insights into its intrasterical regulatory mechanism and whether substrate binding can be enabled by the application of mechanical force.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title id="head_2">Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title id="head_3">Force response of smMLCK during AFM-based force spectroscopy</title><p>The investigated molecular construct is a truncated version of the smooth muscle isoform encoded in the smMLCK gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lazar and Garcia, 1999</xref>) lacking the proline rich region and the N-terminal actin-binding domain.

These protein states represent semistable folding intermediates on the guided way through the protein's energy potential starting from a fully folded native structure. The conformations might also correspond to partially unfolded structures which are stable enough to form functional states. The transitions between these states are marked by distinct drops in the force-distance curves. In all cases reported here these transitions are accompanied by a lengthening of the molecular construct, which is manifested in a characteristic release of hidden contour length. The recorded force-distance response of smMLCK reveals a strict hierarchy in mechanical stability of the individual domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At low forces, the kinase domain unfolds by passing an intermediate conformational state S<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> indicated by two force peaks at the end of state S<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> at <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>30 nm and of S<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> at <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>60 nm. Both transitions appear at forces of approximately 30 pN, measured at a retraction speed of 800 nm/s. At state S<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> the kinase domain is fully unfolded. This characteristic sequence is followed by Fn3 unfolding, which is assigned to a single rupture event at around 100 pN in accordance with the respective contour length and previous data on domain strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rief et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2005</xref>). Finally, the three Ig-like domains in the construct denature at forces of around 200–250 pN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rief et al., 1998</xref>). Significant elongation of the surrounding linker length due to preceding kinase unfolding does not alter rupture forces of these latter domains in our study and is therefore unlikely to influence the hierarchy of rupture forces in the probed structure or its characteristic sequence of unfolding. Since the employed tethering complex (Strep-tag II:Strep-Tactin) substantially overlaps in its rupture force regime with the unfolding force of Fn3, most force distance traces end either before or after the Fn3 domain because the tethering complex ruptured before the Ig-like domains could unfold. A transformation of 99 force-distance curves into a contour length histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) indicates that the rarely unfolded Ig-like domains and Fn3 contribute a contour length of 30 nm each. These increments are consistent with results obtained in other force spectroscopy measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rief et al., 1998</xref>). The kinase domain is assigned with respect to its contour length to a rather clear peak at 61.7<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:mo mathcolor="#000000">±</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>9.6 nm (L<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mrow><mml:mn mathcolor="#000000">23</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> released at transition S<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf21"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow/><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>→S<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mn mathcolor="#000000">3</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) and a less distinct broad ridge in the range of 25–40 nm (L<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mrow><mml:mn mathcolor="#000000">12</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> released at transition S<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mn mathcolor="#000000">1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>→S<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mn mathcolor="#000000">2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>). The relatively wide contour length distribution of the broad ridge may be caused by the low force of this event and the consequently poor transformation of this segment: further aspects which might contribute to this poorly defined transformation are discussed in the context of the ATP-binding measurements below.

The measured contour length of approximately 92 nm for the full kinase domain is in good agreement with a simple approximation assuming 0.365 nm per amino acid (255 aa <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:mo mathcolor="#000000">×</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>0.365 nm = 93.1 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dietz and Rief, 2004</xref>).

Other contour length increments in the overall construct including Fn3 and Ig-like domains were unaffected by the interaction of kinase domain and ATP. Unfolding traces in absence and presence of ATP were realized within one experiment that is, same cantilever and sample surface. The measured forces are therefore directly comparable without uncertainties in the force signal that could originate from deviations in AFM spring constant calibration.

Due to saturated binding conditions using 3 mM ATP, the obtained force histogram most likely represents exclusively the ATP-bound conformation and not a mixed population of ATP-bound and ATP-free states of the tethered smMLCK molecules.

The fact that Fn3 remains unchanged in its unfolding properties independent of ligand addition allows for relative comparison of measurements from different cantilevers. In the following, forces from different experiments are normalized according to the most probable peak force of Fn3 unfolding.

Namely, addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM to the measurement buffer leads to an absence of this barrier otherwise observed in the kinase force response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM is understood to be a trigger for structural rearrangements in the kinase domain that enable RLC binding. The detected energy barrier could represent this rearrangement mechanism. We thus propose the following hypothesis: the release of the pseudosubstrate is already realized upon initial Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding to smMLCK and is therefore not observed. If not activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, however, this regulatory modulation of the smMLCK structure appears as distinct part of the transition pathway indicated by the S<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf120"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mn mathcolor="#000000">0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>→S<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf121"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mn mathcolor="#000000">1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> without CaM has no effect on the observed feature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since the energy barrier precedes the complete process of guiding smMLCK through different conformations, the regulatory fragment appears to be released before the intact kinase domain gets denatured at all and therefore becomes inactive. This mechanism could therefore imply the existence of intermediate smMLCK conformations (S<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf122"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mn mathcolor="#000000">1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, S<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf123"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mn mathcolor="#000000">2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) with an intact active site and RLC binding capability independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM induced by mechanical forces comparable to the regulation of TK.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title id="head_6">RLC peptide interaction</title><p>Based on these considerations, we designed experiments to test if conformational changes in the unfolding pattern can also be detected in the presence of RLC substrate. A minimal MLCK substrate peptide was used as RLC substitute that interacts only with the catalytic core of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knighton et al., 1991</xref>). It consists of a truncated and slightly modified smooth muscle myosin light chain (MLC 11–23, P14A, Q15A) from chicken gizzard with the amino acid sequence KKRAARATSDVFA. It is effectively phosphorylated by smMLCK with a turnover rate of K<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf124"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mi mathcolor="#000000">M</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> = 7.5 µM (for chicken gizzard smMLCK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kemp and Pearson, 1985</xref>).

The experimental results could therefore represent a first indicator for a force-driven activation of the catalytic pathway of smMLCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In the living organism, we assume that smMLCK bridges actin and myosin filaments in smooth muscle tissue and thus allows for a stretched conformation that additionally promotes kinase activity. By relative movements in the cytoskeleton, sufficient mechanical stress may be created within the protein regulating its catalytic activity besides Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding, as proposed in this study. Even for mechanical forces below 15 pN - the force that is identified to be necessary for activation in our experiments - steady physiological stress could likely remove autoinhibition if (semi-)permanently applied as the kinase is spanned between two filaments instead of being probed in a constant speed single-molecule force spectroscopy experiment. Despite a K<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf144"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> in the µM range between smMLCK and myosin or actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 2015</xref>), long-term association to the cytoskeleton is assumed for smMLCK especially due to several additional binding domains to both filaments in its long isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kudryashov et al., 2004</xref>). Necessary forces and lifetimes of the spanned conformation could therefore in principle be reached in a physiological context to allow for the proposed force-driven activation. The <italic>in vivo</italic> existence and relevance of this regulation pathway, however, has to be examined in further studies. Our conclusions are drawn from single-molecule force spectroscopy measurements where we specifically tethered smMLCK and forced it through several conformations. The presented AFM-based approach represents a sensitive means of detecting ligand binding on the single-molecule level but can provide only limited temporal information about the interaction. From the barrier pattern, it is not directly discernible if the substrate binds in the course of the pulling (as assumed for the RLC) or if it is bound right from the beginning of measurements (as for ATP binding). In order to exclude pre-binding of the substrate, basal binding activity of RLC in absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM activation was tested for the used construct via isothermal titration calorimetry. Due to the presumably very low binding affinities, interaction kinetics could not be detected at moderate concentrations to distinguish between basal and mechanically induced binding. The investigated construct does not show Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-independent enzymatic activity, suggesting that RLC does not bind to smMLCK in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM under zero tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). While beyond the scope of this study, hybrid approaches will be required to obtain a complete and conclusive picture of the binding mechanism and its physiological relevance, ideally complemented by structural information of the auto-inhibited state. In particular, combined force and fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations will aid in this. Ultimately, we need to develop an assay that directly visualizes substrate turnover upon force-activation of these enzymes, as <italic>in-situ</italic> unbinding forces from actin and myosin filaments (which are yet unknown) will interplay with the mechanically induced intramolecular conformational changes. Direct measurements of force-induced substrate binding and activity, that is, RLC phosphorylation, will then lead to full comprehension of this alternative activation path for smMLCK. To this end, the powerful combination of single-molecule force spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy in nanoapertures can provide the basis for <italic>in vitro</italic> force-activation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heucke et al., 2013</xref>), to complement the presented findings that RLC substrate binds smMLCK under force in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26473.030</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Structural interpretation of the stabilized S<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf145"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mn mathcolor="#000000">2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> state upon RLC interaction.</title><p>Mechnical stress forces the construct into a conformational state S<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf146"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mn mathcolor="#000000">1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> equivalent to the state reached by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding.

The succinimide group is attached via (3-aminopropyl)-dimethyl-ethoxysilane (APDMES, Karlsruhe, Germany) to the respective surface. The reactive maleimide group covalently conjugates to accessible thiol groups on applied bio-molecules used for specific immobilization.

Software for the automated control of AFM head and xy-piezos was programmed in IgorPro6 (Wavemetrics, OR, USA). Strep-Tactin coated Biolever Mini cantilevers were briefly brought in contact with the sample surface and then retracted at 800 nm/s. After each recorded force-distance curve, the surface was horizontally moved in steps of 100 nm distance for iteratively probing a new position. The cantilever spring constant was calibrated using the equipartition theorem method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hutter and Bechhoefer, 1993</xref>). Typically, datasets contain 30000 force-distance curves and the addition of the substrate was performed in the course of the experiment. If data was not collected within one experiment, but was directly compared via rupture force histograms, the recorded force values were normalized according to the most probable rupture force of the Fn3 domain. For this normalization, only those force-distance curves in a dataset were regarded that detached after unfolding of the Fn3 domain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title id="head_13">Data analysis</title><p>Force heatmaps were assembled from all curves showing the characteristic unfolding pattern of the stressed smMLCK construct. Respective force spectroscopy data was aligned in force-distance space and transformed to a heatmap based on raw data points with 750 bins per axis. Data evaluation was carried out in Python 2.7. The rupture forces were evaluated from the AFM force-distance curves utilizing a quantum mechanically corrected WLC model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hugel et al., 2005</xref>). The AFM distance was corrected for cantilever bending. 20 nm force baseline after the last rupture event – typically representing detachment – was used for determining zero force in the transformation of deflection signal to force values. Force-extension data was transformed into contour length space via an inverse worm-like chain model assuming a persistence length of 0.4 nm and a thermal energy of 4.1 pN nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jobst et al., 2013</xref>). On the transformed data a Gaussian kernel density estimate is applied with a bandwidth of 1 nm. Data set alignments in contour length space are created by the following process: the full set of transformed force-distance curves is aligned to a random curve from this data set according to least residual in cross correlation. This process results in a first superimposition which is used as a template in a second iteration of this process. Again, all contour-length transformed curves are aligned to a template curve but this time to the one formed by the first iteration. This two-step approach diminishes biasing effects given by the choice of the random curve used for initial alignment. Contour lengths of the individual domains are determined by a Gaussian fit of each determined peak and subtraction of the respective fitted means. The error of an increment is given by the standard deviations of both peaks defining the individual increment. Force-distance curves were denoised with Total Variation Denoising in order to detect rupture events as significant drops in force. For the force histograms, detected peaks in the typical region of respective domain unfolding were assigned to S<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf158"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mn mathcolor="#000000">1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>→S<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf159"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mn mathcolor="#000000">2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, S<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf160"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mn mathcolor="#000000">2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>→S<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf161"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mn mathcolor="#000000">3</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> or Fn3.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Arup Chakraborty (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: James R Sellers (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The smooth muscle myosin kinase (smMLCK) is a catalytically active serine/threonine kinase which is triggered by a conformational change upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM) binding. smMLCK shows a structural homology with the force-activated titin kinase and thus may be expected also to be regulated by mechanical pulling stress. In this paper, the authors studied the mechanical response of smMLCK applying AFM-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) to understand how this cytoskeletal kinase is conformationally modulated by external forces. It was particularly investigated whether the presence of different ligands including ATP, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM or RLC peptide substrate or a combination of these affect the mechanical unfolding intermediates along the unfolding pathway of smMLCK. To reveal statistically solid insights these mechanisms have been investigated via high throughput SMFS. The characteristic pattern of transitions between different smMLCK states and their variations in the presence of different substrates and ligands are presented. The results show a very interesting interaction between kinase domain and regulatory light chain (RLC) substrate in the absence of CaM, which indicates a restored substrate-binding capability due to mechanically induced removal of the auto-inhibitory regulatory region. The data also suggest that the conformational change occurs in the presence of the substrate, suggesting that the substrate cannot bind prior to the said conformational change. In addition, the increase in unfolding force shows that the substrate does bind after the conformational change. The AFM-based single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments are conducted at outstanding quality, the experimental data is carefully analyzed and interpreted. Suitable controls have been performed and support the experimental conclusions very convincingly. The paper is written very well.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The evidence for mechanical regulation of kinase activity is indirect and thus the title may be a bit presumptuous.

Perhaps catch bonds are involved?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this work, they present evidence that the inhibitory domain of the kinase undergoes a tension-induced conformational change that is very similar to the change that occurs upon calmodulin binding, which is a known activator. Because the N and C termini are known to bind actin filaments and xxx, respectively, it is proposed that tension may function as an additional regulator mechanism for kinase activation. The data also suggest that the conformational change occurs in the presence of the substrate, suggesting that the substrate cannot bind prior to the said conformational change. In addition, the increase in unfolding force shows that the substrate does bind after the conformational change. Overall, I find the work interesting and of high quality, and there is a good reason to suspect that force can activate the enzyme activity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The smooth muscle myosin kinase (smMLCK) is a catalytically active serine/therosine kinase which is triggered by a conformational change upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM) binding. smMLCK shows a structural homology with the force-activated titin kinase and thus may be expected also to be regulated by mechanical pulling stress.

From the data they infer that force may be a regulator of kinase function. The data show that various domains of the kinase unfold sequentially in a reproducible manner and the authors are able to assign unfolding events to particular domains. They show that the kinase domain unfolds first followed by the FN3 domain and then the Ig domains unfold last. The evidence for mechanical regulation of kinase activity is very indirect and thus the title may be a bit presumptuous. The main data to suggests this behavior is that the S2 state is stabilized in the presence of an RLC substrate peptide.</p><p>The study is of considerable interest and is well executed.</p><p>Regarding my comment about the data not really showing mechanical activation of the enzyme, I realize that this is a very difficult thing to actually prove and the necessary technical advances are brought up in the Discussion. Based on this, I do wonder whether the title oversells the manuscript.</p><p>Some of the speculation about possible mechanoregulation of the kinase stems from early biochemical studies that showed smooth muscle MLCK could bind myosin filaments via its C-terminus and actin filaments via the N-terminus.

However, we agree that those evidences are drawn rather indirectly by means of AFM force spectroscopy data. Although the data is conclusive and in our opinion convincing, a direct proof of the force activation cannot be given so far. To make this clear to the reader, we would therefore like to suggest the following title:</p><p>Increasing Evidence of Mechanical Force as a Functional Regulator in Smooth Muscle Myosin Light Chain Kinase (see title).</p><p><italic>Some of the speculation about possible mechanoregulation of the kinase stems from early biochemical studies that showed smooth muscle MLCK could bind myosin filaments via its C-terminus and actin filaments via the N-terminus. However, the K<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf166"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> for both of these bindings were in the μm range and the recent results from the Cremo and Baker labs (Hong et al., 2015) show that the kinase diffuses along actin filaments.

However, the measured affinity does not necessarily implicate low binding forces as could be shown in the past by other force spectroscopy studies. Other factors such as pulling geometry or force trajectory through the receptor-ligand system could be identified as much more dominant parameters. Best example is the Strep-Tag II:Strep-Tactin handle system employed in this study itself: despite a similar K<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf167"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> in the µM range, we could show that rupture forces easily suffice to not only activate but also unfold the kinase and its side domains.</p><p>A crucial factor, however, is given by the timescales of the binding partners represented in the dissociation rate. The system has to form a stable linkage lasting long enough to bridge mechanical stress and therefore allow activation of the kinase domain before it dissociates again. For a system diffusing along the filaments, however, long-term association can certainly be assumed. Additional binding domains in the long isoforms of MLCK additionally increase this cytoskeletal association as shown by Kudryashov et al. in 2004 (Myosin light chain kinase (210 kDa) is a potential cytoskeleton integrator through its unique N-terminal domain).</p><p>Our hypothesis is that relative movement of actin to myosin in the muscle sets smMLCK under tension. Even for physiological forces below values of 15 pN as shown in our AFM force spectroscopy data, activation can be expected if the molecule is kept in a stretched conformation for sufficient time (comparable to a force-clamp configuration). A catch-bond mechanism might be possible but is not essential for our interpretation.</p><p>To address this we included a paragraph in the discussion section of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
