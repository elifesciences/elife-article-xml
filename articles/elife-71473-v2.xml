of the eyes. Mutations in <italic>RLBP1</italic> are associated with recessively inherited clinical phenotypes, including Bothnia dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, retinitis punctata albescens, fundus albipunctatus, and Newfoundland rod–cone dystrophy. However, the etiology of these retinal disorders is not well understood. Here, we generated homologous zebrafish models to bridge this knowledge gap. Duplication of the <italic>rlbp1</italic> gene in zebrafish and cell-specific expression of the paralogs <italic>rlbp1a</italic> in the retinal pigment epithelium and <italic>rlbp1b</italic> in Müller glial cells allowed us to create intrinsically cell type-specific knockout fish lines. Using <italic>rlbp1a</italic> and <italic>rlbp1b</italic> single and double mutants, we investigated the pathological effects on visual function. Our analyses revealed that <italic>rlbp1a</italic> was essential for cone photoreceptor function and chromophore metabolism in the fish eyes. <italic>rlbp1a-</italic>mutant fish displayed reduced chromophore levels and attenuated cone photoreceptor responses to light stimuli. They accumulated 11-<italic>cis</italic> and all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinyl esters which displayed as enlarged lipid droplets in the RPE reminiscent of the subretinal yellow-white lesions in patients with <italic>RLBP1</italic> mutations. During aging, these fish developed retinal thinning and cone and rod photoreceptor dystrophy. In contrast, <italic>rlbp1b</italic> mutants did not display impaired vision. The double mutant essentially replicated the phenotype of the <italic>rlbp1a</italic> single mutant. Together, our study showed that the <italic>rlbp1a</italic> zebrafish mutant recapitulated many features of human blinding diseases caused by <italic>RLBP1</italic> mutations and provided novel insights into the pathways for chromophore regeneration of cone photoreceptors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>visual cycle</kwd><kwd>retinoid</kwd><kwd>CRALBP</kwd><kwd>retinal degeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schweizerische Nationalfonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_173083</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neuhauss</surname><given-names>Stephan CF</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY028121</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>von Lintig</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY020551</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>von Lintig</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Robert und Rosa Pulfer Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schlegel</surname><given-names>Domino K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The retinoid-binding protein RLBP1 in the retinal pigment epithelium is crucially involved in cone photoreceptor visual pigment recycling and mimics the human eye disease with retinal lipid deposits when mutated.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The gene <italic>RLBP1</italic> encodes the cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP), a soluble 36 kDa protein involved in the vertebrate visual cycle. CRALBP belongs to the CRAL-TRIO family of proteins and contains a CRAL-TRIO domain common to several lipid-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Panagabko et al., 2003</xref>). In mammals, CRALBP is expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Müller glial cells (MGCs). It is known to bind 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal (11cisRAL) in the RPE and both 11cisRAL and 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinol (11cisROL) in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saari et al., 1982</xref>). It is also able to bind 9-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal but not 13-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saari and Bredberg, 1987</xref>). CRALBP facilitates both the isomerohydrolase reaction mediated by RPE65 and the oxidation of the product, 11cisROL, to 11cisRAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saari et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saari et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stecher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Winston and Rando, 1998</xref>). Also, CRALBP prevents unwanted side reactions or premature photoisomerization of the unstable chromophore 11cisRAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McBee et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in <italic>RLBP1</italic> have been associated with a group of autosomal recessive retinal diseases comprising autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maw et al., 1997</xref>), Bothnia dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burstedt et al., 1999</xref>), Newfoundland rod–cone dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eichers et al., 2002</xref>), retinitis punctata albescens (RPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morimura et al., 1999</xref>), and fundus albipunctatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Katsanis et al., 2001</xref>). These retinal disorders differ in certain aspects of the disease such as time of onset, severity, and progression. However, they all cause prolonged dark adaptation and night blindness in early childhood. Upon progression, the involvement of the macula and RPE is possible, resulting in loss of central vision and legal blindness at the age of 20–40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burstedt and Golovleva, 2010</xref>). Another interesting common feature in patients with <italic>RLBP1</italic>-associated disease is a characteristic fundus appearance with homogeneously distributed, punctate white-yellow deposits. It was found that impaired CRALBP function can be caused by pathogenic mutations that either tighten or weaken the interaction of CRALBP with 11cisRAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Golovleva et al., 2003</xref>). The crystal structure of wild-type and mutant CRALBP provided insights into the accompanying molecular changes within the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The involvement of cone photoreceptors at later stages of the disease makes it imperative to elucidate the role of CRALBP in visual pigment regeneration. While visual pigment regeneration in rods is very well established (e.g., reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiser et al., 2014</xref>), the processes involved in 11cisRAL recycling in cones are less well understood. Besides the canonical visual cycle, a Müller glia cell-dependent intraretinal visual cycle has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleisch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collery et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sato and Kefalov, 2016</xref>) as well as recycling pathways via light-dependent mechanisms both in the RPE and MGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolesnikov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morshedian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaylor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babino et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these pathways might meet the demand for chromophore supply of cones during bright daylight illumination and prevent competition between cone and rod photoreceptor for the unique chromophore.</p><p>Interestingly, mammalian <italic>RLBP1</italic>, the gene encoding CRALBP, is expressed not only in RPE cells but also in Müller glia cells (MGCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bunt-Milam and Saari, 1983</xref>). Therefore, CRALBP was implicated in the pathways for visual pigment regeneration in both cell types. Findings from morpholino-knockdown in zebrafish larvae supported this idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleisch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collery et al., 2008</xref>). However, the exact mechanisms underlying these complementary pathways and the role of CRALBP therein are still debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolesnikov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ward et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morshedian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kiser et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kiser et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to mammals, the zebrafish eyes harbor duplicates of Cralbp and express <italic>rlbp1a</italic> in RPE cells and <italic>rlbp1b</italic> in MGCs in a nonoverlapping pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleisch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collery et al., 2008</xref>). In the current study, we exploited the fish to target Cralbp in an intrinsically cell-specific manner and investigated the contributions of the RPE and the MGC to cone visual pigment regeneration. The cone-dominant retina of the zebrafish and the practically exclusively cone-driven retinal responses in larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Branchek, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bilotta et al., 2001</xref>) facilitated the investigation of cone-specific defects upon knockout of either <italic>rlbp1</italic> paralog in larvae up to 5 days postfertilization (dpf). Moreover, our model has the advantage over previous morpholino-mediated knockdown studies in that we could assess the progression of the disease beyond 5 dpf. Importantly, our fish model recapitulated the key characteristics of the human disease, including progressive retinal thinning and the appearance of subretinal lipid deposits, resembling the yellow-white dots in patient fundi.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of intrinsically cell-specific KO lines using CRISPR/Cas9</title><p>The nonoverlapping expression pattern of <italic>rlbp1a</italic> and <italic>rlbp1b</italic> in the zebrafish retina allowed us to target each Cralbp separately and to create intrinsically cell-specific knockout (KO) lines. The <italic>rlbp1a</italic>−/− line harbors a 19 bp deletion in exon four causing a frameshift and an early stop codon. The <italic>rlbp1b−</italic>/− line displays an in-frame 18 bp deletion in exon 4 (see Methods Table 2 for sequences). Both KOs were confirmed in retinal sections using immunohistochemistry with a CRALBP antiserum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In wild types, CRALBP immunofluorescence is present in the RPE cells and the MGCs. In <italic>rlbp1a−</italic>/−, the staining is only present in MGCs, while in <italic>rlbp1b−</italic>/−, staining is restricted to the RPE. Double-KO animals were generated by crossing the two single-mutant lines. The loss of Cralbp proteins in the retina of double-KO was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Both single-KO lines had reduced levels of mRNA of the targeted gene, indicative of nonsense-mediated decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Notably, the expression of the respective paralogs was not increased. Therefore, transcriptional adaptation, often observed in zebrafish knockout models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rossi et al., 2015</xref>), through upregulation of the paralogs, was not observed for Cralbps.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Protein and gene expression in Cralbp-knockout (KO) lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunohistochemical staining with cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP) antiserum (CRALBPas, magenta) and RPE65 (cyan) and glutamine synthetase (GS, yellow) as counterstain for RPE and Müller glia, respectively, on cryosections of adult retinas.

We found that the knockout of <italic>rlbp1a</italic> impaired cone-driven ERG responses and led to disturbed OS morphology of both rods and cones and age-dependent thinning of the photoreceptor nuclear layer. HPLC analysis of <italic>rlbp1a−</italic>/− revealed an accumulation of retinyl esters and a reduction in 11cisRAL that was associated with this visual impairment. To our knowledge, we present the first animal model that recapitulates both the age-dependent retinal thinning and the appearance of subretinal lesions that are commonly found in patients suffering from <italic>RLBP1</italic> mutations.</p><p>Our data indicate that in early stages, the lack of 11cisRAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B and E</xref>, top panel) is most likely the primary cause for the reduction in cone-mediated retinal function in the <italic>rlbpa1−/−</italic> fish. However, at later stages, the disturbed OS morphology and the loss of photoreceptors are likely to contribute to a deterioration of vision in these fish. In addition, it seemed that the integrity of both rods and cones is affected in <italic>rlbp1a−/−</italic> and double-KO fish. The elevated retinyl ester levels in <italic>rlbp1a−/−</italic> and double-KO zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B and E</xref>, middle and lower panel) display as enlarged retinosomes found upon histological examination. ONL thinning appeared, concomitant with the increased number of enlarged retinosomes, only with age. It is interesting to note, that chromophore regeneration was not completely blocked but only attenuated in Cralbpa deficiency. This was true not only for <italic>rlbp1a−/−</italic>, but also for the double-KO.</p><p>These findings are consistent with the prolonged dark adaptation in patients with Bothnia dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burstedt et al., 2003</xref>), and in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saari et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lima de Carvalho et al., 2020</xref>). Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stecher et al., 1999</xref> proposed that CRALBP facilitates the hydrolysis of 11cisRE. More recently, it was reported that the 11cisRE pool in the zebrafish RPE is mobilized in a light-dependent manner to meet the high demand for chromophore under bright daylight conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babino et al., 2015</xref>). We now demonstrated that the mobilization of the 11cisRE pool is Cralbpa dependent and plays a critical role for cone visual pigment regeneration. Interestingly, we found that 11cisRE concentrations also declined in the absence of Cralbpa upon light exposure. This result raises the possibility that 11cisRE hydrolysis can occur Cralbpa independently. Thus, Cralbpa may be mainly required to assist the oxidation of 11cisROL to 11cisRAL, as earlier proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saari et al., 1994</xref>. Additionally, Cralbpa may act as a chaperone for chromophores in the RPE and prevent the light-dependent isomerization of the released 11-<italic>cis</italic>-ROL diastereomer to the <italic>trans</italic>-diastereomer of retinol in the RPE. The latter would be reesterified by LRAT (lecithin retinol acyltransferase), an enzyme that has a high capacity for RE production. This reaction sequence would explain the increase in atRE concentration in illuminated <italic>rlbp1a−/−</italic> larvae.</p><p>As an acceptor of 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinoids RPE-expressed Cralbpa is found at a convergence point for potentially all chromophore producing pathways of the RPE. Besides its well-known function in the classical visual cycle downstream of RPE65 and its role in the light-dependent 11cisRE mobilization described in this study CRALBP was also shown to support photic chromophore regeneration by RGR in bovine RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, knockout of MGC-expressed <italic>rlbp1b</italic> in zebrafish did not affect 11cisRAL content, nor morphology and only marginally affected retinal function in the double-KO in BL conditions. This observation excludes that the MGC-expressed Cralbp carries out the same function in chromophore regeneration as its counterpart in the RPE. Accordingly, it was previously shown that 11cisRE was mostly present in retinosomes of the RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babino et al., 2015</xref>). However, we do not close out that Cralbpb may play different roles in the visual cycle. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kiser et al., 2018</xref> suggested that CRALBP in MGCs could serve as a chromophore storage site by binding 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinoids. Also, RGR in MGCs was implicated in light-dependent chromophore regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morshedian et al., 2019</xref>) and Cralbpb may drive this reaction during BL conditions. In this line of thought our measurements of 11cisRAL in the rlbp1b-KO could be masked by RGR-bound retinoids and provide an explanation for the more severe phenotype in double-KO, despite the apparently normal amounts of 11cisRAL in rlbp1b-KO. Further research is needed to explore the role of Cralbpb in the zebrafish retina.</p><p>Early work in mice failed to reproduce the progressive loss of photoreceptors as well as the characteristic fundus findings seen in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saari et al., 2001</xref>). A more recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lima de Carvalho et al., 2020</xref>) reported ONL thinning in <italic>Rlbp1−/−</italic> mice between 8 and 12 months of age. Such changes may have gone unnoticed in earlier studies on <italic>Rlbp1−/−</italic> mice due to the younger age of animals at examination (5.5 months). Also in patients, the onset of degenerative processes can vary between individuals. Our zebrafish model recapitulates the early impairment of rods and subsequent cone dysfunction that culminates in photoreceptor degeneration at a relatively early age. Therefore, it resembles more closely an early-onset form of CRALBP-associated diseases, such as RPA or Bothnia dystrophy.</p><p>The white-yellow fundus lesions in patients with CRALBP-associated disease are usually found upon imaging the central retina, including the macular region and optic disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burstedt and Golovleva, 2010</xref>). The lesions appear to be restricted in size towards the center. Interestingly, the white dots are often reported to be absent in the macula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demirci et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Naz et al., 2011</xref>) or at least the fovea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dessalces et al., 2013</xref>). The white dots are not present at an early age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gränse et al., 2001</xref>) and only become prominent in the teens and early adulthood, and slowly disappear with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burstedt et al., 2001</xref>). The macular sparing suggests that these structures are more likely to be associated with rod photoreceptors. Based on the localization of these structures between the photoreceptor and RPE layer upon OCT imaging and the fact that other visual cycle defects (e.g., mutations in <italic>RDH5</italic>, <italic>RPE65</italic>) result in a similar punctate fundus appearance, we suggest that they could represent retinyl ester-filled, enlarged retinosomes, similar to the ones we found in the zebrafish retina. If this and their association with rod photoreceptors, as mentioned above, holds true, it is curious, that despite an accumulation of retinyl esters, <italic>Rlbp1−/−</italic> mice were not reported to have enlarged retinosomes or similar structures. So, why does the cone-dominant zebrafish produce this phenotype? First, considering cone density, the larval retina nicely mimics the environment of foveal cones, even if rods are not completely absent. At this age, the accumulation of retinyl esters was not very pronounced yet and the number of lesions was much lower than in older retinas. On the other hand, juvenile and adult retinas of zebrafish are cone rich but contain roughly 40 % of rods that are regularly interspersed throughout the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fadool, 2003</xref>) in contrast to the localized distribution in humans. The older zebrafish retina, therefore, resembles more the outer macular region. Complementary pathways for cones are thought to help them compete for available chromophores with the more abundant rod photoreceptors in the human retina. The density of rods peaks just outside of the macular region. This is likely to exacerbate the need for alternative and larger chromophore sources. The dramatic increase of enlarged retinosomes at the age of 1 month seems therefore in line with the hypothesis that the white puncta are associated with the presence of rods. It seems likely, that the different visual cycle pathways in RPE and MGC would be fine-tuned according to the type of cells they are in contact with. In line with this idea, single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the human retina and RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Voigt et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Voigt et al., 2019b</xref>) revealed differences in peripheral and macular gene expression. Based on these datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kiser and Palczewski, 2021</xref>) suggested higher importance for MGC-expressed <italic>RLBP1</italic> in the peripheral retina compared to the fovea. The MGC-mediated cycle may become more important in later stages with the increase of rod contribution as it was previously suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleisch et al., 2008</xref>. This could explain the absence of an ERG phenotype in <italic>rlbp1b−/−</italic> larvae and the only subtle changes in the capacity of double-KO (compared to <italic>rlbp1a−/−</italic>) to respond to strong bleaching lights and to recover thereafter. It remains to be determined whether the knockout of <italic>rlbp1b</italic> will have a more pronounced effect on retinal function at later stages when rods are more abundant. But it is worthwhile to mention that Cralbpb influenced the retinyl ester storage in adult <italic>rlbp1b−/−</italic> and double-KO in the present study.</p><p>Differences in density and distribution of photoreceptors and the expression pattern or activity of visual cycle proteins could in part explain the discrepancies between different animal models with mutations in CRALBP. Also, the differences in 11cisRE content between species might add to this. In addition, the light environment to which the photoreceptors are exposed during life (nocturnal vs. diurnal species) may contribute to the phenotype. Together, these species-specific differences may provide an explanation for the absence of subretinal lipid droplets in mouse eyes.</p><p>In conclusion, knockout of RPE-expressed <italic>rlbp1a</italic> in zebrafish recapitulates the functional impairment and degenerative phenotype in <italic>RLBP1</italic> disease. Importantly, our model shows an increase in retinyl esters and enlarged retinosomes, providing an explanation for the yellow-white fundus lesions commonly found in <italic>RLBP1</italic> patients (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> for a graphical overview of our working model). It is therefore an excellent model not only to further dissect the disease mechanism, but also to develop potential cures for <italic>RLBP1</italic>-associated disease.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Retinoid metabolism in healthy and Cralbpa-deficient retinas.</title><p>Illustration of a healthy (leftmost) and Cralbpa-deficient (rightmost) retina with the three neural layers (nuclei in dark blue). Rod and cone photoreceptors are depicted with dark blue or turquoise outer segments, respectively. Both retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells (gray-brown) and Müller glia (yellow-brown) contact photoreceptors and are potential sources for chromophore. Between the illustrations, schematics for retinoid metabolism in healthy and Cralbpa-deficient retinas are shown with black arrows indicating the sequence of reactions or transport/diffusion (for simplicity, enzymes or transport proteins other than Cralbp are not shown). In healthy retinas, Cralbpa facilitates the generation of 11cisRAL from both atRE (via the canonical visual cycle) and 11cisRE (through light-dependent hydrolysis, yellow arrow). Therefore, lack of RPE-expressed Cralbpa leads to a reduction of 11cisRAL (gray, dotted arrows) and an accumulation of retinyl ester (bold, black arrow), which manifests as an increased number of enlarged retinosomes in RPE cells (yellow circles in schematic and illustration on the right). Both rod and cone outer segment morphology is affected and with age the outer nuclear layer is thinning and the RPE may become atrophic. The contribution of Müller glial cell-expressed Cralbpb to chromophore regeneration is smaller than expected and the enzymes involved as well as the retinoid species supplied to photoreceptors (11cisRAL/11cisROL?) remain to be further investigated.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71473-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>rlbp1a</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ensembl (GRCz11)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ensembl (GRCz11): ENSDARG00000045808</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>rlbp1b</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ensembl (GRCz11)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ensembl (GRCz11): ENSDARG00000012504</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Zebrafish: wild type Tü</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">KIT, European Zebrafish Resource Center (EZRC)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#1,173</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Zebrafish: wild type AB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">KIT, European Zebrafish Resource Center (EZRC)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#1,175</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>rlbp1a<sup>-19bp</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">mutant line</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Methods: CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis;

For ERG on single mutants, offspring of heterozygous crosses were used and the trunks were used for genotyping after measurements. Five stimulations of 100 ms duration and with increasing light intensity (100 % corresponding to 24’000 µW/cm<sup>2</sup>) were applied with an interstimulus interval of 15’000 ms. For light-adapted ERGs, an additional background illumination of 20 µW/cm<sup>2</sup> was applied and larvae were not DA before measurements. For bleaching experiments, larvae were exposed to BL from a KL 1500 HAL halogen cold light source (as described in light treatments for retinoid analysis) for 1 hr before measurements. To reduce the number of larvae as well as resources for genotyping, we did not directly use double-heterozygous incrosses for double-KO ERGs. Instead, we incrossed wild-type siblings from such a cross to yield closely related offspring as control and double-KO fish were incrossed to yield homozygous mutant offspring. Measurements were blinded by allocating wild type and double-KO larvae to wells of a 24-well plate according to a random key. For experiments including different light conditions, larvae were derived from the same clutch for all light conditions, but measurements were derived from individual retinas, due to the invasive nature of our protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>HPLC analysis of retinoids</title><p>For retinoid extraction, a whole eye from wild type and mutant adult zebrafish or 100 zebrafish mutant larvae were transferred to 2 ml Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). 200 µl of 2 M hydroxylamine (pH 8) and 200 µl of methanol were added and eyes or larvae were homogenized and incubated for 10 min at RT.

editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.06.18.448986">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted

the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>In mammals the cellular retinaldehyde binding protein, CRALBP, is expressed in the pigment epithelium (RPE) and in Müller glial cells in the retina. Zebrafish has two copies of the gene, each expressed in one of the cell types. By knocking out each gene with CRISPR/Cas9, the authors could show that it is the copy expressed in the RPE that is essential for turnover of retinal and for cone function. Thus, the zebrafish gene duplication suggests that the RPE role of CRALBP is the important one also in humans, implying the RPE as target for future gene therapy in humans with mutations in CRALBP.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Disturbed retinoid metabolism upon loss of rlbp1a impairs cone function and leads to subretinal lipid deposits and photoreceptor degeneration in the zebrafish retina&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Xesus Abalo (Reviewer #1); Gennadiy Moiseyev (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers and the reviewing editor are impressed and very positive. Here are some of the general comments from the reviewers: The experiments have been well-designed and for the most part well-executed. The results and the conclusions extracted from them are totally sound. The manuscript is written clearly and carefully, the discussion is well-structured and touches each single point. A major strength is the continuity of the reliable, rigorous and meticulous work. The graphical abstract is beautiful in many ways; stylish, informative, complete.</p><p>The reviewers and I have a number of comments and suggestions, all of which can probably be taken care of by adding clarifications and comments in the text. Some in silico work can probably be done rather quickly and easily if the information is not yet available, especially regarding the presumed ohnology of the two genes and the possible consequences of amino acid differences between them.</p><p>I apologize that the comments may not quite follow the chronology of the manuscript's text (this happens when comments from three reviewers are merged).</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) Is it clear that rlbp1a and b resulted from the teleost WGD ('ohnologs') and thus had identical sequences also in regulatory regions before starting to diverge from one another after the gene duplication? Synteny and paralogon investigations should resolve this if it hasn't been done already.</p><p>2) Lines 92-93: What is the degree of protein sequence identity between the two paralogs in zebrafish? Would the differences be likely to affect substrate binding affinity and interactions with other proteins? In silico modelling might give clues by incorporating information from human mutations.</p><p>3) Please provide additional explanation about the measurement and interpretation of 11-cis retinaldehyde (11cisRAL) levels. The text refers to &quot;11cisRAL&quot; as the aldehyde that binds to CRALBP. However, it is unclear whether the measurements of &quot;11cisRAL&quot; refer to the total of 11-cis isomer covalently bound as visual pigment (in cones and rods) in addition to the non-covalently bound 11cisRAL. It will be important for the paper to make absolutely clear what was measured, and to interpret the measurements appropriately, according to whether or not covalently bound retinaldehyde was included. If the measurements did include rhodopsin and cone opsins, then a term distinct from &quot;11cisRAL&quot; should be employed throughout the paper.</p><p>4) After mutagenesis by CRISP-Cas9, could first 3 exons of the rlbp1a-/- or rlbp1b-/- still be translated into a semi-functional peptide? How could you assess that?</p><p>5) Lines 134 and 608: Some justification is needed to explain why the eyes were collected &quot;in ambient light&quot;. Were any controls done to determine whether the retinoid levels differed for eyes collected under dark-adapted conditions?</p><p>6) Lines 154-156: The authors need to clarify their reasoning for deducing &quot;that the esters were hydrolyzed upon light exposure but not utilized&quot;. Given that Figure 2B (bottom) shows that atRE levels had increased by at least as much, is it not instead likely that retinoid recycled from the retina has been re-routed to atRE rather than to 11cisRE? How can you distinguish ester hydrolysis from reduced ester synthesis? The same considerations apply to the statement on lines 428-9 in the Discussion.</p><p>7) In the sentence &quot;rlbp1a was essential for cone photoreceptor function and chromophore metabolism&quot;, does this mean that the rlbp1a-KO does not affect rods and scotopic vision?</p><p>8) In Figure 1C, can one say that the rlbp1b-/- is really a KO? Its expression is four orders of magnitude higher than 1a in the 1a k/o. The p-value is very high and non-significant.</p><p>9) In Figure 2, there is considerable variability in the measurements of retinoid content in WT adult animals. Between panels A, C and E, the mean WT levels differ markedly: for 11cisRAL (312, 177 and 280); for 11cisRE (12.7, 86.1 and 7.2); and for atRE (168, 460 and 187). These differences would benefit from explanation. Are these WT values significantly different from each other? Would it be better to use the WT grand means in the tests of significance for the knockouts?</p><p>10) How critical is the role of Cralbpb in the MGC? The authors suggest that these cells could serve as a storage of 11-cis-retinoids. Could the authors elaborate a little this suggestion and how it might be explored? Along a similar line, which studies would the authors consider to investigate if 11cisRAL can be taken up by cones from the MGC (the question mark in the Graphical abstract)? In addition, if the MGC transform 11cisROL in 11cisRAL but the second is not transported back to the photoreceptors, what do the MGCs do with it? A storage for bright light conditions? It would be interesting to see the authors discuss this.</p><p>11) The morphology in Figure 5 (and the consecutive ones) suggests a stronger effect of the rlbp1a-KO in the ventral retina as compared to the dorsal. If this is the case, why could it be, and which implications could it have?</p><p>12) The first sentence of the discussion says &quot;Our results showed that cones in the zebrafish retina rely on RPE-expressed Cralbpa for chromophore regeneration and retinal function&quot; and summarizes the results, but as this has been extensively suggested, it would perhaps be better to focus more on the lack of effect of Cralbpb in MCG on chromophore regeneration. An important novelty is the use of a subfunctionalized teleost model to study RLBP1-KO related diseases.</p><p>13) If cralbp1a is completely KO but there is still some chromophore regeneration, what explanation for this can the authors suggest?</p><p>14) What do the authors speculate that could happen with the Retinomotor circadian movements? Would the Cralbp1a-KO fish have a similar response as for the dark-adapted retina? Could these movements be altered, therefore altering the circadian chromophore mobilisation and pigment regeneration and contributing to the accumulation of the small oil droplets/retinosomes in the RPE?</p><p>15) For the insertion of the sgRNA and Cas-GFP, the authors used the injection methods. Did they try or consider using electroporation, working very well for isolated mammalian cells?</p><p>16) In Figure 1A, the CRALBPas images are rather faint, probably due to poor contrast between background autofluorescence and the real signal, especially the two dbKO images. Presumably a negative control photo exists that could be added to help distinguish between the autofluorescence (due to the fixative, for example) and the real signal.</p><p>17) Figure 3: These 5 dpf b-wave signals seem huge, at ~10 mV. For comparison, Bilotta et al., (2001) reported ~50 µV for the b-wave in 8 dpf animals, so your values are 200x higher. If the scale was meant to show &quot;µV&quot; then the signals would be around 5x smaller than theirs. Ideally, the reader should have access to some samples of b-wave records (rather than just measured amplitudes), in order to judge the quality of the recordings, so please provide this. As a minimum, a panel of dark-adapted ERG traces should be presented as a Supplementary Figure.</p><p>18) Before the authors can state that &quot;We observed no pronounced changes of cone responses in Cralbpb-deficient larval eyes&quot; they need to illustrate rlbp1b KO responses in Figure 4. At present, the double KO plots in panel B2 (&quot;BL&quot;, and &quot;BL+reDA&quot;) appear to show considerably greater attenuation than for the rlbp1a KO plots in panel A2, strongly suggesting an effect of Cralbpb. To make the above statement, it is necessary to present the data.</p><p>19) The authors used CRALBP antiserum to detect both Cralbpa and Cralbpb. Presumably it is difficult to generate specific antibodies if the two proteins are highly identical. Instead ISH with riboprobes specific against each paralog could be used. If the coding regions are too similar,the 3´UTR could be used. The authors have surely considered these options so a comment would be appropriate.</p><p>20) The option of generating a dKO Cralbp1a/RPE65 would be an interesting next step continuing with this research line to investigate correlation between the RPE65 genes (the are three paralogs) and rlpb1a. This could be interesting to see a key protein not in transporting but to convert all-trans retinal back to 11-cis retinal, widening the spectrum of diseases to be analysed.</p><p>21) Discussion mentions (line 495 onwards) studies that use single-cell transcriptomics. The authors are encouraged to embrace this option in the near future. It would be interesting to see the transcriptome also of the KOs with spatial resolution, and using ISS or SCRINSHOT spatial mapping for specific transcripts in intact sections in situ.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71473.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) Is it clear that rlbp1a and b resulted from the teleost WGD ('ohnologs') and thus had identical sequences also in regulatory regions before starting to diverge from one another after the gene duplication?

Based on structural predictions the overall fold of the proteins is conserved. In humans, two mutations are described that affect retinoid binding of CRALBP: M226K abolishes retinoid binding, whereas R234W tightens the binding of the lipid. The mutations are located within the CRAL-TRIO domain that is highly conserved in the two zebrafish paralogs. However, form <italic>in silico</italic> models we cannot predict the affinity of the two CRALBP isoforms for 11-cis-retinol/al. Thus, we do not want to exclude that subtle differences between the paralogs modulate the binding affinity for the retinoid or the interaction of the paralogs with other proteins including Rpe65 and Rdh5. These visual cycle proteins have been previously suggested to interact with CRALBP in the RPE and are not expressed in Müller glia cells. Future studies are warranted to unravel such cell-specific protein-protein interactions.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71473-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please provide additional explanation about the measurement and interpretation of 11-cis retinaldehyde (11cisRAL) levels.

In our experiments we cannot distinguish between opsin bound, CRALBP bound and free 11-cis-retinal since we treated ocular tissues with hydroxylamine prior to extraction. Thus, we changed the text as follows, see lines 115-116 of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“The term 11cisRAL always refers to protein-bound (e.g. by opsin or Cralbp) and free 11cisRAL in our experiments.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) After mutagenesis by CRISP-Cas9, could first 3 exons of the rlbp1a-/- or rlbp1b-/- still be translated into a semi-functional peptide? How could you assess that?</p></disp-quote><p>In both lines, the introduced mutations leave the initial exons unaffected. The initial exons encode a coiled coil domain with non-defined function. However, the CRAL-TRIO domain that confers the lipid/retinoid binding properties of the proteins follows downstream of the target site and putative mutant variants lack this domain. Additionally, the mutation in the <italic>rlbp1a</italic>-KO line leads to an early stop codon in the putative mRNA transcript. Our immunostainings showed that no protein or only very little protein is produced from the mutant gene loci, indicating that putative mutant protein variants are rapidly degraded. Together, these features of our targeting strategy strongly indicate that we are dealing with functional null alleles for both CRALBP genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Lines 134 and 608: Some justification is needed to explain why the eyes were collected &quot;in ambient light&quot;. Were any controls done to determine whether the retinoid levels differed for eyes collected under dark-adapted conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>We collected the adult zebrafish eyes in ambient light to measure each intermediate of the visual cycle. We would expect that 11-cis-retinal and retinyl esters are the predominant intermediates in dark-adapted eyes. Additionally, our fish room setup makes it difficult to dark-adapt adult fish for a prolonged period of time. For the investigation of the consequences of different light conditions, we used larval fish which can be easily maintained in petri dishes that can be transferred to the dark room.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Lines 154-156: The authors need to clarify their reasoning for deducing &quot;that the esters were hydrolyzed upon light exposure but not utilized&quot;.

How can you distinguish ester hydrolysis from reduced ester synthesis? The same considerations apply to the statement on lines 428-9 in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We perfectly agree with this concern of the reviewers. Our statement is an assumption and not an experimentally proven fact. Therefore, we rephrased the paragraphs and now state in lines 141-143 of the revised manuscript that:</p><p>“Based on this observation and the reduced chromophore concentration in rlbp1a-/- larvae we assume that the esters were hydrolyzed upon light exposure but not utilized for 11cisRAL production”.</p><p>And in lines 282-283:</p><p>“This result raises the possibility that 11cisRE hydrolysis can occur Cralbpa-independently.”</p><p>Moreover, we indicate the other possibility that these esters stem from retinol that was released from bleached photoreceptors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the sentence &quot;rlbp1a was essential for cone photoreceptor function and chromophore metabolism&quot;, does this mean that the rlbp1a-KO does not affect rods and scotopic vision?</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, we have no reasons to assume that rods are unaffected by the mutation. However, we only tested <italic>cone</italic> photoreceptor function in our study. Regarding retinoid metabolism, we cannot differentiate between rods and cones with our biochemical measurements since we used whole larval or whole eye (adult) samples.</p><p>Morphologically, we observed that rods are also affected, possibly from an early age on (see e.g. Figure 5A3 vs. 5B3). This is further supported by the low levels of <italic>rhodopsin</italic> gene expression both in larvae and adults of the <italic>rlbp1a</italic>-KO and double-KO lines (see Figure 8). In the abstract we already state that “these fish developed retinal thinning and cone and rod photoreceptor dystrophy”.</p><p>Additionally we now emphasize the rod defect also in the sentence line 255 of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“We found that the knockout of rlbp1a impaired cone-driven electroretinogram (ERG) responses and led to disturbed outer segment morphology <italic>of both rods and cones</italic> and age-dependent thinning of the photoreceptor nuclear layer.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In Figure 1C, can one say that the rlbp1b-/- is really a KO? Its expression is four orders of magnitude higher than 1a in the 1a k/o. The p-value is very high and non-significant.</p></disp-quote><p>A knockout does not necessarily manifest at the transcriptional level. It is not unusual to observe mRNA expression from mutant alleles. Irrespective of the transcript levels, at least with the antiserum that we have at our disposal, we observe no protein in Müller glia cells in our <italic>rlbp1b</italic>-KO fish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In Figure 2, there is considerable variability in the measurements of retinoid content in WT adult animals. Between panels A, C and E, the mean WT levels differ markedly: for 11cisRAL (312, 177 and 280); for 11cisRE (12.7, 86.1 and 7.2); and for atRE (168, 460 and 187). These differences would benefit from explanation. Are these WT values significantly different from each other? Would it be better to use the WT grand means in the tests of significance for the knockouts?</p></disp-quote><p>This can be explained by technical variability due to (photo and thermal) isomerization during sample collection and processing, but also by the fact, that zebrafish and their eyes are growing throughout adulthood, so that the retina doesn’t reach a finite size with a precisely defined retinoid content at a specific age. Among other things, strain-to-strain variability could impact the extent of growth and therefore also the absolute amount of retinoids in the eye. Therefore, we felt that by using wild type siblings (or age-matched cousins in case of the double-KO) as controls, we could better control for age- and, importantly, strain-related variation and focus on the differences attributable to the genetic manipulation. Rather than comparing absolute amounts of retinoids in the adults between the different lines one could express the values as fold change or percentages of the wild type of each respective line. The results for the adults are presented in Author response image 2 as log2 fold change:</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71473-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) How critical is the role of Cralbpb in the MGC?

In zebrafish, 11cisRE was mostly found in retinosomes in the RPE and was largely absent from MGC (see Babino et al., 2015). Thus, we conclude that MGCs do not store chromophore precursors in such form. However, MGCs express Cralbpb that can bind 11-cis-retinoids (e.g. produced by RGR?) and may deliver it to cone photoreceptors when needed. There is a whole host of novel gene targeting strategies available for zebrafish and mice. It will be fascinating to use this technology to unravel the role of Cralbp in MGCs and to elucidate the putative mechanism how cones benefit from this source for chromophore.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The morphology in Figure 5 (and the consecutive ones) suggests a stronger effect of the rlbp1a-KO in the ventral retina as compared to the dorsal.

This has been reported in many mouse models of retinal degeneration. Whether this phenotype is related to differences in photoreceptor density and distribution and/or environmental factors such as light remains to be investigated.

It is also known, that retinoids can diffuse without the involvement of any retinoid binding proteins. Of course, their transport is greatly facilitated by proteins such as CRALBP, but not entirely dependent on them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) What do the authors speculate that could happen with the Retinomotor circadian movements?

We always treated the controls and mutants with the same settings and adjustments during acquisition and processing of the images. Thus, the reviewers and readers of the paper should be able to appreciate the differences between the samples. However, we acknowledge that the settings might not have been optimal and the signal is relatively faint when we reduce the background signal as can be appreciated on the BandC adjusted Figure 1. We have attached another figure to this letter as an example showing a 5 dpf wild type and double-KO section (see Author response 3).</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71473-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Figure 3: These 5 dpf b-wave signals seem huge, at ~10 mV. For comparison, Bilotta et al., (2001) reported ~50 µV for the b-wave in 8 dpf animals, so your values are 200x higher. If the scale was meant to show &quot;µV&quot; then the signals would be around 5x smaller than theirs. Ideally, the reader should have access to some samples of b-wave records (rather than just measured amplitudes), in order to judge the quality of the recordings, so please provide this. As a minimum, a panel of dark-adapted ERG traces should be presented as a Supplementary Figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion to include dark-adapted ERG traces and have added a Supplementary figure with representative traces of the different mutant lines and noted this on lines 179-180. In our setup, we use the eye cup preparation which yields better signal compared to the original technique published by Bilotta et al., (2001), where measurements were performed in whole larvae. On top of that, we expect, that the precise configuration of the setup can account for some differences. Our measurements are, however, consistent with multiple publications from our lab in recent years.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) Before the authors can state that &quot;We observed no pronounced changes of cone responses in Cralbpb-deficient larval eyes&quot; they need to illustrate rlbp1b KO responses in Figure 4. At present, the double KO plots in panel B2 (&quot;BL&quot;, and &quot;BL+reDA&quot;) appear to show considerably greater attenuation than for the rlbp1a KO plots in panel A2, strongly suggesting an effect of Cralbpb. To make the above statement, it is necessary to present the data.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. However, we do not state that there is no effect, but that the effect is rather mild. Admittedly, we only measured ERG responses of <italic>rlbp1b</italic>-KO larvae in the dark-adapted state (we clarified this by adding “dark-adapted” to the statement above, line 210 of the revised manuscript), since we knew from the retinoid measurements in larvae, that 11cisRAL concentration is not affected by the mutation even after bright light exposure (BL and BL+reDA conditions). Therefore, we directly set out to investigate retinal function in the double mutant. As pointed out in question (3), the 11cisRAL that we measured could be both free or protein-bound. The possibility remains that our measurements of 11cisRAL were masked by RGR-bound retinoids. The latter effect may also explain the more severe phenotype in double-KO despite the apparently normal amounts of 11cisRAL in <italic>rlbp1b</italic>-KO. We added the following paragraph to the discussion lines 306-311 of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Also, RGR in MGCs was implicated in light-dependent chromophore regeneration (Morshedian et al., 2019) and Cralbpb may drive this reaction during bright light conditions. In this line of thought our measurements of 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal in the <italic>rlbp1b</italic>-KO could be masked by RGR-bound retinoids and provide an explanation for the more severe phenotype in in double-KO, despite the apparently normal amounts of 11-<italic>cis</italic>-retinal in <italic>rlbp1b</italic>-KO.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) The authors used CRALBP antiserum to detect both Cralbpa and Cralbpb. Presumably it is difficult to generate specific antibodies if the two proteins are highly identical. Instead ISH with riboprobes specific against each paralog could be used. If the coding regions are too similar,the 3´UTR could be used. The authors have surely considered these options so a comment would be appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>A gene knockout does not necessarily result in mRNA decay and an in situ hybridization with labelled ribo-probes would not be an appropriate method to confirm it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) The option of generating a dKO Cralbp1a/RPE65 would be an interesting next step continuing with this research line to investigate correlation between the RPE65 genes (the are three paralogs) and rlpb1a. This could be interesting to see a key protein not in transporting but to convert all-trans retinal back to 11-cis retinal, widening the spectrum of diseases to be analysed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, this is a fantastic idea and we hope that such a mutant fish line will be soon available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) Discussion mentions (line 495 onwards) studies that use single-cell transcriptomics. The authors are encouraged to embrace this option in the near future. It would be interesting to see the transcriptome also of the KOs with spatial resolution, and using ISS or SCRINSHOT spatial mapping for specific transcripts in intact sections in situ.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, this is a promising approach and we will apply it if we can secure enough funding to continue our project.</p></body></sub-article></article>
