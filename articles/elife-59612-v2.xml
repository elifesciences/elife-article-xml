somatosensory cortex (S1) are key for processing somatosensory inputs and integrating sensory-motor information. How the callosal innervation pattern in S1 is formed during early postnatal development is not clear. We found that the normal termination pattern of these callosal projections is disrupted in cortex specific NMDAR mutants. Rather than projecting selectively to the primary/secondary somatosensory cortex (S1/S2) border, axons were uniformly distributed throughout S1. In addition, the density of this projection increased over postnatal life until the mice died by P30. By combining genetic and antibody-mediated loss of function, we demonstrated that it is GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in target S1 that mediate this guidance phenotype, thus playing a central role in interhemispheric connectivity. Furthermore, we found that this function of NMDA receptors in callosal circuit formation is independent of ion channel function and works with the EPHRIN-B/EPHB system. Thus, NMDAR in target S1 cortex regulates the formation callosal circuits perhaps by modulating EPH-dependent repulsion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axon guidance</kwd><kwd>corpus callosum</kwd><kwd>somatosensory cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH119435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name><name><surname>Huynh</surname><given-names>Trung</given-names></name><name><surname>Noguchi</surname><given-names>Hirofumi</given-names></name><name><surname>Pleasure</surname><given-names>Samuel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH122471</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name><name><surname>Huynh</surname><given-names>Trung</given-names></name><name><surname>Noguchi</surname><given-names>Hirofumi</given-names></name><name><surname>Pleasure</surname><given-names>Samuel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DE023337</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bush</surname><given-names>Jeffrey O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008069</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences Innovation Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name><name><surname>Huynh</surname><given-names>Trung</given-names></name><name><surname>Noguchi</surname><given-names>Hirofumi</given-names></name><name><surname>Pleasure</surname><given-names>Samuel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008069</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UCSF Marcus Program in Precision Medicine Innovation Transformative Integrated Research Initiative</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name><name><surname>Huynh</surname><given-names>Trung</given-names></name><name><surname>Noguchi</surname><given-names>Hirofumi</given-names></name><name><surname>Pleasure</surname><given-names>Samuel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NMDAR receptors act in regulating axon guidance of somatosensory callosal projections in early postnatal life and the expression of EPHB2 receptors in target cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synaptic connections between neurons form circuits that can convey neural information. Abnormalities at any stage of synaptic circuit development can result in neuropsychiatric pathology. The corpus callosum (CC) is the largest interhemispheric commissural circuit in mammals. The connectivity of the CC is essential for coordinated sensory-motor function and for many higher cognitive processes, and CC pathology is implicated in a variety of developmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paul, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Callosal projections originate from pyramidal neurons located in layers II/III, V, and VI and traverse the CC to form synapses with neurons in contralateral homotopic or heterotopic cortical areas. We previously showed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>) that the medial-lateral topography of callosal neurons in the cortex is tightly constrained by the dorsal-ventral (D-V) position of axons within the CC. The axon position within the CC determines its terminal location in the contralateral cortex, with dorsallyÂ located axons projecting medially and ventrallyÂ located axons projecting laterally. As such, the spatial organization of topographically represented information from one hemisphere is preserved as it is projected onto the contralateral hemisphere. However, the molecular determinants regulating proper targeting of commissural projections remain unknown.</p><p>In vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and multiunit recordings show distinct patterns of neural activity in the cortex of newborn mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelsberger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khazipov and Luhmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khazipov et al., 2004</xref>). These activity patterns synchronize spatially and temporally distinct neural networks and may play important roles in wiring cortical maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">AllÃ¨ne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Golshani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). Suppressing endogenous neural activity by overexpressing the inward rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 in callosal neurons delays axon growth and results ultimately in layer-targeting defects in visual cortex and somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">RodrÃ­guez-Tornos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). Sensory deprivation by ablating whiskers or transecting the infraorbital nerve (ION) before P5 blocks sensory activity to the trigeminal nerve and disrupts barrel field formation in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) with secondary disruption of callosal innervation at the S1/S2 border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">SuÃ¡rez et al., 2014</xref>). These studies show that directly reducing neural activity or blocking ascending sensory inputs to callosal neurons affects callosal targeting and map formation. However, the molecular mechanisms governing these events are not clear.</p><p>Neural activity is generally propagated from the axons of presynaptic neurons to the dendrites of postsynaptic neurons by the secretion of neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitter receptors located on the postsynaptic neuron regulate synaptic transmission. The NMDA receptor (NMDAR) is a glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptor located at the synapses that mediates the vast majority of excitatory neurotransmission in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Traynelis et al., 2010</xref>). NMDAR mediated synaptic transmission is important in generating synchronized activity patterns in immature cortex, suggesting that NMDAR Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel may be involved in neural circuit formation.</p><p>In this study we examined the role of NMDAR in the formation of callosal circuitry. Initially, our hypothesis was that NMDARs would be important modulators of callosal circuit formation and that this would be mediated through the ion channel function by regulating neural activity. Indeed, we did find a crucial role for NMDAR in regulating callosal innervation patterns. To our surprise, this was not mediated by the ion channel function of NMDAR. Rather, there was a specific role for the GluN2B-containing NMDAR and loss of NMDAR resulted in changes in EPHB2 expression. EPHB2 is known to be necessary for localization of NMDAR to synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nolt et al., 2011</xref>); however, we found that this requirement was reciprocal â when NMDARs are lost, EPHB2 protein expression during development is lost as well. Most importantly, this is the first demonstration that interactions between NMDAR and EPHRIN-B/EPHB are required for neural circuit formation during development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Postnatal development of the S1 callosal projection</title><p>The development of commissural S1 projections serves as an ideal model to study interhemispheric circuit development. To understand normal development of the S1 callosal projection, we labeled the progenitor cells for layer II/III neurons with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) by in utero electroporation at embryonic day (E) 15.5 and examined callosal development at four critical time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). At postnatal day (P) 5, the callosal axons from S1 had reached the white matter underneath contralateral S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At P8, the callosal axons were diffusely distributed in contralateral S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). By P12, pruning of excess projections led to a refined innervation pattern with a narrow band limited to the S1/S2 border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

To date, seven different subunits have been identified: the GluN1 subunit, four distinct NR2 subunits (AâD), and a pair of GluN3 subunits. The GluN1 subunit is the essential subunit of NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dingledine et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paoletti et al., 2013</xref>). Global GluN1 knockout mice die within a few hours of birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forrest et al., 1994</xref>). To explore the role of NMDAR in callosal development, we generated cortex-specific GluN1 knock-out (KO) mice by crossing a floxed GluN1 allele mice (<italic>Grin1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) with Emx1-Cre recombinase (Cre) mice (<italic>Emx1<sup>cre/+</sup></italic>) thereby selectively deleting GluN1 in excitatory cortical projection neurons. Since GluN1 is essential, GluN1 deletion results in loss of functional NMDARs in cortical excitatory neurons. Immunostaining and western blot at P8 showed that expression of cortical GluN1 was greatly diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) in GluN1 KO mice. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iwasato et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lo et al., 2013</xref>), the organization of thalamocortical barrels in Layer IV of S1 was somewhat disrupted but still apparent in GluN1 KO mice at P8, as revealed by vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGlut2) immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether NMDAR plays a role in the targeting of callosal projections to contralateral cortex, we first examined the callosal innervation pattern at P14, by which point the mature pattern has formed. In littermate controls (<italic>Emx1<sup>cre/+</sup>; Grin1<sup>fl/wt</sup></italic>), a dense area of innervation was formed at the S1/S2 border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and the overall pattern was the same as wild-type controls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. However, in GluN1 KO mice (<italic>Emx1<sup>cre/+</sup>; Grin1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice), the normal restricted pattern of callosal targeting to the S1/S2 border was absent, and callosal axons were uniformly distributed throughout the contralateral somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Quantitative fluorescence intensity analysis showed that the axon distribution pattern in S1 was statistically significantly different between littermate control and GluN1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Additionally, fluorescence density analysis showed that GluN1 KO mice also had more overall callosal axons innervating S1 at P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). This result suggests that the NMDAR plays a role in callosal circuit formation. In the absence of NMDAR, the targeted callosal innervation of the S1/S2 border was lost, and the overall callosal innervation in S1 was significantly increased. GluN1 KO mice were smaller than littermate controls after P5 (data not shown) and rarely survived past P30 so we chose P30 as the last time point to determine if this defect persists. We found that this phenotype worsens after P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1JâL</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>GluN1 KO mice prematurely innervate S1</title><p>To determine when this prominent targeting defect can first be detected, we examined different time points (P0, P3, P5, and P6) corresponding to critical phases of initial CC circuit formation â initial axon extension to ipsilateral CC (P0), axons crossing the midline (P3), axons reaching the white matter underneath contralateral S1 (P5), and axons starting to innervate S1 (P6). GluN1 KO mice showed no differences with littermate controls at P0, P3, and P5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) indicating no difference in the overall rate of axon growth. However, GluN1 KO mice showed earlier and increased innervation of S1 at P6, when callosal axons start entering the contralateral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and E</xref>).

The distribution of anti-GluN1 antibodies was most abundant in deep cortical layers of the ipsilateral injected hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

However, the callosal innervation pattern in S1 does not only include the process of projecting into S1 but also the later refinement of projection. To address the temporal role of NMDAR in callosal development, we injected antibodies either from P4 to P8 or from P8 to P14 and examined the callosal innervation pattern at P14. We found that antibody injections from P4 to P8 had increased callosal axonal growth into S1 similar to that observed in NMDAR genetic deletion mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâD</xref>).

In mutants where either GluN2B or GluN1 are disrupted, there is excess axonal growth throughout S1. Either genetic or antibody-mediated loss of NMDAR specifically in the target hemisphere disrupted this projection. We found that this begins at P6 when axons that should terminate in deep cortical layers of target S1 instead project more superficially. Once this targeting defect begins, it continues to worsen. We believe this phenotype is most consistent with a loss of a repellant activity that normally restricts commissural axonal projections to the S1 cortex at initial stages of this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Once these axons aberrantly penetrate through the deeper cortical layers of S1 in the GluN1 mutants, this phenotype continues to worsen. A systematic role for NMDAR in this process was a surprise and has significant implications for disorders where NMDAR function is lost due to mutations or due to antibody-mediated disruption of NMDAR surface distribution. We predict this would be a potent disruptor of circuit formation during development certainly in this callosal circuit, but likely others as well.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mechanisms for the formation of homotopic callosal projection during development</title><p>InÂ previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>), we showed that the medial-lateral topography of callosal neurons is tightly constrained by the D-V position of their axons within the CC. The axon position within the CC determines the contralateral cortical projection, with more dorsallyÂ located axons projecting medially and ventrallyÂ located axons projecting laterally. The complementary expression of chemotropic guidance cue Semaphorin3A (Sem3A) and its receptor Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) contributes to this axonal order within the CC. The studies of genetic manipulations showed that Sema3A/Nrp1 signaling contributes to the topographic order of axons within the CC but is not involved in the axon position-dependent projection to the contralateral target cortex. Here, in this study, we demonstrated that contralateral/target expression of NMDAR controls the pattern of callosal projections to contralateral target S1. Interestingly, despite the disruption of targeting within S1 in mice with disrupted NMDAR, there is little evidence of ectopic projection to other cortical areas. This indicates that there are still other cues that regulate the generic projection to S1 but that the mechanisms we have uncovered help govern the distribution of these axons within S1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>NMDARs cooperate with EPHRIN-B/EPHB to regulate axon extension into the cortex</title><p>Given the longstanding understanding of important roles for neural activity in the wiring of circuits and the generation of cortical maps, we expected that the function of NMDAR in this process would be due to the critical role of NMDAR in excitatory activity in the developing brain as synapses form. However, our data show that NMDAR ion channel function is not necessary for its role in somatosensory callosal targeting. These data are consistent with the idea that NMDAR protein complexes containing GluN1 and GluN2B are critical for commissural projection. Our findings suggest that without NMDAR containing GluN1 and GluN2B in the target cortex, there is earlier and increased callosal innervation of S1 starting at P6, when callosal axons start entering the contralateral cortex. We believe that this observation indicates that either loss of NMDAR leads to an increase in the attractiveness of S1 cortex or that loss of NMDAR leads to loss of a repellant activity in the cortex that normally limits axon growth into superficial layers of S1, until axons reach the S1/S2 border. This realization led us to consider whether there might be a role for NMDAR complexes in collaborating with already known axon guidance mechanisms.</p><p>EPHRIN-B/EPHB signals are well-known repulsive axon guidance cues. Because EPHB2 is necessary for localization of NMDAR to postsynaptic terminals, we wondered if this requirement was reciprocal and found indeed that it is â when NMDARs are lost, membrane based EPHB2 protein expression in target neurons is lost as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref>). This result suggests that NMDAR reciprocally regulates the localization of EPHB2. In addition, the NMDAR interaction with EPHB2 is driven by the stimulation of EPHB2 by clustered EPHRIN-B1 expressed in presynaptic axon terminals, indicating that the interaction may regulate axon guidance and termination. When we deleted EPHRIN-B1 only in projecting callosal axons, this also led to excess ingrowth into the S1 cortex visible from P6Â toÂ P8. That this phenotype is less severe than the NMDAR phenotype is most likely due to redundancy with other EPHRIN-B ligands also expressed in projecting axons. To globally disrupt EPHB-EPHRIN-B interactions we injected EPHRIN-B1-Fc fragments and found that these also disrupted the somatosensory callosal targeting as efficiently as anti-NMDAR antibodies; furthermore, these two treatments were neither additive nor synergistic, implying they act through a common pathway. Further studies will examine whether this phenotype is due to loss of repulsive activity of EPHRIN-B/EPHB signals, and whether it is through forward EPHB or reverse EPHRIN-B signaling or both.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The refinement of callosal innervation pattern</title><p>The production of transient, exuberant axons, and axonal branches is a general phenomenon in development across species and systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De LeÃ³n Reyes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fenlon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Innocenti, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Innocenti and Price, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luo and O'Leary, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ribeiro Gomes et al., 2020</xref>).

The axon branches whose activity is not correlated with that of their neighbors are selectively eliminated. However, the selective elimination can be abolished by blocking the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx of NMDAR by its antagonist MK-801. When we blocked the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx of NMDAR by MK-801 or D-APV, even though the overall callosal innervation pattern of somatosensory cortex was not affected, there were some subtle, local laminar-specific innervation differences at the S1/S2 border, suggesting that the refinement of axon arborization may rely on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx-mediated activity changes through NMDAR.</p><p>Regarding previous roles of EPHRIN-B/EPHB signaling in pruning, this pathway was previously shown to be involved in infrapyramidal bundle pruning in dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu and Henkemeyer, 2009</xref>) and it is known that activation of EPHB by EPHRIN-B potentiates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx of NMDA receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Takasu et al., 2002</xref>). These lines of evidence suggest that NMDAR and EPHRIN-B/EPHB signaling may cooperate in the refinement of the callosal innervation pattern and perhaps in other circuits. Further studies will examine how and whether NMDAR regulates EPHRIN-B/EPHB signaling directly and the detailed molecular mechanism underlying their collaboration to regulate callosal innervation patterns in the primary somatosensory cortex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><p>All animal protocols were in accordance with the regulations of the National Institute of Health and approved by the University of California San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

See the following for the criteria of selecting effective dose of MK-801. Based on literature, the single dose of MK-801 for acute i.p. administration is up to 1â10 mg/kg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foster et al., 1988</xref>); the daily dose of MK-801 for chronic i.p. administration is around 0.3â0.6 mg/kg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nilsson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Uttl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zuo et al., 2006</xref>). To optimize the dose for chronic administration, MK-801 was given to three groupsÂ of pups (each group had four pups with mixed genders) from P4 to P9 with the doses of 1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg, respectively. Saline was given to four pups of the same litter as control. We measured body weights of all pups every day before i.p. administration. The pups in saline group always had abundant milk in their stomachs and gained weight rapidly. The pups with the dose of 1 mg/kg had milk in their stomachs and gained weight, but very slowly. Some even lost weights. All MK-801-treated pups developed abnormal behavior-opisthotonic posturing for heads and four limbs, similar to the abnormal postures in children with anti-NMDAR encephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Florance et al., 2009</xref>). The doses of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg were too close to lethal dose and the pups lost weight and died within 2â3 days. Thus, we chose 1 mg/kg for our experiment. The weight loss and abnormal behavior had been reported in neonatal mice after MK-801 administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Facchinetti et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Griesbach and Amsel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>D(-)â2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-APV) intraventricular injection</title><p>Because D-APV poorly penetrates the bloodâbrain barrier (BBB) when administered systemically, we injected it directly into the lateral ventricle of targeted cortex. EGFP positive pups were given D-APV (5 Î¼g/Î¼l, Millipore-sigma, 165304â5 MG) twice-daily at an injection volume of 0.8â1 Î¼l/injection. See sectionÂ Intraventricular injection for injection details. See the following for the criteria of selecting effective dose of D-APV. Based on literature, one-time infusion of 5 Î¼g D-APV into the basolateral amygdala of adult rat (~250 g) caused memory deficit persistent for at least 4Â weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Milton et al., 2008</xref>). Blocking NMDARs by intracerebral infusion of 0.5 Î¼l of 500 Î¼M D-APV into P7 mouse pup reduced somatic calcium transients in pyramidal cells evoked by lateral olfactory tract stimulation, and caused memory deficits both in short-term (3 hr) and long-term (24 hr) odor preference memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mukherjee and Yuan, 2016</xref>). 0.5 Î¼l of 500 Î¼M D-APV is equal to 0.05 Î¼g D-APV (molecular weight of D-APV: 197.13). To optimize the dose for chronic administration, intraventricular D-APV injection was given to two groups of pups (each group had four pups with mixed genders) from P4 (~4 g) to P9 (~8 g) with the concentrations of 5 Î¼g/Î¼l andÂ 10 Î¼g/Î¼l twice-daily (0.8â1 Î¼l/injection), respectively. Saline was given to four pups of the same litter as control. The body weight of all pups was measured before intraventricular injection. There were no body weight differences between saline-treated and D-APV-treated mice. However, D-APV-treated pups in both 5 Î¼g/Î¼l-treated andÂ 10 Î¼g/Î¼l-treated groups developed unilateral muscle contractions in limbs on the opposite side of the injection within 10 min after injection, similar to the abnormal movements seen in MK-801-treated mice but only restricting in one side of body. No pups died during the 6 days of injections. As 5 Î¼g/Î¼l-treated and 10 Î¼g/Î¼l-treated had no dose-dependent effect on the abnormal behavior and based on dosage of D-APV used in literature, we chose 5 Î¼g/Î¼l D-APV treatment for our experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Slice preparation and imaging</title><p>Mice were perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pHÂ 7.4.

Each image was made up by the compression of three slices in 4 Î¼m Z-stack. For each brain, only one section was chosen for data quantification. The callosal axon density (fluorescence density) in S1 was quantitatively analyzed by ImageJ software. First, each picture was converted to an 8-bit image, and then Brightness/Contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3A</xref>) and Threshold Ranges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3B</xref>) were set. Threshold Range was set to eliminate background fluorescence from affecting fluorescent density. Second, the cortical S1 region in the target side was identified according to Dapi staining as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>) and a box was drawn to encompass only the S1 (box I in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3B</xref>). Third, fluorescence density was quantified in the S1 by counting the number of pixels within the threshold range and dividing by total number of pixels in the area. This is done by selecting âArea Fractionâ and âLimit to Thresholdâ in ImageJ âÂ Analyze â Set Measurement. Finally, the axon density in S1 was normalized by the average fluorescence density of midline for each image (box II in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3B</xref>). The average fluorescence density of midline was calculated by measuring the fluorescence density of six non-overlapping points around the midline and averaging the values. A fixed sized box was used for all measurements of midline fluorescence density. Since a fixed sized box was used (total number of pixels is fixed for all), âAreaâ instead of âArea Fractionâ was used for analysis. Results were analyzed by using two-tailed t-test in Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software). Please note that control groups and experimental groups followed exactly the same settings of measurements.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Prof. Roger Nicoll and Jillian Iafrati for providing <italic>Grin2a<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Grin2b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice.

demonstrating that the normal termination pattern of callosal projections are disrupted in cortex-specific NMDAR mutants. Rather than projecting selectively to the primary/secondary somatosensory cortex (S1/S2) border, axons are uniformly distributed throughout S1, with this pattern intensifying until a premature death. You also suggest that GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors mediate this phenotype during callosal innervation of somatosensory cortex and is independent of ion channel function. Finally, you propose that NMDAR functions with the ephrinB/EphB system of guidance molecules.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;NMDA receptors control cortical axonal projections via EPHRIN-B/EPHB signaling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Your study points to a novel mechanism for the development of callosal projections from primary somatosensory cortex (S1), namely, that NR2B-containing NMDA receptors are required to mediate the normal termination pattern of callosal projections. You also show that NR2B-containing NMDAR during callosal innervation of somatosensory cortex is independent of ion channel function in these receptors. An additional, novel slant is your proposal that NMDARs act as accessory axon guidance molecules via Eph/ephrin repulsion. You pose a model where these well-studied axon guidance molecules interact directly with the NMDAR, to coordinate the formation of axonal projections, again, indicating non-ionotrophic functions of the NMDAR.</p><p>From the appended reviews, you will see that the reviewers thought that the claims in the manuscript for the NR2B-containing NMDAR function during callosal innervation are well supported. However, all three reviewers questioned the link between the ephrin/Eph system and NMDAR function, and considered the analyses related to this link preliminary. They thought that this aspect should be strengthened, either through additional experiments (in vitro tests of repellent activity) or by toning down the discussion and potentially removing the link to ephrinB/EphB signaling from the title and Abstract. While it may not be possible to do the additional suggested experiments since lab shutdown and restarting, the revisions on data presentation and textually in the discussion are feasible and could be done in the coming months.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>For the glutamate receptor data:</p><p>1) In the GluN2A and GluN2B floxed mice: at the ages studied, it is unclear how much GluN2A is expressed.</p><p>2) With MK801 and APV application to block the NMDAR, how effective are these drugs at blocking the NMDAR and what is the area of effect of the drugs? Are other activity-dependent events blocked in these animals (e.g., LGN lamination, whisker barrelette formation in PrV)?</p><p>The drugs blocking NMDAR activity lack sufficient controls for the conclusions stated in the manuscript: Loss of the innervation pattern of innervation is variable and the S1/S2 column indicates a possible dependency on activity, leading to other possible interpretations. Changes in the overall cortical activity may affect the stabilization of callosal projections, and therefore acute pharmacological blocking of NMDAR may not mimic the KO or antibody treatments. Early and permanent loss of NMDAR activity can trigger changes in the intrinsic excitability of the neurons that could override the phenotypes of increased innervation. This could be discussed textually</p><p>For the Eph/ephrin data:</p><p>3) You argue EphB2 protein levels are reduced in the cortex of conditional NR1 floxed mice and disruption of ephrin-B/EphB signaling in this system leads to similar termination defects as deleting NR2B. This is an apt argument but the reviewers felt that this was only a first step in the required analyses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>4) Figure 8. By Western blot analysis, the reduction seems 30% compared to controls. This is not dramatic and instead suggests other mechanisms at work, since most heterozygous mutants (with target protein reductions at 50% or more) do not show phenotypes.</p><p>5) Partial reduction of EphB2 protein raises the possibility that further reductions of EphB2 signaling may enhance the phenotype. Instead, blocking NMDAR plus EphB2 functions (by injecting NR1Ab and ephrin-B1-Fc) did not enhance the phenotype of the single manipulations. One would expect additive effects.</p><p>6) Figure 8, only the timepoint P6 is shown. Rev 5 also points out that between P6 and P10 there is more variability in contralateral innervation correlating with the anterior-posterior axis. You should show ephrin B electroporations analyzed at P14-P30, or remove and/or tone down the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>7) EphB-ephrin-B signaling and NMDAR function likely has to do with EphB-ephrin-B repulsive cues or that EphBs interact and modulate NMDAR function, and regulate excitatory synapse development in forebrain. It seems at least equally likely that in the latter case, EphB modulation of NMDAR may mediate the events described in this manuscript, on synapse development and maintenance, not necessarily on repulsion/guidance.</p><p>8) EphB-NMDAR interaction results in phosphorylation of GluN2B, increased synaptic localization of the NMDAR, and increased NMDAR dependent Ca influx. Loss of EphB-ephrin-B signaling might cause a reduction in NMDAR Ca influx, but not a complete block of ionotropic signaling. To demonstrate that the findings in Figures 7 and 8 are linked, the authors should inject NMDAR blockers (after conducting the control experiments in point 2), in the ephrin-B1 knockout mice.

More high-resolution analysis of the impact of your manipulations on axonal branching would address the other reviewers' questions regarding whether the changes see are due defects in branching and/or refinement. This aspect as in the in vitro experiments require additional experiments which could understandably not be possible at this time.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;NMDA receptors control development of somatosensory callosal axonal projections&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Your revision highlights a novel mechanism for the development of callosal projections from primary somatosensory cortex (S1), through demonstrating that the normal termination pattern of callosal projections are disrupted in cortex-specific NMDAR mutants. Rather than projecting selectively to the primary/secondary somatosensory cortex (S1/S2) border, axons are uniformly distributed throughout S1, with this pattern intensifying until a premature death. You also suggest that GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors mediate this phenotype during callosal innervation of somatosensory cortex and is independent of ion channel function. Finally, you propose that NMDAR functions with the ephrinB/EphB system of guidance molecules.</p><p>Due to constraints put in place by COVID, in many cases you have had to reduce the strength of your claims rather than conduct new experiments, and you have satisfactorily downplayed the link between the ephrin/Eph system and NMDAR function. While you were not able to directly show that the NMDAR blockers used were effective at blocking NMDAR channel function, the demonstration of a potential link between activity-independent and activity-dependent signaling systems to impact axon development is considered exciting and novel.</p><p>The previous review stated that you could look to performing follow-up work in the future on: (a). in vitro experiments demonstrating repellent activity of EphB downstream of NMDAR to fortify the link between EphB and NMDAR expression levels. (b). experiments to show the effects of inhibiting Eph/ephrin signaling at later time points, especially on examining refinement and pruning of axons. We hope you will be able to pursue these interesting studies when conditions improve.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>The rebuttal letter was difficult to follow.

Are other activity-dependent events blocked in these animals (e.g., LGN lamination, whisker barrelette formation in PrV)?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with these points raised by the reviewer. These were the exactly concerns we had when we began the experiments. We consulted local electrophysiology labs who suggested we use (+)-MK-801 hydrogen maleate and D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-APV) which are most the effective isoforms for in vivo studies. We also carefully examined the previous literature to determine the dosage range for chronic treatment studies and tested on our own to find the optimal dosage (see the details in Materials and methods). Based on the literature, weight loss and abnormal behavior have been reported in neonatal mice after MK-801 administration (Facchinetti et al., 1993; Griesbach and Amsel, 1998; Wu et al., 2005) which can be used as a sign of effective MK-801 administration. We also found weight loss and abnormal behaviors after systemic i.p. MK-801 administration in mouse pups. For local D-APV injection, we did not see weight loss for pups but did see abnormal behaviors after injection.</p><p>We searched the original literature to address the question âAre other activity-dependent events blocked in these animals (e.g., LGN lamination, whisker barrelette formation in PrV)?â For the LGN, we calculated that the dose used for ferret pups was 0.4mg/kg MK-801 daily. Our dose was 1mg/kg MK-801 daily which is significantly higher than the published dose. It further suggested our dose is effective in mouse pups. So we add this sentence of âPrevious studies showed that blocking NMDAR with a daily dose of 0.4mg/kg MK-801 in ferret pups between P14 and P21 disrupted axonal pattern formation by retinal afferents in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) (Hahm et al., 1999)â in the text when mentioned about âNMDAR regulates callosal circuit development independent of NMDAR channel activityâ. For PrV (Mitrovic et al., 1996), they used silicone carriers to locally apply MK-801 and D-APV, it was not clear how much MK-801 and APPV were delivered to the targeted tissue.</p><p>Of course, the most direct way to test whether our MK-801 or D-APV in vivo administration blocked or reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx of NMDAR, is doing calcium imaging or electrical recording on brain slides after acute and chronic MK-801 or D-APV administration. However, during the pandemic of COVID-19, it is difficult to extend our studies to perform this experiment currently, however, we believe the literature is fairly clear that our treatments are surely affecting NMDAR function profoundly. We do plan to pursue experiments like this in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The drugs blocking NMDAR activity lack sufficient controls for the conclusions stated in the manuscript: Loss of the innervation pattern of innervation is variable and the S1/S2 column indicates a possible dependency on activity, leading to other possible interpretations. Changes in the overall cortical activity may affect the stabilization of callosal projections, and therefore acute pharmacological blocking of NMDAR may not mimic the KO or antibody treatments. Early and permanent loss of NMDAR activity can trigger changes in the intrinsic excitability of the neurons that could override the phenotypes of increased innervation. This could be discussed textually</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and appreciate the valuable advice. In the newly edited manuscript, we disused these possibilities in our Discussion âPrevious studies have observed the role of NMDAR in axon elimination (Colonnese and Constantine-Paton, 2006; Henson et al., 2017; Personius et al., 2016; Rabacchi et al., 1992; Rajan et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2013). in vivo time-lapse images of retinal axons from albino <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpoles show that correlated neural activity influences axon branch dynamics of retinal axons in the optic tectum (Ruthazer et al., 2003). The axon branches whose activity is not correlated with that of their neighbors are selectively eliminated. However, the selective elimination can be abolished by blocking the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx of NMDAR by its antagonist MK-801. When we blocked the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx of NMDAR by MK-801 or D-APV, even though the overall callosal innervation pattern of somatosensory cortex was not affected, there were some subtle, local laminar-specific innervation differences at the S1/S2 border, suggesting that the refinement of axon arborization may rely on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx-mediated activity changes through NMDARâ when mentioned about âThe refinement of callosal innervation patternâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the Eph/ephrin data:</p><p>3) You argue EphB2 protein levels are reduced in the cortex of conditional NR1 floxed mice and disruption of ephrin-B/EphB signaling in this system leads to similar termination defects as deleting NR2B. This is an apt argument but the reviewers felt that this was only a first step in the required analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have toned down the linkage between NMDAR and EPHRINB/EPHB in the Abstract, the Results and the Discussion. We also removed the linkage between NMDAR and EPHRINB/EPHB in the title. We will examine how and whether NMDAR regulates EPHRIN-B/EPHB signaling directly and the detailed molecular mechanism underlying their collaboration to regulate callosal innervation patterns in the primary somatosensory cortex in a following project.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>4) Figure 8. By Western blot analysis, the reduction seems 30% compared to controls. This is not dramatic and instead suggests other mechanisms at work, since most heterozygous mutants (with target protein reductions at 50% or more) do not show phenotypes.</p><p>5) Partial reduction of EphB2 protein raises the possibility that further reductions of EphB2 signaling may enhance the phenotype. Instead, blocking NMDAR plus EphB2 functions (by injecting NR1Ab and ephrin-B1-Fc) did not enhance the phenotype of the single manipulations. One would expect additive effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Questions 4 and 5 are interlinked, so we are addressing them together. We understand the reviewerâs concern that a 30% reduction of EPHB2 in S1 of <italic>Emx1<sup>cre/+</sup></italic>; <italic>Grin1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice by western blot was not dramatic. However, implicit in our studies was our assumption that the loss of EPHB2 would be selective for neurons that lost NMDAR and that this was a subset of cortical neurons. Also, we assumed that EPHB2 expressed in other compartments than the PSD might not be decreased. Thus, we believe that a 30% decrease is actually quite dramatic if the loss is limited to the PSD. We appreciate the reviewer asking us to more directly address this! <italic>Emx1<sup>cre/+</sup></italic>; <italic>Grin1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice only knocked out GluN1 in <italic>Emx1<sup>cre/+</sup></italic> positive cells which were only a subpopulation cells in the cortex (excitatory neurons with Cre penetrance). We found that there are still many cells expressiong GluN1 in <italic>Emx1<sup>cre/+</sup></italic> unaffected cell populations, such as interneurons (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). Also, to more specifically examine the expression of EPHB2 on <italic>Emx1<sup>cre/+</sup></italic>; <italic>Grin1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> positive cells, we crossed <italic>Emx1<sup>cre/+</sup></italic>; <italic>Grin1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice with Cre reporter mice-<italic>Rosa26&lt;fs-tdTomato<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice to generate <italic>Emx1<sup>cre/+</sup></italic>; <italic>Grin1<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Rosa26&lt;fs-tdTomato<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>mice. We found the expression of EPHB2 was completely gone from somatic post-synaptic densities on <italic>Emx1<sup>cre/+</sup></italic>; <italic>Grin1<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Rosa26&lt;fs-tdTomato<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>positive cells. Thus, we believe that a loss of 30% of total EPHB2 protein in the cortex is actually quite dramatic. Importantly, this canât be compared to EPHB2+/- mice where presumably any lost protein would be distributed throughout all domains and in all cells where the protein is expressed.</p><p>We also add the following paragraph into the newly edited text âAs discussed above, in <italic>Emx1<sup>cre/+</sup></italic>; <italic>Grin1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, GluN1 was selectively deleted in excitatory neurons. Based on previous studies, the expression of GluN1 in interneurons (Korotkova et al., 2010), oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (Karadottir et al., 2005) in the cortex should not be affected in <italic>Emx1<sup>cre/+</sup></italic>; <italic>Grin1<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>mice. To examine the expression of EPHB2 specifically in GluN1 KO cells, we crossed <italic>Emx1<sup>cre/+</sup></italic>; <italic>Grin1<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>mice with Cre-reporter mice â <italic>Rosa26&lt;fs-tdTomato<sup>fl/fl</sup> </italic>mice that exhibit tdTomato expression after Cre-mediated recombination. Supporting our hypothesis that loss of GluN1 leads to loss of EPHB2, the punctate staining of EPHB2 on cell membranes was completely lost in red (recombined) cells of <italic>Emx1<sup>cre/+</sup></italic>; <italic>Grin1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>Rosa26&lt;fs-tdTomato<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> brain sections but not red cells of <italic>Emx1<sup>cre/+</sup></italic>; <italic>Grin1<sup>wt/wt</sup>;Rosa26&lt;fs-tdTomato<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> brain sections (Figure 8âfigure supplement 2). Taken together, we demonstrated that the loss of NMDAR caused the loss of EPHB2 selectively on cells that lack GluN1 after excision, thus explaining the 30% reduction in EPHB2 protein expression. Given the known physical association between NMDAR and EPHB2, these data suggest reciprocity in this stabilizing interaction and dendritic localizationâ when mentioned about âEPHB2 protein expression is decreased in GluN1 KO miceâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 8, only the timepoint P6 is shown. Rev 5 also points out that between P6 and P10 there is more variability in contralateral innervation correlating with the anterior-posterior axis.

It seems at least equally likely that in the latter case, EphB modulation of NMDAR may mediate the events described in this manuscript, on synapse development and maintenance, not necessarily on repulsion/guidance.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and thank the reviewer for these suggestions. We have discussed these alternative possibilities in the newly edited manuscript. We have added the following paragraph into our Discussion âRegarding previous roles of EPHRIN-B/EPHB signaling in pruning, this pathway was previous shown to be involved in infrapyramidal bundle pruning in dentate gyrus (Xu and Henkemeyer, 2009) and it is know that activation of EPHB by EPHRIN-B potentiates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx of NMDA receptor (Takasu et al., 2002). These lines of evidence suggest that NMDAR and EPHRIN-B/EPHB signaling may cooperate in the refinement of the callosal innervation pattern and perhaps in other circuits. Further studies will examine how and whether NMDAR regulates EPHRIN-B/EPHB signaling directly and the detailed molecular mechanism underlying their collaboration to regulate callosal innervation patterns in the primary somatosensory cortexâ when discussed âthe refinement of callosal innervation patternâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) EphB-NMDAR interaction results in phosphorylation of GluN2B, increased synaptic localization of the NMDAR, and increased NMDAR dependent Ca influx. Loss of EphB-ephrin-B signaling might cause a reduction in NMDAR Ca influx, but not a complete block of ionotropic signaling. To demonstrate that the findings in Figures 7 and 8 are linked, the authors should inject NMDAR blockers (after conducting the control experiments in point 2), in the ephrin-B1 knockout mice. The anti-NMDAR antibodies simply remove the receptor from the synapse. This does not address whether the effects are independent of the ionotropic modulation of the channel and should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and think this is a reasonable point. Our toned down discussion of the interaction hopefully will address this comment.
