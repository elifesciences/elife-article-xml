Disruptions in these pathways can cause severe congenital cardiac malformations or functional defects. To better understand these pathways and how they regulate cardiac development we used tomo-seq, combining high-throughput RNA-sequencing with tissue-sectioning, to establish a genome-wide expression dataset with high spatial resolution for the developing zebrafish heart. Analysis of the dataset revealed over 1100 genes differentially expressed in sub-compartments. Pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial region induce heart contractions, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying their development. Using our transcriptome map, we identified spatially restricted Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity in pacemaker cells, which was controlled by Islet-1 activity. Moreover, Wnt/β-catenin signaling controls heart rate by regulating pacemaker cellular response to parasympathetic stimuli. Thus, this high-resolution transcriptome map incorporating all cell types in the embryonic heart can expose spatially restricted molecular pathways critical for specific cardiac functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heart</kwd><kwd>pacemaker</kwd><kwd>Islet-1</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>wnt</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>022.001.003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burkhard</surname><given-names>Silja Barbara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CVON - Netherlands Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CVON-CONCORgenes</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bakkers</surname><given-names>Jeroen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001826</institution-id><institution>ZonMw</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91212086</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bakkers</surname><given-names>Jeroen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001826</institution-id><institution>ZonMw</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>9003037607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bakkers</surname><given-names>Jeroen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A genome wide transcriptome dataset of the embryonic zebrafish heart with high spatial resolution was established and used to identify a novel mechanism regulating pacemaker function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The vertebrate heart exerts regular contractions to circulate nutrients and oxygen. Cardiomyocyte contraction is caused by an action potential generated by cardiac pacemaker cells: spontaneous, rhythmic membrane depolarization of the pacemaker cells enables them to trigger the neighboring working myocardium to contract. Heart disease, congenital malformations, aging, or somatic gene defects may cause pacemaker tissue dysfunction, resulting in severely disabling and potentially lethal bradycardia (inappropriately low heart rates) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dobrzynski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wolf and Berul, 2006</xref>). These conditions can be treated by implantation of an electronic pacemaker. However, this is not ideal as electronic pacemakers can cause cardiac complications such as infections, recurring need for surgery to replace malfunctioning parts and the lack of autonomic responsiveness. Furthermore, they are not ideal for pediatric patients due to the continuous need to adapt the implanted device to the growing heart. Biological pacemakers, generated in- or ex vivo are thus being explored as alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rosen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Protze et al., 2017</xref>). This, however, requires exquisite knowledge of the regulatory network driving pacemaker cell differentiation and function.</p><p>Although pacemaker cells are situated within, and coupled to, the surrounding cardiomyocytes, they retain a primitive myocardial identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakker et al., 2010</xref>). This is established during cardiac development, when a myocardial progenitor cell population (Shox2<sup>+</sup>/Tbx18<sup>+</sup>/Isl1<sup>+</sup>/Nkx2.5<sup>-</sup>) becomes spatially restricted to the region connecting the sinus venosus to the atria (sinoatrial region). These progenitor cells differentiate into Isl1<sup>+</sup>/Hcn4<sup>+</sup> pacemaker cells, strictly separated from the Nkx2.5<sup>+</sup> working cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mommersteeg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wiese et al., 2009</xref>). The pacemaker cells are prevented from differentiating into working myocardium by Shox2, which inhibits Nkx2.5 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Espinoza-Lewis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Isl1 plays a conserved role in pacemaker cells since zebrafish and mouse embryos lacking Isl1 have severe bradycardia progressing to complete loss of pacemaker function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Pater et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tessadori et al., 2012</xref>). The etiology of the pacemaker phenotype is unclear and mechanisms acting downstream of Isl1 to control heart rate remain to be determined.</p><p>The cardiac pacemaker generates rhythmic action potentials through the combined and oscillating activity of ion channels on the surface membrane and calcium channels on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lakatta et al., 2010</xref>). Heart rate can vary greatly in response to physiological demand, which is regulated by the autonomic nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gordan et al., 2015</xref>). In the adult zebrafish heart, the receptors enabling autonomic regulation are expressed in the Isl1<sup>+</sup> pacemaker cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stoyek et al., 2016</xref>). Developing biological pacemakers that can be controlled by the autonomous nervous system will be a significant improvement from electronic pacemakers used today. Therefore, it is important to understand how autonomous control is established in pacemaker cells, of which there is very little knowledge.</p><p>Identifying novel molecular pathways that regulate the development and specialized functions of individual organs or tissues in vivo would be greatly facilitated by genome-wide transcriptome datasets with detailed spatial resolution during development. Several techniques have recently been developed that can resolve the expression of many genes without disruption of tissue organization. Fluorescent in situ sequencing (FISSEQ) is an in-situ sequencing technique based on sequencing on a solid substrate using fluorescent-tagged random hexamers. When combined with confocal imaging, FISSEQ can be applied to tissue sections or whole embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Tomo</italic>-seq combines standard RNA-sequencing using barcoded primers with histological tissue dissection and has been used to establish genome-wide transcriptome datasets with high spatial resolution of the whole zebrafish embryo and the injured adult zebrafish heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Junker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kruse et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). The advantages of the FISSEQ and <italic>tomo</italic>-seq techniques compared to other mRNA-seq related techniques are that: (1) there is no need for prior anatomical annotation of the tissue, (2) it does not rely on tissue dissociation and cell sorting that can influence gene expression, (3) spatial information of the transcripts within the tissue is maintained.</p><p>Here, we used one of these techniques, <italic>tomo</italic>-seq, to obtain the first genome-wide transcriptome map with high spatial resolution of the developing zebrafish heart. Using <italic>tomo</italic>-seq data, we identified sub-compartment specific gene expression signatures for the ventricle, atrium, AV canal, and the sinoatrial region, where pacemaker cells reside. We found that several members of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway were differentially expressed in the sinoatrial region, resulting in active Wnt/β-catenin signaling in developing pacemaker cells. Functional analysis demonstrated that Wnt/β-catenin signaling acts downstream of Isl1 to establish parasympathetic control of heart rate. Together these results reveal a genetic pathway regulating autonomic control of pacemaker activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A genome-wide transcriptome dataset with high spatial resolution of the developing zebrafish heart</title><p>At 2 days post-fertilization (2 dpf), the zebrafish heart has developed into a looped structure with a recognizable atrium and ventricle that is able to sustain blood circulation in the larvae. At this stage, functional Isl<sup>+</sup> pacemaker cells are located in the sinoatrial region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrenberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tessadori et al., 2012</xref>). To obtain a transcriptome map of the developing heart at that stage with spatial resolution, we applied the <italic>tomo</italic>-seq method on dissected hearts from 2-day-old zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We generated independent datasets from three wild-type hearts. We chose the most robust dataset (heart#1; for details see Materials and methods section) for further analysis and validation. In short, the isolated cryo-preserved hearts were sectioned into forty 10 µm sections along the anterior-posterior axis. Total RNA was isolated from each section, barcoded and processed for mRNA-sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hashimshony et al., 2016</xref>). We obtained a gene expression dataset with expression information for ~13,000 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). To assess global transcriptome patterns in the dataset, we implemented Pearson’s correlation analysis, a pairwise measurement of linear correlation per section across the total transcriptome. Several blocks of continuous sections with high positive correlation of overall gene expression were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This indicates that specific molecular profiles based on explicit gene expression patterns subdivide the embryonic heart at this stage. In order to identify such gene clusters and elucidate underlying gene expression patterns, we performed a hierarchical clustering analysis. Robustly expressed genes (z-score &gt;1.2, in three or more consecutive sections) were clustered according to their expression peak within the dataset. The cluster plot confirmed the presence of four large gene clusters with region-specific expression, which likely corresponded to the outflow tract, ventricle, AV canal and atrium based on the genes present within these clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31515.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Tomo</italic>-seq on isolated embryonic hearts reveals distinct clusters of gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hearts were isolated from 2-day-old embryos and 10 μm sections were made along the anterior-posterior axis, from outflow to inflow pole.

The total number of reads for a gene of interest was plotted against the consecutive section numbers and compared to its localized expression detected by whole mount in situ hybridization. Expression of <italic>myosin light chain 7</italic> (<italic>myl7</italic>) defining the boundaries of the myocardial tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicated that all sections with exception of the first ten, were derived from myocardial tissue. The first 10 sections most likely contained the non-myocardial arterial pole. <italic>Natriuretic peptide a</italic> (<italic>nppa</italic>) expression is restricted to the working myocardium of the ventricle and atrium and was absent from the non-working myocardium of the outflow tract, AV canal and SA region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Together with the ventricle-specific expression of <italic>ventricle myosin heavy chain</italic> (<italic>vmhc</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and atrial-specific <italic>myosin heavy chain 6</italic> (<italic>myh6</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) we concluded that the ventricle and the atrium were well separated in the <italic>tomo</italic>-seq data. To address whether genes that are expressed in the endocardial cushions, which give rise to the cardiac valves located in the outflow tract and in the AV canal, are present in the <italic>tomo</italic>-seq data, we analyzed the expression of <italic>hyaluronan synthase 2</italic> (<italic>has2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Indeed, <italic>has2</italic> was detected in the sections assigned to the outflow tract and the AV canal. The non-working myocardium of the AV canal can be distinguished by the expression of <italic>bone morphogenetic protein 4</italic> (<italic>bmp4</italic>) and <italic>T-box protein 2b</italic> (<italic>tbx2b</italic>). Both genes showed a peak expression around section 25, indicating the position of the AV myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). Importantly, <italic>bmp4</italic> is also expressed in the SA region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

We superimposed the expression data of the known marker genes to identify the position of the cardiac sub-compartments in the <italic>tomo</italic>-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We directly compared the superimposed expression data with the previously identified gene clusters and concluded that positions of cardiac sub-compartments correlated well with the identified gene clusters. The SA region was only identified by the marker gene expression and not by the gene cluster analysis, most likely due to its small size in combination with the threshold settings of the gene cluster analysis.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31515.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Transcriptome map of the embryonic heart with high spatial resolution.</title><p>(<bold>A–E</bold>) <italic>Tomo</italic>-seq expression traces and corresponding in situ hybridization for (<bold>A</bold>) <italic>myl7</italic> (whole myocardium), (<bold>C</bold>) <italic>vmhc</italic> (ventricular myocardium), (<bold>D</bold>) <italic>myh6</italic> (atrial myocardium), (<bold>E</bold>) <italic>has2</italic> (endocardial cushions), (<bold>F</bold>) <italic>bmp4</italic> (AVC myocardium, orange arrow; IFT myocardium, purple arrow) and (<bold>G</bold>) <italic>tbx2b</italic> (OFT myocardium, yellow arrow, AVC myocardium, orange arrow; IFT myocardium, purple arrow).

The boundaries of the sub-compartments were set based on the gene cluster analysis and the mRNA-seq reads for known marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). All genes were ranked according to the specificity of their expression level in the region of interest when compared with the rest of the dataset. With this approach, we identified a total of 1143 genes for which their expression was upregulated in one of the selected cardiac sub-compartments (ventricle, atrium, AV canal and sinoatrial region) (log2 FC &gt;2 and p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

As mentioned above, several genes that encode for Wnt signaling pathway components were enriched in the sinoatrial region. Wnt ligands bind to Frizzled (Fzd) receptors to activate intracellular β-catenin signaling, which plays multiple roles during cardiac development (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gessert and Kühl, 2010</xref>]). Depending on the developmental stage, Wnt/β-catenin signaling has either positive or negative effects on cardiomyocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tzahor, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gessert and Kühl, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ueno et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the atrioventricular (AV) canal induces the formation of endocardial cushions, giving rise to the AV valves, and the electrophysiological properties of the AV canal myocardium by slowing down electrical conductivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hurlstone et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Verhoeven et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gillers et al., 2015</xref>). Even though Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been studied extensively in the heart, a role in pacemaker development has not been reported.</p><p>Expression of the Wnt receptor <italic>fzd9b</italic> was detected in sections 33–39 and whole mount in situ hybridization confirmed its expression in the sinoatrial region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

From these results, we hypothesized that Wnt signaling is locally activated in the sinoatrial region. To test this further, we analyzed a Wnt-reporter line containing a transgene with 7 repeats of a TCF-binding site upstream of mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moro et al., 2012</xref>). To identify the Isl1<sup>+</sup> pacemaker cells, we made use of a transgenic <italic>tg(Isl1:GFF;UAS:GFP)</italic> line, further referred to as Isl1:GFP. Corroborating the hypothesis that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is activated in the sinoatrial junction, we observed cells that co-expressed both the <italic>TCF:mCherry</italic> reporter as well as the Isl1:GFP reporter in the sinoatrial region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D’</xref>). In addition, TCF-mCherry-positive cells were also located in the AV canal, a cardiac sub-domain in which Wnt-signaling plays a known role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gillers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hurlstone et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Verhoeven et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Overexpression of Axin1 stabilizes the β-catenin destruction complex, resulting in the inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakamura et al., 1998</xref>). Since cardiac specification and differentiation is regulated by Wnt/ β-catenin signaling at various stages during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ueno et al., 2007</xref>), it was important to block Wnt/β-catenin in a tissue-specific and temporally controlled manner.

We have previously observed similarly high heart rates in zebrafish embryos treated with isoproterenol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lodder et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that the observed increase in heart rate could be related to impaired autonomic control. To address this, we first induced Axin1 overexpression, followed by incubation of the embryos with either carbachol, a parasympathetic agonist, or isoproterenol, a sympathetic agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsieh and Liao, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dlugos and Rabin, 2010</xref>). While control embryos showed a significant reduction in heart rate after addition of carbachol, the reduction in heart rate was abolished in Axin1 overexpressing embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). Despite their already high heart rate, the Axin1-overexpressing embryos still responded to isoproterenol by increasing their heart rate further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). This resulted in extreme heart rates of up to 266 bpm in some of the embryos with ectopic Axin1 expression and incubated with isoproterenol.

However, <italic>muscarinic cholinergic receptor 2a</italic> (<italic>chrm2a</italic>) encoding for the muscarinic M2 receptor responsible for parasympathetic regulation of the heart rate is expressed in the sinoatrial region of the adult zebrafish heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stoyek et al., 2016</xref>) as well as the embryonic heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Steele et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thisse et al., 2004</xref>). At 2 and 3 dpf, <italic>chrm2a</italic> was expressed in the sinoatrial region of the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Overexpression of Axin1 resulted in a slight reduction in the expression of <italic>chrm2a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>), indicating that Wnt/β-catenin can work at the level of the M2 receptor.</p><p>Together, our results reveal a new role for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the autonomic control of heart rate by regulating the response of pacemaker cells to parasympathetic stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recently, transcriptome maps with spatial resolution were made of the murine heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeLaughter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2016</xref>). These maps were made by combining microdissection of embryonic hearts with single-cell mRNA-seq. Although these transcriptome maps contain single-cell expression data, the microdissection limited their spatial resolution. In addition, rare cell types may have been missed since not all cells within the heart were sequenced. In comparison, the <italic>tomo</italic>-seq transcriptome map was made by sectioning the entire heart in cryosections of 10 μm thickness. The high resolution and inclusion of all cardiac cells using the <italic>tomo</italic>-seq method likely explains why we were able to identify more differentially expressed genes even in a rare cell type such as the pacemaker cells. We established a comprehensive transcriptome map that includes the expression patterns of all genes expressed in the 2-day-old zebrafish heart. The 502 genes differentially expressed in the sinoatrial region encompass many uncharacterized ones, indicating the potential value of this dataset for revealing new pathways that regulate pacemaker development. A limitation of the <italic>tomo</italic>-seq transcriptome map is that the gene expression information is not cell-type specific, which can be resolved by additional in situ hybridizations or combining <italic>tomo</italic>-seq with single-cell mRNA sequencing.</p><p>Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the AV canal regulates the expression of <italic>bmp4</italic> and <italic>tbx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Verhoeven et al., 2011</xref>). Although <italic>bmp4</italic> and <italic>tbx2</italic> are also expressed in the sinoatrial region, this expression does not depend on Wnt/β-catenin signaling ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Verhoeven et al., 2011</xref>] and data not shown). We found that Isl1 is required for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the sinoatrial region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Since <italic>isl1</italic> is not expressed in the AV canal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hami et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tessadori et al., 2012</xref>), and since we observed active Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the AV canal of <italic>isl1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), we conclude that Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays different roles in the AV canal and sinoatrial region.</p><p>We found that Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity is required between 36 hpf and 52 hpf to reduce the heart rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This was unexpected since <italic>isl1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutant hearts have a severely reduced heart rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Pater et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tessadori et al., 2012</xref>). To explain these seemingly contradicting observations we propose a model in which Isl1 has a very central role in establishing pacemaker cell differentiation, while Wnt has a more specific downstream role during pacemaker function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). We hypothesize that Isl1 regulates the expression of factors that are essential to drive the rhythmic membrane depolarizations, which is specific for pacemaker cells and absent from atrial cardiomyocytes. Without Isl1 the heart beat is maintained at low frequency since embryonic cardiomyocytes are able to spontaneously depolarize their membrane and contract, explaining the low beating frequency observed in <italic>isl1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Pater et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tessadori et al., 2012</xref>). When the cardiomyocytes mature, and lose their ability to spontaneously contract, the heartbeat of <italic>isl1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants stops since the rhythmic membrane depolarizations were not established. In addition, Isl1 induces Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the pacemaker cells to establish parasympathetic control of the rhythmic membrane depolarizations. Since parasympathetic input through acetylcholine and muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs) decreases the heart rate, an increase in heart rate was observed after inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Furthermore, we observed that carbachol, an acetylcholine agonist, was unable to reduce heart rate in embryos in which Wnt/β-catenin signaling was inhibited, indicating regulation at the level of the receptor or of downstream signaling. The M2 mAChR is expressed in the zebrafish heart from 30 hpf onwards and by 3dpf the autonomic response is mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsieh and Liao, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dlugos and Rabin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). Expression of the M2 mAChR was reduced after inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>), suggesting that Wnt/β-catenin signaling effects M2 receptor levels.</p><p>In summary, the spatially resolved transcriptome map of the embryonic heart provides an unprecedented opportunity to uncover novel mechanisms of cardiac development. The here identified Wnt-dependent mechanism to establish autonomous control of heart rate could be beneficial to ongoing efforts in creating biological pacemakers, which currently lack parasympathetic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Protze et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>mb</italic></td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">ZDB-GENE-040426–1430</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>smtnl1</italic></td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">ZDB-GENE-050306–23</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>anxa5b</italic></td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">ZDB-GENE-030131–9076</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>pdgfaa</italic></td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">ZDB-GENE-030918–2</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>fzd9b</italic></td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">ZDB-GENE-000906–4</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top">shox2</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">ZDB-GENE-040426–1457</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Tupfel long fin (TL)</td><td valign="top">ZIRC,Eugene, OR</td><td valign="top">ZDB-GENO-990623–2</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Tg(UAS:GFP)</td><td valign="top">Kawakami lab Asakawa 2008</td><td valign="top">ZDB-FISH-150901–15231</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Tg(Isl1:GFF;UAS:GFP)hu10018tg</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">see Material and methods section</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Tg(7xTCFXla.Siam:nlsmCherry)</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">The tg(7xTCF-nlsmCherry) wnt-signaling reporter line was established in a TL wildtype background using the pDEST-7xTCF-nlsmCHERRY-polyA construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moro et al., 2012</xref>) received from the Smith lab (IMB, Brisbane, Australia).</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top">isl1 mutant line. isl1sa29</td><td valign="top">ZIRC, Eugene, OR</td><td valign="top">ZDB-GENO-990623–2</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Tg(myl7:EGFP): twu26tg</td><td valign="top">ZIRC, Eugene, OR</td><td valign="top">ZDB-FISH-150901–23018</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Tg(TETRE:Mmu.Axin1-YFP)tud1: tud1Tg</td><td valign="top">ZIRC, Eugene, OR, Gilbert Weidinger, Knopf 2012</td><td valign="top">ZDB-FISH-150901–26117</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Tg(myl7:TETAM2-2A-mCherry)ulm8: ulm8Tg</td><td valign="top">ZIRC, Eugene, OR, Gilbert Weidinger, Knopf 2013</td><td valign="top">ZDB-ALT-151214–5</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-GFP (Chicken Antibodies, IgY Fraction)</td><td valign="top">Aves Labs, Tigard, OR</td><td valign="top">Cat# GFP-1010;

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Spatially resolved RNA-seq of the embryonic heart identifies a role for Wnt signaling in autonomic control of heart rate&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Burkhard and Bakkers illustrate the use of tomo-seq to generate a high-resolution spatial transcriptome map of the developing zebrafish heart. The authors identified a large number of genes that are differentially expressed within sub-compartments of the heart, thereby creating a valuable resource for future analyses of cardiac regionalization. To demonstrate the utility of this resource, the authors looked closely at genes expressed in the sinoatrial region and noted the expression of Wnt receptor <italic>fzd9b</italic> in this area. They then demonstrated that Wnt signaling is active in the sinoatrial/pacemaker region and is controlled by Islet-1 activity. Finally, functional analysis elucidated that the Wnt signaling pathway controls embryonic heart rate through modulation of pacemaker cell response to parasympathetic stimuli.</p><p>This work holds interest for investigators studying cardiac development, as little is known about genes regulating early specification of the sinoatrial node. The experiments are performed in a technically sound and elegant manner, the data are of high quality, and sufficient detail is included. Thus, this manuscript contributes significantly to our understanding of how proper cardiac physiology is established during embryogenesis, and it would appeal to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. However, a few key issues remain that need to be addressed in order to strengthen the paper's conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An exciting finding of this study is that Wnt signaling regulates the parasympathetic response in the sinoatrial region of the developing heart. Has the heart been innervated at this early developmental stage? If not, what might be the source of the parasympathetic signal? Are there hints from the tomo-seq dataset?</p><p>2) The model for Isl1 function is somewhat confusing as it separates Isl1's role into two discrete activities: regulating the expression of genes that maintain rhythmic membrane depolarizations and regulating Wnt signaling/parasympathetic controls. Might it be more clear to discuss the function of Isl1 in regulating Wnt signaling as a component of its larger role in establishing pacemaker cell differentiation?</p><p>3) The techniques employed to measure heart rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and heart rate variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) are less rigorous than might be expected. First, use of an atrial kymograph as opposed to a ventricular kymograph seems confusing. Additionally, manual selection of a region of interest in the kymograph can alter heart rate calculations, and the duration of the video image acquired (2.8 seconds) is rather short. Evaluation of heart rate from both chambers would be helpful, as would measurement of fractional shortening. Also, more accurate representations of heart rate variability such as standard deviation of the mean R-R interval would improve the accuracy of the data presented.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>, <italic>chrm2a</italic> expression following Wnt inhibition appears downregulated although the authors state that there is no difference when compared to wild-type. Representation of the total number of embryos examined and the number depicting normal versus slightly decreased expression in the sinoatrial node region would be helpful in this context. Alternatively, a more representative image may be appropriate if expression levels are unchanged.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31515.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An exciting finding of this study is that Wnt signaling regulates the parasympathetic response in the sinoatrial region of the developing heart.

From our analysis, no neuronal innervation of the cardiac tissue was detected at this stage, although superficial sensory neurons are clearly present. Since we believe that this information is important for the interpretation of the functional analysis we have now included a new supplementary figure presenting these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). In addition, we added a short statement in the text to explain this:</p><p>“At the examined embryonic stage the heart lacks any direct innervation by the nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).”</p><p>We do not know what the source is of the parasympathetic stimuli (e.g. acetylcholine) to which the pacemaker cells respond. Acetylcholine is secreted by neurons and is also present in the serum. We speculate that in the embryo, circulating acetylcholine can activate the M2 receptor in pacemaker cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The model for Isl1 function is somewhat confusing as it separates Isl1's role into two discrete activities: regulating the expression of genes that maintain rhythmic membrane depolarizations and regulating Wnt signaling/parasympathetic controls.

From our results, we conclude that Isl1 is required for both the establishment and regulation (through Wnt) of the rhythmic membrane depolarizations in the pacemaker cells. We agree that these are not two discrete activities of Isl1 but are both part of a larger role of isl1. To better show that Wnt signalling is a component of the larger role of Isl1 in pacemaker differentiation, we have adjusted the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>. In addition we adjusted the text in the Discussion, which reads now as follows:</p><p>“To explain these seemingly contradicting observations we propose a model in which Isl1 has a very central role in establishing pacemaker cell differentiation, while Wnt has a more specific downstream role during pacemaker function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). […] Since parasympathetic input through acetylcholine and muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs) decreases the heart rate, an increase in heart rate was observed after inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The techniques employed to measure heart rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and heart rate variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) are less rigorous than might be expected.

Although in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> kymographs are shown representing only 2.8 sec, the actual kymographs used for the analysis had a duration of 10 seconds. The kymograph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> was cropped to 2.8 seconds for better illustration. This was unclear from the description in the Materials and methods section and has been corrected.</p><p>For the analysis, we selected a region close to the pacemaker region to allow us to focus on pacemaker function while limiting a possible effect of slower conduction velocity or impaired contraction on our measurements. We have now reanalysed all the videos and repeated the heart rate analysis using ventricular kymographs as suggested and added the results to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B-E</xref>. The new measurements taken from the ventricle are very similar to the original atrial measurements and therefore do not alter any of our conclusions. The measurements from both chambers are now included in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. We have not quantified fractional shortening due to the large variation observed in control embryos.</p><p>As suggested we have now also included the standard deviation of the mean R-R interval in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>, chrm2a expression following Wnt inhibition appears downregulated although the authors state that there is no difference when compared to wild-type.
