subunit template. The fundamental question of whether human telomerase catalytic activity requires cooperation across two TERT subunits remains under debate. In this study, we describe new approaches of subunit labeling for single-molecule imaging, applied to determine the TERT content of complexes assembled in cells or cell extract. Surprisingly, telomerase reconstitutions yielded heterogeneous DNA-bound TERT monomer and dimer complexes in relative amounts that varied with assembly and purification method. Among the complexes, cellular holoenzyme and minimal recombinant enzyme monomeric for TERT had catalytic activity. Dimerization was suppressed by removing a TERT domain linker with atypical sequence bias, which did not inhibit cellular or minimal enzyme assembly or activity. Overall, this work defines human telomerase DNA binding and synthesis properties at single-molecule level and establishes conserved telomerase subunit architecture from single-celled organisms to humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08363.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08363.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08363.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Enzymes carry out the many diverse chemical reactions that support life. Some enzymes are made of just one component protein that works on its own, but others are made of multiple proteins that are all required for the enzyme to work properly. Most of what is understood about the activities of enzymes has been deduced by studying solutions containing many enzyme molecules. However, many enzymes can bind to different combinations of proteins to form groups (or ‘complexes’) with a variety of three-dimensional shapes, so there may be a variety of enzyme complexes in the solution. This can lead to researchers drawing different conclusions about the same enzyme.</p><p>In humans and other eukaryotic organisms, DNA is contained within structures called chromosomes. An enzyme called telomerase adds structures called telomeres to the ends of the chromosomes, which protect the DNA from damage. The center of telomerase has a protein called TERT that forms complexes with other proteins. However, it is not known how many copies of the TERT protein are present in each complex. Wu et al. studied these complexes using fluorescent tags that enabled each protein to be identified using a technique called ‘single-particle imaging’. The experiments show that these complexes can contain either one or two TERT proteins.</p><p>It had previously been suggested that TERT is only an active enzyme when it is bound to another TERT molecule, but Wu et al. show that even complexes with a single TERT are able to add telomeres to DNA. Further experiments used a mutant form of the TERT protein that cannot interact with other TERT molecules and found that complexes that contain this mutant protein still have normal enzyme activity.</p><p>Large quantities of purified proteins were used in this study. Therefore, a future challenge will be to refine the method to allow experiments to use much less protein, which would more closely reflect how telomerase is produced in cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08363.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08363.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>fluorescence imaging</kwd><kwd>telomerase</kwd><kwd>telomeric repeat synthesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL079585</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Robert Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Kathleen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM094522, GM054198</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Robert Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Dagdas</surname><given-names>Yavuz S</given-names></name><name><surname>Yilmaz</surname><given-names>S Tunc</given-names></name><name><surname>Yildiz</surname><given-names>Ahmet</given-names></name><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Kathleen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1106400, MCB-1055017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Robert Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Dagdas</surname><given-names>Yavuz S</given-names></name><name><surname>Yildiz</surname><given-names>Ahmet</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>New labeling approaches for single-molecule fluorescence microscopy detect the monomeric catalytic subunit of human telomerase within cellular holoenzyme and minimal active recombinant enzyme.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Threats to genomic integrity occur at the ends of every linear chromosome, including incomplete DNA synthesis by the replisome and the potential for inappropriate DNA break repair. Eukaryotic cells control these reactions through the function of telomeres, typically consisting of telomeric repeat DNA bound by proteins that comprise the telosome, or in mammalian cells, shelterin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palm and de Lange, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stewart et al., 2012</xref>). Telomeric repeat tract maintenance depends on the specialized reverse transcriptase telomerase, which can extend a chromosome 3′ end by processive addition of single-stranded repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blackburn et al., 2006</xref>). Insufficient telomere synthesis ultimately compromises telomere function and signals a halt to cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Sullivan and Karlseder, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aubert, 2014</xref>). This telomere-linked restriction of cellular renewal leads to failures of highly proliferative human tissues, with clinical manifestations including bone marrow failure, aplastic anemia, and pulmonary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armanios and Blackburn, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The active human telomerase ribonucleoprotein (RNP) includes telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), which provides the active site, and an RNA (hTR) containing a reiteratively copied internal template. The unique repeat addition processivity of telomerase requires conserved domains in both TERT and hTR that distinguish telomerases from other polymerase families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackburn and Collins, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Podlevsky and Chen, 2012</xref>). The TERT N-terminal (TEN) domain allows retention of single-stranded DNA during the template repositioning required for tandem repeat synthesis. TEN-domain-truncated TERT, designated ‘TERT ring’ based on <italic>Tribolium</italic> TERT structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gillis et al., 2008</xref>), supports only single-repeat synthesis that can be complemented to high repeat addition processivity by the TEN domain as a separate polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Robart and Collins, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu and Collins, 2014a</xref>). In addition to these and other catalytic activity requirements for TERT and hTR, a biologically functional human telomerase holoenzyme contains two sets of H/ACA proteins (dyskerin, NHP2, NOP10, and GAR1) bound to hTR to direct RNP biogenesis and TCAB1 to redistribute the RNP from nucleoli to Cajal bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Egan and Collins, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Podlevsky and Chen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmidt and Cech, 2015</xref>). Telomerase holoenzyme must also assemble with the shelterin protein TPP1 for telomere recruitment and extension of chromosome ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lue et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nandakumar and Cech, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sexton et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Endogenous human telomerase is scarce, with the number of TERT-hTR complexes per cell estimated as only ∼35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 2007</xref>) or ∼250 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xi and Cech, 2014</xref>) in even the most highly telomerase-positive tumor cell lines. Consequently, biochemical investigations of human telomerase have been greatly facilitated by enzyme reconstitution. Enzyme reconstitution in cells exploits transiently introduced plasmids to overexpress TERT and the 451-nucleotide mature hTR, which must be 3′-processed from an appropriate precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mitchell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fu and Collins, 2003</xref>). Telomerase complexes reconstituted in cells have a diversity of substoichiometric-associated factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Egan and Collins, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nandakumar and Cech, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmidt and Cech, 2015</xref>). As an alternative reconstitution approach, a minimal-subunit catalytically active RNP can be assembled by expressing TERT in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) with in vitro transcribed full-length hTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weinrich et al., 1997</xref>) or a half-sized RNA such as hTRmin used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu and Collins, 2014a</xref>), which lacks the two-hairpin H/ACA motif that assembles the holoenzyme subunits dyskerin, NHP2, NOP10, GAR1, and TCAB1. Only two hTR domains are critical for telomerase catalytic activity: a domain containing the template and adjacent pseudoknot and a branched stem-junction domain containing stem-loop P6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mitchell and Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). Importantly, human telomerase enzymes reconstituted in cells or in RRL can interact with the same length of single-stranded DNA, have similar specific activity, and have only minor differences in other enzyme properties such as repeat addition processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jurczyluk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zaug et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu and Collins, 2014a</xref>).</p><p>Central to defining telomerase RNP architecture is a delineation of the number of TERT and hTR subunits that assemble together to generate an enzyme active site. RNP affinity purification and structural studies indicate a single RNA and single TERT per biologically functional telomerase holoenzyme of single-celled eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Livengood et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Witkin and Collins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cunningham and Collins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bajon et al., 2015</xref>). This subunit stoichiometry is recapitulated by the minimal <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> telomerase RNP assembled in RRL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bryan et al., 2003</xref>). However, the subunit stoichiometry of an active human telomerase RNP is unresolved: some assays suggest TERT and hTR function as monomeric subunits, without dominant-negative inhibition of a wild-type (WT) subunit by co-expressed mutant subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Errington et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Egan and Collins, 2010</xref>), while other assays suggest obligate co-dependence of active site function across TERT and hTR subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wenz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sauerwald et al., 2013</xref>). Size fractionation of human telomerase holoenzyme has been suggested to establish TERT dimerization based on molecular mass by gel filtration of ∼600 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wenz et al., 2001</xref>) or by glycerol gradient sedimentation of 550 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schnapp et al., 1998</xref>) or 670 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 2007</xref>) relative to protein standards, but similar fractionation would be predicted for a holoenzyme with a single TERT, single hTR, single TCAB1, and a complex of dyskerin, NHP2, NOP10, and GAR1 bound to each of two H/ACA-motif hairpin stems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Egan and Collins, 2012a</xref>). Analysis using single-molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy detected one TERT and one hTR per RRL-reconstituted minimal RNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alves et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, cellular subunit overexpression, purification, and crosslinking yielded particles observed by electron microscopy that were proposed to be active dimeric TERT RNPs, based on detection of two bound single-stranded DNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sauerwald et al., 2013</xref>). Unfortunately, all of the experiments above suffer from the caveat that individual complexes are inferred to have the activity measured only for a bulk population.</p><p>Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy can detect the number of subunits in individual macromolecular complexes. We therefore developed a single-molecule TERT-labeling strategy to determine the TERT subunit content of human telomerase RNPs assembled and purified using methods typical in previous studies. We exploited the preserved function of N-terminally tagged human TERT to introduce the acyl carrier protein (ACP) tag for covalent labeling by prosthetic group transfer from derivatives of Coenzyme A (CoA). ACP and ACP-based tags are well suited to the applications developed here because they are small, monomeric, and expose the conjugated prosthetic group as a conformationally dynamic extension from the protein surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Byers and Gong, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan and Vogel, 2010</xref>). We applied previously developed tag labeling methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>) to investigate the TERT content of individual complexes from purifications of cellular telomerase holoenzyme reconstituted by assembly in human 293T cells and minimal recombinant RNP reconstituted by assembly in RRL. Surprisingly, different affinity purifications yielded different mixtures of complexes monomeric or variously multimeric for TERT. TERT complexes were also heterogeneous in catalytic activity and DNA-binding properties. Complexes with TERT monomer supported DNA synthesis. Apparently non-productive TERT self-association occurred through a low-complexity region of the protein dispensable for RNP catalytic activity. Overall, these studies support the function of human telomerase holoenzyme and minimal recombinant RNPs with a single subunit of TERT and demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved telomerase subunit architecture.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Purification-biased TERT subunit content of DNA-bound complexes</title><p>To quantify the TERT subunit content of reconstituted human telomerase complexes, we developed a strategy to label individual TERT molecules with a Cy3 or Cy5 fluorophore. The 8 kDa ACP and MCP tags derive from bacterial proteins that accept covalent transfer of the CoA phosphopantetheinyl (Ppant) group to a serine on the protein surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left). In endogenous bacterial context, the Ppant group serves as a 20 Å swing-arm tether for subsequent transient attachment of the acyl groups that are the carrier proteins' cargo. For labeling ACP/MCP in vitro, the Ppant group of CoA can be pre-conjugated to diverse labels including Cy3, Cy5, or biotin prior to the prosthetic group transfer reaction, such that the Ppant swing-arm becomes a spacer between the label and the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belshaw et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">George et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yin et al., 2006</xref>). ACP synthase catalyzes transfer from a derivatized CoA to the ACP tag but does not label the MCP tag, while either tag is labeled by SFP synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>).

Therefore, we fused the human TERT N-terminus to a triple FLAG peptide and either the ACP or MCP tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right).

TERT complexes from each reconstitution method were enriched by each of two purification approaches: TERT binding to FLAG antibody resin followed by peptide elution (F purification) or RNA template base-pairing to a resin-immobilized 2′O-methyl RNA (2′OMe) oligonucleotide followed by displacement oligonucleotide elution (O purification; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, panels A, B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schnapp et al., 1998</xref>). The 3′-modified displacement oligonucleotide used in this work did not compete with DNA primer for telomerase elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel C). 293T cell lysates or RRL expression reactions were split and purified in parallel using the F and O purification approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). ACP- and MCP-tagged TERTs expressed at equivalent level and assembled active telomerase, quantified by radiolabeled dGTP incorporation in reactions also containing dTTP and ddATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). CoA-Cy5 labeling of ACP-TERT using ACP synthase and CoA-Cy3 labeling of MCP-TERT using SFP synthase were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and fluorescence scanning, with no labeling of TERT lacking an ACP or MCP tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Importantly, the profile of telomerase product synthesis was not affected by the labeling reaction for fluorophore conjugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>While purification by either tagged TERT or RNA template yields active telomerase, these purification strategies also enrich either TERT not assembled with hTR or hTR without TERT, respectively. To investigate the amounts of tagged TERT vs active RNP, we compared the levels of TERT protein and enzyme activity across the four combinations of reconstitution and purification, subsequently designated 293T-F, 293T-O, RRL-F, and RRL-O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,F</xref>). TERT was detected by an antibody raised against its C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel D). Activity was quantified from reactions with dTTP, ddATP, and radiolabeled dGTP. O-purification by the hTR template enriched more telomerase activity relative to TERT than did F-purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), as would be expected based on template hybridization vs antibody binding to TERT. Comparison between the pair of 293T or RRL purifications suggests that most of the TERT in 293T-F and RRL-F was not assembled as telomerase RNP. This was anticipated for the 293T-F purification, because cellular expression of hTR is limited by inefficient co-transcriptional H/ACA RNP assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Darzacq et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Egan and Collins, 2012b</xref>). However, RRL reconstitution exploits the use of pre-transcribed hTR added at very high final concentration relative to TERT. Nonetheless, even optimized RRL expression produced hTR-free TERT enriched by F-purification.</p><p>To investigate the TERT content of individual complexes within a bulk fraction, we used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to image labeled TERT complexes bound to immobilized single-stranded T<sub>15</sub>(T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> DNA primer.

In the first method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left), we assembled telomerase by co-expression of ACP-TERT and MCP-TERT and labeled the TERTs sequentially, first labeling ACP-TERT with ACP synthase and CoA-Cy5 then labeling MCP-TERT with SFP synthase and CoA-Cy3. Fields of individual complexes were imaged to detect both dyes, and images were scored for the fraction of Cy5-labeled ACP-TERT that co-localized a Cy3-labeled MCP-TERT. In the second TERT subunit counting method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left), we assembled telomerase complexes containing only MCP-TERT and labeled using SFP synthase and CoA-Cy5. Fields of individual complexes were imaged, and each Cy5 ‘spot’ in the flow cell was analyzed for the number of dye photobleaching steps that occurred before the spot vanished. In the parallel approaches, the fraction of two-color co-localized spots and the number of photobleaching steps are both readily related to the sample fractional content of TERT monomer and dimer considering all possible two-subunit combinations (see Materials and methods, Equations 1, 2). Fluorescently labeled TERT complexes were diluted to obtain 1–4 spots per 100 µm<sup>2</sup> of the slide surface, and unbound protein was removed before imaging. To attain similar spot count per field across samples, labeled O-purification complexes required dilution relative to F-purification complexes isolated from an equal amount of the same extract, consistent with the greater yield of active RNP for O-purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Both two-color co-localization and photobleaching assays revealed the presence of more than one labeled TERT in a subset of the DNA-bound TERT complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). In the two-color co-localization assay, there was no statistically significant difference in TERT co-localization comparing DNA-bound 293T-O, RRL-F, and RRL-O complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; 17–23%, p = 0.58). In contrast, 293T-F complexes had much more TERT co-localization (46%, p = 0.0015). This distinction was consistent across a range of fluorescent spot density per field and different 293T cell extracts used for purifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Results from the photobleaching method of TERT subunit counting also indicated no statistically significant difference in TERT subunit content across the population of DNA-bound complexes from 293T-O, RRL-F, and RRL-O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; 19–27% bleaching in multiple steps, p = 0.33). In contrast, 293T-F complexes had much more multistep photobleaching (43%, p = 0.0066) including a substantial fraction of complexes that photobleached in three or even more than three steps (12%). We analyzed whether the results from the methods of subunit counting were consistent with each other, assuming a mixed population of TERT monomer and TERT dimer complexes (Materials and methods, Equation 3, and see below). There is excellent correlation of two-color co-localization to two-step photobleaching results for 293T-O, RRL-F, and RRL-O but not 293T-F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The abundance of 293T-F TERT complexes that photobleached in three or more steps is likely responsible for this discord, as this population of complexes was distinguished from TERT dimer complexes in the count of photobleaching steps but would be lumped together with TERT dimer complexes in the count of two-color co-localization. Together, the findings above reveal a surprising diversity of TERT subunit content in DNA-bound complexes. Furthermore, it is evident that this heterogeneity varies across the methods of telomerase reconstitution and purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Quantification of the TERT monomer fraction of DNA-bound complexes</title><p>The subunit co-localization and multistep photobleaching values measured above are related to the number of TERTs within each complex but are also influenced by the labeling efficiency of the MCP tag. Therefore, in order to calculate the fraction of complexes with TERT monomer or TERT dimer for each method of reconstitution and purification, it was necessary to establish MCP-TERT-labeling efficiency. Labeling of 293T- and RRL-reconstituted, F-purified MCP-TERT complexes was to saturation within 30 min of a reaction with CoA-Cy3 or CoA-Cy5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), well within the standard 2-hr labeling protocol. Also, labeling efficiency was not dependent on the reconstitution and purification method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We adapted a previously developed approach to quantify a minimum lower bound of labeling efficiency without assumptions from fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yin et al., 2005</xref>). Using CoA-biotin as the synthase substrate results in covalent target protein biotinylation, which can be used as the basis for protein depletion by binding to streptavidin resin. The minimum lower bound of labeling efficiency can be calculated from the amount of protein remaining in the unbound fraction. First, we confirmed that CoA-biotin is used equivalently to CoA-fluorophore by measuring competition between CoA-biotin and CoA-Cy3. If RRL-reconstituted F-purified MCP-TERT was labeled to saturation with CoA-Cy3 and then labeled with CoA-biotin, no biotinylation of TERT could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Similarly, labeling with CoA-biotin drastically reduced subsequent labeling with CoA-Cy3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Streptavidin depleted 49% of the TERT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), consistent with the previous TERT depletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, 38% of biotinylated TERT remained unbound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), revealing that streptavidin binding in 2 M urea did not completely deplete the labeled TERT.

Correcting the quantified total TERT depletion for depletion efficiency of biotin-TERT gives an MCP-TERT-labeling efficiency of 82% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

We set labeling efficiency as 82% but also modeled a range of labeling efficiency from 51% to 100% as lower and upper bounds (indicated as ‘Low L’ and ‘High L’ limits).

The 293T-F population of DNA-bound TERT could not be modeled as a mixture of TERT monomer and dimer across the full range of labeling efficiency using the co-localization quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), likely due to the substantial fraction of complexes with three or more TERT subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Curiously, the fraction of WT TERT complexes with activity-dependent elution varied widely across the TERT populations from different reconstitution and purification conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). RRL-F and RRL-O complexes showed predominantly activity-dependent elution. About half of the DNA-bound 293T-O complexes also showed activity-dependent elution, but a surprisingly low percentage of 293T-F complexes eluted with the opportunity for DNA synthesis. The non-eluting fraction of TERT complexes roughly correlated with the fraction of complexes that could bind slide-immobilized DNA after sample pre-treatment with RNase A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, gray bars).</p><p>Importantly, the fraction of DNA-bound 293T-O, RRL-F, and RRL-O TERT complexes with nucleotide-dependent-‘specific’ elution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) overlaps the fraction of DNA-bound complexes with monomeric TERT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>). This overlap establishes that at least some TERT monomer RNPs have catalytic activity. To directly measure the contribution of TERT monomer RNPs to specific elution, we used RRL-reconstituted O-purified Cy5-labeled MCP-TERT complexes to quantify TERT spot count per field and steps of photobleaching for samples after incubation in parallel for 30 min in buffer with or without dNTPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Approximately one third as many labeled TERT complexes were present in samples incubated with dNTPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), consistent with the elution time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The reduction of TERT spot count by activity-based elution occurred entirely in complexes with single-step photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, p = 0.0006). The conditions of elution altered the relative representation of TERT monomer and dimer complexes, calculated by adjusting the photobleaching step quantifications for TERT-labeling efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Consistent with specific elution of TERT monomer complexes, the DNA-bound TERT complexes remaining after specific elution were enriched for TERT dimer. Overall, the findings above strongly suggest that human telomerase catalytic activity requires only a single TERT subunit per RNP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Assessing the DNA-binding affinity of TERT complexes</title><p>The heterogeneity of DNA-bound TERT complex elution was surprising. We therefore investigated whether the bulk populations of TERT complexes from different reconstitution and purification conditions had heterogeneous DNA-binding affinities as well. Towards this goal, we quantified the DNA-binding affinity of TERT complexes anchored directly to the flow cell surface. To do this, we labeled MCP-TERT with CoA-biotin, bound the biotin-labeled TERT complexes to streptavidin on the flow cell surface, and assayed the immobilized TERT complexes for retention of Cy5-labeled (T<sub>2</sub>AG<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This direct TERT immobilization captured the full TERT heterogeneity of the bulk purification fractions, which we monitored separately by SDS-PAGE of MCP-TERT labeled with Cy5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Many variations of reconstitution method had surprisingly little impact on the DNA-bound TERT monomer/dimer ratio, with one exception: elimination of the 125 amino acid linker between the TERT ring and TEN domain. Phylogenetic comparison revealed that this domain linker is particularly long in vertebrate TERTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Podlevsky et al., 2008</xref>), approximately 100 amino acids longer than in the ciliate and budding yeast TERTs that assemble only TERT monomer RNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Livengood et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bryan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Witkin and Collins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cunningham and Collins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bajon et al., 2015</xref>). Scanning six-residue substitutions of human TERT linker sequence did not uncover any significance of the region for telomerase catalytic activity or telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armbruster et al., 2001</xref>), but this approach did not alter the atypical amino acid composition of the linker region overall. Human TERT amino acids 201–325 are 18% proline, 14% arginine, and 12% glycine. When subject to bioinformatical analysis for amino acid content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harbi et al., 2011</xref>), this region is identified as having high compositional bias. We also used SEG analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wootton and Federhen, 1993</xref>) to search for low-complexity sequence within the human TERT linker. SEG analysis identified two segments of the linker, residues 213–248 and 313–323, as low complexity. Low-complexity regions can mediate diverse protein–protein interactions including concentration-dependent self-association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coletta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kato et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the TERT low-complexity <underline>p</underline>roline/<underline>a</underline>rginine/glycine-rich <underline>l</underline>inker (termed the PAL) is a candidate region for mediating self-association of overexpressed TERT.</p><p>Whether the length of the human TERT PAL influences RNP assembly or activity has not been tested. Previous assays that separated the TEN domain from the TERT ring retained the PAL on either the TEN domain or TERT ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Robart and Collins, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu and Collins, 2014a</xref>). We therefore removed TERT residues 201–325 from the N-terminally F-tagged full-length protein, either by simply deleting the region (TERT-∆PAL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) or replacing it with 5, 10, or 20 repeats of the sequence NAAIRS (TERT-5N, −10N, −20N; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), the six amino acid motif used previously in the non-disruptive scanning mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armbruster et al., 2001</xref>). The PAL-mutant TERT proteins expressed at levels similar to WT TERT in 293T cells and in RRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and binding of WT and PAL-mutant TERT complexes to FLAG antibody resin enriched similar amounts of catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Although direct fusion of the TEN domain to the TERT ring did not substantially affect the quantified overall activity it appeared to reduce the amount of the longest product DNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This change in product profile was rescued by NAAIRS repeat insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Since the number of radiolabeled dGTP nucleotides incorporated into a product DNA is proportional to length, products elongated by many repeats are detected with disproportionately high sensitivity relative to their actual abundance. To more accurately profile the repeat addition processivity of the reconstituted enzymes, we assayed telomerase activity using a primer radiolabeled at its 5′ end rather than by extension with radiolabeled dNTPs. This also allowed the use of a non-limiting concentration of dGTP in the activity assay reaction (see ‘Materials and methods’). A 5-min pulse of primer extension was followed by a chase period with excess unlabeled primer to eliminate telomerase reinitiation on released product DNA. Under these conditions, primer extension was highly processive for complexes of WT TERT, TERT-∆PAL, and TERT-20N assembled in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Similar results were obtained with RRL-reconstituted enzymes (data not shown).

The WT TERT proteolysis products correspond to the TEN domain fused to lengths of PAL ending at the two computationally identified low-complexity regions. A simple hypothesis to explain these findings is that an hTR-bound full-length TERT can co-purify a TERT fragment dimerized through the PAL. This would account for the detection of some PAL-containing TEN domain in the 293T-O bulk purification, which unlike the bulk F-purification should not directly enrich TERT fragments compromised for hTR binding. Bulk purification fractions of RRL-reconstituted WT TERT lacked the TERT proteolysis products detected in the 293T bulk purifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and data not shown), suggesting that the TERT PAL may be a target of protease cleavage in cells. Furthermore, this proteolysis is specific for WT PAL sequence because no TEN domain fragments were observed the TERT-∆PAL and TERT-20N purifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

Whether assembled in vivo or in vitro, we show that human telomerase complexes monomeric for TERT are catalytically active. Monomeric TERT was abundant in the populations of DNA-bound complexes from at least three of the four bulk purification samples examined here, particularly from any purification using a template-complementary oligonucleotide. These results establish the phylogenetic conservation of a TERT-monomer telomerase active site. Also, our results support TERT haploinsufficiency rather than dominant-negative inhibition as the mechanism accounting for human disease from heterozygous TERT mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armanios et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armanios and Blackburn, 2012</xref>). We note that although the budding yeast telomerase holoenzyme has a TERT monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bajon et al., 2015</xref>), multiple telomerase RNPs can transiently co-localize as a cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gallardo et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly in human cells, Cajal bodies and/or shelterin interactions could dynamically cluster telomerase RNPs within a general nuclear area. The biological significance of this clustering remains to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hockemeyer and Collins, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The biased amino acid composition, low-complexity sequence, and predicted lack of structure of the TERT PAL all may promote overexpressed TERT formation of dimers and aggregates. The similar TERT monomer/dimer ratio observed for DNA-bound O-purified 293T vs RRL complexes suggests that TERT self-association accounts for the vast majority of dimer formation, since 293T and RRL TERT complexes differ in all components other than TERT (full-length hTR and H/ACA proteins vs hTRmin). TERT complexes with multistep photobleaching appeared to support little if any activity-dependent elution from DNA. It remains possible that active RNP dimers form under reconstitution conditions other than the standard protocols used in this work. Also, not all TERT monomer complexes had efficient activity-dependent elution: a larger fraction of 293T-O complexes than RRL-O complexes failed to elute with the opportunity for DNA synthesis, even when these complexes were converted to nearly homogeneous TERT monomer content by PAL deletion. We speculate that this difference arises from the greater heterogeneity of TERT structure, modification, and interaction partners produced by expression in cells. All of the findings above raise the need for caution in the interpretation of biochemical assays conducted using bulk purifications of TERT complexes. Surprisingly, even selection for single-stranded DNA-binding activity did not fully discriminate against inactive TERT.</p><p>We pinpoint a proline/arginine/glycine-rich human TERT domain linker as the major site of TERT dimerization. Although the PAL mediates dimerization of overexpressed TERT, at lower endogenous TERT expression level, we propose that the PAL has other biological roles. To address this hypothesis, it will be important to determine PAL interaction partners using approaches that recapitulate a physiological TERT expression level.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript addresses a long-standing debate over the subunit composition of human telomerase and whether the enzyme functions as a monomer or dimer. Resolution of this question is fundamental to full understanding of telomerase mechanism and how heterozygous TERT or telomerase RNA mutations cause human disease. The current manuscript circumvents the past problems associated with bulk population assays by taking very powerful and creative single molecule approaches to analyze both subunit composition and enzyme activity. They show unequivocally that telomerase is fully functional as a monomer: i.e. it shows the expected high affinity primer binding and activity with high repeat addition processivity. They also show that the approach used for enzyme production and purification has major effects on the fraction of enzyme in monomeric versus multimeric form.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the western blots for TERT are done using an antibody that has not been characterized – the Methods simply cite “Geron”. Given the significant literature about the non-specificity of TERT antibodies, it is important to show the specificity of the antibody used here.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, two different kinds of telomerase activity assays are shown in E and F, but there is no comment about these two different methods in the Methods section.</p><p>3) In the experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, it is not clear why the authors don't look at the fraction of co-localized spots AFTER product release. If the monomers are more specifically released, there should be an increase in co-localization after release. This is a very straightforward experiment that would extend the findings.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the data on the TEN swapping experiments are confusing and should be removed from the manuscript. At the end of the subsection “Assessing the active RNP fraction of DNA-bound TERT complexes”, the authors conclude that the human TERT is a monomer. Then, in the next subsection (“TERT dimerization without TERT or hTR domain swapping”), the authors start by saying: “we next addressed the biochemical basis for assembly of two TERT subunits”. This makes no sense. Why would you do these experiments after having shown the active enzyme is a monomer? The next section on the PAL domain should be included but should be set up much more clearly as a way to investigate how TERT might be found in aggregates when the active enzyme is a monomer. The authors should seriously consider removing this data and focusing the paper.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the data in panel C is messy and it is not clear how this adds to the story. The limited proteolysis of an isolated domain is not very helpful. If the authors showed that full length TERT is proteolyzed within the PAL region that would be a much better use of this technique. As it is, this panel does not add to the paper.</p><p>6) Again in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the authors conclude that there is no effect of the PAL deletion on telomerase activity, but from the gels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> there is a visible effect. Showing reproducible side-by-side lane would be helpful here, and more importantly a dilution series of the elongation products, or a time course to better compare activity is needed. The difference seen in these gels is almost as great as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> where the authors state a 50% reduction in activity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08363.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>, the western blots for TERT are done using an antibody that has not been characterized – the Methods simply cite “Geron”.

TERT subunit counting in an MCP-TERT reconstitution would be by steps of photobleaching rather than two-color colocalization, but the intent of this request is clear. We had hesitated to include quantification of photobleaching steps on a post-elution field of TERT complexes already imaged several times to quantify spot count per microscope field. We resolved this concern by performing comparative post-elution analysis of photobleaching as an experiment separate from the spot-count time courses described by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> panels B, C.
