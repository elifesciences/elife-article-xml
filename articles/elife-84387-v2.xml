major drivers of cholinergic modulation of the firing rate during a triangular current ramp, which emulates the bump in synaptic input received while traversing the place field. In control, fewer spikes at lower frequencies are elicited on the down-ramp compared to the up-ramp due to long-term inactivation of the Na<sub>V</sub> channel. The cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh) removes or even reverses this spike rate adaptation, causing more spikes to be elicited on the down-ramp than the up-ramp. CCh application during Schaffer collateral stimulation designed to simulate a ramp produces similar shifts in the center of mass of firing to later in the ramp. The non-specific TRP antagonist flufenamic acid and the TRPM4-specific blockers CBA and 9-phenanthrol, but not the TRPC-specific antagonist SKF96365, reverse the effect of CCh; this implicates the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated nonspecific cation current, I<sub>CAN</sub>, carried by TRPM4 channels. The cholinergic shift of the center of mass of firing is prevented by strong intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering but not by antagonists for IP<sub>3</sub> and ryanodine receptors, ruling out a role for known mechanisms of release from intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. Pharmacology combined with modeling suggest that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in a nanodomain near the TRPM4 channel is elevated through an unknown source that requires both muscarinic receptor activation and depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx during the ramp. Activation of the regenerative inward TRPM4 current in the model qualitatively replicates and provides putative underlying mechanisms for the experimental observations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>multicompartmental modeling</kwd><kwd>patch clamp</kwd><kwd>nanodomain</kwd><kwd>nonspecific cation current</kwd><kwd>neuromodulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH115832</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Canavier</surname><given-names>Carmen C</given-names></name><name><surname>Gasparini</surname><given-names>Sonia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018936</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Canavier</surname><given-names>Carmen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Enhancement Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gasparini</surname><given-names>Sonia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A nonspecific cation current mediated by TRPM4 channels is a major contributor to the increase in excitability induced by cholinergic modulation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, which are thought to play an important role in episodic memory.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Release of the neuromodulator acetylcholine is thought to be correlated with certain brain states or functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Pepeu and Giovannini, 2004</xref>).

As for the degree to which acetylcholine release is spatially targeted, this is still under debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Disney and Higley, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Sarter and Lustig, 2020</xref>); however, it has been shown that CA1 receives cholinergic afferents in all layers, although at different densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Nyakas et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aznavour et al., 2002</xref>). Pyramidal neurons express G-protein-coupled metabotropic muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Levey et al., 1995</xref>), more so than they do ionotropic (nicotinic) receptors, which are primarily on interneurons in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dani and Bertrand, 2007</xref>). M<sub>1</sub> mAChRs, in particular, are found on both dendritic shafts and spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Yamasaki et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Elevated acetylcholine in the hippocampal formation is thought to favor memory encoding, and modulates theta oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Hasselmo, 2006</xref>), which in turn modulate place cell firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Easton et al., 2012</xref>). There is evidence that cholinergic activity regulates long-term synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Huerta and Lisman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Palacios-Filardo and Mellor, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fernández de Sevilla et al., 2021</xref>). Cholinergic activation also influences intrinsic properties of neurons, which result in membrane potential depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brown and Adams, 1980</xref>), increase in firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benardo and Prince, 1982</xref>), and modulation of input/output relationships, for example switching from burst to regular firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Azouz et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>In addition to suppressing several potassium currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brown and Adams, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Hoffman and Johnston, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Buchanan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Giessel and Sabatini, 2010</xref>), cholinergic stimulation has been linked to the activation of a calcium-activated, non-specific cation current, I<sub>CAN</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Colino and Halliwell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Egorov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Yoshida et al., 2012</xref>). I<sub>CAN</sub> is attributed to current flowing through channels of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Guinamard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Reboreda et al., 2011</xref>). The canonical TRP channel, TRPC, has been implicated in cholinergic-mediated persistent firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arboit et al., 2020</xref>), but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Egorov et al., 2019</xref>. There is indirect evidence, however, of involvement of TRPM4 channels in the cholinergic activation of I<sub>CAN</sub>. TRPM4 channel activation downstream of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors in pre-Botzinger cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Mironov, 2008</xref>), implicates the G<sub>q/11</sub> pathway shared by mGluR<sub>1/5</sub> and mAChR M<sub>1/3/5</sub>. Although TRPM4 channels are known to be expressed in the soma and apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Riquelme et al., 2021</xref>), their known functions in these neurons are currently limited to a minor role in the afterdepolarization following action potential trains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Lei et al., 2014</xref>) and involvement in NMDA-mediated LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Menigoz et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we found that when triangular shaped current ramps intended to emulate the depolarizing input received by a place cell during a place field traversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Epsztein et al., 2011</xref>) were injected at the soma or dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, they elicited fewer spikes on the down-ramp than on the up-ramp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Upchurch et al., 2022</xref>). In the current study, we investigated the effect of cholinergic modulation on this firing pattern in vitro (slice electrophysiology) and in silico (multi-compartmental NEURON model). We found that, at comparable maximum firing rates, cholinergic activation shifts the center of mass of firing to the latter half of the ramp, both for current injection ramps as well as for synaptically-driven depolarizations. Both CCh and sustained depolarization are required to produce the rightward shift in the center of mass of firing along the ramp. This shift is blocked by antagonists specific for TRPM4 channels or by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering, but not by IP<sub>3</sub> or ryanodine receptor antagonists. The TRPM4 channels have a micromolar half-activation concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Nilius et al., 2004</xref>), which implies that a restricted Ca<sup>2+</sup> nanodomain near the channel mouth is required to elicit substantial opening of TRPM4 channels. Thus, whatever the Ca<sup>2+</sup> source that activates the TRPM4 channels, it is likely co-localized with them.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Asymmetric firing on symmetric ramps is modulated by cholinergic activation</title><p>We have previously used 2 and 10 s long triangular-shaped current ramps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Upchurch et al., 2022</xref>) to emulate the depolarizing input received by a place cell during a place field traversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Epsztein et al., 2011</xref>); the amplitude of the ramps was adjusted for each cell to produce peak frequencies between 10 and 25 Hz, as observed in place cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hargreaves et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Resnik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>). Regardless of whether these ramps are injected at the soma or in the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, they elicit fewer spikes on the down-ramp than on the up-ramp, due to adaptation mediated by long-term sodium channel inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Fernandez and White, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Venkatesan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Upchurch et al., 2022</xref>). Place cell firing is modulated by experience such that the center of mass of the place field shifts in a direction opposite the direction of motion as the environment becomes more familiar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Mehta et al., 2000</xref>). This modulation is strongest when animals are first introduced to a novel environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Roth et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting involvement of a novelty signal. Since elevated acetylcholine is thought to be such a signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acquas et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Giovannini et al., 2001</xref>), we investigated the effect of cholinergic neuromodulation on this firing rate adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Carbachol shifts the center of mass of firing in response to depolarizing current ramps.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Somatic recording, control.

This type of response results in a positive value for the normalized difference between spikes fired on the up-ramp versus the down-ramp (we call this an adaptation index, see Materials and methods for definition). A positive index means that neurons fire more on the up-ramp than the down-ramp, whereas a negative value indicates the converse, and is therefore a good metric to determine shifts in the center of mass of the firing of CA1 pyramidal neurons in different conditions. In some trials, under control conditions we applied a baseline depolarization prior to the ramp, in order to capture the variability of the membrane potential observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Harvey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Epsztein et al., 2011</xref>). Application of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh, 2 µM) caused a depolarization of 2–6 mV. We compensated for this depolarization by injecting tonic hyperpolarizing current to reestablish the original membrane potential (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Losonczy et al., 2008</xref>), as indicated by an offset from the 0 pA current level in the traces of the injected current ramps. The amplitude of background fluctuations in the resting membrane potential increased from a few tenths of a mV in control to 2–4 mV in CCh. Moreover, the threshold for action potential generation became more hyperpolarized. For all these reasons, we were not able to consistently vary the membrane potential using baseline depolarizations in the presence of CCh, because baseline depolarization alone frequently evoked spiking. As a result of the increased excitability in CCh, smaller current ramps were sufficient to produce the same peak frequencies as in control (note the difference in the injected ramp currents below the voltage trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A1 vs. B1 and E1 vs. F1</xref>). Under these conditions, CCh caused a shift of the center of mass of firing to later in the ramp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B1 and 1F1</xref>), which resulted in a decreased value of the adaptation index which became negative for most cells, as shown in the scatter plot of group data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and H</xref>). The shift is evident in the plots of the frequency as a function of time (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A2 vs. 1B2 and E2 vs. F2</xref>). As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995</xref>, the raster plots of the spike times were characterized by variability in the timing of action potentials among different trials in the same neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A3, B3, E3 and F3</xref>). However, the variability appears to be independent of the amount of current injected, as demonstrated by trials that are grouped as a function of the injected peak current amplitude. Moreover, the raster plots show how the center of mass of firing overall shifted from early in the ramp in control conditions to later in the ramp in the presence of carbachol. This shift was significant for short (2 s) ramps in the soma (control 0.33±0.02, CCh –0.25±0.03; t(20) = 16.741; p&lt;0.0005; n=21), long (10 s) ramps in the soma (control 0.24±0.02, CCh –0.33±0.06; t(18) = 9.854; p&lt;0.0005; n=19), as well as for short and long ramps in the dendrites (2 s ramps: control 0.49±0.04, CCh –0.45±0.07; t(18) = 12.529; p&lt;0.0005; n=19; 10 s ramps: control 0.37±0.02, CCh –0.16±0.06; t(9) = 10.582; p&lt;0.0005; n=10).</p><p>Plots of instantaneous frequency versus current injection are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C1, C2, G1 and G2</xref>. These plots provide a way to assess firing rate adaptation or acceleration when the injected current is not a square pulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Venugopal et al., 2015</xref>). In control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C1 and G1</xref>), frequencies were higher on the up-ramp (filled circles) and decreased on the down-ramp (open circles) at similar values of injected current. This hysteretic clockwise motion corresponds to spike rate adaptation, in which the firing rate decreases at a constant value of injected current. In contrast, in the presence of CCh, the motion was variable; it could be essentially linear as shown in the somatic example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C2</xref> or even counter-clockwise as in the dendritic example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G2</xref>. The frequency/current (f/I) plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> show the clockwise hysteresis in control and different cases of reversal or removal of adaptation in the presence of CCh for somatic recordings, with panels A and B showing acceleration, and panels C and D showing linearization. A linear motion indicates no hysteresis, although often the neurons fire at lower current injections on the down-ramp (defined as sustained linear in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Venugopal et al., 2015</xref>), whereas counter-clockwise motion corresponds to an acceleration of the firing rate that would be observed during injection of a constant current. Both of these variants correspond to an effective removal of the spike rate adaptation by cholinergic activation. These results also demonstrate that cholinergic activity shifts the center of mass of firing to later times during a symmetric ramp. We speculate that the level of cholinergic modulation could therefore be a source of rapid modification of the timing of place cell firing relative to position in the place field. Our summary results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> show that carbachol similarly affects 2 s and 10 s ramps, and we present only the data for the 2 s ramps for subsequent figures.</p><p>Since the initial membrane potential and the amount of current injected could potentially affect the center of mass of firing, confounding the effects of cholinergic modulation, we plotted the adaptation index as a function of the initial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and of injected current amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), in control conditions and in the presence of carbachol (2 µM) for each trial for all recorded neurons, both for somatic and dendritic recordings. Likewise, since the input resistance of the neuron could potentially skew the center of mass of firing, we plotted the average adaptation index as a function of the steady-state input resistance in control conditions and in the presence of carbachol for each somatic and dendritic recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In all cases, it is apparent that the main factor determining the adaptation index, and therefore whether the center of mass of firing occurs earlier or later in the ramp, is the presence or absence of carbachol rather than initial membrane potential, current injection amplitude, or input resistance.</p><p>The later onset of spiking in CCh in the experiments described above may be attributable to the smaller current ramps, but the persistence of spiking without adaptation is striking in comparison to control. The use of smaller ramps to achieve similar firing rates may be justified by analogy with the presynaptic action of ACh to reduce glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Hasselmo, 2006</xref>). Since the current injection protocols described above only account for the effects of cholinergic agonists on the postsynaptic neuron, we examined the effects of carbachol on synaptically-driven membrane potential ramps, where pre- and postsynaptic effects can be probed at the same time. To this end, we stimulated the Schaffer collateral fibers with bipolar electrodes and recorded the responses from the somata of CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The electrical stimulation consisted of 30 stimuli for a total duration of ~2 s. The stimulation pattern was adjusted according to a linear, symmetric ramp as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>, such that the frequency increased and decreased symmetrically, starting at 6.7 Hz and peaking in the middle of the ramp at 25 Hz, the target peak frequency in the current injection experiments. The intensity of stimulation was adjusted such that neurons would fire in response to 40–65% of the total inputs under control conditions, and was kept constant in control conditions and in the presence of carbachol. In both conditions, firing was more frequent in the middle of the ramp, because of the higher stimulation frequency. However, as in the current injection protocols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, some variability was observed in the timing of the spikes across trials, as can be appreciated in the raster plots. In control conditions, the neurons tended to fire more in the first half of the ramp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), whereas in the presence of carbachol they tended to fire more on the second half of the ramp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The adaptation index was calculated in a similar manner as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, as the normalized difference between the number of spikes in the first and the second half of the ramp. On average, the adaptation index decreased from 0.18±0.03 in control to –0.17±0.04 in the presence of carbachol, t(10) = 6.873, p&lt;0.0005, n=11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This shift was partly due to a decrease in the amplitude of the EPSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>); the average amplitude of the first EPSP in control (8.83±0.82 mV) was significantly larger than the average first EPSP in CCh (6.81±0.52 mV; t(10) = 4.127; p=0.002; n=11). In addition, the decay of the EPSPs appeared to slow down later in the ramp in the presence of CCh (compare EPSPs indicated by diamonds in the two conditions), resulting in an increase in temporal summation and excitability. These results show that carbachol tends to shift the center of mass of firing to later in the ramp in the case of a synaptically driven depolarization as well as in response to a ramp of injected current.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cholinergic modulation of the response to electrical stimulation of Schaffer collaterals, recorded at the soma.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top, synaptic response in control conditions to an input frequency that increases and decreases symmetrically, from 6.7 to 25 Hz, as denoted by the pulses, labeled stim.

To verify that the effects of the endogenous neuromodulator were comparable to those of its synthetic analog, we repeated the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> with different concentrations of acetylcholine. In this and all following sets of experiments, the amplitude of current injection was adjusted for each cell and condition to produce peak frequencies between 10 and 25 Hz as described above. Acetylcholine caused a depolarization of the V<sub>m</sub> in a dose-dependent manner. As before, we compensated for this depolarization by injecting hyperpolarizing current to restore the initial V<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Like carbachol, acetylcholine shifted the center of mass of firing to later in the ramp, albeit to a more moderate degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). A one-way repeated measures ANOVA was carried out to determine if there was an effect on the adaptation index of three concentrations of ACh within the same neurons. The assumption of sphericity was violated, so a Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied (<italic>ε</italic>=0.574). There was a significant effect of ACh on the adaptation index, plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> (control 0.35±0.04; 2 μM ACh 0.14±0.04; 10 μM ACh 0.00±0.06; 15 μM ACh –0.02±0.06; F(1.722, 20.665)=44.360; p&lt;0.0005, n=13). Bonferroni-adjusted post hoc tests demonstrated significant differences between the control condition and all concentrations of ACh (all comparisons p&lt;0.0005), and between the lowest concentration and the subsequent higher concentrations (for 2 µM compared to 10 µM, p=0.001; for 2 µM compared to 15 µM, p=0.01). There was not a significant difference between 10 µM and 15 µM ACh. Due to likely degradation via acetylcholinesterase, we speculate that the actual concentration in the slices is lower than the applied one. CCh is not susceptible to degradation by acetylcholinesterase, and its concentration, which in our experiments is markedly lower than that used in many studies on cholinergic modulation of neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bland et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fisahn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Knauer et al., 2013</xref>), is therefore more consistent, which may explain the more pronounced shift in spiking in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> as compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Nonetheless, our results with ACh suggest that there are concentration-dependent effects of the endogenous neuromodulator on firing rate adaptation.

Although the SK channel clearly contributes to adaptation when the dendrites are stimulated at high frequency (&gt;50 Hz; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Combe et al., 2018</xref>), we have previously examined the contribution of small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) current, M-type potassium current, and A-type potassium current with respect to the asymmetric firing in response to symmetric current ramps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Upchurch et al., 2022</xref>). We found that, in the relatively low range of firing frequencies evoked by this type of stimulation, the adaptation induced by these K<sup>+</sup> currents (including SK) does not play a role in shifting action potentials to earlier times during the ramp. However, cholinergic activation has also been shown to activate a non-specific inward cationic current, I<sub>CAN</sub>, that is thought to be carried by certain TRP channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Guinamard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Reboreda et al., 2011</xref>).

After observing the typical response to CCh, responses to symmetric ramps were recorded while FFA (100 µM) was applied along with CCh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). FFA shifted most action potentials back to the up-ramp as shown in the examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A1–A3 and B1–B3</xref>, effectively reversing the shift triggered by CCh. The differences in adaptation index across the three conditions were found to be significantly different by repeated measures ANOVA in both somatic recordings (control 0.35±0.05, CCh –0.36±0.09, CCh + FFA 0.25±0.06; F(2,16) = 65.835; p&lt;0.0005; n=9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A4</xref>) and dendritic recordings (control 0.52±0.02, CCh –0.54±0.11, CCh + FFA 0.20±0.08; F(2,16) = 60.680; p&lt;0.0005; n=9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B4</xref>). Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons indicated that for somatic recordings, the differences were significantly different between control and CCh (p&lt;0.0005), and between CCh and CCh + FFA (p&lt;0.0005), but not between control and CCh + FFA (p=0.43). For dendritic recordings, the differences were significantly different between control and CCh (p&lt;0.0005), CCh and CCh + FFA (p&lt;0.0005), and control and CCh + FFA (p=0.02). In most cases, the adaptation index reverted to a positive value with the application of FFA from a negative value in CCh alone, and in all cases was closer to the control value with FFA than with CCh alone. The failure of the adaptation index to return to control values in FFA may reflect an incomplete block of TRP channels or an additional effect of CCh. Overall, these data suggest that the shift in the center of mass of firing to later along the ramp that is associated with cholinergic activity is due, in large part, to activation of TRP channels.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cholinergic-associated shift in the timing of firing on ramp is mediated by TRP channels, but notably not TRPC channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Somatic recordings for a two second triangular current ramp injected in the soma in control (<bold>A1</bold>), CCh (2 µM) (<bold>A2</bold>), and CCh + FFA (100 µM) (<bold>A3</bold>) applied subsequently to the same cell.

We first focused on IP<sub>3</sub> receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>Rs), which are activated through mAChRs and G<sub>q</sub> as described above, using the antagonist Xestospongin C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gafni et al., 1997</xref>) in the intracellular solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Since the antagonists rapidly dialyzed into the cytosol, in this figure control data reflect the effect of the antagonists before the addition of CCh. We initially used Xestospongin C at 1 µM, which was previously found to be effective in inhibiting TRPM4 channel activation via mGluRs in neurons of the preBötzinger nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Pace et al., 2007</xref>). Since this concentration was not effective in preventing the cholinergic shift in the center of mass of firing in our experiments, in six out of nine experiments we increased the concentration to 2 µM. Neither concentration of intracellular Xestospongin C appeared to change the firing features in control conditions. The shift induced by carbachol did not appear to depend on the concentration of Xestospongin C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A3</xref>), therefore we averaged the data in these two conditions. The adaptation index still decreased significantly (t(8) = 10.574, p&lt;0.0005; n=9, as per a paired t-test) from 0.31±0.02 in control conditions to –0.38±0.07 in the presence of CCh (2 µM). This result argues strongly against the hypothesis that the effects of the activation of muscarinic receptors on the shift of the center of mass of firing are mediated by activation of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs. Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are also expressed on the endoplasmic reticulum in CA1 pyramidal neurons, and appear to contribute selectively to spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations during LTP at the CA3-CA1 synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Raymond and Redman, 2006</xref>). We therefore tested the hypothesis that the increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in a nanodomain leading to TRPM4 channel activation could be due to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR) through RyRs following Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. In these experiments, we included ryanodine at 40 µM, a concentration known to inhibit RyRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ehrlich et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Isokawa and Alger, 2006</xref>), in the intracellular solution. Notably, one out of nine of the neurons recorded from in these conditions had a slightly negative adaptation index already under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B3</xref>) when RyR were inhibited. Moreover, three more neurons appeared to fire irregularly, with some doublets, under control conditions (an example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), a feature that was not observed in other experimental conditions. This change could be due to the close juxtaposition of RyRs in the endoplasmic reticulum and various K<sup>+</sup> channels on the membrane of CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Vierra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Tedoldi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Sahu and Turner, 2021</xref>).

In order to model the effect of CCh, we added a nanodomain for the spatially restricted Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration which we hypothesize is sensed by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site on TRPM4 channels; also note that, as in the experiments, the amount of injected current is lower for the simulated CCh.

Although the source of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase that activates TRPM4 channels is currently unknown, it likely depends in some way upon the activation of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels during the ramp. We therefore made the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in the nanodomain proportional to the total instantaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> current across the membrane in the model, but only during simulated activation of the muscarinic receptor.

The contribution of the increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the nanodomain was examined by turning off the voltage-dependence of the TRPM4 channel (light blue traces). In this case, the voltage component of TRPM4 channel activation was set to its steady state value at the resting V<sub>m</sub> (see Materials and methods).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>The model explains how activation of TRPM4 channels affects the firing pattern in response to triangular ramps that evoke similar firing frequencies.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simulated voltage traces (top) during a two second triangular current ramp (just below voltage traces). Insets show the reciprocal of the interspike interval (ISI) plotted as the instantaneous frequency at the ISI midpoint. Vertical dashed red line shows the peak of the current ramp. The slower frequencies at similar values of injected current and fewer ISIs on the down-ramp (open circles) versus the up-ramp (closed circles) in control show hysteresis due to adaptation mediated by long-term inactivation of the sodium channel. TRPM4 channel activation causes the center of mass of firing to be shifted to the right in all other traces compared to control because a nanodomain for TRPM4 activation with special access to Ca<sup>2+</sup> was added in simulated CCh. The hysteresis is in the opposite direction because the activation of TRPM4 channels by Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation obscures and overwhelms adaptation. In the light blue traces, the voltage-dependence of TRPM4 activation was not included, so there is less Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in the outer shell in (<bold>B</bold>) and in the nanodomain in (<bold>C</bold>), resulting in less activation of TRPM4 channels in (<bold>D</bold>). In order to isolate the effect of voltage-dependence from that of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> waveforms in all nanodomains were recorded during the full CCh simulation shown in magenta, and played back into each nanodomain Ca<sup>2+</sup> during the simulations shown in purple.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84387-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Simply adding the nanodomain accomplishes the shift in center of mass (compare blue trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> to control trace in black) and removes the adaptation, with a very slight tendency to accelerate the firing. However, without the contribution of the voltage-dependence of TRPM4 channels, the resulting Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is lower than in the original simulation of the effects of CCh (compare the blue traces to the magenta traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B and C</xref>), resulting in less TRPM4 channel activation (compare the blue trace to the magenta trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>) and therefore fewer total spikes. To determine the contribution of the positive feedback loop by which Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry recruits more Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via additional spiking and depolarization, we recorded the Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces in each nanodomain (one for each segment of every section in NEURON, see Methods) of the original CCh simulation (magenta trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). We then used this Ca<sup>2+</sup> trace as the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the nanodomain during simulations with the voltage dependence removed as described above. The purple trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> shows that the positive feedback loop added two spikes (16 in the purple trace versus 14 in the blue trace) by slightly increasing the frequency during the spike train and allowing spiking to continue longer. The f/I plot shows a little more acceleration of the firing rate. The purple trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> shows that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the outermost shell is slightly different than both the blue and magenta traces, reflecting the different numbers of spikes. Note that the purple and magenta traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref> are identical because the magenta trace for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the nanodomain (original CCh simulation) was input to the nanodomain in the simulations shown in purple in the other panels. The additional TRPM4 channel activation (compare purple to blue trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>) results from the increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the nanodomain. Adding the full voltage-dependence to the TRPM4 channel slightly raises the overall level of TRPM4 channel activation. The voltage-dependence also allows for fast excursions in channel activation that could contribute to action potential initiation (compare magenta trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref> to the blue and purple ones). The voltage-dependence contributes one additional spike (17 in the magenta trace versus 16 in the purple trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) and accentuates spike rate acceleration due to the positive feedback loop, as shown in the f/I curves.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Evidence for tight coupling between TRPM4 channels and the calcium source that activates them</title><p>In order to test experimentally the model prediction that the highly localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in a nanodomain next to the TRPM4 channels gives rise to the CCh-mediated shift in the center of mass of firing, the calcium chelator BAPTA was included in the recording pipette, and somatic recordings obtained before and during addition of CCh. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, control data reflect the effect of BAPTA before the addition of CCh, rather than control data such as in previous figures, because the dialysis occurred quickly. As in previous sets of experiments, the amount of current injected was chosen in order to achieve a target firing frequency of 10–25 Hz. With intracellular dialysis of BAPTA, the current needed to reach these frequencies was consistently higher in these experiments (compare scale bars of injected current to those in previous figures). In addition, intracellular dialysis with BAPTA tended to shift the firing earlier in the ramp, with fewer spikes on the down-ramp, therefore making the adaptation index closer to 1. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref> , 10 mM BAPTA was included in the internal solution. As previously noted, the addition of CCh in the bath caused a depolarization that was compensated for by the injecting hyperpolarizing current. Moreover, despite the presence of BAPTA, the adaptation index became significantly smaller in the presence of CCh, as per a paired t-test (control 0.82±0.05, CCh –0.12±0.11; t(9) = 8.594; p&lt;0.0005; n=10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A3</xref>); therefore, 10 mM BAPTA did not prevent the cholinergic-mediated shift. It has been shown that a higher concentration of BAPTA may be required to prevent TRPM4 channel activation in neurons of the preBötzinger nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Pace et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Picardo et al., 2019</xref>), therefore, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, BAPTA in the internal solution was increased to 30 mM. With a free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> of 100 nM (see Materials and methods), CCh never produced negative adaptation indices that were seen in previous figures, although the V<sub>m</sub> did depolarize and was restored by the injection of tonic hyperpolarizing current. CCh still had a significant effect on the adaptation index, as per a paired t-test (control 0.62±0.05, CCh 0.37±0.06; t(7) = 5.069; p=0.001; n=8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B3</xref>). However, when the free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was adjusted to 10 nM in the presence of intracellular 30 mM BAPTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>), the adaptation index did not change significantly when CCh was applied in the bath (control 0.73±0.03, CCh 0.76±0.03; t(11) = 0.776; p=0.45; n=12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C3</xref>). In addition, the depolarization normally observed in the presence of CCh did not occur in these conditions, and the amount of injected current was comparable to that injected in control. These data demonstrate that a concentration of BAPTA higher than the typical value (10 mM) used to disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Harney et al., 2006</xref>) is required to prevent TRPM4 channel activation, and that free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> of &lt;100 nM is necessary to disrupt TRPM4 channel activation.

All underlying state variables (ion concentrations, channel open fractions) are accessible so that mechanisms can be positively identified, facilitating design of experiments to test the putative mechanisms.</p><p>In this study we show that: (1) muscarinic receptor activation shifts the center of mass of firing from earlier to later during a depolarizing ramp, through (2) activation of I<sub>CAN</sub> mediated by TRP channels, most likely of the TRPM4 subtype; (3) the shift is not affected by the inhibition of either IP<sub>3</sub>Rs or RyRs, arguing against a role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> released from the endoplasmic reticulum in this process; (4) multicompartmental modeling suggests a close physical relationship between the source of Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase and the TRPM4 channels; (5) the model prediction is supported by recordings showing that a very high concentration of BAPTA (30 mM), combined with buffering [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> at 10 nM are required to prevent the cholinergic-mediated rightward shift.</p><p>More broadly, our results suggest that some rapid changes to place cell firing could be triggered via neuromodulation of intrinsic excitability, in addition to and distinct from longer lasting experience-dependent changes that are brought about by synaptic and structural plasticity. Specifically, we speculate that increasing levels of ACh could lead to forward shifts in place cell firing, whereas decreasing levels of ACh could contribute to backwards shifts.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mystery current identified</title><p>Muscarinic activation of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent nonselective cation current in rat CA1 pyramidal neurons has been known for nearly three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Colino and Halliwell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Fraser and MacVicar, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dasari et al., 2017</xref>). A previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Yamada-Hanff and Bean, 2013</xref> found that in mouse CA1 neurons as well, muscarinic stimulation not only inhibits background potassium currents but also activates a nonselective cation current. They found that the latter effect was dominant and in fact converted CA1 pyramidal neurons into pacemakers with the application of 5–25 μM acetylcholine, 5–25 μM carbachol, or 5–10 μM oxotremorine-M. They suggested TRPC channels might mediate this current but were unable to positively identify the source of the nonselective cation current. Based on our results, this unidentified channel could be the TRPM4 channel. We show that TRPM4 channels primarily mediate a nonspecific Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated cation current evoked by cholinergic modulation in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Our model shows that the activation of TRPM4 channels contribute an additional inward current that activates and deactivates slowly upon depolarization. In the case of synaptically driven depolarizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), this inward current, with its slow kinetics (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) is likely to cause an increased decay time of the EPSPs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This aspect has likely implications for synaptic integration by these neurons, as shown by the observation of an impairment of LTP in TRPM4 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Menigoz et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>One of our most surprising findings was that TRPC channels did not seem to play a role in cholinergic modulation of the firing pattern along a triangular ramp. TRPC channels have been implicated in cholinergic signaling via direct activation by DAG, one of the two bioactive molecules generated by PLC hydrolysis of PIP<sub>2</sub> (the other being IP<sub>3</sub>). Cholinergic-associated persistent firing, whereby neurons continue to fire after a depolarizing stimulus has ceased, has been attributed to activation of TRPC channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arboit et al., 2020</xref>). However, the presence of cholinergic-induced persistent firing in TRPC knockout mice has called this into question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Egorov et al., 2019</xref>). In a recent study, TRPM4 channels were found to be involved in persistent firing generated upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via T-type channels in thalamic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">O’Malley et al., 2020</xref>). Delayed bursting in a subtype of cerebellar granular cells was also shown to be mediated by TRPM4 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Masoli et al., 2020</xref>). Our study therefore provides further evidence regarding the role of these channels in the control of neuronal firing, possibly including persistent firing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Nanodomain resulting from colocalization of cholinergic-induced increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and TRPM4 channels</title><p>In HEK cells transfected with cDNA encoding TRPM4 channels, and in cardiac myocytes, activation of TRPM4 channels is secondary to IP<sub>3</sub> receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Launay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Gonzales et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Gonzales and Earley, 2012</xref>), suggesting that TRPM4 channels in myocytes are activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores. Furthermore, in situ proximity ligation assay was used to demonstrate co-localization of TRPM4 channels and IP<sub>3</sub>Rs in human detrusor smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Provence et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, in neurons of the preBötzinger nucleus TRPM4 channels are recruited by metabotropic glutamate receptors to generate robust inspiratory drive potentials through IP<sub>3</sub>R activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Pace et al., 2007</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER was not involved in the cholinergic shift of the center of mass of firing, since neither the IP<sub>3</sub>R antagonist Xestospongin C (1–2 µM) nor the RyR antagonist ryanodine (40 µM) prevented the effects of carbachol. Therefore, although the mechanisms that produce the micromolar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] increases needed for TRPM4 channel activation are unknown, our results point to these channels acting as coincidence detectors, requiring both muscarinic receptor activation and depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx during the ramp to be activated.</p><p>Our modeling results imply that, upon activation of muscarinic receptors, TRPM4 channels have privileged access to a nanodomain in order to achieve the micromolar concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> necessary for their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Nilius et al., 2004</xref>), since microdomains (like the multicompartmental model’s outer shell) only achieve submicromolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Fakler and Adelman, 2008</xref>). The affinity of TRPM4 channels for Ca<sup>2+</sup> is heavily dependent on the availability of PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Nilius et al., 2006</xref>) and binding of ATP and calmodulin or PKC-dependent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Nilius et al., 2005</xref>), which all function to increase the sensitivity of TRPM4 channels for Ca<sup>2+</sup>. If under our conditions, the dependence of TRPM4 channels on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] has a much lower EC<sub>50</sub> and/or is much steeper than in the model we implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Nilius et al., 2004</xref>), perhaps the nanomolar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the outer shell could be sufficient to activate TRPM4 channels. However, the experimental result that 30 mM BAPTA was required to block the TRPM4 channels’ access to Ca<sup>2+</sup> argues for a spatially restricted nanodomain. In a previous study, we found that intracellular BAPTA at a concentration 5 mM can mimic SK channel block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Combe et al., 2018</xref>), presumably by interfering with the calcium activation of those channels. The requirement of using 30 mM BAPTA while buffering free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to 10 nM in order to prevent TRPM4 channel activation suggests that TRPM4 channels are activated by a more spatially restricted Ca<sup>2+</sup> domain than SK channels.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Convergence of pharmacological blockers</title><p>One caveat for our experimental results is that TRP channel blockers, like most drugs, have been reported to have some non-specific effects. In cardiac cells, both CBA and 9-phenanthrol have been shown to decrease the Ito1 potassium current, attributed to Kv4.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Veress et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dienes et al., 2021</xref>) and a late sodium current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dienes et al., 2021</xref>). Kv4.3 is likely more important in interneurons than in pyramidal cells in the CA1 area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Martina et al., 1998</xref>), and neither of the two currents are affected by FFA at the concentration we used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Guinamard et al., 2013</xref>). The other reported non-specific effects do not overlap between the three blockers, flufenamic acid, CBA and 9-phenanthrol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Simard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Guinamard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Veress et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dienes et al., 2021</xref>). The convergent effects of these three distinct drugs implicate TRPM4 channels as the most probable effector of the CCh-mediated modulation of the center of mass of firing. A similar pharmacological approach was used to implicate TRPM4 channel activation in subthreshold oscillations underlying pacemaker firing of chemosensory neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Li et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Diverse cholinergic effects on CA1 pyramidal neurons</title><p>In CA1 pyramidal neurons, ACh binding to muscarinic receptors results in neuromodulation of neuronal excitability and presynaptic release probability. In our study, focused mainly on intrinsic properties, the predominant effect of ACh and CCh was to activate TRPM4 channels; however, the effect of ACh on CA1 pyramidal cells in vivo is multipronged. Muscarinic receptors are known to suppress several K<sup>+</sup> currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Halliwell and Adams, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Hoffman and Johnston, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Buchanan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Giessel and Sabatini, 2010</xref>). The effects of ACh on SK, M-type currents and I<sub>CAN</sub> are mediated by M<sub>1</sub> (G<sub>q</sub>-coupled) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dasari and Gulledge, 2011</xref>). Synaptic depression of Schaffer collateral inputs to CA1 is mediated by M<sub>4</sub> (G<sub>i</sub>-coupled) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dasari and Gulledge, 2011</xref>) located on presynaptic glutamatergic terminals, and synaptic depression of temporoammonic pathway glutamatergic inputs to CA1 is mediated by M<sub>3</sub> (G<sub>q</sub>-coupled) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Palacios-Filardo et al., 2021</xref>). When we used a synaptically driven depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), decreased release from Schaffer collateral was indicated by the smaller amplitude EPSPs in the presence of CCh. In these experiments, as in the current injection protocols, the center of mass of firing occurred earlier in the ramp in control and shifted to later in the ramp in the presence of CCh, suggesting that a combination of pre- and postsynaptic effects of cholinergic agonists can contribute to the shift. Moreover, the cholinergic down-regulation of these afferents justifies the use of smaller depolarizing current injection ramps in our recordings in the presence of carbachol, because less current injection is required to produce the same output frequencies due to enhanced intrinsic excitability in carbachol.</p><p>In a model of place field formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Savelli and Knierim, 2010</xref>), if a neuron randomly fires within a place field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>), its inputs from the currently active grid cells are strengthened and the input from those grid cells onto silent cells are weakened. Previously, ACh was thought to act in a manner consistent with volume transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dannenberg et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, this view has been challenged by the finding that all hippocampal cholinergic terminals form synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Takács et al., 2018</xref>), and vesicles dock only at synapses. Since cholinergic neuromodulation of TRPM4 channels greatly increases excitability in CA1 pyramidal cells, selective synaptic ACh inputs may underlie the formation of place fields in a novel environment. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Takács et al., 2018</xref> found that the ACh terminals co-released GABA in separate vesicles, and that ACh acting on M<sub>2</sub> (G<sub>i</sub>-coupled) autoreceptors on cholinergic terminals inhibited the release of both ACh and GABA. Future work is required to disentangle the distinct effects of ACh acting at the various muscarinic receptors (M<sub>1</sub>-M<sub>5</sub>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Acetylcholine, novelty and place field shifts</title><p>Acetylcholine acting at muscarinic receptors has been hypothesized to be a global novelty signal in the dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Gómez-Ocádiz et al., 2022</xref>), dorsal hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Huff et al., 2022</xref>), and the parahippocampal gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Frank and Kafkas, 2021</xref>). A novel unconditioned stimulus caused a large increase in ACh extracellular levels in the hippocampus, but little locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acquas et al., 1996</xref>). On the other hand, hippocampal ACh release in an animal placed in a novel environment has two components, one related to novelty, that disappears in a familiar environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Thiel et al., 1998</xref>), and one related to motor activity, associated with increased exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Giovannini et al., 2001</xref>). Indeed, a recent fiber photometric study showed that part of the population activity in medial septal cholinergic neurons is correlated with the logarithm of running speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Kopsick et al., 2022</xref>). We are primarily interested in the component of the ACh signal related to novelty because of previous studies demonstrating modulation of place cell firing that was more pronounced during the first day in a novel environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Roth et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In vivo recordings in rats demonstrated that place fields expand and the center of mass shifts backward with respect to the direction of travel on continuous tracks over several laps during each recording session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Mehta et al., 2000</xref>). This phenomenon was predicted by modeling studies that implemented Hebbian plasticity in the form of NMDA-mediated LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Blum, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Blum and Abbott, 1996</xref>), whereby spatially tuned input gradually strengthens over repeated traversals of a place field, causing a CA1 place cell to fire earlier in the place field. NMDA blockers were subsequently shown to occlude the backwards shift of the place field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ekstrom et al., 2001</xref>) and an NMDA agonist partially restored it in aged rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Burke et al., 2008</xref>). Calcium imaging in mice running on a treadmill in a virtual environment showed an abrupt backward shift in place cell firing (relative to where the first episode of place field firing occurred) during the first exposure to a novel environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Priestley et al., 2022</xref>), as well as much smaller backward shifts in place fields in novel environments that leveled off as the animals became more familiar with the environment during subsequent exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dong et al., 2021</xref>). These backwards shifts, which were much larger than those observed previously and attributed to Hebbian plasticity, were ascribed to behavioral time scale plasticity, which is also dependent on NMDA receptor activation, and strengthens glutamatergic inputs active during an asymmetric seconds-long window skewed towards synapses activated before a burst triggered by a dendritic plateau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Despite the ability of elegant theories of synaptic plasticity to account for backward shifts in the center of mass of the place field, forward shifts have also been observed. Forward shifting of the center of mass of place field firing occurred, shifting toward prospective goal locations in the continuous T-maze alternation task as a reward was approached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, task-specific demands may allow for the modulation of firing fields by neuromodulators such as ACh and dopamine. In a study that did not involve reward, but only exploration of a novel virtual linear maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dong et al., 2021</xref>), the center of mass of CA1 place fields in laps 2–4 were forward shifted compared to the first lap, for cells that already had a place field on the first lap (a lap required approximately 25 s). Laps 5 and beyond were backward shifted compared to the immediately preceding lap, so averaging over all runs, the place field was shifted backwards. Perhaps the neuromodulatory environment, including cholinergic tone, was different during the first four laps. The data in that study indicated that backward shifting in CA1 in a novel environment is due to a combination of place field expansion, skewness and translation of the point at which peak firing occurs. They suggested that since skewness and width dynamics are inconsistent across studies, multiple mechanisms may be involved in place field shifting.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Ideas and speculations: Implications of our results for place fields in intact rodents</title><p>Our results suggest that increasing levels of ACh could lead to forward shifts in place field center of mass whereas decreasing levels of ACh could contribute to backwards shifts. Since cholinergic activity in CA1 is elevated when animals encounter novel environments, our results with CCh could correspond to an initial encounter with a novel environment, where firing of an existing place cell is shifted ‘forward’ or later during the depolarizing ramp that simulates spatially tuned input. Our control conditions, then, would be analogous to lower cholinergic tone, occurring as an animal becomes familiar with an environment, and the associated “backward” shift earlier in the depolarizing ramp. The rapid modulation of ion channels by removal of cholinergic tone could therefore provide a possible mechanism for the rapid shifting of place cell firing in a novel versus familiar environment, perhaps complementary to Hebbian plasticity that develops over time.</p><p>If our hypothesis is correct, optogenetic silencing of medial septum cholinergic afferents to CA1 during runs through a place field in a novel environment should partially occlude backwards shifts in place field center on subsequent runs that are due to diminished ACh in a familiar environment. Optogenetic stimulation of the same afferents during runs in a familiar environment should induce forward shifts in place field centers. Behaviorally, it could be informative to design experiments to test the effects of these manipulations on the animal’s subjective sense of position, for example, demonstrated by overshoot or undershoot locations where the animal has been trained to pause.</p><p>There is a growing realization that there may be multiple mechanisms for place field shifting in addition to the well-known mechanisms for backwards shifts dependent on Hebbian plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Blum and Abbott, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ekstrom et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Burke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Roth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Mehta et al., 2000</xref>) or, more recently, behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Priestley et al., 2022</xref>). We propose that neuromodulation of intrinsic properties by ACh, and potentially other neuromodulators like dopamine, provide an additional level of modulatory control in parallel with synaptic plasticity mechanisms, contributing to rapid place field shifts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

according to protocols developed by following guidelines on the responsible use of laboratory animals in research from the National Institutes of Health and approved by the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center-New Orleans Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, internal protocol numbers 3583 and 3851). Animals were housed in pairs, whenever possible; in the event of single housing, Bed-r’nest pucks (Andersons Lab Bedding) were provided for enrichment purposes.</p><p>For these experiments, 400-µm-thick slices were prepared from 7- to 11-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Combe et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, rats were deeply anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine (90 and 10 mg/kg, respectively), until the disappearance of the toe-pinch and palpebral reflexes. After trans-cardiac perfusion with ice-cold solution, decapitation, and rapid removal of the brains, transverse hippocampal slices were cut using a vibratome. Slices were then transferred to a chamber filled with an oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing, in mM: NaCl 125, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25, KCl 2.5, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.25, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2, dextrose 25, ascorbate 1, sodium pyruvate 3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Patch clamp electrophysiology</title><p>After recovery, individual slices were transferred to a submerged recording chamber, and superfused with ACSF at about 2 ml/min; the solution was warmed through an inline heater and measured to keep it at a temperature of 34–36°C in the chamber.</p><p>CA1 pyramidal cells were identified via differential interference contrast-infrared video microscopy. Whole-cell current clamp recordings were made using Dagan BVC 700 A amplifiers in the active ‘bridge’ mode. Recording pipettes were filled with an internal solution that contained, in mM: potassium methanesulphonate 125, KCl 20, HEPES 10, EGTA 0.5, NaCl 4, Mg<sub>2</sub>ATP 4, Tris<sub>2</sub>GTP 0.3, phosphocreatine 14. The electrode resistance was 1–3 MΩ for somatic recordings and 3–5 MΩ for dendritic recordings. Series resistance was monitored throughout the recordings and was usually less than 20 MΩ; recordings were discarded when series resistance reached 25 MΩ or 30 MΩ, for somatic and dendritic recordings, respectively. Cells with resting membrane potentials depolarized beyond –60 mV at break-in were discarded.</p><p>To investigate the contribution of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling to TRPM4 channel activation and the cholinergic shift in the center of mass of firing, in some sets of experiments, the internal patch clamp solution was modified as follows. In some experiments, EGTA was replaced by higher concentrations (10 or 30 mM) of the faster Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator BAPTA tetra-potassium salt. When 30 mM BAPTA was included, 0.69 mM or 5.7 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> was added to the internal solution to give 10 or 100 nM free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], respectively, at 33 °C, pH 7.3 and an overall ionic concentration of 300 mM, according to the online program MAXCHELATOR, WEBMAXC EXTENDED version (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://somapp.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/pharmacology/bers/maxchelator/webmaxc/webmaxcE.htm">https://somapp.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/pharmacology/bers/maxchelator/webmaxc/webmaxcE.htm</ext-link>). In other experiments, Xestospongin C (1–2 µM) or ryanodine (40 µM) were added to the internal patch clamp solution to block IP<sub>3</sub>Rs and RyRs, respectively. Xestospongin C and ryanodine were dissolved in DMSO; in this case the [DMSO] in the final solution was ≤0.2% due to the limited solubility of these compounds. As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Pace et al., 2007</xref>, Xestospongin C was added to the standard intracellular solution immediately prior to use and discarded after 2 hr. In all these cases, intracellular dialysis appeared to take effect quickly, so the control data refer to the effect of the modified internal solution. Nonetheless, dialysis was allowed for at least 20 min in these experiments to make sure that the drug could diffuse into distal compartments.</p><p>NBQX (10 µM), DL-APV (50 µM), Gabazine (12.5 µM) and CGP55845 (1 µM) were applied in the external solution in all experiments, except those in which the Schaffer Collateral fibers were electrically stimulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), to block glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, respectively, in order to isolate the contribution of the intrinsic ion channels to the ramp responses. Carbachol (2 µM), acetylcholine (2, 10, or 15 µM), flufenamic acid (100 µM), SKF96365 (50 µM), CBA (50 µM), and 9-phenanthrol (100 µM) were added to the external solution as needed, from stock solutions made with water, DMSO, or ethanol; the concentration of ethanol or DMSO in the final solution was ≤0.1%. Carbachol, 9-phenanthrol, and CBA were purchased from Tocris, CGP55845 and Xestospongin C from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), DL-APV and ryanodine from HelloBio (Princeton, NJ), NBQX, Gabazine, and SKF96365 from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel), and acetylcholine, flufenamic acid, and K4-BAPTA from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).</p><p>In order to approximate the depolarizing input that place cells receive as an animal traverses the place field, ramp-shaped depolarizing current injections were applied via the recording electrode to CA1 pyramidal neurons at either the soma or the apical dendrite (150–250 µm from soma). Two second ramps (1 s up, 1 s down) and ten second ramps (5 s up, 5 s down) were applied to simulate different running speeds. Current amplitude was adjusted to evoke peak frequencies between 10 and 25 Hz, comparable to place cell firing as recorded in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hargreaves et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Resnik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Electrical stimulation was achieved by delivering constant current pulses through a tungsten bipolar electrode placed in the stratum radiatum of area CA1 to stimulate the Schaffer collateral fibers from CA3 pyramidal neurons. The instantaneous input frequency of stimulation was adjusted according to a linear, symmetric ramp (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>). The total duration of the ramp was ~2 s and the peak frequency at the center of the ramp was 25 Hz, our target for the maximum peak frequency in the ramp current injections (see above). The intensity of stimulation was adjusted such that neurons would fire in response to 40–65% of the total inputs and kept constant in control conditions and in the presence of carbachol. For each neuron and condition, we averaged the trials where the neurons did not fire in response to the first pulse in the synaptic ramp and the amplitude of the EPSPs was measured to estimate the degree of cholinergic modulation of presynaptic release. Antagonists of synaptic transmitter receptors were omitted in these experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental design and statistical analyses</title><p>Experimental data were recorded and analyzed with Igor Pro software (WaveMetrics).

For synaptically driven membrane potential ramps, the adaptation index was calculated in a similar manner, where the up-ramp consisted of the first 15 (out of 30) stimuli. An adaptation index of zero indicates symmetry in the number of action potentials on the up-ramp and the down-ramp. Plots of instantaneous frequency versus time (f/t) or current (f/I) use the time or current value at the midpoint of the interspike interval (ISI), respectively. Current amplitude is relative to tonic baseline current. Raster plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> show the timing of action potential firing for several trials in control conditions and in the presence of carbachol, where time = 0 indicates the beginning of the ramp.

Each experimental group in this study is made up of n≥8 recording sessions; the number of cells recorded for each experiment is indicated in the Results section. Recordings were from one cell per slice; typically, a maximum of three recordings were obtained for each animal. Biological replicates (recording from different cells) were n≥8 for each experiment and (recordings from different animals) n≥6 for each experiment.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed in SPSS (IBM, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002865">SCR_002865</ext-link>), following the tutorials and software guide from Laerd Statistics (2015, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://statistics.laerd.com/">https://statistics.laerd.com/</ext-link>). Comparisons were made in the same cell before and during pharmacological treatment; the summary plots for these data include individual points and means ± standard error of the mean. Parametric analyses (paired samples t-test and repeated-measures ANOVA) were used to compare treatments in the same neurons, since data were normally distributed as determined by the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality. Significant differences demonstrated by repeated measures ANOVA were followed up by post-hoc analysis using Bonferroni-corrected pair-wise comparisons. Differences were considered to be statistically significant when p&lt;0.05. Outliers, as assessed by boxplots, were not removed from analysis. To check the effect of the outliers, analyses were also performed after removing outliers, and with non-parametric tests keeping the outliers. The significance did not change, and for consistency, the results of parametric tests are reported with all data included.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Computational modeling</title><p>A multicompartmental CA1 pyramidal neuron model from our laboratory was used as a starting point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Upchurch et al., 2022</xref>).

We injected enough current into the model to hold the membrane potential at –60 mV long enough for all transients to equilibrate before injecting a two second temporally symmetric current ramp in the soma. The amplitude of the ramp was adjusted to reach similar peak frequencies as in the experiments, 10–25 Hz.</p><p>The persistent current during the interspike intervals determines the spike frequency. In order to focus on the rate determining currents in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>, we removed points from the traces during spiking by eliminating points at which the absolute value of the first temporal derivative of the current trace exceeded 0.005 μA/ms•cm<sup>2</sup> for the net current, 0.15 μA/ms•cm<sup>2</sup> for the TRPM4 current, and 0.2 μA/ms•cm<sup>2</sup> for the Na<sub>V</sub> current.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: J. Julius Zhu (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It has been shown recently that the asymmetric firing of CA1 place cells is due to synaptic weight changes resulting from synaptic plasticity (e.g., Bittner et al., 2017). This suggests that the asymmetric firing of place cells is primarily the result of asymmetric synaptic input. Therefore, the authors should test whether carbachol similarly affects a synaptically driven membrane potential ramp.</p><p>2) It has been shown before that the precision of spike timing depends on the stimulation pattern in vitro (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995). The authors could add noise to their current stimulus and observe the effect on the AP firing patterns. If this is not possible, the authors should at least report the sweep-to-sweep variability for the data shown, e.g., in panels 1A2, 1B2, 1D2, and 1E2.</p><p>3) In most of the data presented in this manuscript, Carbachol appears to induce a 3 mV hyperpolarization and increase input resistance. As a result, the amount of current injected during Carbachol is drastically lower than during the controls. This should be emphasized more, and the input resistance should be quantified for each experimental condition. It should also be discussed whether this change in input resistance can account for the changes in the firing pattern observed. Finally, it should be clearly stated how the amount of the current injected was chosen for each cell, and data from a range of injected current ramps should be shown for each cell.</p><p>4) How the current result that TRPM4 channels can mediate the firing pattern change relates to the previous finding that the current injection evoked CA1 neuronal firing pattern is due to long-term Na channel inactivation (Upchurch, 2017, JNeurosci). What is the connection?</p><p>5) To validate the role of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in regulating TRPM, depletion of ER ca<sup>2+</sup> pool with SERCA inhibitor (e.g. thapsigargin) would be a more direct way to test the model (also make sure to add TRPC inhibitor to avoid the store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Only panels 1A2, 1B2, 1D3, and 1E2 include x-axes that show the actual current values; in all the other figures, such axes are absent, which makes it hard to decipher the amount of current injected. Please change the plots in all the other figures to match the ones in figure 1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>To argue the cholinergic involvement in backwards shifts, the authors need first to show the cholinergic effect on down-ramp shifts. So far, the reported data (e.g., figure 1) imply that higher membrane potential, larger injected current, and longer duration (as shown in Epsztein et al. 2011 Neuron) all would cause larger increases in up-ramp firing, consistent with the authors' conclusion that activation of I<sub>CAN</sub> is slow, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> and voltage-dependent. If the authors believe otherwise, they should carry out more rigorous experiments using the physiological resting membrane potential, current strength, and duration and with the parameters properly controlled. In addition, they need to provide direct evidence to show increased acetylcholine release during backwards firing shifts and validate the cholinergic effect with optogenetic activation and inhibition. Alternatively, the authors might want to remove this claim.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84387.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It has been shown recently that the asymmetric firing of CA1 place cells is due to synaptic weight changes resulting from synaptic plasticity (e.g., Bittner et al., 2017).

We think that this is a very effective way of showing how the center of mass of firing shifts from early to late in the ramp in the presence of carbachol, and therefore we added the raster plots in the new Figure 2 as well, to report sweep-to-sweep variability under the inherently noisier conditions of synaptic stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In most of the data presented in this manuscript, Carbachol appears to induce a 3 mV hyperpolarization and increase input resistance.

We now clarify on page 5 (lines 113-125) of the manuscript as follows:</p><p>“In some trials, under control conditions, we applied a baseline depolarization prior to the ramp, in order to capture the variability observed in vivo (Harvey et al. Nature 461:941–946, 2009; Epsztein et al. Neuron 70:109–120, 2011). Application of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh, 2 µM) caused a depolarization of 2-6 mV. We compensated for this depolarization by injecting tonic hyperpolarizing current to reestablish the original membrane potential (see also Losonczy, et al., Nature 452, 436-442, 2008), as indicated by an offset from the 0 pA current level in the traces of the injected current ramps. The amplitude of background fluctuations in the resting membrane potential increased from a few tenths of a mV in control to 2-4 mV in CCh. Moreover, the threshold for action potential generation became more hyperpolarized. For all these reasons, we were not able to consistently vary the membrane potential using baseline depolarizations in the presence of CCh, because baseline depolarization alone frequently evoked spiking.”</p><p>For this reason, many of the carbachol example traces in the initial submission had more hyperpolarized V<sub>m</sub> than their control counterparts. Acetylcholine also caused a depolarization in a dose-dependent manner, that was compensated for in the same way.</p><p>In this new version of the manuscript, we systematically report the effects of cholinergic agonists on membrane potential and neuronal excitability. Further, we show example traces with resting membrane potentials within 1 mV for each pharmacological comparison, therefore removing this variable and hopefully making results clearer. We also now state how the amount of injected current was chosen for each condition, and that the amount of injected current was generally lower in the presence of cholinergic agonists. Both the tonic hyperpolarizing current and the amplitude of the injected ramp for each example can now be appreciated in each figure.</p><p>Finally, the reviewers’ comment also made us realize that, in principle, the center of mass of firing could be systematically skewed by the initial membrane potential, the amplitude of the current ramp injection and/or the input resistance. For this reason, we added a supplementary figure (1-2) where the adaptation index was plotted as a function of each these variables. In all cases, it is apparent that the main factor determining whether the center of mass of firing is shifted earlier or later in the ramp is the presence or absence of carbachol rather than initial membrane potential, current injection amplitude, or input resistance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) How the current result that TRPM4 channels can mediate the firing pattern change relates to the previous finding that the current injection evoked CA1 neuronal firing pattern is due to long-term Na channel inactivation (Upchurch, 2017, JNeurosci). What is the connection?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion, which helps to clarify our initial results. New Figure 8 addresses the connection between long-term inactivation of Na<sup>+</sup> channels and the activation of TRPM4 channels, as characterized by the model (see Results lines 375-391). Furthermore, the model was instrumental in assessing how the ca<sup>2+</sup> and voltage-dependence of TRPM4 channels synergize to contribute to the shift in the center of mass of firing (Figure 9). Figure 9 illustrates the positive feedback loop between ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and the additional depolarization produced by ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of TRPM4 channels that can potentially accelerate firing (see Results lines 392-427).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) To validate the role of ER ca<sup>2+</sup> release in regulating TRPM, depletion of ER ca<sup>2+</sup> pool with SERCA inhibitor (e.g. thapsigargin) would be a more direct way to test the model (also make sure to add TRPC inhibitor to avoid the store-operated ca<sup>2+</sup> entry).</p></disp-quote><p>For this resubmission, we have thoroughly investigated the role of the ER ca<sup>2+</sup> pool, as suggested by the reviewers. Since reviewer 2 also suggested to pharmacologically dissect the role of IP<sub>3</sub> vs ryanodine receptors, we have added a new figure to discuss these results. To our surprise, neither the IP<sub>3</sub>R antagonist, Xestospongin C (1-2 µM), nor the RyR antagonist ryanodine (40 µM) were effective in preventing the cholinergic shift of the center of mass of firing when added to the intracellular solution, as shown in new Figure 6 (see Results lines 311-340).</p><p>We also performed numerous pilot experiments using alternative approaches to assess the contribution of the ER ca<sup>2+</sup> pool to the cholinergic-mediated activation of TRPM4 channels and the shift of the center of mass of firing to later in the ramp. In particular, we hypothesized that IP<sub>3</sub>R and/or RyR agonists could mimic the effect of CCh and that antagonists would prevent its effect.

These experiments further confirm the data presented in Figure 6, but we chose to focus only on one pharmacological agent each for IP<sub>3</sub>Rs and RyRs for inclusion in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Only panels 1A2, 1B2, 1D3, and 1E2 include x-axes that show the actual current values; in all the other figures, such axes are absent, which makes it hard to decipher the amount of current injected. Please change the plots in all the other figures to match the ones in figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this recommendation, we have modified all the experimental figures and we now show the actual current values injected for each cell in the figures, rather than the current amplitude relative to the holding current, as was presented in the initial submission. To this end, we have expanded the traces of injected ramp currents and plotted them as the absolute level of current injected, as referred to the 0 pA level. In this way, we think it is easier to estimate already at a glance the differences in the amount of current injected among the various treatments, as well as the tonic current that has to be injected in the presence of CCh or ACh to maintain the V<sub>m</sub> at similar levels as in control conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>To argue the cholinergic involvement in backwards shifts, the authors need first to show the cholinergic effect on down-ramp shifts. So far, the reported data (e.g., figure 1) imply that higher membrane potential, larger injected current, and longer duration (as shown in Epsztein et al. 2011 Neuron) all would cause larger increases in up-ramp firing, consistent with the authors' conclusion that activation of ICAN is slow, and ca<sup>2+</sup> and voltage-dependent.

Alternatively, the authors might want to remove this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment appears to be in line with some of the points raised above, in which reviewers expressed concern regarding the effect of CCh on membrane potential as well as the choice of the amplitude of injected current, and ramp length. We believe that the majority of these concerns were caused by our inadequate explanation and presentation of example traces in the first submission, and the lack of emphasis in the text on how the current injection amplitude was adjusted. Previous and new figures have been designed to clearly show V<sub>m</sub>, tonic current injection and ramp amplitude, and the text has been modified accordingly. As for ramp length, when determining the duration of the current injections for our ramps, we relied on the data recorded in vivo in freely moving rats (Epsztein et al. Neuron 70:109–120, 2011) or in head-fixed mice running on spherical a treadmill immersed in virtual reality (Harvey et al. Nature 461:941–946, 2009). In those papers, the voltage deflections are shown as a function of time, and gray bars or boxes represent the time the animals spend traversing the place field. We interpret those figures as showing that the hill-shaped depolarizations have variable durations, on the order of 1-20 s; we therefore think that our experiments with 2 and 10 second-long ramps cover a fair range of these durations. Our summary results in Figure 1 show that carbachol similarly affects 2 s and 10 s ramps.</p><p>We added a supplementary figure (1-2) where the adaptation index was plotted as a function of the initial membrane potential and ramp amplitude (as well as input resistance). In all cases, it is apparent that the main factor determining whether the center of mass of firing is shifted earlier or later in the ramp is the presence or absence of carbachol rather than initial membrane potential, current injection amplitude, or input resistance (see Results lines 158-168).</p><p>Further, we agree with the reviewer that our interpretation is somewhat speculative, and we have now included disclaimers as well as placed most of these interpretations in a portion of the discussion titled “Ideas and Speculations: Implications of our results for place fields in intact rodents”. In addition, we added the word “potential” in the title.</p></body></sub-article></article>
