(MHb) to interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) is critical for emotion-related behaviors and uniquely expresses R-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Cav2.3) and auxiliary GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor (GBR) subunits, the K<sup>+</sup>-channel tetramerization domain-containing proteins (KCTDs). Activation of GBRs facilitates or inhibits transmitter release from MHb terminals depending on the IPN subnucleus, but the role of KCTDs is unknown. We therefore examined the localization and function of Cav2.3, GBRs, and KCTDs in this pathway in mice. We show in heterologous cells that KCTD8 and KCTD12b directly bind to Cav2.3 and that KCTD8 potentiates Cav2.3 currents in the absence of GBRs. In the rostral IPN, KCTD8, KCTD12b, and Cav2.3 co-localize at the presynaptic active zone. Genetic deletion indicated a bidirectional modulation of Cav2.3-mediated release by these KCTDs with a compensatory increase of KCTD8 in the active zone in KCTD12b-deficient mice. The interaction of Cav2.3 with KCTDs therefore scales synaptic strength independent of GBR activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gabab receptor</kwd><kwd>Cav2.3</kwd><kwd>KCTD</kwd><kwd>r-type calcium channel</kwd><kwd>medial habenula</kwd><kwd>interpeduncular nucleus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>694539</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shigemoto</surname><given-names>Ryuichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>692692</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonas</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A‐172881</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bettler</surname><given-names>Bernhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>665385</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Önal</surname><given-names>Cihan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>For2143</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kulik</surname><given-names>Akos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BIOSS-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kulik</surname><given-names>Akos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The direct interaction of R-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Cav2.3 and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor auxiliary subunits in the active zone of medial habenula terminals scales synaptic strength independent of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The medial habenula (MHb) is an epithalamic structure that exclusively projects to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), with the dorsal MHb projecting to the lateral IPN and the ventral MHb projecting to the rostral and central subnuclei of the IPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This pathway is involved in various behaviors, including nicotine addiction and aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agetsuma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Koppensteiner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koppensteiner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Melani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhao-Shea et al., 2013</xref>). A striking property of the MHb-IPN pathway is the prominent presynaptic localization of the R-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel 2.3 (Cav2.3), a channel mainly located in postsynaptic elements in other brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Parajuli et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, activation of presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (GBRs) on MHb terminals exerts an unusual facilitatory effect by increasing neurotransmitter release up to 10-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), and this effect appears to be involved in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koppensteiner et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, this potentiation via presynaptic GBR activation only occurs in the glutamatergic/cholinergic pathway from the ventral MHb to the rostral/central IPN, whereas in the glutamatergic/substance-P-ergic pathway from the dorsal MHb to the lateral IPN, the release is attenuated by GBR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Melani et al., 2019</xref>). Although GBRs are ubiquitously expressed in these MHb-IPN pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Margeta-Mitrovic et al., 1999</xref>), the presynaptic localization and function of their auxiliary KCTD subunits is unknown.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression and function of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors and Cav2.3 at two parallel MHb-IPN pathways.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic drawing of the two MHb-IPN pathways.

KCTD subunits bind as hetero- and homo-pentamers to GBRs and modulate their signaling kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fritzius et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). Structurally, KCTD subunits are composed of an N-terminal T1 domain and an H1 domain. The T1 domain binds to the GABA<sub>B2</sub> subunit, while the H1 domain binds to the Gβ subunit of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schwenk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Turecek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). X-ray crystallography of the T1 and H1 domains of KCTD12 and KCTD16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lepore et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zuo et al., 2019</xref>) revealed that the secondary and tertiary protein structures of those domains are highly conserved in the KCTD proteins. However, the T1 domain possesses a highly divergent loop between helix α2 and strand β3 (following the nomenclature from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zuo et al., 2019</xref>), while the H1 domain features a divergent loop between the strands β4 and β5 (following the nomenclature from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). These loops are hydrophilic, exposed at the protein surface, and potentially allow the different KCTD subunits to bind proteins other than GABA<sub>B2</sub> or Gβ. KCTD8 and 16, but not KCTD12 and 12b, additionally encode a C-terminal H2 domain. The absence of the H2 domain enables KCTD12 and 12b to rapidly desensitize GBR responses by uncoupling the Gβγ subunits of the G-protein from effector channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Turecek et al., 2014</xref>). KCTD12 and 12b can form hetero-pentamers with each other but also with KCTD8 and 16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fritzius et al., 2017</xref>). Compared to the rest of the brain, the expression patterns of KCTD subunits in the MHb are unique: With the exception of a weak expression in the cerebellum and superior colliculus, KCTD8 is exclusively and strongly expressed in MHb and, to a lesser extent, IPN neurons. Furthermore, KCTD12b is exclusively expressed in the ventral part of the MHb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Metz et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, KCTD12 is weakly expressed in the ventral part of the MHb, while KCTD16 is expressed in most brain areas but not the MHb. Based on proteomics studies, voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels co-precipitate GBRs and their auxiliary KCTD subunits together with release machinery proteins of the presynaptic active zone, including SNAP-25, synaptotagmins, synaptobrevin-2, Munc13-1, syntaxins, RIM1, and synapsins, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Müller et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, KCTD8 and KCTD16 were consistently found to co-purify with presynaptic Cav2.2 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Müller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwenk et al., 2016</xref>). However, the functional consequences of these interactions and whether other voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels interact with KCTDs remain unknown.</p><p>Here, we studied the nano-anatomy of Cav2.3, GBRs, and KCTDs and their roles in the modulation of neurotransmission from the MHb to the IPN. Our results demonstrate that Cav2.3 is located in the presynaptic active zone of habenular terminals and required for fast neurotransmitter release. In heterologous cells, we found that KCTD8 and KCTD12b, but not KCTD12, bind to Cav2.3 at the plasma membrane. Furthermore, Cav2.3 currents were enhanced by co-expression of KCTD8, but not KCTD12b in the absence of GBRs. Strikingly, genetic deletion of KCTD8 or KCTD12b reduced or increased, respectively, the probability of neurotransmitter release in the ventral MHb to the rostral IPN pathway without affecting GBR-mediated potentiation. The increase of release in KCTD12b knock-out (KO) mice was accompanied by a compensatory recruitment of KCTD8 into the active zone, where it closely associates with Cav2.3. Furthermore, viral expression of KCTD12b in MHb neurons reduced the increased release probability in KCTD12b KO mice, whereas overexpression of KCTD8 in MHb neurons of wild-type mice increased release probability. These results support that synaptic strength at the MHb-IPN pathway is scaled via GBR-independent Cav2.3–KCTD interactions in the presynaptic active zone.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cav2.3 mediates neurotransmission in two distinct MHb–IPN pathways</title><p>The MHb to IPN pathway comprises two major projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

GBR activation has been reported to facilitate both electrically and optogenetically evoked neurotransmitter release in the ventral MHb-rostral/central IPN pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koppensteiner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), whereas it inhibits release in the dorsal MHb-lateral IPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Melani et al., 2019</xref>). We confirmed that rostral IPN neurons exhibit a strong increase in excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes following GBR activation with 1 µM baclofen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), whereas EPSC amplitudes were reduced by baclofen in lateral IPN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Both the rostral/central and lateral subnuclei showed prominent Cav2.3 immunofluorescence signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), in accordance with a previous study showing strong and exclusive presynaptic Cav2.3 localization in the IPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Parajuli et al., 2012</xref>). A previous report tested the functional involvement of Cav2.3 in neurotransmission from the ventral MHb to the IPN by applying Ni<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), an ion known to also inhibit other Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 1999</xref>). To test Cav2.3 dependency of neurotransmission in both pathways, we performed whole-cell recordings from IPN neurons in acute brain slices and applied the Cav2.3 blocker SNX-482 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Newcomb et al., 1998</xref>). In rostral and lateral IPN neurons, 1 µM SNX-482 strongly reduced the amplitude of EPSCs by 83% and 52%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). The SNX-482-mediated reduction in EPSC amplitudes was significantly stronger in the ventral MHb to rostral IPN pathway compared to the dorsal MHb to lateral IPN pathway (main effect of IPN subnucleus F<sub>1, 395</sub> = 213.7, p&lt;0.0001; two-way ANOVA). In addition, SNX-482 did not significantly affect action potential peak times or full-widths at half maximum in ventral MHb neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; peak times: control: 0.86 ± 0.03 ms, n = 3; SNX-482: 0.93 ± 0.05 ms, n = 4; t<sub>5</sub> = 1.083, p=0.3282; full-widths: control 1.08 ± 0.07 ms, n = 3; SNX-482: 1.06 ± 0.03 ms, n = 4, t<sub>5</sub> = 0.3852, p=0.7159; unpaired t-test), suggesting that the reduction of neurotransmitter release by SNX-482 was not caused by a blockade of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> channels. To corroborate the involvement of Cav2.3 in release from MHb terminals, we next performed electrical stimulation of the MHb-derived fiber tract, the fasciculus retroflexus (FR), in Cav2.3 KO mice and recorded EPSCs in rostral and lateral IPN neurons. To obtain maximally intact FR, slices were cut at 1 mm thickness, which allowed for the stimulation of the fiber tract at a distance of 2–3 mm from the IPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). The MHb is a ventricular structure and therefore well supplied with freshly oxygenated ACSF, even in thick slices, assuring long-lasting viability of intact axons and their terminals within the IPN. In wild-type (WT) animals, electrical stimulation of the FR in slices prepared this way produced reliable responses in all recorded rostral and lateral IPN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,D</xref>). Pathway specificity was confirmed by baclofen, which enhanced responses in the rostral but depressed responses in the lateral IPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). In order to compare responses between rostral and lateral IPN recordings in Cav2.3 KO mice, the position of the stimulating electrode and the stimulus intensity remained unchanged between recordings. From each KO animal, three neurons each from the rostral and lateral IPN were recorded in an alternating manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). Responses were approved when (1) evoked events were observed in response to at least six consecutive stimuli in the train, (2) the amplitude of evoked responses exceeded three times the standard deviation of the baseline noise, and (3) responses showed the characteristic shapes of a fast rising and slowly decaying synaptic response. Applying these criteria, 10 Hz electrical stimulation for 1 s failed to evoke synaptic responses in the nine of nine recorded rostral IPN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,J</xref>). In contrast, seven of nine recorded lateral IPN neurons showed EPSC responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>; main effect of IPN subnucleus: F<sub>1, 160</sub> = 120.4, p&lt;0.0001; two-way ANOVA).</p><p>To investigate the identity of additional Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels involved in release from dorsal MHb terminals, we performed FR stimulation to measure EPSCs in lateral IPN neurons (seven recordings/five mice) in WT mice and sequentially applied SNX-482, the Cav2.2 blocker ω-conotoxin GVIA (1 µM) and CdCl<sub>2</sub> (200 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). While SNX-482 produced a similar decrease in EPSC amplitude as in the optogenetic stimulation experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K,L</xref>, effect of electrical vs. optogenetic stimulation: F<sub>1, 305</sub> = 1.830, p=0.1772; main effect of SNX: F<sub>23, 305</sub> = 17.41, p&lt;0.0001; Interaction F<sub>23, 305</sub> = 1.842, p&gt;0.9999, two-way ANOVA of time courses between minutes 0–25), ω-conotoxin did not reduce EPSC amplitudes further. The remaining EPSC amplitude was completely blocked by CdCl<sub>2</sub>, suggesting an involvement of either P/Q- or L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Comparison of the SNX-482 effects on electrically and optogenetically evoked EPSCs in the lateral IPN with that on electrically evoked EPSCs in the rostral IPN confirmed a significantly weaker effect in dorsal MHb terminals in the lateral IPN than in ventral MHb terminals in the rostral IPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>; electrical stim. rostral vs. electrical stim. lateral: p&lt;0.0001; electrical stim. rostral vs. optogenetic stim. lateral: p&lt;0.0001; electrical stim. lateral vs. optogenetic stim. lateral p=0.3174; two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test). Overall, these results suggest that ventral MHb terminals in the rostral IPN rely exclusively on Cav2.3 for release, whereas dorsal MHb terminals in the lateral IPN rely on Cav2.3 and additional Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>KCTD8 and KCTD12b directly bind Cav2.3 and KCTD8 enhances currents through Cav2.3 in HEK cells</title><p>GBRs strongly modulate release in both pathways.

Immunoreactivity for KCTD8 appeared strong in all IPN subnuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), consistent with its strong expression throughout MHb and presynaptic localization in IPN. KCTD12 immunofluorescence appeared strong in the rostral and central subnuclei but faint in the lateral subnucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Overall, these results show that KCTDs differentially modulate basal release probability at ventral MHb terminals. The increase in Cav2.3-mediated release probability by KCTD8 is consistent with its facilitatory effects on Cav2.3 current density in HEK293 cells. The decreased PPR in the absence of KCTD12b recovered to control levels when KCTD8 was additionally absent, suggesting alterations in either Cav2.3 or KCTD8 localization in the active zone of MHb terminals in KCTD12b KO mice.

Since KCTD12b is not expressed in MHb terminals in the lateral IPN, no effects on expression of these molecules are expected in the lateral IPN in KCTD12b KO mice. Thus, we normalized the densities of presynaptic molecules in the rostral IPN to the average density of the same molecule in the corresponding lateral IPN in the same replicas. Thereby, we avoided interference by technical variabilities in labeling efficiencies between individual replicas. We found no significant difference in the densities of Cav2.3 in the presynaptic active zone in the rostral relative to the lateral IPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; WT rostral: 1.01 ± 0.04 fold of lateral IPN, n = 8 replicas from eight mice; KCTD12b KO: 1.06 ± 0.13 fold of lateral IPN, n = 8 replicas from eight mice; p=0.5054, Mann–Whitney test).

We confirmed that Cav2.3 is involved in mediating transmitter release at both pathways, but only release at the ventral MHb-IPN pathway exclusively relies on Cav2.3. KCTD8 and KCTD12b show distinct expression along these pathways, with KCTD12b specifically expressed in the cholinergic ventral MHb-IPN pathway. In HEK293T cells, we found that KCTD8 and KCTD12b bind to Cav2.3 at the plasma membrane and that specifically KCTD8 increases Cav2.3 currents. Using electron microscopy, we verified that Cav2.3 and KCTDs co-localize within the presynaptic active zone of MHb terminals. Genetic deletion of the KCTDs indicated that KCTD8 increases basal release probability and that KCTD12b prevents this effect. Synapses lacking KCTD12b showed an increased density of KCTD8 in the active zone, resulting in a close association of KCTD8 with Cav2.3 and a consequent increase in release probability. Viral expression of KCTD12b in KCTD12b KO mice reduced release probability to WT levels, whereas overexpression of KCTD8 in WT mice mimicked the phenotype of KCTD12b KO mice.

Our data confirmed that both MHb-IPN pathways heavily rely on Cav2.3 for release. Interestingly, projections from the ventral MHb to the rostral IPN were more affected by SNX-482 than the dorsal MHb to lateral IPN pathway. Using Cav2.3 KO mice, we found residual EPSC responses in lateral but not rostral IPN neurons, confirming that exclusively Cav2.3 mediates transmitter release from ventral MHb terminals. The remaining release from dorsal MHb terminals in the lateral IPN of Cav2.3 KO mice could be explained either by a compensatory upregulation of other Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels or by the presence of additional Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in WT mice.

Possibly, the use of total brain extracts may have limited detection to the most prominent protein interactions. Thus, brain-wide approaches to study presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-interacting proteins may have failed to detect interactions uniquely occurring inside MHb terminals. In contrast, our pre-embedding EM approach utilizing interference in Cav2.3 immunogold labeling by steric hindrance with KCTD8 antibody in the AZ of MHb terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) indicates a close association in situ of these molecules within 16 nm (two times of IgG size 8 nm), if not a direct binding.</p><p>The selective KO of KCTD8 lowered basal levels of release probability from ventral MHb terminals below that of WT synapses. On the other hand, KO of KCTD12b resulted in a significant increase of basal release probabilities. This finding of modulation of release independent of GBR activation could be explained by the current-enhancing effects of KCTD8 on Cav2.3 observed in a heterologous expression system. Since the probability of neurotransmitter release is relatively low in WT terminals (0.26), the additional reduction in release probability in KCTD8 KO mice (0.12) may not be detectable by PPR measures. An important indication that KCTD8 functionally increases synaptic strength was the observation that viral overexpression of KCTD8 in WT ventral MHb neurons significantly lowered PPR values compared with EGFP controls. This result suggests that KCTD8 and KCTD12b may be in a state of dynamic balance. Creating an imbalance appears to result in alterations in synaptic strength. This possibility would be in line with our pre-embedding EM result, with KCTD12b showing peak densities inside the active zone of ventral MHb terminals, whereas KCTD8 shows peak expression in the peri-synaptic region. This could be an indication for the preferred interaction of synaptic Cav2.3 with KCTD12b over KCTD8 due to spatial proximity or higher binding affinity. Although the increase in release probability at ventral MHb terminals is likely caused by a direct effect of KCTD8 on Cav2.3, it is unknown whether other Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels involved in transmitter release from dorsal MHb terminals are equally affected by KCTD8.</p><p>It is unclear whether a compensatory increase of KCTD12b occurs in KCTD8 KO mice. Our initial results from WT pre-embedding EM indicate that KCTD12b displays peak densities in the active zone, whereas KCTD8 shows peak densities in the peri-synaptic region. Therefore, although it may be possible to see a compensatory increase in KCTD12b in the active zone of KCTD8 KO mice, due to the weaker expression of KCTD8 in the WT active zone, such an increase would be expected to be smaller than the compensatory increase seen in KCTD12b KO animals. Furthermore, the functional consequence of a compensatory increase in KCTD12b in the active zone in KCTD8 KO mice would not be detected in our functional experiments, as KCTD12b did not alter Cav2.3 function in vitro and KCTD12b has no effects on PPR in the absence of KCTD8 (no significant difference between KCTD8 KO and KCTD8/12b double KO in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Our results suggest that the relatively mild reduction in release probability seen in KCTD8 KO mice resulted from removal of the comparatively low levels of KCTD8 from the WT active zone, rather than from a compensatory increase in KCTD12b.</p><p>To induce synaptic plasticity in the ventral MHb to IPN pathway, release of glutamate, activation of postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors on GABAergic IPN neurons, and subsequent retrograde release of GABA to activate presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors on MHb terminals are required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koppensteiner et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, KCTD-mediated modulation of release probability could determine a ventral MHb synapse’s propensity to undergo and express activity-dependent plasticity.

For KCTD8 KO line generation, exon one containing ATG and most of the open reading frame (ORF) of the Kctd8 gene (MGI:2443804) was replaced with a loxP-flanked neo.

All KCTD KO lines had the neo removed by crossing founders with a Cre-deleter line, leaving one loxP site behind.

To evoke glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in rostral IPN neurons, voltage pulses (0.5–3.5 V, 0.2 ms duration) were applied with an ISO-Flex stimulus isolator (AMPI, Jerusalem, Israel) to a concentric bipolar stimulating electrode (CBBPC75, FHC, Bowdoin, ME) located inside the IPN, ~200–300 µm distal to the recorded neuron. For optogenetic stimulation in Tac1-ChR2 mice, blue light (λ = 465 nm) was emitted directly onto the lateral IPN through a 5 mm long mono fiber-optic cannula (fiber diameter 200 µm, total diameter 230 µm, Doric lenses, Quebec, Canada) connected to a PlexBright LED (Plexon, Dallas, TX), with an optical patch cable (fiber diameter 200 µm, total diameter 230 µm, 0.48 NA). The LED was triggered via 200–290 mA current pulse (2 ms duration) from a LED Driver (LD-1, Plexon), which was controlled directly via the HEKA EPC10 amplifier. The sweep interval of all stimulation protocols (electrical and optogenetic) was 10 s. For the application of SNX-482 (1 µM, hellobio, Bristol, UK) and ω-Conotoxin GVIA (1 µM, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel), 0.1% bovine serum albumin was added to the ACSF. For variance-mean analysis, ACSF with four different Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (1.5–8 mM) was applied to measure variance and mean EPSC amplitude at different release probabilities. Each Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration was washed in for 5–10 min. Once EPSC amplitudes stabilized, 15–20 consecutive EPSC responses were used for the calculation of mean EPSC amplitude and variance, followed by the wash-in of the next Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. The order of application was 2.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, followed by 1.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, followed by 6–8 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, followed by 4–5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Baseline noise was much smaller than synaptic noise. The values for release probability and quantal size were calculated according to the equations Var = Iq – I²/N and I = Nqp, with I being the average EPSC amplitude, N the number of release sites, and q the quantal size. To measure the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of two consecutively evoked EPSCs at 20 Hz, the PPRs of 20–30 EPSC pairs evoked at 10 s intervals were averaged. To study the effect of GBR activation on EPSC amplitude, R(+)-Baclofen hydrochloride (1 µM) was bath applied for 3 min and washed for 10 min. For PPR and variance-mean experiments, data from wild-type C57BL/6J and BALB/c mice were found to not differ significantly and thus were pooled. To measure action potential properties in ventral MHb neurons, a 50 pA current was injected for 100 ms, which reliably evoked a train of action potentials. Action potential peak times were measured as the time from the threshold potential to the peak. Action potential full-width at half maximum was measured as the time between rising and the falling phase of the action potential at half of the maximal action potential amplitude. Only the first action potential in the train was analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Human Embryonic Kidney 293T (HEK293T) were directly obtained from ATCC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.expasy.org/cellosaurus/CVCL_0063">https://web.expasy.org/cellosaurus/CVCL_0063</ext-link>)and maintained in DMEM supplemented with GlutaMAX (Invitrogen) and 10% FCS in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO<sub>2</sub>) at 37°C.

Cells were maintained in culture as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dai et al., 2008</xref>). All cell lines were authenticated using Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis by Microsynth (Switzerland) and tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cell culture transfection and electrophysiology</title><p>For experiments, the Cav2.3-expressing HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids for the expression of Myc-tagged KCTD8 (AY615967) or KCTD12b (AL831725) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schwenk et al., 2010</xref>). Plasmids for the expression of eGFP (Clontech, Kyoto, Japan) were co-transfected in order to identify cells expressing the plasmids. A total quantity of 0.75 µg of DNA was transfected in each well, and empty pCI plasmid was used to complete to this amount of total DNA. The control group contained only eGFP and empty vector. Two to four days after transfection, cells were briefly subjected to Versene (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) treatment for its dissociation and plated on glass coverslips and, at least 2 hr later, electrophysiology experiments were performed.</p><p>Whole-cell recordings were performed using fire-polished borosilicate patch pipettes (2–4 MΩ of tip resistance), filled with a cesium-based intracellular solution containing (mM): 110 CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 15 CsCl, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 10 Tri–phosphocreatine, 0.1 NaGTP, 4 MgATP, pH 7.3 adjusted with CsOH.

For patch-clamp experiments, isolated cells with a clear eGFP fluorescent signal were selected. The culture was maintained under continuous perfusion (~1 ml/min) at room temperature. A MultiClamp 700B (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) amplifier connected to a 1440A Digidata was used to acquire signals at 10–50 kHz, filtered at 2–8 kHz. After whole-cell formation, series resistance (&lt;10 MΩ) was compensated by 85%. Linear leak currents and capacity transients were subtracted on-line using a −P/4 protocol. Current-voltage relationships were recorded from a holding potential of −80 mV using 25 ms depolarizations from −70 to 60 mV in 10 mV increments. Peak <italic>I</italic><sub>Ba</sub> was measured at each step and normalized to the capacitance of the cell to obtain the current densities, which were plotted as a function of the voltage step. I−V curves were fit with a standard Boltzmann equation as follows: <italic>I</italic><sub>Ba</sub> = <italic>G</italic><sub>max</sub>(<italic>V − V</italic><sub>rev</sub>)/(1 + exp((<italic>V</italic><sub>0.5act</sub> − <italic>V</italic>)/<italic>k</italic>)), where <italic>I</italic><sub>Ba</sub> is the current measured at each test potential <italic>V</italic>, <italic>G</italic><sub>max</sub> is the maximal conductance, <italic>V</italic><sub>rev</sub> is the reversal potential, <italic>V</italic><sub>0.5act</sub> is the half-maximal voltage of activation, and <italic>k</italic> is the slope factor. To study voltage dependency of activation, a series of 25 ms voltage steps from −80 to 60 mV (with 10 mV increments) were applied, followed by a 10 ms step to 0 mV, where peaks of the evoked current tails were measured, normalized to the maximal peak, and plotted against the corresponding voltage. To the study-steady state inactivation, a series of 2 s long voltage steps from −120 to 10 mV (10 mV increments) was applied, followed by a test step to 10 mV (150 ms) where peaks of elicited currents were measured, normalized to the maximal response, and plotted against the corresponding voltage.

Plasmids expressing C-terminally Flag-tagged Cav2.3 were obtained from GenScript. Cultured human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were transfected using 2 μg/μl polyethylenimine (Sigma-Aldrich) with indicated plasmids for the expression of either Flag-KCTDs alone or in combination with Flag-Cav2.3. Cells were washed 48 hr after transfection in ice-cold PBS and lysed in NETN buffer (100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture [Roche, Basel, Switzerland]), followed by rotation for 10 min at 4°C. Cell lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g (4°C, 10 min) and directly used for immunoblot analysis (Input) or for co-immunoprecipitation assay, in which they were precleared for 1 hr using 30 μl (dry volume) of a 1:1 mixture of protein-A and protein-G-agarose beads (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL). Thereafter, lysates were incubated by rotating for 16 hr at 4°C in the presence of 2.5 μl of 0.3 μg/μl anti-Cav2.3 (CACNA1E) antibody (ACC-006, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel). The next day, 10 μl (dry volume) of a 1:1 mixture of protein-A and protein-G-agarose beads were added and incubated by rotating for 40 min at 4°C. Afterward, they were washed with 5 × 1 ml of NETN buffer and pulled down proteins were eluted with 25 μl of 4× sample loading buffer containing 200 mM DTT. Proteins were resolved using standard one-dimensional SDS–PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels (for 45 min at 70 mV, followed by an additional 1.5 hr at 120 mV). For immunoblotting analysis, proteins were transferred to 0.45 μM polivinylidene fluoride membranes (Milipore, Burlington, MA) for 2 hr at 200 mA and probed with the primary antibodies rabbit anti-Flag (F7425, Sigma) and anti-Cav2.3 (ACC-006, Alomone Labs) in combination with peroxidase-coupled secondary donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (NA934, GE Healthcare, 1:10,000).</p><p>For co-IP experiments using membrane extracts, we transiently transfected HEK293T cells with the pore forming α-subunit (rat Cav2.3) together with auxiliary β3 and α2δ1 subunits in order to emulate the experimental conditions present the stable cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dai et al., 2008</xref>). These cells were then subjected to hypotonic lysis to separate cytosolic proteins from membrane proteins (total membrane). A fraction of the total membrane pool was then subjected to a plasma membrane purification protocol using a commercially available plasma membrane extraction kit (ab 65400, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). The plasma membrane fraction obtained after the purification as well as the total membrane fraction were subsequently solubilized in detergent-containing buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40) and loaded on 10% SDS–PAGE gels. The presence of the KCTD proteins in the corresponding tissues was determined by western blotting using ECL detection of HRP-coupled antibodies against Flag-tagged KCTD8 (rabbit anti-KCTD8) and Flag-tagged KCTD12b (mouse anti-Flag). For co-immunoprecipitation assay, lysates were incubated by rotating for 16 hr at 4°C in the presence of 2.5 μl of 0.3 μg/μl anti-Cav2.3 (CACNA1E) antibody (ACC-006, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel), washed, and eluted as described above with subsequent immunoblotting analysis performed as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Lentiviral injections</title><p>Lentiviral vectors (LV–hSyn–EGFP, LV–hSyn–3xFlag/mKCTD8[NM_175519.5]/P2A/EGFP, and LV–hSyn–3xFlag/mKCTD12b[NM_175429.4]/P2A/EGFP) were generated by the life science facility at IST Austria and by VectorBuilder GmbH (Neu-Isenburg, Germany). Bilateral viral injections were performed in male C57Bl/6J or KCTD12b KO mice at 2 months of age. Seven hundred nanoliter of virus was injected at a rate of 50 nl/min to the following coordinates: anterior/posterior: –1.42 mm from Bregma, lateral: ±0.22 mm from the midline, dorsal/ventral: –2.5 mm from the surface of the brain. Mice were allowed to recover for 10–14 days before carrying out electrophysiology experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>All statistical tests and graph preparations were done using Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, CA), and figure assembly was done in Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA). To determine whether to use parametric or non-parametric statistical tests, Shapiro-Wilk test for normality of residuals was applied. Unless otherwise noted, averaged data is presented as mean ± SEM, and p-values&lt;0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. Power analysis (power = 0.8, α error = 0.05) was used to determine the appropriate sample size for SDS-FRL and variance-mean experiments using G*Power software (Univ. Kiel, Germany). Sample size in other experiments was based on those of similar experiments in previous studies. Masking was not used for any experiment. For the analysis of pre-embedding immunolabeled ultrathin sections, the presynaptic active zone was manually demarcated based on (1) rigid alignment of pre- and postsynaptic membranes and the presence of a postsynaptic density with the same length as the presynaptic active zone, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rubio et al., 2017</xref>). Active zone length and silver-intensified gold particle densities and distances were measured using Reconstruct software. In SDS-FRL samples, demarcation of presynaptic active zones was performed manually based on two morphological criteria: there had to be a visible alteration in surface curvature in the P-face and/or a concentration in intramembrane particles (IMPs) of variable sizes that appeared clearly different from those of the surrounding P-face. For density measurements, incomplete active zones were analyzed whenever there was a visible transition to the postsynaptic E-face that displayed the characteristic IMP clusters of a glutamatergic postsynapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>). For confirmation, the complete active zone area demarcated based on protoplasmic surface depression and concentrated IMP cluster were compared with the area of complete postsynaptic E-face IMP clusters. In addition, the area of manually demarcated complete active zones was also compared with those demarcated using a mixture of active zone-marker antibodies for RIM1/2 (5 µg/ml; Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany), neurexin (5 µg/ml) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miki et al., 2017</xref>), and CAST (3 µg/ml) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hagiwara et al., 2018</xref>). To analyze clustering of molecules (Cav2.3, GABA<sub>B1</sub>, KCTD8, and KCTD12b), we performed 100 Monte Carlo simulations using GPDQ software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Luján et al., 2018</xref>). For each simulation, the same number of particles was redistributed randomly, with each pixel having the same probability of becoming the center of a particle, on the demarcated area of interest under the condition that two particles could not be closer to each other than 10 nm. We then compared nearest neighbor distances (NNDs) between real particles with the NNDs of simulated particles using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Akari Hagiwara and Toshihisa Ohtsuka for CAST antibody, and Masahiko Watanabe for neurexin antibody.

The authors focus on the special features of these synapses, namely the presynaptic expression of R-type voltage gated calcium channel, Cav2.3, the potent modulation by the presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, and their auxiliary KCTD subunits whose functions have been elusive. Through electrophysiological, biochemical and ultrastructural characterizations, the paper shows that KCTD8 and KCTD12b directly interact with Cav2.3 and regulate neurotransmitter release from ventral medial habenula terminals independently of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, where effectively KCTD12b serves to restrain release while the recruitment of KCTD8 to the active zone potentiates release by promoting Cav2.3 currents. These findings are important as they identify novel, GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-independent role for KCTD proteins in regulating neurotransmission and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

For example, the lateral IPN has no detectable KCTD12b but expresses high levels of KCTD8 (Figure 2), yet its response to baclofen is opposite to the response detected in the rostral IPN in KCTD12b KO mice.

I was expecting an examination of underlying second messenger pathways, but this was not the route taken, as the authors investigating whether there is a role for the KCTD proteins which interact with GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors.</p><p>My impression of this manuscript is that by trying to understand the potentiating effect of baclofen on the synapses in question, the authors have uncovered a very interesting effect of KCTD8 potentiating CaV2.3, and an interplay between KCTD8 and KCTD12b, shown with several techniques including very nice EM images and analysis, which however is completely separate from the effect of baclofen acting on GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors.</p><p>In trying nevertheless to combine the two stories, the authors have overcomplicated the message of their study, in my view. I would prefer to see the results separated, with the KCTD study stripped out and potentially published here, as it is novel and well performed. Otherwise it seems to me the manuscript is over-complex and the very interesting message about the KCTDs is difficult to extract.</p><p>1. Line 99 SNX482 is not &quot;selective&quot;. The authors are using it at 1 µM. It may be relatively selective between calcium channels, but it also blocks certain K channels in the same concentration range, in fact 500 nM was used in slices to block A-type K currents (Kimm and Bean, 2014). It also affects other Ca channels and Na channels at concentrations below 1µM (Newcomb et al., 1998). How sure are the authors this blockade of other channels is not affecting their study ?</p><p>2. Line 104. You cannot say the two MHb-IPN pathways have different sensitivities to SNX482, as no dose response curve has been performed, and the difference between the pathways at the single dose studied may indicate the involvement of other Ca channels.</p><p>3. Similarly, in the Discussion, line 310 &quot;We confirmed that both dorsal MHb-IPN and ventral MHb-IPN pathways require Cav2.3 for transmitter release&quot;, is not completely correct, as how is release occurring for the ~50% SNX482-insensitive lateral epscs (Figure 1) ?</p><p>4. Figure 8A needs correct labelling of the panels, with MW markers. I assume the top panel is KCTDs, but this is unclear as both CaV2.3 and KCTDs have Flag tags, which is an unusual way of performing the experiment. The entire blot should be shown for the top panel, as blotting with Flag would show both KCTDs and CaV2.3.</p><p>5. If there is co-ip between CaV2.3 and KCTD8/12b, should there be actual co-localization observed in the EM images? Can this be measured?.</p><p>6. In Figure 8c, how selective is the augmentation with KCTD8 and CaV2.3, ie does it also occur for any other Ca channels? It is possible that a low level of other presynaptic Ca channels might be also augmented by KCTD8 in these terminals, increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry.</p><p>7. If this large augmentation of CaV2.3 currents by KCTD8 plays a physiological role should the epsc's in the KCTD8 KO mice be reduced? I cannot see this basic result, although I note the release probability is indeed reduced.</p><p>8. Following on from point 6, in Discussion line 329, has the 1997 study by Ludwig et al. showing no α1B, A, C mRNA in the habenula been replicated anywhere? The technique used in this early study is not very sensitive, are there other more recent studies using single cell RNAseq for example?</p><p>9.

The topic is interesting especially because it is very unusual that GABA-B receptors gate an enhancement of neurotransmission, since usually when they are activated, they depress the release of neurotransmitter.</p><p>The manuscript contains some high quality data, for example, freeze-fracture replica immunolabelling of presynaptic proteins in habenular terminals. However, I also found some technical problems, (e.g., see comment #1 below). Overall, the manuscript is potentially interesting and covers an original topic. However, the data currently submitted fail to answer the two major questions, namely the underlying mechanisms and the physiological relevance of GABA-B receptor-mediated modulation. A lot of efforts are devoted in characterizing key protein expression in various K<sup>+</sup> channel tetramerization domain-containing (KCTD) proteins. However, I doubt that this strategy paid off and really shed light on the mechanisms underlying GABA-B receptor mediated modulation of the synapses studied.</p><p>1. Data on the action of SNX-482 on evoked EPSCs need refinement. The presynaptic fibers of the fasciculus retroflexus were electrically stimulated and recordings were made in the rostral IPN. In contrast, stimulation of dorsal fibers were obtained via optogenetic stimulation and responses were recorded in the lateral IPN. The effect of SNX-482 was stronger at the former versus the latter synapses. However, this result is at odds with similar Cav2.3 densities in the active zones of dorsal and ventral MHb terminals. The Authors discussed this issue, and I acknowledged this mis-match in their data. Nevertheless, the problem remains: a quantitative comparison between drug modulation of synaptic responses evoked by electrical versus optogenetic stimulation is a poor choice. Amongst various problems, several recent papers report the non-physiological high release probability often caused by optogenetic stimulation of presynaptic fibers that contrasts with the electrical stimulation method. This discrepancy would affect the results obtained with SNX-482. This set of experiments should be repeated by using more uniform experimental conditions in the two synaptic pathways. Furthermore, a serious comparison of the efficacy of SNX-482 should rely on testing at least three different drug concentrations for each synapse. Furthermore, normalization assuring that approximatively an equal number of presynaptic fibers are stimulated at each synaptic connection should be employed. What ever methods of presynaptic stimulation will be used, optical or electrical, test of selective stimulation of fibers should be also performed.</p><p>2. Baclofen still presynaptically potentiated EPSCs in KCTD KO mice. However, loss of KCTD12b impaired GABABR action probably via increasing release probability and occlusion. In contrast, lack of KCTD8 reduces release probability. But what about the effects of GABABR modulation? Is baclofen more powerful at MH synapses in KCTD8 KO?</p><p>3. The manuscript lacks to experimentally demonstrate that GABA-B receptor potentiation of ventral MH and the rostral interpeduncular nucleus synapses is physiologically relevant. This should be addressed by using physiologically salient repetitive stimulation in control and in the presence of GABA-B R antagonists. It would be also interesting to test the GABA-B R ligands on evoked EPSPs followed by IPSPs to see the comprehensive pharmacological effects on both excitation and inhibition. At present none of these important points are addressed and this reduces the impact of the data currently submitted.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor auxiliary subunits modulate Cav2.3-mediated release from medial habenula terminals&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Several additional experiments have been performed, including the comparisons of Cav2.3-dependence of synaptic transmission between the two distinct medial habenula to IPN inputs by electrical stimulation, which has been made possible by the establishment of thick-slice preparation. New data lend further support to the conclusion that KCTD8 and KCTD12b directly interact with Cav2.3 and regulate release from ventral MHb terminals independently of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, where effectively KCTD12b serves to restrain release while the recruitment of KCTD8 to the active zone potentiates release by promoting Cav2.3 currents. Prior to accepting the manuscript for publication, a number of points require attention.</p><p>Figure 6F-G: the EPSC waveforms of some rescued currents appear to be quite different than one would expect. Specifically, the LV-hSyn-KCTD8 current is quite prolonged, and may have two components to the rising phase. Additionally, the LV-hSyn-KCTD12b current appears to have a delayed onset. Are these examples representative of the population? If so, are these effects a result of over-expression, or more an indicator of the distinct roles of these two KCTD proteins?</p><p>In the introduction (Line 47 or Line 53-54), it would be clearer to readers who may not necessarily be familiar with KCTDs if the authors could briefly state the nature of the molecular difference especially between KCTD12 and KCTD12b.</p><p>Line 302-304. &quot;The decrease in release probability by KCTD12b in the presence but not in the absence of KTCD8…&quot; is confusing. Do the authors mean that the reason why the decreased PPR observed in KCTD12bKO could be recovered to control levels when KCTD8 is additionally absent (as observed in double KO mice), could be because the loss of KCTD12b in itself alters the localization of KCTD8 or Cav2.3?

To test the effect of overexpression of KCTD8 on basal release from ventral MHb terminals, we injected lentivirus expressing either EGFP or KCTD8-p2A-EGFP bilaterally into the MHb of WT mice (Figure 6F). PPR values recorded in rostral IPN neurons of EGFP control-injected animals remained unchanged (LV-EGFP: 2.17 ± 0.18, n = 17, 5 mice), whereas KCTD8-injected animals exhibited significantly lower PPR values (LV-KCTD8: 1.41 ± 0.14, n = 13, 3 mice; t<sub>28</sub> = 3.20, P = 0.0034; unpaired t-test).

It is unclear whether a compensatory increase in KCTD12b occurs in KCTD8 KO mice. Our initial results from WT pre-embedding EM indicate that KCTD12b displays peak densities in the active zone whereas KCTD8 shows peak densities in the perisynaptic region. Therefore, although it may be possible to see a compensatory increase in KCTD12b in the active zone of KCTD8 KO mice, due to the weaker expression of KCTD8 in the WT active zone, such an increase would be expected to be smaller than the compensatory increase of KCTD8 seen in KCTD12b KO animals. Furthermore, the functional consequence of a compensatory increase in KCTD12b in the active zone in KCTD8 KO mice would not be detected in functional experiments, as KCTD12b did not alter Cav2.3 function in vitro and KCTD12b has no effects on PPR in the absence of KCTD8 (no significant difference between KCTD8 KO and KCTD8/12b double KO in Figure 6A). Our results suggest that the relatively mild reduction in release probability seen in KCTD8 KO mice resulted from removal of the comparatively low levels of KCTD8 from the WT active zone, rather than from a compensatory increase in KCTD12b.

This might have been due to potential postsynaptic expression of KCTD8 as well as difficulty to detect nanoscale changes in protein distribution on the level of light microscopy. Instead, to confirm the compensatory increase of KCTD8 in ventral MHb terminals in the absence of KCTD12b, we performed pre-embedding EM immunolabeling for KCTD8 in presynaptic terminals in rostral and lateral IPN of KCTD12b KO mice (Figure 7C). The distribution pattern of KCTD8 in the lateral IPN showed peak densities in the peri-synaptic region, as seen in WT (Figure 3C). In contrast in the rostral IPN, the density of KCTD8 particles in the active zone, but not in the peri- and extrasynaptic area, was significantly higher compared with lateral IPN synapses (main effect of presynaptic distribution: F<sub>4, 775</sub> = 31.65, P &lt; 0.0001; rostral AZ vs. lateral AZ: P &lt; 0.0001; two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test).

These cells were then subjected to hypotonic lysis to separate cytosolic proteins from membrane proteins (a fraction that we called TM or “total membrane”). A fraction of the TM was then subjected to a plasma membrane purification protocol using a commercially available plasma membrane (PM) extraction kit from Abcam (ab 65400). We decided to work with this kit due to its extensive use in peer reviewed publications (so far it has been used in 85 papers – 10 of which were published between 2019 and 2020). This kit separates proteins of the plasma membrane from proteins located on other cellular membranes or the cytosol, using a 2-phase aqueous polymer method that takes advantage of differences in surface properties of the membranes rather than size and density. The PM fraction obtained after the purification as well as the TM fraction were subsequently solubilized in detergent-containing buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40) and loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE gels.

Based on earlier Co-IP experiments that we performed in order to look at the binding of endogenous KCTDs to other interacting proteins, such as GBRs, we estimate that it would be necessary to pool tissue from over 100 mice. This constitutes an unreasonable number of animals to perform this experiment just once, and replicates might be required to consolidate findings.</p><p>– Alternatively, a co-IP could be performed from full brain lysates but this approach comes with the drawback that Cav2.3 is expressed in many brain regions whereas KCTD8 and KCTD12b show much more restricted expression. It would be theoretically possible to perform the pull down for the KCTDs, however, this runs into the problem that endogenous Cav2.3 is notoriously difficult to detect in lysates and even more challenging to detect in pull downs as co-IPs.</p><p>Due to these challenges, we designed an alternative experiment to test the interaction of Cav2.3 with KCTDs in MHb terminals. Specifically, we tested whether antibodies bound to KCTD8 might interfere with labeling of Cav2.3 by steric hindrance in KCTD12b KO mice, where KCTD8 is strongly localized to the active zone. We hypothesized that the compensatory increase in KCTD8 in the AZ might lead to increased binding of KCTD8 to Cav2.3 and, therefore, pre-incubation with anti-KCTD8 antibody might reduce the ability of the anti-Cav2.3 antibody to bind to Cav2.3, resulting in lower labeling densities. In rostral IPN synapses, we found that pre-incubation significantly reduced Cav2.3 labeling densities in the AZ but not the peri- or extrasynaptic regions (Figure 7D; main effect of synaptic distribution: F<sub>4, 880</sub> = 31.42, P &lt; 0.0001; control AZ vs. pre-incubation AZ: P = 0.0006; two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test). In the lateral IPN, pre-incubation slightly but significantly reduced Cav2.3 labeling density only in the peri-synaptic region (Figure 7E; main effect of synaptic distribution: F<sub>4, 890</sub> = 39.01; control &lt;50 nm vs. pre-incubation &lt;50 nm: P = 0.0320). The peri-synaptic region is the location exhibiting peak expression for KCTD8 in dorsal MHb terminals. The significant reduction in Cav2.3 labeling density at this position therefore validates our steric hindrance approach.</p><p>These results indicate a close association between KCTD8 and Cav2.3 in situ, if not their direct binding. This point was added to the Results section on page 16, starting from line 340, and discussed on page 20, staring from line 417.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript aims to examine the mechanism of the unusual potentiating effect of baclofen acting on presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in the MHb-IPN pathway. I was expecting an examination of underlying second messenger pathways, but this was not the route taken, as the authors investigating whether there is a role for the KCTD proteins which interact with GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors.</p><p>My impression of this manuscript is that by trying to understand the potentiating effect of baclofen on the synapses in question, the authors have uncovered a very interesting effect of KCTD8 potentiating CaV2.3, and an interplay between KCTD8 and KCTD12b, shown with several techniques including very nice EM images and analysis, which however is completely separate from the effect of baclofen acting on GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors.</p><p>In trying nevertheless to combine the two stories, the authors have overcomplicated the message of their study, in my view.

The authors are using it at 1 µM. It may be relatively selective between calcium channels, but it also blocks certain K channels in the same concentration range, in fact 500 nM was used in slices to block A-type K currents (Kimm and Bean, 2014). It also affects other Ca channels and Na channels at concentrations below 1µM (Newcomb et al., 1998). How sure are the authors this blockade of other channels is not affecting their study ?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this important point. We agree that the concentration that we used in our acute slice preparation is higher than the concentrations used in the papers cited by the reviewer, which used either cell culture (Kimm and Bean, 2014) or oocyte preparations (Newcomb et al. 1998). Although slices were cut in the paper by Kimm and Bean 2014, they were only used to extract substantia nigra cells to prepare primary neuronal cultures, not for pharmacological experiments. An important consideration, in this respect, is the fact that SNX-482 is a peptide which may easily adhere to surfaces such as biological membranes, thereby potentially reducing its effective concentration considerably, particularly in acute brain slices. Use of SNX-482 in cell culture or oocytes naturally does not run into such issues as the pharmacological targets are readily exposed to the extracellular solution containing the drug. To reduce loss of SNX-482 as much as possible, we added 0.1 % BSA to the ACSF but it is still likely that the effective SNX-482 concentration inside the acute slice at the site of active terminals was considerably lower than 1 µM.</p><p>In addition, a block of A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels would be expected to increase membrane excitability and/or action potential half-width, both of which would result in increased neurotransmitter release. However, we did not observe increases in EPSC amplitudes in any of the SNX experiments, suggesting that the observed decrease in EPSC amplitudes by the application of SNX-482 was not mediated by an inhibition of A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels.</p><p>To test whether the decrease in EPSC amplitude caused by the application of SNX-482 resulted from a block of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> channels, we measured action potential properties in ventral MHb neurons in ACSF containing 0.1% BSA and in ACSF containing 0.1% BSA + 1 µM SNX-482. We defined the action potential peak time as the time between the threshold potential and the action potential peak. Action potential full-width at half maximum was measured as the time between the rising and falling phase of the action potential at half of the maximal action potential amplitude. SNX-482 did not significantly affect action potential peak times or full-widths at half maximum in ventral MHb neurons (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A; peak times: control: 0.86 ± 0.03 ms, n = 3; SNX-482: 0.93 ± 0.05 ms, n = 4; t<sub>5</sub> = 1.083, P = 0.3282; full-widths: control 1.08 ± 0.07 ms, n = 3; SNX-482: 1.06 ± 0.03 ms, n = 4, t<sub>5</sub> = 0.3852, P = 0.7159; unpaired t-test), suggesting that the reduction of neurotransmitter release by SNX-482 was not caused by a blockade of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> channels. This part was added to the Results section on page 6, starting from line 107.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Line 104. You cannot say the two MHb-IPN pathways have different sensitivities to SNX482, as no dose response curve has been performed, and the difference between the pathways at the single dose studied may indicate the involvement of other Ca channels.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the poor wording. We removed this sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Similarly, in the Discussion, line 310 &quot;We confirmed that both dorsal MHb-IPN and ventral MHb-IPN pathways require Cav2.3 for transmitter release&quot;, is not completely correct, as how is release occurring for the ~50% SNX482-insensitive lateral epscs (Figure 1) ?</p></disp-quote><p>We changed this sentence to: “We confirmed that Cav2.3 is involved in mediating transmitter release at both MHb-IPN pathways, but only release at the ventral pathway exclusively relies on Cav2.3.” page 17, starting from line 364.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 8A needs correct labelling of the panels, with MW markers. I assume the top panel is KCTDs, but this is unclear as both CaV2.3 and KCTDs have Flag tags, which is an unusual way of performing the experiment. The entire blot should be shown for the top panel, as blotting with Flag would show both KCTDs and CaV2.3.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight and added MW markers to the co-IP blots, now moved to Figure 2. Unfortunately, due to substantial differences in molecular weight, KCTDs and Cav2.3 cannot be run on the same gels because the high molecular weight of Cav2.3 requires a less dense gel which would not allow for adequate band separation of the significantly smaller KCTDs, while in gels with higher density that allow us to better visualize the size differences between the individual KCTDs, large molecules like Cav2.3 get trapped at the pore openings. Furthermore, since KCTDs are expressed stronger than Cav2.3, two separate gels were necessary to avoid overexposure of KCTD bands.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. If there is co-ip between CaV2.3 and KCTD8/12b, should there be actual co-localization observed in the EM images? Can this be measured?.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a very important consideration. In freeze-fracture replica labeling, proteins that are closely associated with the membrane, such as transmembrane proteins or membrane-anchored proteins, get trapped in a carbon layer and remain there even after all remaining tissue is digested by SDS. Therefore, KCTDs, which are cytosolic proteins, are undetectable in replica unless they are covalently bound by chemical fixation to another membrane–integrated protein and getting trapped together in the carbon. As we readily detect them at high densities in the active zone, it very likely that the vast majority of detected KCTDs in replica are actually bound to either GBRs or Cav2.3.</p><p>Another important aspect is that it is difficult to label multiple proteins that are bound to each other in a complex because a) the protein complex might mask epitopes and b) primary/secondary antibodies with gold conjugates might hamper the binding of additional antibodies to another protein in the same complex in a process called steric hindrance.</p><p>Nevertheless, we made use of this steric hindrance effect to confirm the co-localization of KCTD8 and Cav2.3 in the active zone. We found that pre-incubation with anti-KCTD8 antibodies in KCTD12b KO mice led to a reduction in Cav2.3 labeling densities in the active zone of only ventral but not lateral MHb terminals. Although this does not prove that the two proteins are directly bound to each other, it suggests that they are in close proximity (&lt;16 nm, two times IgG size of 8 nm) to each other. The following part was added to the Results section on page 16, starting from line 340:</p><p>“In order to examine further the spatial proximity of Cav2.3 to KCTD8, we tested whether steric hindrance of antibodies bound to KCTD8 might interfere with labeling of Cav2.3.

In rostral IPN synapses, we found that pre-incubation significantly reduced Cav2.3 labeling densities in the AZ but not the peri- or extrasynaptic regions (Figure 7D; main effect of synaptic distribution: F<sub>4, 880</sub> = 31.42, P &lt; 0.0001; control AZ vs. pre-incubation AZ: P = 0.0006; two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test). In the lateral IPN, pre-incubation significantly reduced Cav2.3 labeling density only in the peri-synaptic region (Figure 7E; main effect of synaptic distribution: F<sub>4, 890</sub> = 39.01; control &lt;50 nm vs. pre-incubation &lt;50 nm: P = 0.0320).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 8c, how selective is the augmentation with KCTD8 and CaV2.3, ie does it also occur for any other Ca channels? It is possible that a low level of other presynaptic Ca channels might be also augmented by KCTD8 in these terminals, increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question and we do not have a definite answer to it. However, we did not observe any EPSC responses in rostral IPN neurons in Cav2.3 KO mice, suggesting that Cav2.3 is the sole Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel mediating release at this pathway. Although the increase in release probability at ventral MHb terminals is likely caused by a direct effect of KCTD8 on Cav2.3, it is unknown whether other Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel subtypes involved in transmitter release from dorsal MHb terminals are equally affected by KCTD8. We added this to the discussion on page 20, starting from line 435.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. If this large augmentation of CaV2.3 currents by KCTD8 plays a physiological role should the epsc's in the KCTD8 KO mice be reduced? I cannot see this basic result, although I note the release probability is indeed reduced.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important question. It is generally difficult to quantify absolute amplitudes of electrically evoked EPSCs as they depend largely on the stimulation intensity. Therefore, we used the variance mean analysis to show the reduced release probability in KCTD8 KO mice. An important indication that KCTD8 functionally increases synaptic strength was the observation that viral overexpression of KCTD8 in WT ventral MHb neurons significantly lowered PPR values compared with EGFP controls. This result suggests that KCTD8 and KCTD12b may be in a state of dynamic balance. Creating an imbalance appears to result in alterations in synaptic strength.

However, the data currently submitted fail to answer the two major questions, namely the underlying mechanisms and the physiological relevance of GABA-B receptor-mediated modulation. A lot of efforts are devoted in characterizing key protein expression in various K<sup>+</sup> channel tetramerization domain-containing (KCTD) proteins.

Data on the action of SNX-482 on evoked EPSCs need refinement. The presynaptic fibers of the fasciculus retroflexus were electrically stimulated and recordings were made in the rostral IPN. In contrast, stimulation of dorsal fibers were obtained via optogenetic stimulation and responses were recorded in the lateral IPN. The effect of SNX-482 was stronger at the former versus the latter synapses. However, this result is at odds with similar Cav2.3 densities in the active zones of dorsal and ventral MHb terminals. The Authors discussed this issue, and I acknowledged this mis-match in their data. Nevertheless, the problem remains: a quantitative comparison between drug modulation of synaptic responses evoked by electrical versus optogenetic stimulation is a poor choice. Amongst various problems, several recent papers report the non-physiological high release probability often caused by optogenetic stimulation of presynaptic fibers that contrasts with the electrical stimulation method. This discrepancy would affect the results obtained with SNX-482. This set of experiments should be repeated by using more uniform experimental conditions in the two synaptic pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that using two separate ways of stimulation for the two pathways was not ideal. We initially used optogenetics to study lateral IPN inputs because it was challenging to keep the fiber tract intact all the way to the lateral IPN. This is due to the fact that although MHb axons project linearly from the MHb to the IPN, they enter the IPN from the anterior side. Thus, to solve this problem, we have newly established thick-slice preparations (1 mm) cut at a 54° angle, which keep the most anterior portion of the IPN intact within the slice and allow reliable stimulation of the fasciculus retroflexus (FR). In this preparation we stimulated FR just below the MHb, 2 – 3 mm distal to the IPN, and could obtain EPSC responses in both rostral and lateral IPN neurons (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1B – D). We used a 10 Hz stimulus train rather than a single stimulus in order to not miss potentially weaker responses due to the absence of Cav2.3. The following was added to the Results section on page 6 starting from line 112:</p><p>“To corroborate the involvement of Cav2.3 in release from MHb terminals, we next performed electrical stimulation of the MHb-derived fiber tract, the fasciculus retroflexus (FR), in Cav2.3 KO mice and recorded EPSCs in rostral and lateral IPN neurons. To obtain maximally intact FR, slices were cut at 1 mm thickness which allowed for the stimulation of the fiber tract at a distance of 2 – 3 mm from the IPN (Figure 1H, I). […] Overall, these results suggest that ventral MHb terminals rely exclusively on Cav2.3 for release, whereas dorsal MHb terminals rely on Cav2.3 and additional Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, a serious comparison of the efficacy of SNX-482 should rely on testing at least three different drug concentrations for each synapse. Furthermore, normalization assuring that approximatively an equal number of presynaptic fibers are stimulated at each synaptic connection should be employed. What ever methods of presynaptic stimulation will be used, optical or electrical, test of selective stimulation of fibers should be also performed.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in our response to the reviewer’s initial concern (1.), we tested the effect of SNX-482 using fiber tract electrical stimulation in WT mice and directly compared EPSC responses in rostral and lateral IPN neurons in the same slice of Cav2.3 KO mice using electrical fiber tract stimulation. Stimulation selectivity was confirmed by application of baclofen in WT slices (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D), which potentiated EPSCs when recording from rostral IPN neurons and inhibited EPSC when recording from lateral IPN neurons. We also compared the time courses of SNX-482-mediated EPSC reductions in lateral IPN for electrical and optogenetic stimulation in Figure 1L, confirming no significant difference between types of stimulation and no effect of Conotoxin application on EPSC amplitudes. This point was also added to the Results section on page 7, starting from line 136.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Baclofen still presynaptically potentiated EPSCs in KCTD KO mice. However, loss of KCTD12b impaired GABABR action probably via increasing release probability and occlusion. In contrast, lack of KCTD8 reduces release probability. But what about the effects of GABABR modulation? Is baclofen more powerful at MH synapses in KCTD8 KO?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not find a significant difference in baclofen-mediated potentiation between WT and KCTD8 KO mice, suggesting that the relatively minor reduction in release probability in KCTD8 KO mice did not affect GBR-mediated enhancement of release. Since the reviewers felt that our manuscript focused too much on GBR-mediated enhancement instead of the effect of KCTDs on basal release, we removed discussion and analysis of the potential connection between basal release and baclofen-mediated enhancement. We now only mention that GBR-mediated potentiation was still intact in all KCTD KO mice and moved the corresponding result to the supplement (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The manuscript lacks to experimentally demonstrate that GABA-B receptor potentiation of ventral MH and the rostral interpeduncular nucleus synapses is physiologically relevant. This should be addressed by using physiologically salient repetitive stimulation in control and in the presence of GABA-B R antagonists. It would be also interesting to test the GABA-B R ligands on evoked EPSPs followed by IPSPs to see the comprehensive pharmacological effects on both excitation and inhibition. At present none of these important points are addressed and this reduces the impact of the data currently submitted.</p></disp-quote><p>We were unfortunately unable to unravel the exact mechanism underlying the GBR-mediated enhancement of release in our original manuscript but instead found a surprising involvement of KCTDs with Cav2.3 that modulate basal release. As the reviewers suggested, we therefore shifted our focus away from potential GBR mechanisms, and now mostly focus on the role of KCTDs in basal release.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The revised manuscript has been significantly improved by refocusing the study on the role for KCTDs on neurotransmitter release. Several additional experiments have been performed, including the comparisons of Cav2.3-dependence of synaptic transmission between the two distinct medial habenula to IPN inputs by electrical stimulation, which has been made possible by the establishment of thick-slice preparation. New data lend further support to the conclusion that KCTD8 and KCTD12b directly interact with Cav2.3 and regulate release from ventral MHb terminals independently of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, where effectively KCTD12b serves to restrain release while the recruitment of KCTD8 to the active zone potentiates release by promoting Cav2.3 currents. Prior to accepting the manuscript for publication, a number of points require attention.</p><p>Figure 6F-G: the EPSC waveforms of some rescued currents appear to be quite different than one would expect.

Upon re-examination of the other recordings in this group, we did not consistently observe broader responses in KCTD8 overexpression experiments and therefore, replaced the corresponding example trace with one showing a more representative decay time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the LV-hSyn-KCTD12b current appears to have a delayed onset. Are these examples representative of the population? If so, are these effects a result of over-expression, or more an indicator of the distinct roles of these two KCTD proteins?</p></disp-quote><p>Concerning the slightly delayed onset in the KCTD12b rescue trace: This delay might be influenced by the position of the stimulating electrode relative to the recorded neuron. Inside the IPN, habenula-derived axons can be unmyelinated and therefore responses may occur slightly faster or slower depending on this distance. Although we try to keep recording conditions similar for all experiments, random biological variation cannot be completely controlled. Upon re-examination of the other recordings, we did not consistently observe delayed responses in LV-hSyn-KCTD12b injected mice, suggesting a KCTD-independent effect, and we replaced the example trace with one showing a more representative response onset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the introduction (Line 47 or Line 53-54), it would be clearer to readers who may not necessarily be familiar with KCTDs if the authors could briefly state the nature of the molecular difference especially between KCTD12 and KCTD12b.</p></disp-quote><p>In accordance with this suggestion, we rewrote the second paragraph of the introduction:</p><p>“Four KCTD subunits, KCTD8, 12, 12b and 16, serve as auxiliary GBR subunits (Schwenk et al., 2010).
