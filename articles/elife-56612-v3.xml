This subject is difficult to investigate as it requires the identification of specific metabolic effects within the dynamic system of activated cells in a process of rapid transformation and rewiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">MacIver et al., 2013</xref>). This is important field of research, since hypoxemia, reduced blood oxygen saturation, and tissue hypoxia are associated with multiple respiratory and circulatory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congenital heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kent et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kaskinen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">O'Brien and Smith, 1994</xref>). Reportedly, such patients also exhibit a higher prevalence of viral infections compared to healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaw et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kherad et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have examined how hypoxia affects cell fate determination in fully activated effector T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doedens et al., 2013</xref>). Some have found that hypoxic conditions contribute to the formation of long-lasting effector cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Phan and Goldrath, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Phan et al., 2016</xref>). Other studies have demonstrated that respiratory restriction, mediated by inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthase, arrests T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). This is particularly interesting because activated T cells undergo an early shift in cell metabolism, in parallel to activation stimuli, switching to aerobic glycolysis to support their expansion and cytotoxic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gubser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van der Windt et al., 2013</xref>). However, it remains unclear what mechanism underlies the inhibition of T cell activation under hypoxic conditions.</p><p>In the present study, we explored the effects of chronic systemic hypoxia on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response. To assess the possible effects of systemic hypoxia in vivo, we challenged mice with a lentivirus under conditions simulating COPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yu et al., 1999</xref>), and found that low oxygen availability diminished CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response. Similarly, in vitro hypoxic conditions led to complete arrest of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response, but only marginally inhibited fully activated cells. To further characterize the metabolic mechanism underlying T cell arrest, we used the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin, which enables differentiation between indirect and direct effects of respiratory restriction. Incubation with oligomycin at different time-points post-stimuli revealed that after mitochondrial-biogenesis, atÂ ~12 hr post-stimuli, activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells become independent of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Next, to elucidate why CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are sensitive to respiratory restriction prior to mitochondrial-biogenesis, we examined cytoplasmic response to respiratory restriction via metabolic profiling and p-AMPK analysis. ThisÂ analysisÂ revealed that respiratory restriction prior to mitochondrial-biogenesis had only a marginal effect on cytoplasmic function. Accordingly, the inhibition of mitochondrial ATP transport to the cytoplasm through genetic alteration or pharmacological treatment had little effect on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation. In contrast, respiratory restriction prior to T cell mitochondrial-biogenesis, yielded an energetic crisis within the mitochondrial matrix, manifested by dysfunctional mitochondrial RNA processing and protein import. Moreover, oligomycin-treated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells could be rescued using the proton ionophore FCCP, which uncouples the electron transport chain from ATP synthase. Finally, comparative metabolic profiling of oligomycin-treated activated T cells following uncoupler rescue, revealed significantly increased generation of mitochondrial matrix-localized ATP via mitochondria-localized substrate-level phosphorylation. Overall, these findings establish that during early activation, OXPHOS is required primarily to provide ATP for mitochondrial remodeling. By applying these insights to our in vivo model, we demonstrated that the detrimental effects of hypoxia may be alleviated byÂ short oxygen resuscitation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Systemic chronic oxygen restriction inhibits CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation and response</title><p>Clinical chronic hypoxia is prevalent in multiple respiratory and circulatory diseases, and is associated with increased susceptibility to viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaw et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kherad et al., 2010</xref>).

In accordance with our in vivo findings and previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2013</xref>), naÃ¯ve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (T<sub>n</sub>) activated under hypoxic conditions exhibited reduced levels of the in vitro activation marker CD25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1IâJ</xref>) and diminished proliferative capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1KâL</xref>) compared to cells activated under atmospheric oxygen levels. Finally, to examine the relevance of our model system to human immunity, we activated human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells under either atmospheric oxygen levels or hypoxic conditions. As expected, and similar to the findings in mouse cells, human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells activated under hypoxic conditions exhibited a marked decrease in surface expression of CD25, and proliferative capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1DâG</xref>). Together, our findings demonstrate that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation is compromised during systemic chronic hypoxia.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Following mitochondrial remodeling, activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells become tolerant to inhibition of OXPHOS</title><p>Next, we aimed to investigate the oxygen-dependent mechanisms governing T cell transition from the naÃ¯ve to the activated state. It was previously demonstrated that although hypoxia negatively impacts naÃ¯ve T cell proliferation after activation, it does not significantly impact the proliferation or function of effector T cells. Moreover, some reports show that hypoxia can actually improve effector T cell functions in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doedens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gropper et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Makino et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vuillefroy de Silly et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). These findings suggest that T cells acquire hypoxia tolerance during their activation. Thus, defining the metabolic alterations between hypoxia-sensitive and hypoxia-resistance T cells could elucidate the inhibitory effects of systemic hypoxia on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation. To characterize this metabolic transition, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were activated in vitro and subjected to hypoxia at early (5 hr) and late (18 hr) time-points post-stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Notably, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exposed to hypoxia at the early time-point following activation exhibited impaired elevation of CD25 expression and decreased proliferative capacity.

To this end, we measured the level of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) as a marker for AMPK activation, which is a cytoplasmic sensor for energy homeostasis, in both T-Early and T-Late cells. Treatment with oligomycin, which is the typical positive control for AMPK activation, markedly increased the p-AMPK levels in treated naÃ¯ve T cells.Â Interestingly following activation oligomycin only marginally increased the level of p-AMPK in respect to untreated activated control. Importantly, the response to oligomycin was comparable between T-Early and T-Late cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Together, these results suggest that despite the important role of AMPK signaling in T cell metabolic adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blagih et al., 2015</xref>), it is not correlated with the inhibitory effects mediated by respiratory restriction in early activation. Further, the respiratory dependence during early T cell activation is not caused by an altered cellular response to reduced AMP levels in the cytoplasm.</p><p>Our findings to this point imply that activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have a unique capacity to avoid p-AMPK signaling in the presence of elevated AMP levels.

To investigate this possibility, we generated T cell-specific adenine nucleotide translocator 2 (ANT2 is encoded by the <italic>Slc25a5</italic> gene) knockout mice (refer to as ANT2ko) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2015</xref>).

To evaluate whether respiratory restriction promotes disturbance in matrix-localized RNA processing, we quantified the relative expression levels of unprocessed Rnr polycistronic mitochondrial RNA (unpmt-Rnr), as well as the ratio between unpmt-Rnr and its processed products, Rnr1 and Rnr2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rackham et al., 2016</xref>). Oligomycin treatment yielded markedly increased unpmt-Rnr levels in T-Early cells but not in T-Late cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). Accordingly, we found that the ratios between unpmt-Rnr and its cleaved products, Rnr1 or Rnr2, were further increased in oligomycin-treated T-Early cells compared to T-Late cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>During matrix ATP deficiency, the protein import machinery cannot pull nuclear-encoded matrix proteins. This protein import disturbance causes matrix proteins to misfold in the cytoplasm, leading to their degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chacinska et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, we next assessed whether respiratory restriction also resulted in the accumulation of ubiquitinated mitochondrial matrix proteins and, specifically, ubiquitinated matrix pre-proteins. T-Late and T-Early cells were treated with oligomycin or left untreated for 1Â hr. Then protein extracts from all samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-ubiquitin antibody, and assayed using mass spectrometry. As expected, in T-Early cells, acute oligomycin treatment significantly increased the amounts of at least two central matrix proteins when compared to controls without oligomycin treatment. Specifically, T-Early cells exhibited increased abundances of ubiquitinatedÂ mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and the CH60 chaperone, which plays a role in the folding and assembly of newly imported proteins in the mitochondria. In line with the partial tolerance to oligomycin observed during late activation, oligomycin-treated T-Late cells showed no substantial increase in ubiquitinatedÂ matrix proteins compared to untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M-N</xref> and itsÂ <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/67wnx/">sourceÂ data</ext-link>). Importantly, in all groups, the oligomycin-treated samples and controls did not significantly differ in the amounts of the mitochondrial inner-membrane proteins ANT2, ANT1, and CYC1, which do not require matrix ATP for mitochondrial localization. Furthermore, in samples from oligomycin-treated T-Early cells, we detected leader peptides of several mitochondrial proteins whose mitochondrial import depends on matrix ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C-D</xref>). In contrast, no relevant leader peptides were detected in any of the untreated samples or in the oligomycin-treated T-Late samplesÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C-D</xref>). Taken together, these results reveal a matrix-specific energetic crisis following oligomycin mediated respiratory restriction during early CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation, and suggest that inhibition of TCA cycle and substrate-level phosphorylation may be the central inhibitory mechanism of respiratory restriction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>FCCP treatment rescues respiratory-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by stimulating matrix-localized substrate-level phosphorylation, elevating ATP, and reducing AMP/GMP concentrations</title><p>TCA-linked substrate-level phosphorylation is thought to fuel mitochondrial matrix activity, while ATP synthase-derived ATP is exported to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schwimmer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bochud-Allemann and Schneider, 2002</xref>). Oligomycin may indirectly lead to TCA cycle congestion, accumulation of intermediate metabolites, and blockade of matrix-based substrate-level phosphorylation. In this case, the addition of uncouplers to respiratory ATP-deprived T-Early cells could rescue the activation phenotype via TCA cycle stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, we first attempted to rescue oligomycin-treated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by uncoupling the respiratory chain using an effective concentration of trifluoromethoxy carbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone (FCCP), which is a potent uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. T-Early cells were treated with oligomycin, FCCP, both oligomycin and FCCP, or were left untreated. As expected, oligomycin treatment during early activation arrested CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation. FCCP treatment alone slightly inhibited CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation compared to control. Strikingly, treatment of stimulated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with both oligomycin and FCCP led to an almost complete rescue of CD25 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-B</xref>) and proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C-D</xref>) compared to the cells treated with only oligomycin. These key observations demonstrate that uncoupling the respiratory chain from ATP synthase rescues the respiratory-restricted T-Early cells, suggesting that the inhibitoryÂ mechanism that follows respiratory restriction is linked to a decrease in ATP concentration in the matrix compartment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>FCCP treatment rescues respiratory-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by stimulating matrix-localized substrate-level phosphorylation, elevating ATP, and reducing AMP/GMP concentrations.</title><p>(<bold>A-D</bold>) CellTrace-labeled splenocytes were stimulated using anti-CD3/28.

We investigated this possibility byÂ examining the levels of mono/di/tri-phosphonucleotides using metabolomics analysis. As expected, T-Early cells treated with oligomycin and FCCP exhibited significantly higher ATP and lower AMP/GMP concentrations compared to controls treated with only oligomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E-F</xref>).

While previous studies have suggested that there is a critical time window of mitochondrial activity for T cell activation, the mechanistic basis of this dependency has been unclear. In this study, Saragovi and colleagues demonstrate that mitochondrial respiration is critical during these first hours to enable TCA cycle activity and produce ATP within mitochondrial matrix to support mitochondrial-biogenesis. The authors show a detrimental effect of hypoxia on mitochondrial-biogenesis during T cell activation. They use oligomycin treatment to mimic respiratory restriction and find that ATP-dependent matrix processes, critical for mitochondrial-biogenesis, are impaired under respiratory restriction condition, leading to compromised T cell activation. Moreover, increased mitochondrial matrix-localized ATP via boosting substrate-level phosphorylation can partially rescue the defect upon respiratory restriction. Thus, they refute a common hypothesis that mitochondrial activity is critical for providing ATP to the cytosol, since inhibition of ATP export does not inhibit T cell activation. Lastly, they show that anti-viral responses under systemic oxygen restriction in vivo can be rescued by short exposure to atmospheric oxygen pressure. Thus, the authors provide convincing evidence to demonstrate the linkages between hypoxia, mitobiogenesis and T cell activation.</p><p>However, a number of major concerns, identified below, remain to be addressed in order to increase enthusiasm for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors use oligomycin treatment to establish respiratory restriction and mimic a hypoxic environment. However, it is unclear whether the impaired T cell activation coupled with ATP-deficiency and blocked mitobiogenesis upon oligomycin treatment is similar to the phenotypes observed under hypoxic conditions. It is therefore essential to examine if hypoxia also impairs T cell activation when encountered at early but not at later stages, and whether the mitobiogenesis and ATP-dependent matrix processes are also inhibited under hypoxic conditions.</p><p>Similarly, it is advisable to examine if oligomycin-mediated effects can also be reversed as hypoxic effects can be (Figure 6A-6D).</p><p>2) While the model chosen for in vivo studies is appropriate (Figures 1 and 6), the data provided require additions of further analysis of T cell activation and effector functions under the different experimental conditions used.</p><p>In Figure 1 and in Figure 6, which essentially repeats the experiment in Figure 1 and tests whether a short exposure to high oxygen can rescue T cell activation under hypoxia, the authors show reduction in CD62L expression as the only parameter of T cell activation. It will be more convincing to include additional activation markers (such as CD25, CD69), especially since those are used in other experiments presented in the paper, and the sporadic usage of different markers is confusing. Assays for T cell proliferation (using Ki67, for example) and effector functions (IFNÎ³, TNFa, GzB levels) under hypoxia are also advisable.</p><p>In the experiments for Figure 6 day 3 was chosen for normoxia; but using an earlier time point would be more congruent with the ~9 h in-vitro time window.</p><p>Finally, it would be important to test if mitobiogenesis is also rescued after short oxygen exposure, so as to further identify a specific time window for mitobiogenesis essential for T cell activation.</p><p>3) In order to enhance the observations on AMPK signaling (Figure 3), it would be useful to include treatment with AMPK inhibitors in order to conclude that activated AMPK signaling is independent of the impaired activation upon respiratory restriction.</p><p>4) While investigating the role of ATP transportation, it would be best to examine the activation phenotypes in ANT2-depleted or Bongkrekic acid-treated T-Early and T-Late T cells upon oligomycin treatment or hypoxia conditions Figures 3D-G).</p><p>5) The impaired cellular processes observed in T-Early, not in T-Late, T cells (Figure 4) could indicate either that mitochondrial-biogenesis is ongoing and essential for the early phase of T cell activation and is less critical in T-Late cells, or that these cellular processes in T-Late cells are independent of respiratory restriction. Data comparing these cellular processes in untreated T-Early and T-Late cells to test if mitobiogenesis has already declined in T-Late cells in comparison with T-Early cells would be useful to distinguish between these. Thus, for example, in Figure 4C, all groups could be normalised to the untreated 9 h group.</p><p>Similarly, with respect to the importance of mitobiogenesis in the development of tolerance, it would be useful to examine mitobiogenesis or mitochondrial mass in T-Early and T-Late cells in Figure 4A.</p><p>6) In the examination of cell size, CD25 expression and proliferation in oligomycin-treated T cells (Figure 2A), analyses of percentages of CD44- and CD25-positive cells and the expression levels of the activation markers in activated T cells would be very useful.</p><p>7) In Figure 6, there appears to be some confusion that needs clarification. The bar graph in Figure 6F shows higher levels of effector T cells (CD62L<sup>-</sup>) in mice kept under hypoxia, which is the opposite of what the authors claim. In Figure 6G, showing CD62L expression in antigen-specific CD8 T cells, the authors claim that the data are showing reduced CD62L expression in mice exposed to high oxygen. However, the difference in the presented histograms seem to be in the number of cells acquired.</p><p>8) The language in the manuscript is very difficult to follow, and revision would be very helpful. Careful editing is also needed; an example is of panels that are mentioned in the text but are missing from the figures (S3B-S3G).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Systemic hypoxia inhibits T cell response by limiting mitobiogenesis via matrix substrate-level phosphorylation arrest&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We chose to use oligomycin for two main reasons: 1. It provides a simple experimental system to test the immediate effects of respiratory restriction under multiple conditions. 2. as opposed to hypoxia, it allows to distinguish between the indirect effects mediated by the inhibition of the electron transport chain and the TCA cycle (MartÃ­nez-Reyes et al., 2016), and the direct effect, as a result of reduced mitochondrial ATP (Lee and OâBrien, 2010). It is worthy to mention that there are several papers that already showed that hypoxia leads to impaired activation of naÃ¯ve T cells in vitro, but none of them provided mechanistic insight that will explain why oxygen is necessary for activation of naÃ¯ve T cells. Applying oligomycin and later combination of oligomycin and FCCP allows a fine dissection of the direct role of oxygen in T cell activation. Hypoxia is an evolving process that leads to accumulative effects. When the experimental conditions were suitable, we repeated the experiment using a hypoxic chamber. However, due to multiple reasons such as oxygen pressure in the media, the hypoxic chamber method is not rapid enough to meet the requirements in some of the more mechanistic experiments. For example testing the immediate-direct influence of ATP-dependent matrix processes requires precise timing. Please note that these sets of experiments are performed by applying oligomycin to a very short period of ~1h. This cannot be done by applying hypoxic conditions.</p><p>Following the reviewers' comments we now provide the additional data as follow:</p><p>New Figure 2A-E: CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were activated in vitro and subjected to hypoxia at early and late time points post stimuli. Indeed, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that were exposed to hypoxia at an early time point (5h) following activation demonstrated an impaired elevation in CD25 expression and decreased proliferative capacity. These impairments were shown to be significantly improved in cells that were transferred to hypoxic conditions at a late time point (18h) following activation (Figure 2B-E). These results suggest that, similar to oligomycin-treatment, hypoxia impairs T cell activation when encountered at early but not at later stages.</p><p>New Figure 4A-D: using CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from mito-Dendra2 we show that the intensity of Dendra2 in activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells failed to be elevated when the cells were exposed to 1% oxygen 5 hours but not 18 hours following activation. These results demonstrate that, similar to oligomycin treatment, mitochondrial-biogenesis is inhibited under hypoxic conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, it is advisable to examine if oligomycin-mediated effects can also be reversed as hypoxic effects can be (Figure 6A-6D).</p></disp-quote><p>Oligomycin is an irreversible ATP synthase inhibitor (Matsuno-Yagi A, Hatefi Y. J Biol Chem. 1993;268(3):1539-45. PMID: 8380571). Therefore the effects of oligomycin cannot be reversed by simply washing it from the medium. However, we demonstrated that the effect on T cell activation mediated by oligomycin can be rescued by FCCP, suggesting that the effect of oligomycin on cellular respiration may be reversible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the model chosen for in vivo studies is appropriate (Figures 1 and 6), the data provided require additions of further analysis of T cell activation and effector functions under the different experimental conditions used.</p><p>In Figure 1 and in Figure 6, which essentially repeats the experiment in Figure 1 and tests whether a short exposure to high oxygen can rescue T cell activation under hypoxia, the authors show reduction in CD62L expression as the only parameter of T cell activation.

We do believe that since it is the first time that the influence of systemic low oxygen levels on T cell priming in vivo is tested, a more careful look is needed. Therefore, we invested significant resources to substantially improve the in vivo model and the subsequent phenotyping of antigen specific T cells activation status.</p><p>To better examine the priming of anti-ova CD8 T cells we modified the model from our first submission in line with a method previously used to test T cell priming in response to vaccination with lentivirus, Furmanov et al, 2010 and Furmanov et al., 2013. This model entails the injection of the OVA-lentivirus into ear pinna, intradermally. CD8 T cells activation status could then be measured by extracting cells from the deep cervical lymph nodes, which was shown to specifically drain the ear pinna. The adjusted model offered a more rapid, simple, robust method to characterize T cell activation in respect to IM immunization. Importantly the new model allows picking an experimental time frame similar to the one used in vitro.</p><p>Using this model we repeated all the in vivo experiments and completely revised both Figures 1 and 6 to include CD25, CD44, and CD62L as activation markers and Ki67/CellTrace as a marker for proliferation of the ova specific T cells. We couldn't observe CD69 elevation in our in vivo model. Most probably since CD69 elevation in T cells is a temporary event, peaks at 24 h post-activation, begin to decrease after 48h and almost entirely diminished after 96-120 h from activation. We therefore, for the sake of coherence, thought to exclude CD69 from our analysis both in vivo and in vitro. The new results are presented now in the revised Figures 1A-H, S1-C, 6K-Q, and S7A-B. Together with the experiments conducted for the first version we believe we present compelling evidence that CD8 T cell activation is compromised under systemic hypoxia.</p><p>To account for the influence of systemic exposure to low oxygen on T cell proliferation and mitochondrial-biogenesis we further developed our in vivo model. Mice were primed with LV-OVA. Three days after the viral challenge, mice were adoptively-transferred with CellTrace-labeled splenocytes from OT1/mito-Dendra2 double transgenic mice. Mice were then either kept in 8% oxygen levels for 24 hours and then transferred to atmospheric oxygen pressure for another 48 hours, or continuously kept for 72 hours in atmospheric or 8% oxygen levels. Using this approach we could directly show that low oxygen levels lead to impaired antigen-specific T cell proliferation and mitochondrial-biogenesis by analyzing CellTrace and Dendra2 intensities respectively. This key finding demonstrates that effects caused by systemic hypoxia on T cell activation are reversible and supports the notion that a short exposure to atmospheric oxygen pressure can rescue hypoxic T cells. The new results are presented now in the revised Figures 6F-J.</p><p>Numeros studies examined the effect of hypoxia on effector function of T cells. The primary focus of this paper is to understand how systemic hypoxia mechanistically affects CD8 T cell priming. We therefore thought that screening effector molecules (cytokines, grenzym), either in vitro or in vivo, will be a distraction from the primary focus of the paper. Importantly, effector molecules secretion is localized at the site of inflammation, our model was designed to examine cells in the draining lymph nodes. These CD8 T cell samples are not suitable for effector molecules phenotyping. Finally, examination of effector molecules in the small population of cells that did activate under systemic hypoxia will represent a biased phenotyping of selective cells. We therefore ask to leave effector molecules phenotyping out of the current paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In order to enhance the observations on AMPK signaling (Figure 3), it would be useful to include treatment with AMPK inhibitors in order to conclude that activated AMPK signaling is independent of the impaired activation upon respiratory restriction.</p></disp-quote><p>We used p-AMPK to show that the lack of ATP is not sensed differently in T-Late and T-Early and therefore is not correlated with impaired activation of T-Early. Nevertheless, following the reviewers' comment we treated T cells at different time points following activation with Compound C (also called dorsomorphin) an AMPK inhibitor. Unfortunately, naÃ¯ve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, T-Early, and T-Late cells all died following the treatment. These results indicate that both fully-activated and naÃ¯ve T cells require functional AMPK to complete their activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) While investigating the role of ATP transportation, it would be best to examine the activation phenotypes in ANT2-depleted or Bongkrekic acid-treated T-Early and T-Late T cells upon oligomycin treatment or hypoxia conditions Figures 3D-G).</p></disp-quote><p>The revised Figures 3D-G now include oligomycin treatment of ANT2KO cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The impaired cellular processes observed in T-Early, not in T-Late, T cells (Figure 4) could indicate either that mitochondrial-biogenesis is ongoing and essential for the early phase of T cell activation and is less critical in T-Late cells, or that these cellular processes in T-Late cells are independent of respiratory restriction. Data comparing these cellular processes in untreated T-Early and T-Late cells to test if mitobiogenesis has already declined in T-Late cells in comparison with T-Early cells would be useful to distinguish between these. Thus, for example, in Figure 4C, all groups could be normalised to the untreated 9 h group.</p><p>Similarly, with respect to the importance of mitobiogenesis in the development of tolerance, it would be useful to examine mitobiogenesis or mitochondrial mass in T-Early and T-Late cells in Figure 4A.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewers' comments, we added new data which include:</p><p>1) Influence of hypoxia on mitobiogenesis in T-Early: mtDendra2-derived derived CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells transferred to hypoxic chamber 5h after activation demonstrated a significant reduction in Dendra2 intensity in comparison to cells (Figure 4C-D).</p><p>2) Influence of oligomycin treatment on mitobiogenesis in T-Early: at early CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation abrogated activation (Figure 4E-F) and inhibited the increase in mitochondrial mass observed in control mtDendra2-derived CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Figure 4G-H).</p><p>3) Influence of oligomycin treatment on mitobiogenesis in T-Late with respect to their proliferation status: we observed a substantially higher Dendra2 intensity in proliferating T-Late with respect to undivided T-Late (Figure 4I).</p><p>Overall these findings support the conclusion that respiratory restriction inhibits activation by disrupting mitochondrial-biogenesis in T-Early. Notably, we observed no reduction in dendra2 signal following oligomycin treatment in proliferating T-Late, suggesting that T-Late cells maintain mitochondrial-biogenesis during cell division independent of oxygen levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the examination of cell size, CD25 expression and proliferation in oligomycin-treated T cells (Figure 2A), analyses of percentages of CD44- and CD25-positive cells and the expression levels of the activation markers in activated T cells would be very useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised Figures, 1I-J, S1D-E, 2B-C, 2G-H, 4A-B, 4E-F, 5A-B, and 6B-C, to include representative flow cytometry plots of FSC vs. CD25 gated on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We included gates that will show the % of the CD25+ cells and added bar graphs that will show a summary of the % CD25+ cells in all of the replicates.</p><p>As for the CD44 staining: since we have redone all of the in vivo experiments we included CD44 staining. Our initial in vitro analyses did not include CD44. Therefore adding CD44 as an additional activation marker will require to repeat most of our in vitro experiments. Importantly, CD44 is elevated late in the activation process in vitro and highly expressed in mature naive, memory-like cells, independent of activation signal. Given CD44 ambiguity as an activation marker we ask not to include CD44 as a marker for activation to our in vitro analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 6, there appears to be some confusion that needs clarification. The bar graph in Figure 6F shows higher levels of effector T cells (CD62L-) in mice kept under hypoxia, which is the opposite of what the authors claim. In Figure 6G, showing CD62L expression in antigen-specific CD8 T cells, the authors claim that the data are showing reduced CD62L expression in mice exposed to high oxygen. However, the difference in the presented histograms seem to be in the number of cells acquired.</p></disp-quote><p>We truly apologize for this mistake. As we have redone the entire in-vivo experimentation using a new model we now present totally revised Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The language in the manuscript is very difficult to follow, and revision would be very helpful. Careful editing is also needed; an example is of panels that are mentioned in the text but are missing from the figures (S3B-S3G).</p></disp-quote><p>The comments are well taken. We revised the manuscripts and sent it to a professional editing.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) The use of oligomycin to mimic hypoxia remains a problem, since it does not simply mimic hypoxia. If it can be achieved, it is very advisable to perform these experiments with hypoxia. At the very least, the conclusions of this manuscript should be toned down substantially in the interim.</p></disp-quote><p>We used Oligomycin to distinguish between the indirect effects mediated by the inhibition of the electron transport chain and the TCA cycle, and the direct effect, as a result of reduced mitochondrial ATP. This cannot be achieved using hypoxia. However, we do agree with the reviewers that Oligomycin does not simply mimic hypoxia, and therefore ideally some of these experiments should be performed under hypoxic conditions. Specifically, it could be interesting to examine whether ATP-dependent matrix processes are also inhibited under hypoxic conditions. However, in practice, these experiments will require the development of complex new protocols and the acquisition of suitable devices. The major challenge in conducting these experiments under hypoxic conditions is to capture the immediate effects of hypoxia, 1-2 hours post-induction. The time taken for hypoxia to be induced varies due to multiple factors such as medium oxygen saturation, volume, chamber pressure, etc. As with other T cell signaling experiments, the result is dependent on a robust and homogeneous readout. This is hard to achieve with hypoxic chamber settings. We are currently working to develop the protocols and settings required to perform the suggested experiments and intend to explore this issue further in our follow up work.</p><p>As for our current work, we followed the reviewer request to tone down substantially the conclusions by adding the following remark in the Discussion: &quot;Notably, some of these mechanistic observations regarding the inhibitory effect mediated by an acute respiratory restriction on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation were based on the application of oligomycin. Since oligomycin, only partially mimics hypoxia, follow-up work should look further into mechanistic effects induced by hypoxia induction.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The cell death of early activated naive T cells induced by compound C may be a dosage-related artificial result. It is not clear whether the authors examine different doses. Some controls should be included to make the conclusion made. At the very least, the authors need to tone done their conclusions of these data in the interim.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to note that AMPK signaling is not the focus of this current study. We used AMPK activation only as a marker, a proxy for the sensing of low ATP, high AMP levels in the cytosol. We note that AMPK signaling is important for T cell activation and metabolic adaptation. However, we state that under our specific experimental conditions AMPK activation levels in oligomycin-treated T-Early and T-Late cells are similar. We then claim that AMPK activation is not correlated with T-Early cells' sensitivity to respiratory restriction. Our observation that acute AMPK inhibition by Compound C treatment (we used several concentrations, 1, 5, 10, and 20 ÂµM) leads to T cell death is in line with previous a study, Rao et al., 2016. showed that Compound C promotes, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling-induced T cell death in an AMPK-dependent manner. Moreover, this result actually emphasizes that AMPK activation is a key component in the metabolic adaptation of T cells and highly supports a previous study from Blagih et al., 2015. We agree that our observation highlights the need to further assess the role of AMPK in T cells metabolic adaptation under chronic hypoxia conditions. To this end, we aim to generate T cell-specific AMPK knockout mice that we think will be a much more suitable tool than AMPK inhibitors.</p><p>As for our current work, we followed the reviewer request to tone down substantially the conclusions by stating in the Results section that our &quot;results suggest that despite the important role of AMPK signaling in T cell metabolic adaptation (Blagih et al., 2015), it is not correlated with the inhibitory effects mediated by respiratory restriction in early activation&quot;.</p></body></sub-article></article>
