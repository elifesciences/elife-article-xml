differentiation, a relatively poorly understood process. Here, we describe a mechanism whereby the neurotrophic factor NGF and the transcription factor Runx1 coordinate postmitotic differentiation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors, a major nociceptor subtype. We show that the integrity of a Runx1/CBFβ holocomplex is crucial for NGF-dependent nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. NGF signals through the ERK/MAPK pathway to promote expression of <italic>Cbfb</italic> but not <italic>Runx1</italic> prior to maturation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors. In contrast, transcriptional initiation of <italic>Runx1</italic> in nonpeptidergic nociceptor precursors is dependent on the homeodomain transcription factor Islet1, which is largely dispensable for <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression. Thus, an NGF/TrkA-MAPK-CBFβ pathway converges with Islet1-Runx1 signaling to promote Runx1/CBFβ holocomplex formation and nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. Convergence of extrinsic and intrinsic signals to control heterodimeric transcription factor complex formation provides a robust mechanism for postmitotic neuronal subtype specification.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10874.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10874.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10874.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals detect and respond to their environment using their sensory nervous system, which forms through a complex, multi-step process. A precursor nerve cell’s fate is set early in its development, and determines the different nerve types it can become. As development progresses, sensory nerve cells develop further into distinct subtypes that perform particular tasks, such as responding to touch or pain.</p><p>Nociceptors are the specialised sensory nerves that respond to potentially harmful stimuli. They form two distinct subtypes: peptidergic nerves detect potentially dangerous temperatures, whereas non-peptidergic nerves detect potentially dangerous mechanical sensations. Both subtypes originate from the same precursor nerve cell and both initially depend on an external molecule called NGF for their development and survival. During their development, non-peptidergic neurons stop responding to NGF and start producing a protein called Runx1, considered to be the ‘master regulator’ of non-peptidergic nerve cell development. Runx1 works by forming a complex with another protein called CBFbβ, and this complex activates a program of gene expression that is specific to non-peptidergic nerves. However it was unclear how an external signal, like NGF, can coordinate with or influence a nerve cell’s internal genetic program during the nerve’s development. It was also not known whether NGF and Runx1 interact with each other.</p><p>By studying non-peptidergic nerve cell development in mice that lack NGF, Runx1 and other associated proteins, Huang et al. have now established the sequence of events that regulate the development of this nerve cell subtype. Two signalling pathways converge to switch on non-peptidergic nerve cell development. An NGF-driven signalling pathway activates the production of CBFβ, while another protein binds to the Runx1 gene to switch it on. This leads to the production of the Runx1 and CBFβ proteins that complex together to activate the non-peptidergic neuronal genetic program.</p><p>These findings demonstrate how two different mechanisms converge to produce the component parts of a complex, which then activates a genetic program that drives the development of a particular neuronal subtype. Whether this mechanism is involved in determining the fate of other cell types remains a question for future work.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10874.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10874.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>NGF</kwd><kwd>Runx1/CBFB</kwd><kwd>nociceptor differentiation</kwd><kwd>convergence of extrinsic and intrinsic factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS34814</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ginty</surname><given-names>David D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001391</institution-id><institution>Whitehall Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2010-08-61</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01EY022409</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS064933</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Eric E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The extrinsic cue NGF and the intrinsic signal Islet1 converge at the level of the Runx1/CBFβ transcription factor complex formation to promote differentiation of a major nociceptor subtype.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal cell fate specification is a multistep process that can be broadly divided into two stages, early specification of neural progenitor cell identity and postmitotic differentiation of neuronal subtypes. A recurring theme in the early phase of neural progenitor specification of the vertebrate nervous system is that the interplay between intrinsic determinants and extrinsic signals governs neural cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fishell and Heintz, 2013</xref>). Indeed, cell fate choice of progenitor cells is determined by a combination of intrinsic genetic programs, which define the differentiation potential or the competence state of progenitors, and extrinsic cues, which influence the relative proportions of each cell type generated within the confines of a given competent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Livesey and Cepko, 2001</xref>). Our understanding of the mechanisms of postmitotic differentiation of neuronal subtypes, on the other hand, is rather limited, and thus the relative contributions of extrinsic and intrinsic signals, and their mechanisms of interplay during late phases of cell fate determination, remain poorly understood.</p><p>Primary sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) are pseudo-unipolar neurons that extend one axonal branch to the spinal cord and the other to peripheral targets such as the skin. The existence of a large number of functionally specialized DRG sensory neuron subtypes, each endowed with unique morphological and physiological properties enables the somatosensory system to encode diverse sensory information, including nociception, temperature, light touch, limb movement, and body position. DRG neurons can be classified into three major classes: nociceptors, which preferentially respond to noxious stimuli, pruritogenic stimuli, and temperature; mechanoreceptors, which respond to innocuous tactile sensations; and proprioceptors, which detect position and movement of the trunk and limbs. Each functional class is further subdivided into subtypes exhibiting distinct physiological, morphological, and molecular properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lallemend and Ernfors, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>). Since the same Neurogenin1-dependent progenitor population gives rise to the three principal DRG neuron types within a relatively short time window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frank and Sanes, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ma et al., 1999</xref>), specification of the diverse DRG neuron subtypes mainly takes place in postmitotic neurons. Therefore, DRG sensory neurons are particularly well suited for mechanistic studies of postmitotic differentiation of neuronal subtypes.</p><p>The differentiation of nociceptor precursors into nonpeptidergic and peptidergic nociceptors is a well-studied example of postmitotic sensory neuron subtype specification. These two nociceptor subtypes are molecularly, morphologically and functionally distinct. Peptidergic nociceptors are traditionally defined by expression of neuropeptides, such as CGRP and Substance P, while the majority of nonpeptidergic nociceptors have binding sites for the lectin IB4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mulderry et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Silverman and Kruger, 1990</xref>). More recently, a single cell transcriptome analysis led to the identification of four molecularly defined nonpeptidergic neuron subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>). Peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptor subtypes are further distinguished by their central and peripheral axonal projection patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Molliver et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zylka et al., 2005</xref>). Functionally, nonpeptidergic and peptidergic nociceptors are preferentially required for mechanical and thermal nociception, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavanaugh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCoy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mishra and Hoon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vulchanova et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Despite these differences, nonpeptidergic and peptidergic nociceptors derive from a common nociceptor precursor that expresses tropomyosin-receptor kinase A (TrkA), the receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), and both nociceptor subtypes require NGF–TrkA signaling for survival and development beginning at ~E12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crowley et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Silos-Santiago et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smeyne et al., 1994</xref>). A key developmental event that defines the segregation of nociceptor subtypes is the nonpeptidergic nociceptor-specific switch from NGF responsiveness to glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligand (GFL) responsiveness. This occurs by virtue of the upregulation of Ret and GDNF family <italic>receptor alpha receptors (</italic>GFRα), receptor components for GFL signaling, in nonpeptidergic nociceptors starting from E15.5, as well as postnatal extinction of TrkA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bennett et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Molliver and Snider, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Molliver et al., 1997</xref>). Interestingly, both NGF–TrkA and GFL–GFRα/Ret signaling are essential for postmitotic differentiation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors. Indeed, NGF–TrkA signaling is required for the acquisition of virtually all nonpeptidergic nociceptor-specific features, including expression of <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Gfra</italic>s, whereas GFL–GFRα/Ret signaling, in turn, plays a critical role in postnatal development of nonpeptidergic nociceptors, including expression of a subset of genes characteristic of mature nonpeptidergic nociceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patel et al., 2000</xref>). The mechanism by which NGF–TrkA signaling governs differentiation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors is unclear.</p><p>In addition to the extrinsic signals NGF and GFLs, intrinsic determinants of nonpeptidergic nociceptor fate have begun to be defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lopes et al., 2012</xref>). Most prominent is Runx1, a Runx family transcription factor whose expression is primarily restricted to nonpeptidergic nociceptors. Runx1 functions as a master regulator of the nonpeptidergic nociceptor lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshikawa et al., 2007</xref>). In mammals, Runx family proteins, which include Runx1, Runx2 and Runx3, are key regulators of hematopoietic, osteogenic, and immune cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Bruijn and Speck, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ducy et al., 1997</xref>). In those systems, Runx proteins function as heterodimers by forming complexes with CBFβ, a non-DNA-binding cofactor that enhances the DNA binding affinity and protein stability of Runx proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adya et al., 2000</xref>). In the peripheral nervous system, genetic ablation of Runx1 leads to a near complete loss of nonpeptidergic nociceptor-specific features and a concomitant expansion of neurons exhibiting a peptidergic nociceptor-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kramer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshikawa et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the dramatic consequences of NGF deficiency on nonpeptidergic-specific gene expression resemble those seen upon Runx1 ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2007</xref>). This observation suggests a potential interaction between the extrinsic signal NGF and the intrinsic factor Runx1 during nonpeptidergic nociceptor development and thus an opportunity to define mechanisms of interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic factors during postmitotic neuronal differentiation.</p><p>Here, we show that Runx1 controls nonpeptidergic nociceptor development primarily by acting downstream of NGF–TrkA signaling. NGF/TrkA regulates Runx1 function at least in part by promoting expression of CBFβ, which we show is an essential component of the Runx1/CBFβ complex during nonpeptidergic nociceptor development. Mechanistically, NGF–TrkA signaling controls Runx1/CBFβ complex formation through the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, which is both necessary and sufficient for <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression. On the other hand, Islet1, a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor, controls transcriptional initiation of <italic>Runx1</italic> but not <italic>Cbfb</italic>. These findings identify a novel NGF/TrkA–MAPK–CBFβ axis critical for the differentiation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors and reveal a mechanism by which convergence of extrinsic and intrinsic signals promotes formation of a heterodimeric transcription factor complex that instructs postmitotic neuronal subtype specification.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NGF and Runx1 are similarly required for initiation of nonpeptidergic nociceptor-specific gene expression</title><p>The differentiation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors requires the target-derived neurotrophic growth factor NGF as well as the transcription factor Runx1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2007</xref>). The phenotypic similarity exhibited by mice lacking NGF and those lacking Runx1 raises the intriguing possibility that NGF and Runx1 function in a common signaling pathway to control nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. To address this, we assessed the extent to which initiation of the nonpeptidergic phenotype is co-dependent on NGF and Runx1 during early stages of nociceptor development. We first sought to extend our understanding of Runx1-dependent nonpeptidergic nociceptor-specific genes using unbiased gene expression profiling of DRGs from <italic>Wnt1-Cre; Runx1<sup>f/f </sup>(Runx1 CKO</italic>) mice, previously characterized neural crest-specific <italic>Runx1</italic> conditional mutants and their littermate controls at E16.5, the onset of nonpeptidergic-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2006</xref>). Among the many genes with downregulated expression in <italic>Runx1CKO</italic> DRGs compared to controls, <italic>Ptprt, Myo1a</italic>, and <italic>Kif21b</italic> were shown to exhibit strong Runx1 dependence by in situ hybridization analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O–T</xref>). Further co-localization studies with Runx1 confirmed that their expression is primarily restricted to nonpeptidergic nociceptors (data not shown). We next compared the patterns of expression of these as well as additional, canonical nonpeptidergic nociceptor-specific genes between <italic>Runx1 CKO</italic> mice and mice lacking NGF at the same developmental stages by in situ hybridization. In order to study survival-independent functions of NGF, nociceptors are kept alive in the absence of NGF by co-deletion of <italic>Ngf</italic> and the proapoptotic gene <italic>Bax (Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/- </sup></italic>mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patel et al., 2000</xref>). In accordance with previous observations, expression of the nonpeptidergic nociceptor markers<italic> Mrgprd</italic> and <italic>Gfra2 </italic>was almost completely abolished in presumptive nonpeptidergic nociceptors of both <italic>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Runx1 CKO</italic> mice at P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D, K–N</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, newly identified nonpeptidergic-specific genes, including <italic>Ptprt, Myo1a</italic>, and <italic>Kif21b</italic>, exhibited dramatically reduced expression in neurons that would normally become nonpeptidergic nociceptors in <italic>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to littermate controls at P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–J</xref>), in a manner similar to that observed in <italic>Runx1 CKO</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O–T</xref>). Furthermore, impairment in expression of <italic>Mrgprd, Ptprt, Myo1a</italic>, and <italic>Kif21b</italic> was observed in <italic>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Runx1 CKO</italic> mice as early as E16.5, which is when their expression is normally initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, expression of <italic>Gfra2, Myo1a</italic>, and <italic>Kif21b</italic> in non-nociceptors was unaffected in <italic>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Runx1 CKO </italic>mice, thus explaining the residual expression observed in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, H, N, P</xref>).

Therefore, while NGF is required for initiation of <italic>Ret</italic> expression, Runx1 is only required at a later stage, for maintenance of <italic>Ret</italic> expression. We conclude that NGF and Runx1 are both required for initiation of expression of a large cohort of nonpeptidergic nociceptor-specific genes, with <italic>Ret</italic> being a notable exception.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Runx1 acts downstream of NGF signaling to control expression of nonpeptidergic nociceptor-specific genes</title><p>The finding that initiation of expression of most nonpeptidergic nociceptor-specific genes analyzed so far is dependent on both NGF and Runx1 suggests a model in which Runx1 is a downstream mediator of NGF signaling during maturation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors. Alternatively, Runx1 may indirectly control nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation by facilitating NGF signaling. In fact, the level of NGF signaling, as assessed by the fluorescent intensity of phospho-Trk (pTrk) immunostaining, is lower in <italic>Runx1 CKO</italic> DRG neurons relative to controls at P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>). This ability of Runx1 to sustain normal levels of TrkA activity is not simply due to an effect on TrkA expression, as TrkA levels in control and <italic>Runx1 CKO</italic> DRGs are indistinguishable, as determined by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>). However, since <italic>Ret</italic> expression, which is strongly dependent on NGF signaling in nonpeptidergic nociceptors, appears normal at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>), it is unlikely that diminished NGF signaling observed at P0 accounts for the profound deficits in initiation of expression of nonpeptidergic-specific genes in E16.5 <italic>Runx1 CKO</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nevertheless, to directly test the possibility that Runx1 controls maturation of nonpeptidergic nociceptors solely by modulating NGF signaling, we asked whether exogenous NGF can rescue nonpeptidergic nociceptor gene expression deficits in <italic>Runx1 CKO</italic> DRGs. This was addressed in two ways. First, the consequence of excess NGF was evaluated in vivo by in situ hybridization and real-time PCR analysis following intraperitoneal injections of NGF into neonatal mice. With the notable exception of <italic>Ret</italic>, whose expression was partially restored following NGF injection into <italic>Runx1 CKO</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J–L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>), we found a general and complete lack of effect of NGF administration on expression of nonpeptidergic-specific genes in <italic>Runx1 CKO</italic> DRGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). In a second series of experiments, dissociated DRG cultures from P0 control and <italic>Runx1 CKO</italic> animals were incubated in the presence or absence of NGF, and the effects of NGF on nonpeptidergic-specific gene expression were assessed by real-time PCR. Importantly, NGF treatment led to a robust increase in expression of the nonpeptidergic-specific genes, <italic>Mrgprd, Gfra2</italic>, and <italic>Ptprt</italic>, in wildtype neurons but not in Runx1-deficient neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M–O</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Ret</italic> expression was NGF-dependent in both control and Runx1-deficient neurons, albeit to a lesser extent in the absence of Runx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref>).

To address the mechanism by which Runx1 activity may be modulated by NGF, it was critical to first ask how Runx1 activity is normally controlled in DRG neurons. Outside of the nervous system, Runx family transcription factors function as heterodimers, forming complexes with a common non-DNA-binding cofactor CBFβ. CBFβ is indispensable for Runx1 activity in cells of the hematopoietic lineage because of its role in enhancing the DNA-binding activity and stability of Runx1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adya et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether CBFβ plays a similar role in DRG neurons to promote Runx1 function.</p><p>To determine whether CBFβ is expressed in DRG neurons at the appropriate time to form a complex with Runx1, its expression patterns at both the mRNA and protein levels during nociceptor development were assessed. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that <italic>Cbfb</italic> is expressed at varying levels, in the majority, if not all, DRG neurons over the entire time course of our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Due to a lack of CBFβ antibodies that work reliably for immunohistochemistry, we generated a <italic>Cbfb<sup>Flag</sup></italic> knockin mouse line, in which N-terminally Flag-tagged CBFβ protein (Flag-CBFβ) is produced from the endogenous <italic>Cbfb</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In<italic> Cbfb<sup>Flag</sup></italic> mice, the Flag antibody allows for specific detection of endogenous Flag-CBFβ, which appears to be expressed in nearly all DRG neurons, at varying levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). Double labeling of Flag and Runx1 showed overlap between CBFβ and Runx1 throughout nociceptor development suggesting a potential interaction between these two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>). It is noteworthy that CBFβ is broadly expressed and found in more than just Runx1<sup>+</sup> neurons, suggesting additional Runx1-independent CBFβ functions in the DRG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>). To test for a direct physical interaction between Runx1 and CBFβ in DRG neurons, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were done using a Flag antibody and extracts from DRGs of P0 <italic>Cbfb<sup>Flag/Flag</sup></italic> animals and wildtype littermate controls. Indeed, Runx1 is enriched in Flag immunoprecipitates from <italic>Cbfb<sup>Flag/Flag</sup></italic> animals but not wildtype animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

A similar strategy was used to generate a <italic>Runx1</italic> inducible knockout mouse model for direct comparison. Both <italic>Runx1<sup>CreER</sup>; Cbfb<sup>f/f </sup>and Runx1<sup>CreER/f</sup></italic> mice treated with postnatal tamoxifen were viable and indistinguishable from control littermates. However, following postnatal deletion of either <italic>Runx1 </italic>or <italic>Cbfb</italic>, we observed, during the third postnatal week, few or no tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)<sup>+ </sup> C-low threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs), a nonpeptidergic neuronal subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seal et al., 2009</xref>). Specifically, key features of C-LTMRs, including TH expression and longitudinal lanceolate endings in the periphery, as marked by expression of a Cre-dependent GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hippenmeyer et al., 2005</xref>), are nearly completely absent in mice lacking Runx1 or CBFβ at postnatal time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F–M</xref>). Similar phenotypes were previously reported in a different <italic>Runx1</italic> conditional mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lou et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, both Runx1 and CBFβ are required during early development for initiation of the nonpeptidergic nociceptor fate and at postnatal times for maturation of at least one specific nonpeptidergic neuronal subtype, the C-LTMR.</p><p>The phenocopy of <italic>Runx1</italic> and <italic>Cbfb</italic> mutants may be partly attributed to a dramatic defect in Runx1 protein expression in <italic>Cbfb CKO </italic>DRGs, as shown by immunostaining and western blot analysis at P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Q–S</xref>). This Runx1 protein deficit was evident as early as E13 (data not shown). <italic>Runx1</italic> mRNA expression, on the other hand, remained unchanged, if not increased, in <italic>Cbfb CKO</italic> DRGs compared to controls, as determined by both in situ hybridization and real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5T–V</xref>). These findings demonstrate a key role for CBFβ in the post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>Runx1</italic> expression, most likely at the level of protein stability. Together, these findings indicate that CBFβ and Runx1 are both essential for induction of the nonpeptidergic nociceptor fate and postnatal nonpeptidergic neuron subtype maturation, and that the CBFβ requirement may reflect its role in controlling the level and activity of Runx1 proteins.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10874.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>CBFβ is required for acquisition of molecular and morphological features of nonpeptidergic nociceptors.</title><p>(<bold>A<bold>–</bold>J</bold>) Expression of <italic>Mrgprd</italic> (Control, 26.9% ± 2.8%; <italic>Cbfb CKO</italic>, 0%), <italic>Gfra2</italic> (Control, 38.8% ± 2.8%; <italic>Cbfb CKO</italic>, 11.7% ± 1.9%), <italic>Ptprt</italic>, (Control, 31.9% ± 3.2%; <italic>Cbfb CKO</italic>, 7.1% ± 2.8%), <italic>Myo1a</italic> (Control, 26.9% ± 3.2%;<italic> Cbfb CKO</italic>, 5.6% ± 0.6%) and <italic>Kif21b</italic> (Control, 20.2% ± 0.1%;<italic> Cbfb CKO</italic>, 2.4% ± 0.5%) in control and <italic>Cbfb CKO</italic> DRGs at P0 by in situ hybridization analysis.

Since Runx1 and CBFβ are both necessary for nonpeptidergic neuron maturation, NGF could, in principle, control Runx1/CBFβ function by promoting the activity of Runx1, CBFβ or both. Considering the profound requirement of NGF for nonpeptidergic nociceptor gene expression, one possibility is that NGF promotes expression of <italic>Runx1, Cbfb</italic>, or both, thereby enabling Runx1/CBFβ complex formation, stabilization and function, and thus initiation of the nonpeptidergic nociceptor fate. We therefore examined expression of both <italic>Cbfb </italic>and<italic> Runx1 </italic>in DRGs of control and <italic>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals before and during the acquisition of the nonpeptidergic nociceptor fate. Interestingly, <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression was found to be sensitive to loss of NGF prior to specification of nonpeptidergic nociceptors. In fact, at E14.5, a time prior to expression of nonpeptidergic nociceptor-specific genes, <italic>Cbfb</italic> mRNA expression was significantly reduced in<italic> Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></italic> DRGs relative to controls, specifically in small-diameter nociceptor precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig6 fig6">Figure 6A, B, E</xref>). This <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression deficit in <italic>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></italic> small diameter DRG neurons becomes much more pronounced at later time stages, such as E16.5, the onset of observable deficits in nonpeptidergic-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Ntrk1<sup>-/-</sup>/Bax<sup>-/- </sup></italic>DRGsdisplayed reduced levels of <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression at P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig7">Figure 7H, I</xref>). The deficit of <italic>Cbfb</italic> mRNA expression was confirmed by real-time PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Considering the inability of this assay to distinguish between <italic>Cbfb</italic> expressed in nociceptors and that expressed in NGF-independent DRG neurons, such as proprioceptors, and non-neuronal cells of the ganglion, it is noteworthy that the real-time PCR measurements are an underestimation of the NGF dependence of <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression in developing nociceptors. We further addressed NGF-dependence of <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression at the protein level in two ways. First, Flag immunostaining on dissociated DRG cultures from P0 <italic>Cbfb<sup>Flag/+ </sup></italic> animals showed that NGF is essential for CBFβ protein expression in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–H</xref>). Second, when DRGs from P0 control and <italic>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></italic> animals that were also heterozygous for the <italic>Cbfb<sup>Flag</sup></italic> allele were acutely dissociated, the level of Flag immunoreactivity was significantly lower in <italic>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neurons compared to controls, suggesting NGF-dependence of CBFβ protein expression in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). <italic>Cbfb </italic>is also sensitive to the dose of NGF as exogenous NGF administered to wildtype neonates via intraperitoneal injection further potentiated <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Together<italic>, </italic>these findings identify NGF as a key regulator of <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression prior to the initiation of NGF-dependent nonpeptidergic-specific gene expression. On the other hand, <italic>Runx1</italic> mRNA levels are normal in <italic>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></italic> DRGs at E14.5, as determined by both in situ hybridization and real-time PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig6 fig6">Figure 6I, J, M</xref>), consistent with our previous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2007</xref>). It is only at later times, beginning at E16.5, that <italic>Runx1</italic> expression becomes affected, suggesting a late requirement of NGF for maintenance of <italic>Runx1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K–M</xref>). Consistent with the late NGF dependence of <italic>Runx1</italic> mRNA expression, Runx1 protein expression is unaffected in <italic>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>; Bax<sup>-/-</sup></italic> DRGs at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig6 fig6 fig6">Figure 6N, O, R, S</xref>). At E16.5, the level of Runx1 protein is significantly diminished without any change in the number of Runx1<sup>+ </sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6P–S</xref>). In view of the discrepancy between the dramatic nonpeptidergic phenotypes at E16.5 and the relatively modest deficit in <italic>Runx1</italic> expression at this time, upregulation of <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression by NGF is likely to be an important mechanism by which NGF enables Runx1 function during nonpeptidergic nociceptor development.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10874.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>NGF regulates the Runx1/CBFβ complex through differential control of <italic>Cbfb </italic>and<italic> Runx1 </italic>expression.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) In situ hybridization analysis of <italic>Cbfb </italic>expression in control and <italic>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>Bax<sup>-/-</sup></italic> DRGs at E14.5 shows a significant reduction in the level of transcripts in small diameter neurons that correspond to prospective nociceptors in <italic>Ngf<sup>-/-</sup>Bax<sup>-/-</sup></italic> DRGs compared to controls.

The canonical ERK1/2 signaling cascade represents a likely candidate because this is a major NGF–TrkA effector pathway, and animals deficient in components of this pathway exhibit nonpeptidergic phenotypes, including reduced <italic>Ret </italic>expression, impaired innervation of the epidermis, and impaired adult CBFβ protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Newbern et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhong et al., 2007</xref>). To directly assess the role of MAPK signaling in NGF-dependent <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression during development, both in vitro and in vivo approaches were used. Through immunostaining and immunoblot analysis, we found that pharmacological inactivation of Mek1/2, direct activators of ERK1/2, greatly attenuated the ability of NGF to promote CBFβ protein expression in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). A <italic>Nestin-Cre</italic>-based conditional knockout mouse model, which targets all four <italic>Mapk3, Mapk1, Map2k1</italic>and<italic> Map2k2 </italic>alleles, was next used to determine the in vivo role of MAPK signaling for <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression.

The phenotypic variation in this analysis likely reflects incomplete excision of all four floxed alleles. We next asked whether MAPK signaling is sufficient to promote <italic>Cbfb </italic>expression in vivo, in the absence of NGF or activation of other NGF-dependent signaling pathways. For this analysis, a constitutively active form of B-Raf (V600E) was expressed exclusively in the nervous system to drive MAPK signaling in animals that were null for both <italic>Ntrk1</italic> and <italic>Bax</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Donovan et al., 2014</xref>).

We tested the involvement of Islet1, a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor, because in a neural crest derivative-specific <italic>Islet1</italic> mutant (<italic>Isl1 CKO</italic>), a Runx1 protein deficit was noted as early as E12.5, the time when Runx1 proteins are first detected in lumbar DRGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dykes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2008</xref>). To define the level at which <italic>Runx1</italic> expression is regulated by Islet1, <italic>Runx1</italic> expression was evaluated by in situ hybridization analysis in DRGs of E12.5 control and <italic>Isl1 CKO</italic> animals. Consistent with a central role for Islet in initiating <italic>Runx1</italic> expression at the transcriptional level, <italic>Runx1</italic> transcripts were virtually undetectable in <italic>Isl1 CKO</italic> DRGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8 fig8">Figure 8A, B</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression was only minimally affected by the same genetic perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8 fig8">Figure 8C, D</xref>).

At the core of this process is the formation of the Runx1/CBFβ transcription factor complex, both components of which are essential for directing the nonpeptidergic nociceptor-specific transcriptional program. Importantly, expression of each component is independently regulated at the transcriptional level. <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression is controlled by the extrinsic cue NGF through the MAPK signaling pathway. On the other hand, <italic>Runx1</italic> expression is initiated by a mechanism that is critically dependent on Islet1, an intrinsic factor that controls early development of sensory neurons. Furthermore, the Runx1/CBFβ complex, through an unknown mechanism, maintains a high level of NGF-TrkA signaling, which is essential for at least one defining feature of nonpeptidergic nociceptors: postnatal expression of<italic> Ret</italic>. Thus, the initiation of a lineage-specific differentiation program is tightly controlled by a convergence of extrinsic and intrinsic factors at the level of formation of the heterodimeric Runx1/CBFβ transcription factor complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The Runx1/CBFβ complex, a coincidence detector for extrinsic and intrinsic cues that direct nociceptor subtype specification</title><p>Nonpeptidergic nociceptor specification requires proper expression of both<italic> Runx1</italic> and <italic>Cbfb,</italic> whose transcriptional initiation is differentially dependent on Islet1 and NGF signaling. The Runx1/CBFβ holocomplex therefore serves as a coincidence detector for extrinsic and intrinsic signals that promote specification of nonpeptidergic nociceptors. The requirement for NGF, an extrinsic cue that is critical for survival of all nociceptors, ensures that only those nociceptor precursors that gain access to a sufficient amount of NGF and survive the period of naturally occurring cell death will undergo nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation. Consistent with this, <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression exhibits NGF dependence at E14.5, immediately following the period of naturally occurring cell death. On the other hand, the dependence of <italic>Runx1</italic> expression on Islet1, a transcription factor required for terminating expression of genes whose expression is restricted to the early stage of sensory neurogenesis, likely contributes to the orderly transition from pan-sensory neurogenesis to specification of nonpeptidergic nociceptors by ensuring that <italic>Runx1</italic> expression and hence Runx1/CBFβ-dependent nonpeptidergic nociceptor development are initiated after sensory neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2008</xref>). Thus the NGF and Islet1 signals coordinate temporal control of the Runx1/CBFβ complex for timely initiation of nonpeptidergic nociceptor differentiation. It is important to note that the extrinsic and intrinsic signals described here are unlikely to be sufficient to instruct Runx1/CBFβ complex formation and the nonpeptidergic nociceptor lineage choice, as neither NGF nor Islet1 functions exclusively in nonpeptidergic nociceptors. Indeed, NGF–TrkA signaling is required for survival, target innervation and normal phenotypic development of both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harrington and Ginty, 2013</xref>), and Islet1 is expressed broadly in developing DRG neurons and is required for the generation of virtually all nociceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, one or more additional, unidentified signals must govern the divergence of the two main nociceptive lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Transcriptional activator(s) of <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression downstream of MAPK signaling</title><p>We found that MAPK signaling is both necessary and sufficient for NGF-dependent expression of <italic>Cbfb </italic>in developing nociceptors. The generality of MAPK signaling suggests that it plays a similar role in controlling <italic>Cbfb </italic>expression in cells outside of the nervous system and thus MAPK–CBFβ signaling may have a general role in cell type specification. Moreover, the identification of MAPK as an upstream activator of <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression may provide an explanation for the observation that <italic>Cbfb</italic>, unlike <italic>Runx</italic> genes, is widely expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 1993</xref>).

To this end, we found, through bioinformatic analysis of the putative <italic>Cbfb</italic> promoter, cAMP-response element (CRE) consensus motifs within an evolutionally conserved 458 bp enhancer-like element (data not shown), raising the intriguing possibility that CREB family members, which are well-studied downstream mediators of MAPK signaling in many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shaywitz and Greenberg, 1999</xref>), are direct transcriptional activators of <italic>Cbfb. </italic>In view of the role of CREB family members in NGF-dependent growth and survival of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Riccio et al., 1999</xref>), the possibility of CREB-mediated activation of <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression would further suggest that common effectors of growth factor signaling pathways support distinct biological outcomes, in this case, survival, axon growth and maturation of nociceptors, presumably by controlling expression of distinct target genes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A mechanism of interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic signals for postmitotic differentiation of neuronal subtypes</title><p>The formation of the Runx1/CBFβ complex downstream of NGF and Islet1 signaling during nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation illustrates a novel mechanism of interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic factors in controlling postmitotic specification of neuronal subtypes. It is important to note the distinction between this relatively late developmental process and the specification of progenitor domains, which takes place prior to cell cycle exit. While it is well established in vertebrate systems that specification of progenitor domains is coordinately regulated by the intrinsically defined competence state of a progenitor and spatially and temporally controlled extrinsic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Briscoe and Novitch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Livesey and Cepko, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Molyneaux et al., 2007</xref>), relatively little is known about the contributions of extrinsic cues, intrinsic factors, and their modes of interaction, during postmitotic specification of neuronal subtypes. The gene regulatory mechanism described here leads us to propose a simple model in which convergence of extrinsic and intrinsic signals onto a single heterodimeric transcription factor complex controls lineage-specific differentiation programs and postmitotic specification of neuronal subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). It is conceivable that this simple model is generally applicable to a broad range of neuronal subtypes that rely on heterodimeric transcription factor complexes for their specification.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10874.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Islet1 is required for initiation of <italic>Runx1</italic>, but not <italic>Cbfb</italic> expression.</title><p>(<bold>A<bold>–</bold>D</bold>) In situ hybridization analysis of expression of <italic>Runx1</italic> (<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) and <italic>Cbfb</italic> (<bold>C</bold> and <bold>D</bold>) in control and <italic>Isl1 CKO</italic> DRGs at E12.5 shows that <italic>Islet1</italic> deficiency abolishes expression of <italic>Runx1 </italic>but not <italic>Cbfb </italic>at an early age.

For each image, the epidermal region was defined based on TOPRO3 nuclear stain and selected as the region of interest. Images were then thresholded based on βIII-Tubulin or GFP immunostaining, and the area fraction (the percentage of pixels above threshold in the region of interest) was calculated using Image J and reported as a measure of epidermal innervation density. Area fraction for each image was considered an individual data point for statistical analysis. For quantifying the intensity of fluorescent images, images except those of cultured neurons were thresholded and regions of interest were defined either on a cell-by-cell basis or as populations of cells. The mean or total intensity of pixels above threshold was measured. For cultured neurons, the total intensity of pixels within each neuron was measured without thresholding. For quantifying in situ hybridization signal intensity, the same procedure was done, except that images were first converted to grayscale.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Alan Friedman for providing <italic>Runx1<sup>flox</sup></italic> mice; Dr. Qiufu Ma and members of the Ginty lab for discussions, technical assistance, and comments on the manuscript; Dori Reimert and Holly Wellington for ES cell work; Lely Quina for preparing the <italic>Islet1</italic> conditional knockout embryos, and Charles Hawkins and the Johns Hopkins Transgenic Facility for blastocyst injections.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf2"><p>DDG: Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife.</italic></p> </fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The other authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p> </fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>SH, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>KJO'D, Drafting or revising the article, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>EET, Drafting or revising the article, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>JZ, Drafting or revising the article, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>DDG, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was done in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. One of the two reviewers, Yves Barde, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This detailed study by Huang and colleagues addresses how the general class of nonpeptidergic nociceptors becomes defined at a genotypic level during development of sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglia. Genetically engineered mice, gene profiling, expression assays and in vitro analysis using cultured embryonic neurons are combined to test the temporal impact of NGF/TrkA and Runx1 activity on genes that define the nonpeptidergic lineage. A novel model invoking communication between intrinsic and extrinsic signaling pathways and a key regulatory role for the Runx1/CBFβ complex is well supported.</p><p>Its highlight is the finding that NGF/TrkA signalling induces the expression of core binding factor beta (CBFβ) that stabilizes the Runx1 transcription factor. The involvement of the activation of a MAP kinase pathway is convincingly documented not only by pharmacological means but also by demanding experiments involving <italic>Mek</italic> and <italic>Erk</italic> quadruple mutants (2 of them conditional) as well as by a constitutively active <italic>B-Raf</italic> mutant that rescues the CBFβ phenotype in the <italic>TrkA/Bax</italic> mutant. It also appears that CBFβ stabilises Runx1 as impressively documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (compare u and s).</p><p>All in all this is an interesting contribution nicely and convincingly illustrating how growth and transcription factors orchestrate the development of well-defined sub-populations of neurons.</p><p>While all were enthusiastic about the study, the manuscript itself needs a thorough go-through for consistency (see below).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are some discrepancies between the text and the figures. In particular, some of the figures do not illustrate what is indicated in the text (compare for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> and the reference to &quot;controls&quot;, with unexplained and misleading signal intensities, in the subsection “NGF and Runx1 are similarly required for initiation of nonpeptidergic nociceptor-specific gene expression”). Also, some of the figures are insufficiently labelled and the antigens not identified.</p><p>2) The text would also greatly benefit from being better structured and shortened, for example by avoiding numerous repetitions. The summary of the results at the end of the Introduction could be omitted as well as discussion points in the Results section.</p><p>3) Leaving out some of the data might also help, in particular those related to the additional genes co-downregulated in the absence of NGF and Runx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). Functionally nothing is made of <italic>Ptprt, Myo1a</italic> and <italic>Kif21b</italic>.</p><p>4) The co-localisation of CBFβ and Runx1 is of course an important point but it is rather poorly illustrated and not quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 C-D</xref> in particular: most of the green and red signals do not overlap). Yet the authors are surely correct, simply because CBFβ is expressed in most neurons and therefore must include the Runx1 sub-population.</p><p>5) Previous work by Ugarte et al. may also be quoted as it indicates that the transcription of TRPV1 requires Runx1 and C/EBPβ heterodimers, a related finding that may be of interests to the reader.</p><p>6) In some cases (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) a paired, as opposed to an unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test has been used. The reasons for this surprising choice should be explained.</p><p>7) Please rephrase or remove the following sentence: “since Ret expression, a readout of general NGF signaling in nonpeptidergic nociceptors…”. This statement is confusing, as it implies that NGF signals through Ret. It can be deleted without changing the point of the sentence.</p><p>8) Without supporting data, the statement that proprioceptors are lacking (due to defective Runx3 activity) should be omitted in the Results section (first paragraph of the subsection “CBFβ is required for the development of Runx1-dependent nonpeptidergic populations”). This statement, repeated in the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection, should also be removed. The effect of CBFβ KO on other <italic>Runx</italic> genes, and the potential loss of proprioceptors could be added to the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10874.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:1) There are some discrepancies between the text and the figures.

Therefore, we opted to leave these data in the paper. Instead, changes in the text and figure, as mentioned above, were made so that readers can better appreciate the phenotypic similarity of <italic>NGF</italic> and <italic>Runx1</italic> mutants.</p><p><italic>4) The co-localisation of CBFβ and Runx1 is of course an important point but it is rather poorly illustrated and not quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4 C-D</xref> in particular: most of the green and red signals do not overlap).

In fact, a co-localization analysis (data not shown) suggests an anti-correlated relationship between the two, which along with the observation that CBFβ expression was found to be higher in <italic>Runx1</italic> mutant DRGs relative to control (data not shown), suggests negative cross-regulation of CBFβ expression by Runx1. This interesting observation does not negate the fact that green signals, above background as seen in wildtype DRGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), are always found where red signals are, leading to the conclusion of Runx1 and CBFβ colocalization in DRG neurons.</p><p><italic>5) Previous work by Ugarte et al. may also be quoted as it indicates that the transcription of TRPV1 requires Runx1 and C/EBPβ heterodimers, a related finding that may be of interests to the reader.</italic></p><p>While we agree that the aforementioned study demonstrated <italic>Trpv1</italic> as a direct transcriptional target of Runx1 and C/EBPβ heterodimers (which is not to be mistaken for CBFβ, a subunit of the functional Runx1 transcription factor complex) in dorsal root ganglion neurons, this finding has little bearing on our study, which has identified the Runx1/ CBFβ complex as a point of convergence between extrinsic and intrinsic factors that control nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation.</p><p><italic>6) In some cases (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) a paired, as opposed to an unpaired </italic>t<italic>-test has been used.
