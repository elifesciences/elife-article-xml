reproduction, involves changes in shape and identity of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). The change in shape, termed doming, occurs early during floral transition when it is induced by environmental cues such as changes in day-length, but how it is regulated at the cellular level is unknown. We defined the morphological and cellular features of the SAM during floral transition of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Both cell number and size increased during doming, and these changes were partially controlled by the gene regulatory network (GRN) that triggers flowering. Furthermore, dynamic modulation of expression of gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis and catabolism enzymes at the SAM contributed to doming. Expression of these enzymes was regulated by two MADS-domain transcription factors implicated in flowering. We provide a temporal and spatial framework for integrating the flowering GRN with cellular changes at the SAM and highlight the role of local regulation of GA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>flowering</kwd><kwd>shoot apical meristem</kwd><kwd>gibberellin</kwd><kwd>shape</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kinoshita</surname><given-names>Atsuko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kinoshita</surname><given-names>Atsuko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>390686111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coupland</surname><given-names>George</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coupland</surname><given-names>George</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The shoot meristem becomes domed in shape during floral transition and this is controlled by flowering pathways and the phytohormone gibberellin causing increases in cell size and number.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In plants, all shoot tissues are derived from the shoot apical meristem (SAM), a group of cells at the apex of the plant that includes a population of self-renewing stem cells. Organ primordia are formed continuously on the flanks of the SAM, and these change in identity during growth and development. In the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, leaf primordia are formed during vegetative growth, but at floral transition the developmental identity of the SAM changes to an inflorescence meristem, and it initiates the formation of floral primordia. This process of floral induction represents the first step in plant reproduction and is closely regulated by environmental cues and by the developmental stage of the plant. One of these environmental cues is day length or photoperiod, which in many species synchronizes reproduction with the changing seasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andrés and Coupland, 2012</xref>). For example, floral induction of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> occurs rapidly in response to exposure to long days (LDs). Here we define early cellular changes at the SAM during floral induction in response to LDs, and determine the contributions of genes that control flowering time or encode enzymes that regulate levels of the phytohormone gibberellin (GA).</p><p>The size and shape of the inflorescence meristem, and the regulation of cell division and cell size within it, have been studied in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaillochet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jones et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laufs et al., 1998</xref>). However, the programmed alterations in shape of the SAM that occur during the transition from a vegetative to inflorescence meristem are less well understood.</p><p>During induction of flowering in many plant species, the SAM increases in size and takes on a domed shape prior to the production of flowers, and these changes are induced by exposure to environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kwiatkowska, 2008</xref>). The contribution of different regions of the meristem to doming has been analyzed. The SAM is considered to consist of three regions based on histological and functional analyses: the central zone (CZ), the peripheral zone (PZ), and the rib zone (RZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bowman and Eshed, 2000</xref>). The CZ contains the stem cells, the PZ gives rise to primordia, and the RZ forms the stem. Cells in the CZ divide slowly, whereas cells in the PZ divide more frequently to produce organ primordia. During floral induction initiated by exposure to LDs, mitotic activity in the SAM of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> was measured by tritiated thymidine labeling and was found to increase in both the CZ and the PZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jacqmard et al., 2003</xref>). Similar conclusions were drawn from classical histological studies in <italic>Sinapis alba</italic> and <italic>Helianthus annuus</italic>, where increases in mitotic activity at the SAM upon floral induction reduced the difference in the rate of mitosis between the CZ and the PZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bodson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marc and Palmer, 1982</xref>). Although these histological analyses identified the correlation between cell division frequency and enlargement of the SAM, the resulting cellular changes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie the phenomenon have not been determined. Recently, a study in <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> demonstrated that increased expression of an anti-florigen, SELF PRUNING (SP), delayed floral transition and uncoupled doming of the SAM and floral development, whereas mutation of the florigen encoding gene <italic>SINGLE-FLOWER TRUSS</italic> (<italic>SFT</italic>) prevented doming at the morphological level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tal et al., 2017</xref>). However, the contribution at the cellular level of florigen to doming of the SAM during floral transition remains to be determined.</p><p>Genetic analyses have defined a pathway that regulates flowering of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> in response to photoperiod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koornneef et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Turck et al., 2008</xref>). The paralogous proteins FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF) represent the output of this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kardailsky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kobayashi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yamaguchi et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>FT</italic> and <italic>TSF</italic> are transcribed specifically under LDs in the leaf vasculature, and the FT protein is transported to the SAM, where it interacts with 14-3-3 proteins and a bZIP transcription factor, FD, to promote the transcription of floral integrator genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corbesier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jaeger and Wigge, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mathieu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Romera-Branchat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tamaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Taoka et al., 2011</xref>). The earliest known gene to respond directly to FT/FD at the SAM is <italic>SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1</italic> (<italic>SOC1</italic>) that encodes a MADS-domain type transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Samach et al., 2000</xref>). Subsequently, the FT/FD complex also activates the transcription of <italic>APETALA1</italic> (<italic>AP1</italic>), another gene encoding a MADS-domain transcription factor that confers floral identity on primordia on the flanks of the SAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wigge et al., 2005</xref>). On the other hand, flowering of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> is severely delayed under non-inductive short-day conditions, in which the MADS-domain transcription factor SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) inhibits flowering by reducing transcription of <italic>FT</italic>, <italic>TSF</italic>, and <italic>SOC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hartmann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jang et al., 2009</xref>). The onset of flowering can be synchronized by transferring plants from SDs to LDs, and in the wild-type accession Col-0, the SAM of plants grown for 2 weeks under SDs becomes committed to floral induction around 5 days after transfer to LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Torti et al., 2012</xref>). The histological and transcriptional profiles of the SAM change dramatically as flowering is initiated and proceeds, but the mechanisms underlying how these histological changes occur and are initiated by environmental cues remain largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kwiatkowska, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laufs et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmid et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Torti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Uchida and Torii, 2019</xref>).</p><p>GA promotes diverse biological processes, including cell elongation, cell division, and floral induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yamaguchi, 2008</xref>). The strongly GA-deficient <italic>ga1-3</italic> mutant of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> is late flowering under LDs and fails to flower under SDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wilson et al., 1992</xref>). Corresponding to this phenotype, the level of bioactive GA<sub>4</sub> increases strongly in shoot apices under SDs around the time of floral induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eriksson et al., 2006</xref>). Local GA biosynthesis is largely dependent on the activity of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (2ODD) enzymes GA20-oxidase (GA20ox) and GA3-oxidase (GA3ox) that convert the GA precursor GA<sub>12</sub> into bioactive GA<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yamaguchi, 2008</xref>). Both are encoded by gene families in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, and individual family members exhibit distinct expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han and Zhu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mitchum et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Plackett et al., 2012</xref>). By contrast, the 2ODD enzyme GA2-oxidase (GA2ox) contributes to the inactivation of GA<sub>4</sub> or its precursors and regulates the concentration of bioactive GA in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yamaguchi, 2008</xref>). In <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, this enzyme is also encoded by a gene family, and individual genes are expressed in specific patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rieu et al., 2008a</xref>). Bioactive GA is perceived by its receptor, GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Griffiths et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Willige et al., 2007</xref>). The GID1–GA complex interacts directly with DELLA proteins and induces their degradation by the 26S-proteasome pathway through the E3 ubiquitin ligase SLEEPY (SLY) and SNEEZY (SNE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ariizumi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Griffiths et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McGinnis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Willige et al., 2007</xref>). DELLA proteins are repressors of GA-mediated growth and development, and they interact with a broad range of transcription factors to alter their DNA binding properties or transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marín-de la Rosa et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>A. thaliana</italic> there are five DELLA proteins, of which REPRESSOR OF ga1-3 (RGA) and GA INSENSITIVE (GAI) are major repressors of growth and reproductive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dill and Sun, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peng et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Silverstone et al., 1998</xref>). Transcription of GA biosynthesis and deactivating genes is regulated by DELLA proteins, demonstrating that these contribute to feedback and feedforward regulation of GA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hedden and Phillips, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zentella et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>GA levels are strongly repressed in the SAM of different plant species during vegetative development. Establishment and maintenance of the SAM involve KNOTTED1-LIKE homeobox (KNOX) transcription factors, such as KNOTTED1 (KN1) in maize and SHOOTMERISTEMLESS (STM) in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, which are expressed in the SAM from the early stages of embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bowman and Eshed, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Long et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vollbrecht et al., 1991</xref>). A major function of KNOX transcription factors is the reduction in GA levels in the SAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bolduc and Hake, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jasinski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sakamoto et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sakamoto et al., 2001b</xref>). In maize, KN1 directly binds to and activates expression of the <italic>GA2ox1</italic> gene that encodes a GA catabolic enzyme. Similarly, in Arabidopsis and tobacco, the activity of STM and its homologue NTH15, respectively, are associated with reduced expression of <italic>GA20ox</italic> genes that encode GA biosynthetic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jasinski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sakamoto et al., 2001a</xref>). Therefore, the concentration of GA is maintained at a low level in the SAM and this is proposed to be required for meristem activity. Indeed, the previous studies linking <italic>KNOX</italic> genes to GA levels in the SAM showed the specific expression of genes encoding GA2 oxidases and GA20 oxidases in the SAM and the leaf primordia, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bolduc and Hake, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jasinski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sakamoto et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sakamoto et al., 2001b</xref>). However, due to the resolution and sensitivity of the β-glucuronidase activity and in situ mRNA hybridization methods used to detect gene expression, it remains unclear in which domains of the SAM these genes are expressed and how dynamic their expression patterns are during development. Recently, several studies used tissue-specific promoters to express GA catabolic enzymes or DELLA proteins in the leaves and in the SAM separately, and these approaches suggested functions for GA in the SAM during flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galvão et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Porri et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the mRNA of <italic>GA20ox2</italic> and GA levels were found to increase in apices of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> during floral transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrés et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the repression of GA mediated by KNOX proteins may be overcome during floral induction.</p><p>Here we analyze SAM shape and cellular content by confocal microscopy and demonstrate dynamic histological and cellular changes at the SAM during floral transition induced by LDs. Both the number and size of the cells in the SAM increased in the early stages of this process, and these changes are at least partially regulated by the photoperiodic flowering pathway and GA. Detailed observations of reporter lines revealed dynamic changes in expression patterns of genes encoding GA biosynthesis and catabolism enzymes in the SAM. Furthermore, the expression of these genes was found to be regulated by two MADS-domain transcription factors that play key roles in the control of flowering time. These results define roles for the photoperiodic flowering and phytohormone signaling pathways in the dynamic control of SAM properties during floral transition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Both cell division and elongation are enhanced in the SAM at floral transition</title><p>To understand better the histological changes at the SAM during photoperiod-induced flowering, we investigated the configuration of the cells on the surface of the SAM in plants grown under SDs for 2 weeks (2wSD), then either transferred to LDs or maintained in SDs for 7 days (3wSD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). For this analysis, the SAM was defined as the region between the first developing primordia (P<sub>n</sub>) and its boundaries were delimited by regions of negative Gaussian curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In wild-type plants grown in non-inductive SDs, the area of the SAM and the distance between primordia on opposite sides of the SAM gradually increased between 2wSD and 3wSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). During this time, the number of cells in the SAM also slightly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). By contrast, when 2-week-old SD-grown plants were transferred to LDs, both SAM area and the number of cells in the SAM increased rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). In particular, a dramatic increase in the number of cells in the SAM was observed between 3 and 5 days after transfer to LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This increase in cell number was associated with doming of the SAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Later, between 5 and 7 days after transfer to LDs, the area of the SAM and the distance between primordia on opposite sides of the SAM decreased, although the number of cells in the SAM did not change significantly between these two time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, we next examined the size of the cells in the SAM during floral transition. Statistical analysis showed that cell size in the SAM significantly increased between 3 and 5 days after transfer to LDs, and decreased again between 5 and 7 LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and G</xref>). To examine the difference in cell size in distinct regions of the SAM, we compared the size of cells in a central region (defined as zero to two cells from the central cell at the apex of the shoot) with that of cells in a ring surrounding this central region (three to five cells from the central cell) at each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Cell size increased in response to LDs in both regions, but the effect was stronger in the outer ring area than in the central region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These histological analyses suggest that as well as cell number, cell size increased in response to transfer from SDs to LDs and that the transient enlargement of the cells correlates with doming of the SAM during floral transition.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The number and size of the cells in the meristem increase during floral transition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heat-map quantification of cell area in the meristem region of Col-0, <italic>ft-10 tsf-1</italic>, and <italic>KNAT1::GA2ox7</italic> grown for 2 weeks in non-inductive short days (SDs) (2wSD) and observed for an additional 3SDs (+3SD), 5SDs (+5SD), or 7SDs (+7SD), or transferred to inductive long days (LDs) for 3LDs (+3LD), 5LDs (+5LD), or 7LDs (+7LD). Scale bars, 50 µm.

Notably, VENUS-GA20ox2 signal was not evenly distributed in the PZ, but was detected in distinct patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>).

Plants grown under SDs for different time periods were transferred to LDs, and in those plants that were still in the vegetative phase (2wSD, 3wSD, 4wSD, and 5wSD) the VENUS-GA20ox2 signal was upregulated after exposure to 3LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

We compared meristem size in <italic>ga20ox2</italic>–1 and Col-0. In this experiment, the increase in meristem area and cell area was visible in 3LD and 5LD after transfer from SD in both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). However, in the 5LD samples, the meristem area was smaller in <italic>ga20ox2</italic>–1 compared with Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Analysis of different regions of the meristem, as described previously in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, at 5LD detected a reduced number of cells and the presence of smaller cells in the ring outside the central region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–F</xref>). Because the <italic>ga20ox2</italic>–1 mutant is late flowering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>), we monitored these parameters until 9LD after transfer, but the meristem size or cell area in the PZ was not greater at any time point than that observed in Col-0 at 5LD, although at 9LD cell size was larger in the CZ and PZ of <italic>ga20ox2</italic>–1 meristems than in those of Col-0 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>).

The number of cauline leaves was indistinguishable in <italic>ga2ox</italic> mutants and wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that C<sub>19</sub>-GA2ox enzymes increase the duration of vegetative development prior to shoot elongation, but are not involved in regulating the transition from cauline leaves to floral primordia after bolting. However, <italic>ga20ox2</italic> mutants possessed more rosette leaves and fewer cauline leaves in LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), suggesting that in wild-type plants GA20ox2 contributes to the synthesis of GA that promotes transition from the vegetative to inflorescence stage and delays the switch from cauline leaves to floral meristem identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yamaguchi et al., 2014</xref>). These data support previous reports that GA20ox2 is one of the key GA biosynthesis enzymes that contributes to GA production at the shoot apex during floral transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrés et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rieu et al., 2008b</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined the expression of <italic>GA2ox</italic> genes in shoot apices.

By reconstructing the 2.5D geometry and structure of the SAM from confocal 2D images, we demonstrated that both cell number and size are increased at specific developmental stages in response to inductive environmental cues. The photoperiodic flowering pathway and GA metabolism contribute to these dynamic changes. Genetic analyses demonstrated that two MADS-box transcription factors, SOC1 and SVP, which are components of the gene regulatory network (GRN) associated with floral induction, modulate expression of enzymes involved in GA homeostasis in the SAM and that SOC1 also contributes to the increases in meristematic cell size and number during floral transition. These results highlight the importance of coordinating the photoperiodic and GA phytohormone pathways to induce precise morphological changes in the SAM as it transitions from a vegetative to an inflorescence meristem.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Environmentally induced changes in shape and cellular composition at the SAM during floral transition</title><p>Five days after transfer to long photoperiods, the SAM acquired a characteristic domed shape similar to that previously described for a transition meristem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jacqmard et al., 2003</xref>). The meristematic area at this stage was approximately fourfold greater than that of plants maintained under SDs, and this enlargement was associated with a threefold to fourfold increase in cell number in the epidermis and an increase of approximately 80% in the median cell area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The higher cell number is consistent with the previously described increase in cell division during floral transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bodson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jacqmard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marc and Palmer, 1982</xref>). Increases in cell size were not previously described in the domed meristem. However, analysis of cell size in the mature inflorescence meristem indicated that it is an emergent property of altering relative growth rate and the rate of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jones et al., 2017</xref>). Increases in cell size and cell number in the domed meristem are therefore probably achieved by increasing the rate of both cellular growth and division. During the interval between 5 LDs and 7 LDs, the SAM progressed from a domed transition meristem to a mature inflorescence meristem, and at the latter time point bore on its flanks several floral primordia. During this 2-day interval, the domed shape of the meristem was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and the meristematic area became smaller, although it remained markedly larger than the vegetative meristem. The reduction in size of the meristematic region at 7 LDs is associated with the presence of primordia closer to the tip of the meristem than occurs in the domed meristem at 5 LDs. This suggests that during the domed transition stage, primordium formation is transiently suppressed, contributing to the larger domed meristematic region. The development of methods for live imaging a single meristem throughout floral induction will be necessary to address this question directly. Between 5 LDs and 7 LDs, a reduction in cell size occurs despite the maintenance of approximately the same number of cells, and this is probably due to a reduction in cell growth rate combined with continued division, as described previously for reduction in cell size in the mature inflorescence meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jones et al., 2017</xref>). Overall, during the 7-day period after transfer from SDs to LDs, the meristematic area increases as the vegetative meristem becomes an inflorescence meristem that contains more cells of similar size compared to the vegetative meristem. The domed meristem represents an intermediate stage that contains more and larger cells than the vegetative meristem.</p><p>Floral induction was induced by transferring plants from SDs to LDs, and this change in environment could conceivably alter meristem size independently of floral induction. Previous work showed that transfer of plants from high to low light intensity caused the inflorescence meristem to become smaller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaillochet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jones et al., 2017</xref>), and the inflorescence meristem of plants grown under nutrient-limiting conditions was smaller than that of plants grown under optimal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Landrein et al., 2018</xref>). The effect of low light was postulated to be due to a reduction in photosynthates; thus, under our conditions, the availability of higher amounts of fixed carbon upon transfer to LDs may contribute to the changes in the SAM that we observed. To control for effects independent of floral transition, <italic>ft-10 tsf-1</italic> plants that did not flower in response to LDs were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These plants did not produce floral primordia or a domed meristem during the experiment. Thus, the rapid increase in cell number and size associated with doming requires activity of the photoperiodic flowering pathway and are not simply caused by an increase in photosynthesis. However, meristem size, cell number, and cell size did increase gradually in the <italic>ft-10 tsf-1</italic> mutant through 5 and 7 LDs compared with control plants grown under SDs. This residual increase in meristem size in <italic>ft-10 tsf-1</italic> was independent of floral transition, and may be caused by partial activation of the photoperiodic flowering pathway independently of FT and TSF, or to enhanced photosynthesis under longer photoperiods. In further agreement with this notion, specific changes in gene expression were previously detected in the SAM of <italic>ft-10 tsf-1</italic> mutants transferred from SDs to LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Torti et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In addition to photoperiodic pathway components, GA is probably an important regulator of the increase in SAM size upon floral induction, because after transfer to LDs, the SAM of <italic>KNAT1::GA2o × 7</italic> plants contained fewer cells than wild-type meristems and a similar number to <italic>ft-10 tsf-1</italic> meristems. The <italic>KNAT1</italic> promoter is not active in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lincoln et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Porri et al., 2012</xref>), so reducing GA levels in the inner layers of the SAM must lead to the reductions in cell size and cell number detected in the epidermis, perhaps due to indirectly reducing GA levels in the epidermis or to mechanical constraints. Whether the photoperiod and GA pathways regulate SAM size independently remains unclear; however, the distinct morphology of the SAM in these two genotypes suggests independent roles for these two signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Regulation of GA biosynthesis and catabolism at the SAM during floral transition</title><p>Low GA levels maintain the undifferentiated state of the SAM and contribute to the boundary between the SAM and elongating cells in differentiating shoot tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bolduc and Hake, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sakamoto et al., 2001a</xref>).

Furthermore, an increased level of the DELLA protein GAI in the inflorescence meristem leads to a smaller meristem that contains fewer cells, due to the increased expression of a member of the Kip-related protein (KRP) family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Serrano-Mislata et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that in the wild-type inflorescence meristem, GA may promote cell division by inducing degradation of GAI and thereby reducing KRP levels. It is not yet clear how the negative regulation of bioactive GA by KNOX transcription factors in the SAM is reconciled with increased GA levels at the shoot apex during floral transition and in inflorescence meristems. Although transcription of <italic>GA20ox2</italic> and the accumulation of bioactive GA<sub>4</sub> are induced in the shoot apex during floral transition, its precise pattern of expression in the SAM has not been examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrés et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eriksson et al., 2006</xref>).

Furthermore, transcription of <italic>GA2ox4</italic>, which encodes a GA catabolism enzyme, is reduced at the domed stage but highly upregulated later specifically in early-stage floral primordia in the inflorescence meristem. Although KNOX proteins have a general role in reducing GA levels in meristems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bolduc and Hake, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jasinski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sakamoto et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sakamoto et al., 2001b</xref>), they are unlikely to have a regulatory function in modulating GA levels in the SAM specifically during floral transition.</p><p>Previous studies showed that GA is critical for cell division and elongation in root meristems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Achard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ubeda-Tomás et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ubeda-Tomás et al., 2008</xref>). We found that GA also regulates cell division and elongation in the SAM during floral transition. Furthermore, the patterns of expression of <italic>GA2ox4</italic> and <italic>GA20ox2</italic> suggest that the GA level mainly increases in the PZ of the SAM during floral transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, cell size also increased during floral transition in the PZ of wild-type plants, but not in that of <italic>KNAT1::GA2ox7</italic>. Furthermore, the highest level of expression of <italic>GA20ox2</italic> in the PZ was observed in meristems of 2w- or 3w-old SD-grown plants transferred to 3LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This pattern emphasizes the idea that GA may promote enlargement of the relatively small vegetative SAM of these SD grown plants as they initiate floral transition by enhancing cell division and elongation. Subsequent reduction in <italic>GA20ox2</italic> mRNA levels required the SOC1 MADS box transcription factor, as <italic>soc1</italic> mutants expressed higher levels of <italic>GA20ox2</italic> mRNA for longer than Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Doming of the SAM of the <italic>soc1</italic> mutant also occurred more slowly than that of Col-0 plants and continued for several more days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The longer duration of expression of GA20ox2 in the SAM of the <italic>soc1</italic> mutant may contribute to its extended period of doming. Mutations in <italic>GA20ox2</italic> did not reduce the number and size of the cells in the SAM as much as <italic>KNAT1:GA2ox7</italic> so other isoforms of GA20ox may also redundantly contribute to the biosynthesis of bioactive GA during floral transition.</p><p>In addition to the elevated levels of GA that are necessary to terminate the vegetative phase and initiate inflorescence development, a reduction in GA levels in primordia is required to initiate floral development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yamaguchi et al., 2014</xref>). The dynamic changes in <italic>GA20ox2</italic> and <italic>GA2ox4</italic> expression that we report are consistent with this model and further support the idea that GA is transiently upregulated in the SAM during floral transition, and then later reduced in floral primordia. <italic>GA20ox2</italic> was expressed in the meristem transiently after exposure to 3–5 LDs during the transition, whereas <italic>GA2ox4</italic> was repressed at this stage, but strongly induced in floral primordia at 7 LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). At this stage, expression of GA2ox4 was detectable in incipient floral primordia (i1 stage), which precedes <italic>AP1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Depletion of GA in these incipient floral primordia is proposed to be required for the accumulation of the DELLA protein RGA, which then acts as a transcriptional co-activator of SPL9 in the transcription of <italic>AP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yamaguchi et al., 2014</xref>). The expression pattern of <italic>VENUS-GA2ox4</italic> in incipient floral primordia is consistent with its role in contributing to GA depletion prior to <italic>AP1</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Here it would enhance the role of ELA1 enzymes that were previously shown to be expressed in floral primordia to reduce bioactive GA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yamaguchi et al., 2014</xref>), although it remains uncertain whether ELA1 enzyme is expressed as early in the incipient primordia as GA2ox4. Because low GA levels are associated with maintaining the undifferentiated state of meristems, the activation of <italic>GA2ox4</italic> in these primordia may contribute more generally to the establishment of meristem identity in floral meristems. Indeed, the expression of <italic>GA2ox4</italic> precedes the establishment of meristematic identity as determined by <italic>STM</italic> and <italic>WUS</italic> expression, which are detectable in stage 2 floral primordia onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Long and Barton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mayer et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, although STM is implicated in transcriptional activation of <italic>GA2ox4</italic> in the SAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jasinski et al., 2005</xref>), it is probably not responsible for its initial activation in early floral primordia. Instead, <italic>GA2ox4</italic> activation at this stage involves the MADS-box protein SVP, which contributes to transcriptional complexes that confer floral fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Balanzà et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gregis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Perspectives</title><p>We describe at unprecedented resolution the changes in shape and cellular composition that occur at the shoot meristem during floral transition induced by the environmental cue of day length. Our analysis is based on developing methods for image analysis of the epidermis at 2.5D using fixed and cleared meristematic samples. Further methodological development to enable imaging of deeper cell layers of the transition meristem, as has been performed on the inflorescence meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaillochet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Serrano-Mislata et al., 2017</xref>), and analysis at higher temporal resolution using live imaging will help define which cellular changes are the primary cause of meristem doming. Our experiments also demonstrate dynamic changes in temporal and spatial expression of GA metabolism enzymes controlled by the GRN that regulates flowering. Similar approaches can be used to analyze the roles of other phytohormones such as auxin and cytokinin and to image the machinery that controls the behavior of the stem cells. Such approaches will provide a more complete picture of how the environment influences meristem shape, size, and function in a developmentally programmed and stereotypical way during floral induction. Furthermore, although the regulatory machinery that regulates flowering responses to environment has diverged during evolution, the FT/FD pathway and meristematic doming are highly conserved (<xref

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Hao Yu as the Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors report a comprehensive analysis of morphological changes in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) during the floral transition, the associated dynamic modulation of expression of the enzymes involved in GA biosynthesis and catabolism, and their relationship with two flowering time genes, SOC1 and SVP, in Arabidopsis. This study reveals interesting links among dynamic cellular changes, the flowering regulatory network and GA signaling in the SAM during the floral transition.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the topic and the findings are very relevant and of considerable interest, some concerns on the methodologies, image quality and interpretation of results as listed below need to be addressed to support the conclusions.</p><p>1) Studies on morphological and cellular features of the SAM during the floral transition should be better integrated with the analysis of molecular and genetic interactions between SOC1/SVP and GA metabolism genes. This will strengthen the novelty of this study through providing a clearer link among cellular/hormonal changes, the flowering regulatory network, and the associated morphological feature-SAM doming during the floral transition.</p><p>2) The quality of images in several figures, such as Figures 4, 6, Figure 2—figure supplement 3, and Figure 4—figure supplement 5, needs to be improved. The authors may consider replacing them with better images and/or providing relevant quantitative analysis.</p><p>3) Interpretation of some figures, such as Figures 3, 5 and Figure 4—figure supplement 6, needs to be revised to describe the results herein more accurately. For key images like Figure 5, presentation of images from biological replicates will be helpful.</p><p>Please also take into consideration the other specific comments from the reviewers below to revise the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The floral transition is a crucial process in plant development. During this transition, the shoot apical meristem stops producing leaves and starts making floral buds. The gene regulatory network (GRN) that controls the floral transition has been extensively studied, but much less is known about the cellular changes that underlie the transition from a vegetative to a reproductive meristem, and how they are linked to the flowering GRN. The manuscript by Kinoshita et al. reports a comprehensive analysis of morphological changes of the shoot meristem during the floral transition, the role of hormonal signaling in these changes and how the hormonal changes are linked to regulatory genes that control the floral transition.</p><p>Their overall conclusion is that the shoot meristem appears to go through two rapid transitions during the floral transition. First, there is a sudden increase in meristem size, associated with higher GA levels and signaling. Shortly afterwards, GA levels are reduced, coinciding with a change in the identity of organ primordia, from leaf primordia to floral buds; the regulatory genes SOC1 and SVP play a role in repressing GA signaling during the second transition. The work is thorough, the images are of very high quality and I consider the results of general interest.</p><p>My main criticisms are:</p><p>1) Currently, the manuscript seems made of two parts that are insufficiently connected. The first part is a detailed analysis of the early changes in meristem structure during the floral transition, focusing on cellular structure and on the role of GA metabolism and signaling. The processes studied in the first part were formally placed downstream of the floral transition by showing that they were triggered by a shift from short to long days and required the function of the FT/TSF genes. The second part is an analysis of the molecular and genetic interactions between SOC1/SVP and GA metabolism genes. In the Abstract and in Figure 9—figure supplement 2, both parts are linked. However, the experiments on SOC1 and SVP focus on the transition from leaf primordia to floral buds, assessed mostly as changes in the number of cauline leaves. It would have been more logical to test the effect of SVP/SOC directly on the processes studied in part 1, such as meristem size and number of cells in the central and peripheral zones during the floral transition. Similarly, it would have been better to show the effect of SOC1/SVP on the expression of GA20ox2 or GA20x4 using the same conditions as in Figures 1-6 (SD followed by 3, 5 and 7 LD), rather than the different conditions used in Figures 7, 9 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1 (9, 11, 13, 15 and 17 LD). A better connection between the flowering GRN and processes that occur during meristem doming is important because to a large extent the novelty of the paper is in the link between cellular/hormonal changes and the flowering GRN.</p><p>2) In Figure 5, the authors show reduced RGA-GFP expression in the periphery of the shoot apex after the floral induction. The text refers to reduced expression in the peripheral zone, but the images appear to show a reduction mostly in organ primordia, which are not the same as the meristem PZ. Increased GA in organ primordia or in the PZ would have different implications. Still in Figure 5, panels E-H and I-L show different sections of the same four apices. This is somewhat repetitive; perhaps the space in the figure could be better used to show the reproducibility of changes in RGA-GFP expression across biological replicates – the color bars show that quantitative data are available, so the authors could show a statistical analysis of RGA-GP intensity in specific regions across all four biological replicates.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>A number of classical studies have analyzed the morphological changes of the SAM during floral transition. However, a detailed and quantitative cellular analysis was still lacking. This work exploits recent advances in bioimaging to fill this gap. The main conclusion is that two well-known flowering-time transcription factors directly control the expression of GA metabolism in specific regions of the shoot apex and that GA signaling is necessary to promote the increase in cell number and cell size that cause doming of the SAM. This conclusion, with the detailed analysis that supports it, represents a significant advance in the field. The major concerns that I would raise refer to the quality of some images, and to the interpretation of some pieces of evidence, all of which could be solved by selecting additional images and/or reducing the intensity of the claims.</p><p>1) It is a pity that the imaging is mostly focused on the epidermal L1 layer, not allowing to draw conclusions about the behavior of the RZ, for instance.

During this transition, the shoot apical meristem stops producing leaves and starts making floral buds. The gene regulatory network (GRN) that controls the floral transition has been extensively studied, but much less is known about the cellular changes that underlie the transition from a vegetative to a reproductive meristem, and how they are linked to the flowering GRN. The manuscript by Kinoshita et al. reports a comprehensive analysis of morphological changes of the shoot meristem during the floral transition, the role of hormonal signaling in these changes and how the hormonal changes are linked to regulatory genes that control the floral transition.</p><p>Their overall conclusion is that the shoot meristem appears to go through two rapid transitions during the floral transition. First, there is a sudden increase in meristem size, associated with higher GA levels and signaling. Shortly afterwards, GA levels are reduced, coinciding with a change in the identity of organ primordia, from leaf primordia to floral buds; the regulatory genes SOC1 and SVP play a role in repressing GA signaling during the second transition. The work is thorough, the images are of very high quality and I consider the results of general interest.</p><p>My main criticisms are:</p><p>1) Currently, the manuscript seems made of two parts that are insufficiently connected. The first part is a detailed analysis of the early changes in meristem structure during the floral transition, focusing on cellular structure and on the role of GA metabolism and signaling. The processes studied in the first part were formally placed downstream of the floral transition by showing that they were triggered by a shift from short to long days and required the function of the FT/TSF genes. The second part is an analysis of the molecular and genetic interactions between SOC1/SVP and GA metabolism genes. In the Abstract and in Figure 9—figure supplement 2, both parts are linked. However, the experiments on SOC1 and SVP focus on the transition from leaf primordia to floral buds, assessed mostly as changes in the number of cauline leaves. It would have been more logical to test the effect of SVP/SOC directly on the processes studied in part 1, such as meristem size and number of cells in the central and peripheral zones during the floral transition. Similarly, it would have been better to show the effect of SOC1/SVP on the expression of GA20ox2 or GA20x4 using the same conditions as in Figures 1-6 (SD followed by 3, 5 and 7 LD), rather than the different conditions used in Figures 7, 9 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1 (9, 11, 13, 15 and 17 LD). A better connection between the flowering GRN and processes that occur during meristem doming is important because to a large extent the novelty of the paper is in the link between cellular/hormonal changes and the flowering GRN.</p><p>The reviewer finds that the manuscript is structured in two parts that are not sufficiently well integrated. The first part is the description of the structural changes of the shoot meristem during floral transition, and the second is the link between the GRN, particularly SOC1 and SVP, and the GA metabolism genes. The reviewer requests that these two parts are better integrated and concludes “A better connection between the flowering GRN and processes that occur during meristem doming is important because to a large extent the novelty of the paper is in the link between cellular/hormonal changes and the flowering GRN.” The reviewer makes suggestions for how this could be achieved, including “to test the effect of SVP/SOC directly on the processes studied in part 1, such as meristem size and number of cells in the central and peripheral zones during the floral transition”. We have now analyzed the meristem of <italic>soc1-2</italic> mutants after growth for 2 weeks under SDs and transfer to LDs, and compared these with wild-type plants, as done already in the original submission for <italic>ft tsf</italic> mutants. These data are presented in new Figure 7, described in the Results and Discussion. We could not carry out these experiments for <italic>svp</italic> mutants, because the plants flower extremely early under SDs, and the SAM is already doming by 2 weeks under SDs. Nevertheless, we believe that the inclusion of the <italic>soc1</italic> mutant data helps to integrate the different themes of the manuscript, as requested by the reviewer. Particularly, as these data appear in Figure 7, late in the Results section, and are compared with the results for <italic>ft tsf</italic> and <italic>ga20ox2</italic> presented earlier in the manuscript.</p><p>2) In Figure 5, the authors show reduced RGA-GFP expression in the periphery of the shoot apex after the floral induction. The text refers to reduced expression in the peripheral zone, but the images appear to show a reduction mostly in organ primordia, which are not the same as the meristem PZ. Increased GA in organ primordia or in the PZ would have different implications. Still in Figure 5, panels E-H and I-L show different sections of the same four apices. This is somewhat repetitive; perhaps the space in the figure could be better used to show the reproducibility of changes in RGA-GFP expression across biological replicates – the color bars show that quantitative data are available, so the authors could show a statistical analysis of RGA-GP intensity in specific regions across all four biological replicates.</p><p>The reviewer comments on the analysis of RGA-GFP shown in Figure 5, and raises several issues on the quality of these images and the relative quantification of RGAGFP and VENUS-GA2ox4 or VENUS-GA20ox2. The analysis of RGA-GFP was a relatively small part of the manuscript, and we could not rigorously quantify these low resolution images nor substantially improve them with the replicates. Furthermore, we could not repeat the experiment within a reasonable revision period. Therefore, as the analysis of RGA-GFP was a relatively small part of the manuscript and did not represent one of our major conclusions, we decided to delete Figure 5 and the description of the RGA-GFP data from the Results.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>A number of classical studies have analyzed the morphological changes of the SAM during floral transition.

We have made it clear in the text that smaller cells of <italic>ga20ox-2</italic> specifically in the PZ are detected at the 5LD time point during the floral transition, following on from the previous sentence that referred to meristem size at this time point. (“Analysis of different regions of the meristem, as described previously in Figure S2, at 5LD detected a reduced number of cells and the presence of smaller cells in the ring outside the central region (Figure 3B-F)”). We have also made it clear that at 9LDs cells are smaller both in the CZ and PZ (“although at 9LD cell size was larger in the CZ and PZ of <italic>ga20ox2-1</italic> meristems than in those of Col-0 plants (Figure 3E, F).”). We prefer to maintain the measurements in the CZ and PZ as differences are detected at specific time points, as now made clear in the edited text.</p><p>– According to Figure 4—figure supplement 6 panels D-F, cells in the CZ of ga2ox4-3 meristems are bigger with respect to the wt after 5 LDs.

For example, mechanical constraints from inner tissues may restrict cell growth and division in the epidermis of KNAT1p:GA2ox7 apices. On the other hand, it is surprising that the difference in meristem width between KNAT1p:GA2ox7 and ft tsf apices is not reflected in the distance between primordia (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C).</p><p>We have now mentioned that <italic>KNAT1</italic> is not expressed in the epidermis in the Results. <italic>“</italic>This transgene reduces the level of GA precursor specifically in the SAM, but is not expressed directly in the epidermis (Lincoln et al., 1994; Porri et al., 2012; Schomburg et al., 2003).” Also, in the Discussion we raise the specific point mentioned by the reviewer on mechanical constraints. (”The <italic>KNAT1</italic> promoter is not active in the epidermis (Lincoln et al., 1994; Porri et al., 2012), so reducing GA levels in the inner layers of the SAM must lead to the reductions in cell size and cell number detected in the epidermis, perhaps due to indirectly reducing GA levels in the epidermis or to mechanical constraints.”). Concerning the difference in distance between primordia and width in the apices of <italic>KNAT1p:GA2ox7 and ft tsf,</italic> we have now included in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 the width measurements (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E), as these were not shown in the submitted version. The width of <italic>ft tsf</italic> apices is significantly greater than <italic>KNAT1p:GA2ox7</italic> only at 7LDs, and at this time point there is no difference in distance between primordia. We assume that this is because the <italic>apices of KNAT1p:GA2ox7</italic> are domed at 7LDs. As the distance between primordia is measured across the top of the apex, the increase in height of <italic>KNAT1p:GA2ox7</italic> apices presumably compensates for the reduction in width.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript by Kinoshita et al. entitled &quot;Regulation of shoot meristem shape by photoperiodic signaling and phytohormones during floral induction of Arabidopsis&quot; reports an cellular resolution analyses of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) shape change during floral transition.
