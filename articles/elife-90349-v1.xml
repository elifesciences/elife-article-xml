Determining the mechanisms underlying these sexually antagonistic effects is challenging because it can require studying Y-linked alleles while they still segregate as polymorphisms. We used a Y chromosome polymorphism in the house fly, <italic>Musca domestica</italic>, to address this challenge. Two male determining Y chromosomes (Y<sup>M</sup> and III<sup>M</sup>) segregate as stable polymorphisms in natural populations, and they differentially affect multiple traits, including male courtship performance. We identified differentially expressed genes encoding odorant binding proteins (in the <italic>Obp56h</italic> family) as candidate agents for the courtship differences. Through network analysis and allele-specific expression measurements, we identified multiple genes on the house fly III<sup>M</sup> chromosome that could serve as <italic>trans</italic> regulators of <italic>Obp56h</italic> gene expression. One of those genes is homologous to <italic>Drosophila melanogaster CG2120</italic>, which encodes a transcription factor that binds near <italic>Obp56h</italic>. Upregulation of <italic>CG2120</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> nervous tissues reduces copulation latency, consistent with this transcription factor acting as a negative regulator of <italic>Obp56h</italic> expression. The transcription factor gene, which we name <italic>speed date</italic>, demonstrates a molecular mechanism by which a Y-linked gene can evolve male-beneficial effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Musca domestica</italic></kwd><kwd>polygenic sex determination</kwd><kwd>copulation latency</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-1845686</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meisel</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An integrative approach is used to identify a mechanism by which the fitness effects of Y chromosomes can manifest via <italic>trans</italic> effects on autosomal genes, through their effects on male courtship and other sexually selected traits.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In species with genetic sex determination, a Y or W chromosome can have sex-limited inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bachtrog et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beukeboom and Perrin, 2014</xref>). The male-limited inheritance of Y chromosomes is predicted to allow for the accumulation of alleles with male-specific beneficial effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Rice, 1996</xref>). These male-beneficial alleles can have female-deleterious (sexually antagonistic) effects because they are never exposed to direct selection in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Charlesworth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>One important way that sex-limited Y and W chromosomes appear to affect sex-specific traits is via <italic>trans</italic> regulation of genes elsewhere in the genome. For example, Y chromosome genotypes in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> have <italic>trans</italic> effects on gene expression throughout the genome, which modify a broad range of phenotypes, including immunity and chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lemos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lemos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brown et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Y chromosome genotypes also have fitness consequences that depend on the genetic background, suggesting epistatic interactions between Y-linked alleles and the X or autosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Chippindale and Rice, 2001</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>Poecilia</italic> spp., Y-linked alleles may affect sexually selected male pigmentation patterns by acting as <italic>trans</italic> regulators of autosomal gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Morris et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kawamoto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sandkam et al., 2021</xref>), although the specific mechanisms of these effects are not well understood.</p><p>Even though we are aware of sex-specific phenotypic and fitness effects of Y and W chromosomes, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not as well understood. Notably, we have a limited understanding of how Y and W chromosomes act as <italic>trans</italic> regulators of sex-specific and sexually antagonistic traits genome-wide. There are also very few sexually antagonistic alleles that have been genetically or molecular characterized on young sex chromosomes (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Roberts et al., 2009</xref>), which limits our ability to make generalizations about the molecular mechanisms underlying sexually antagonistic selection on Y and W chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mank et al., 2014</xref>). To address these shortcomings, we sought to identify the genetic mechanism underlying how a young Y chromosome affects male courtship behavior in the house fly, <italic>Musca domestica</italic>.</p><p>House fly has a multifactorial sex determination system, in which multiple young proto-Y and proto-W chromosomes segregate as polymorphisms in natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hamm et al., 2014</xref>). The two most common proto-Y chromosomes (III<sup>M</sup> and Y<sup>M</sup>) are distributed along latitudinal clines on multiple continents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Franco et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Tomita and Wada, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hamm et al., 2005</xref>), and they affect thermal traits in ways that are consistent with their geographic distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Delclos et al., 2021</xref>). This polymorphism has remained stable in natural populations since at least the mid-20th century, suggesting that selection maintains multifactorial sex determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kozielska et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Meisel et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we focus on the effect of the house fly proto-Y chromosomes on male courtship performance. Males carrying the III<sup>M</sup> chromosome (III<sup>M</sup> males) outcompete males carrying the Y<sup>M</sup> chromosome (Y<sup>M</sup> males) for female mates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hamm et al., 2009</xref>). In light of this and other aforementioned phenotypic differences between Y<sup>M</sup> and III<sup>M</sup> males, it is remarkable that the III<sup>M</sup> and Y<sup>M</sup> chromosomes carry nearly all of the same genes as their homologous proto-X chromosomes (III and X), and only a small number of allelic differences have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Meisel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Son and Meisel, 2021</xref>). These similarities between the proto-Y and proto-X chromosomes have led to the hypothesis that the phenotypic effects of the proto-Y chromosomes may be mediated by <italic>trans</italic> effects of Y<sup>M</sup> and III<sup>M</sup> alleles on the expression of genes elsewhere in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adhikari et al., 2021</xref>).

In addition, III<sup>M</sup> males have greater heat tolerance than Y<sup>M</sup> males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Delclos et al., 2021</xref>), further suggesting that the benefits of the III<sup>M</sup> chromosome may be limited to warm temperatures. We therefore tested if the differences in courtship performance between Y<sup>M</sup> and III<sup>M</sup> males are sensitive to temperature. We found that III<sup>M</sup> males were more successful at mating than Y<sup>M</sup> males regardless of developmental temperature (ANOVA,χ<sup>2</sup>=20.7, p=6.53 × 10<sup>–6</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We then tested whether males reared at different developmental temperatures, but with the same genotype, have a difference in courtship success. We found that males reared at 18°C outcompete males reared at 29°C, regardless of genotype (ANOVA, χ<sup>2</sup>=13.1, p=2.93 × 10<sup>–4</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This demonstrates that there is an effect of developmental temperature on courtship success, but it appears to be independent of the genotype effect. More generally, our results suggest that the III<sup>M</sup> male courtship advantage is robust to developmental temperature, which differs from the prediction based on temperature-dependent <italic>Obp56h</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We next tested if the effects of developmental temperature and genotype on competitive mating advantage could be caused by differences in copulation latency. To measure copulation latency, we combined five males from a single strain raised at a single temperature with five females from the unrelated strain used in our competitive courtship assays. Developmental temperature had a significant effect on copulation latency (ANOVA, χ<sup>2</sup>=15.3, p=9.40 × 10<sup>–5</sup>), with males reared at 22°C mating faster than those reared at 29°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This result is consistent with increased courtship success of males raised at 18°C relative to those raised at 29°C in our competitive assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>We conducted a survival analysis to test for differences in copulation latency between Y<sup>M</sup> and III<sup>M</sup>. To those ends, we fit a Cox proportional hazards regression model, treating unmated males as censored data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Burke and Holwell, 2021</xref>), and we observed significant effects of both developmental temperature (ANOVA, χ<sup>2</sup>=14.6, p=1.35 × 10<sup>–4</sup>) and male genotype (χ<sup>2</sup>=15.8, p=3.73 × 10<sup>–4</sup>) on copulation latency. However, there was no significant interaction effect between genotype and developmental temperature (χ<sup>2</sup>=3.86, p=0.145). Consistent with our hypothesis that III<sup>M</sup> males have a reduced copulation latency relative to Y<sup>M</sup> males, at 22°C, III<sup>M</sup> males mated nearly three times faster than Y<sup>M</sup> males (Cox model: HR = 2.92, 95% CI=1.42–6.03, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We do not observe this trend at 29°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), possibly due to very few successful matings at the warmer developmental temperature.</p><p>To further address the limitations of censored data, we treated copulation latency as a binary variable by calculating the proportion of the five males per trial that mated within the 4 hr assay. We observed significant effects of male genotype (ANOVA, χ<sup>2</sup>=10.2, p=6.18 × 10<sup>–3</sup>) and developmental temperature (ANOVA, χ<sup>2</sup>=11.0, p=9.04 × 10<sup>–4</sup>) on the proportion of males that mated. The effect of developmental temperature was largely a result of very few matings for males that developed at 29°C relative to 22°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), consistent with our finding that males that developed at a lower temperature have higher courtship success (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the 22°C treatment, a significantly greater proportion of III<sup>M</sup> males mated within 4 hr than Y<sup>M</sup> (61.7% vs. 28.3%; Z-test of proportions, p=1.21 × 10<sup>–4</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). There is further evidence that III<sup>M</sup> males have reduced copulation latency, which is consistent with their previously documented competitive advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hamm et al., 2009</xref>), the competitive advantage that we observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and the reduced expression of <italic>Obp56h</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The Y<sup>M</sup> and III<sup>M</sup> males that we and others have previously used in courtship experiments all share the CS genetic background that comes from a III<sup>M</sup> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hamm et al., 2009</xref>). This raises the possibility that III<sup>M</sup> males perform better because they have a proto-Y chromosome that is co-adapted to its genetic background. To test this hypothesis, we measured copulation latency in Y<sup>M</sup> males from the same strain (LPR) as the females in our experiments. We observed a greater proportion of III<sup>M</sup> males mating within 4 hr when compared to the LPR Y<sup>M</sup> males (Z-test of proportions, p=0.038), although the copulation latency in LPR males was highly variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, the reduced copulation latency conferred by the III<sup>M</sup> chromosome overwhelms any potential effects of co-adaptation of the proto-Y chromosome to male genetic background or male-female co-adaptation within strains. The reduced copulation latency of III<sup>M</sup> males is only detectable when house flies develop at 22°C, suggesting that it is either temperature-dependent or we lack the resolution to detect it when males develop at warmer temperatures (because they take too long to mate).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>House fly chromosome III genes and <italic>Drosophila</italic> X chromosome genes have correlated expression with Obp56h genes</title><p>The <italic>Obp56h</italic> gene cluster is found on house fly chromosome V, suggesting that it is regulated in <italic>trans</italic> by genes on the Y<sup>M</sup> or III<sup>M</sup> chromosome.

Removing samples with a different genetic background did not affect the general difference in <italic>Obp56h</italic> expression between III<sup>M</sup> and Y<sup>M</sup> males. Specifically, we conducted DE analysis on males with a shared (CS) genetic background. These males with a shared genetic background differ only in their proto-Y chromosome (Y<sup>M</sup> or III<sup>M</sup>).

We hypothesize that constraints on the regulators of <italic>spdt</italic>, or the genes it regulates, likely prevent its upregulation in neurons—specifically neurons in the head that affect copulation latency.

This dual role of CHCs in mating and desiccation resistance suggests that sexual selection on <italic>Obp56h</italic> expression could be pleiotropically constrained by trade-offs with stress response. Our GO enrichment analysis on both the house fly and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> RNA-seq data also revealed that <italic>Obp56h</italic> expression is correlated with the expression of genes involved in general stress responses, supporting this hypothesis.

As described above, deleterious fitness effects could result from both pleiotropic effects of upregulation of the negative regulators of <italic>Obp56h</italic> and downstream effects of the downregulation of <italic>Obp56h</italic>. Regardless of the cause, these fitness costs are likely to affect both males and females. However, downregulation of <italic>Obp56h</italic> confers a fitness benefit to males that may offset any fitness costs. III<sup>M</sup> males can realize this fitness benefit because the III<sup>M</sup> chromosome carries at least one negative <italic>trans</italic> regulator of <italic>Obp56h</italic>. Therefore, our results provide evidence that sexual antagonism can arise via conflicts between sexual selection in males and opposing pleiotropic effects in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lande, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fitzpatrick, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mank et al., 2008</xref>). It also appears that the intersexual conflict over <italic>Obp56h</italic> expression was (at least partially) resolved with the Y-linkage of the <italic>trans</italic> regulators in III<sup>M</sup> males.</p><p>Upregulation of the III<sup>M</sup> alleles of <italic>Md-spdt</italic>, <italic>Md-gd</italic>, and/or <italic>Md-Gr35</italic> alone cannot fully resolve the intersexual conflict over <italic>Obp56h</italic> regulation for at least two reasons. First, Y<sup>M</sup> males do not realize the fitness benefit because they do not carry a III<sup>M</sup> chromosome. Therefore, Y<sup>M</sup> males remain evolutionarily constrained in their expression of <italic>Obp56h</italic>, suggesting that other fitness benefits are responsible for the maintenance of the Y<sup>M</sup> chromosome. Previous work suggests that temperature-dependent fitness differences could be responsible—specifically Y<sup>M</sup> males have higher fitness at colder temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Feldmeyer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Delclos et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that the III<sup>M</sup> courtship advantage may be temperature-sensitive, which could create context-dependent fitness effects that favor Y<sup>M</sup> males in specific environments. This is consistent with the prediction that genotype-by-environment interactions can maintain variation in sexually selected traits across heterogeneous environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kokko and Heubel, 2008</xref>). In contrast to that prediction, we failed to detect effects of temperature on the III<sup>M</sup> courtship advantage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), although we did not comprehensively test for environmental effects. Additional work could evaluate whether trade-offs across environments create opportunities for Y<sup>M</sup> males to have courtship advantages in specific contexts.</p><p>A second reason that the intersexual conflict over <italic>Obp56h</italic> regulation is not fully resolved is that female house flies can carry the III<sup>M</sup> chromosome. The male determining gene on the Y<sup>M</sup> and III<sup>M</sup> chromosome (<italic>Mdmd</italic>) is a negative regulator of <italic>Md-tra</italic> splicing, and there is a dominant allele (<italic>Md-tra<sup>D</sup></italic>) that is desensitized to the effects of <italic>Mdmd</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hediger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>). This allows female house flies to carry Y<sup>M</sup> or III<sup>M</sup> if they also carry <italic>Md-tra<sup>D</sup></italic>. Females with III<sup>M</sup> and <italic>Md-tra<sup>D</sup></italic> in their genotype may suffer a fitness cost from upregulation of <italic>Md-spdt</italic>, <italic>Md-gd</italic>, and <italic>Md-Gr35</italic> and/or downregulation of <italic>Obp56h.</italic> Therefore, even though the putatively sexually antagonistic alleles are Y-linked, they can still be carried by females, leaving the conflict unresolved. Consistent with this interpretation, previous work has determined that sexually antagonistic fitness effects of the house fly proto-Y chromosomes could contribute to the maintenance of the Y<sup>M</sup>-III<sup>M</sup> polymorphism within natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Meisel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Meisel, 2021</xref>). Our results provide a mechanism by which the III<sup>M</sup> chromosome could confer sexually antagonistic effects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Commonalities across sex chromosome evolution</title><p>Our results have two additional implications for our understanding of the evolution of sex chromosomes. First, our results provide evidence that gene duplication is important for the acquisition of genes with male-specific functions during the evolution of Y chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Koerich et al., 2008</xref>). The most central gene in the co-expression module, <italic>LOC101887703</italic>, has a paralog in the house fly genome (<italic>LOC101890114</italic>) that is predicted to be on chromosome III. These two genes are homologous to <italic>D. melanogaster CG8745</italic>, which we hypothesize is negatively regulated by <italic>Obp56h</italic> based on conserved correlated expression in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and house fly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The two transcripts encoded by <italic>LOC101887703</italic> and <italic>LOC101890114</italic> are &lt;1% diverged in their nucleotide sequences, suggesting a recent duplication event. <italic>CG8745</italic> is broadly expressed in many <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chintapalli et al., 2007</xref>), and broadly expressed genes often give rise to paralogs with sex-specific expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Meisel et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesize that one of the two paralogs (<italic>LOC101887703</italic> or <italic>LOC101890114</italic>) has evolved a male-specific function, which resolved an intersexual conflict associated with the coregulation of <italic>CG8745</italic> and <italic>Obp56h</italic>. It is not clear which gene is ancestral and which is derived. However, a derived paralog with sex-specific expression is consistent with duplication of a broadly expressed gene to resolve an intersexual conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Connallon and Clark, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gallach and Betrán, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">VanKuren and Long, 2018</xref>). Those types of duplications often involve genes on sex chromosomes—either when a broadly expressed X-linked gene gives rise to an autosomal gene with sex-specific expression, or when a gene is duplicated onto the Y chromosome and evolves male-specific expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Betrán et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Emerson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Koerich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Meisel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mahajan and Bachtrog, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ricchio et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with this evolutionary trajectory, the only identified differences between the house fly Y<sup>M</sup> and X chromosomes thus far have been autosome-to-Y duplications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Meisel et al., 2017</xref>). Future work could address a potential sexually dimorphic subfunctionalization of the two <italic>CG8745</italic> paralogs in the house fly genome.</p><p>Second, our results suggest that intersexual conflict may have been an important factor in the convergent evolution of Muller element A into a sex chromosome in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and house fly. Muller element F was the X chromosome of the most recent common ancestor of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and house fly, and element A became the <italic>Drosophila</italic> X chromosome after the divergence with most other flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Vicoso and Bachtrog, 2013</xref>). Element A also recently became a sex chromosome in house fly when it acquired an <italic>Mdmd</italic> gene, creating the III<sup>M</sup> chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Meisel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Son and Meisel, 2021</xref>). Element A has become a sex chromosome in at least two other dipteran lineages: <italic>Glossina</italic> (tsetse flies) and <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Pease and Hahn, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Vicoso and Bachtrog, 2015</xref>), raising the possibility that element A is primed to be recruited as a sex chromosome. Similar convergent sex-linkage of the same chromosomal region has been observed in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">O’Meally et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Furman and Evans, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ezaz et al., 2017</xref>), which could be explained by the same gene independently acquiring a sex determining allele in multiple independent lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Takehana et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesize that element A may be convergently recruited to be a sex chromosome because the <italic>trans</italic> regulatory connections with <italic>Obp56h</italic> create sexually antagonistic effects related to male mating behavior. This differs from the hypothesized cause of convergent evolution of sex chromosomes in vertebrates, which is based on the expectation that some chromosomes contain an excess of genes that are predisposed to become sex determiners. Sexually antagonistic alleles are expected to be an important selective force in the formation of new sex chromosomes because sex-limited inheritance can resolve the intersexual conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">van Doorn and Kirkpatrick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Roberts et al., 2009</xref>). Our results suggest that an enrichment of genes involved in a regulatory network with sexually antagonistic effects could promote the sex-linkage of the same chromosome in distantly related species without convergent evolution of a master sex determiner.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have identified <italic>Obp56h</italic> expression as a candidate mechanism implicated in regulating courtship performance between Y<sup>M</sup> and III<sup>M</sup> house flies.

We assigned RNA-seq reads to house fly transcripts from genome assembly v2.0.2 and annotation release 102 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Scott et al., 2014</xref>) using kallisto in single-end read mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bray et al., 2016</xref>). All RNA-seq reads were single-end, and we set the average fragment length to 300 bp and standard deviation to 30 bp for all samples. Our expression analysis was performed at the level of transcripts (as opposed to genes), which should not affect our conclusions because all of our focal genes each produce one annotated transcript.</p><p>We tested for DE transcripts between males with a Y<sup>M</sup> chromosome and males with a III<sup>M</sup> chromosome using a combination of DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Love et al., 2014</xref>), sva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Leek et al., 2012</xref>), and limma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>). We only included transcripts that passed an initial threshold filter of 0.5 counts per million in at least four samples. Read counts for each of those transcripts were normalized by variance stabilizing transformation in DESeq2. To remove batch effects across data sets, we used the sva package to identify and estimate surrogate variables that adjust for latent sources of variation (e.g. batch effects). To identify DE transcripts between Y<sup>M</sup> and III<sup>M</sup> males, we used the lmFit() function in limma to fit a linear model comprised of male type (Y<sup>M</sup> vs. III<sup>M</sup>) and our surrogate variables as fixed effects, and read counts as the response variable. We then computed contrasts between male types and calculated test statistics using the eBayes() function.

For all pairs of transcripts with variable expression across samples, we calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficient across all samples. We created an unsigned correlation matrix and adjusted the soft-threshold value (β) to which among-transcript covariances are exponentially raised to ensure a scale-free topology (this resulted in β=7), thereby creating a weighted network of gene expression. An unsigned matrix allows us to identify connected transcripts whose expression is either positively or negatively correlated. Within this topological overlapping network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Li and Horvath, 2007</xref>), transcripts were hierarchically clustered, and modules were identified based on the degree of similarity among transcripts. We used a merging threshold of 0.2, with a minimum module size of 30 and a mean connectivity threshold of greater than or equal to 0.7. We used the default parameters of WGCNA for the rest of the analyses. We then correlated module eigengene values for a given module across samples via Pearson’s correlation and identified modules differentially regulated between male types at FDR-adjusted p&lt;0.05.</p><p>To visualize WGCNA genetic covariance results among modules significantly associated with male type, we exported final co-expression networks to Cytoscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>).

To identify transcripts that may have more central functions within and across our significant modules, we ranked transcripts in descending order based on intramodular connectivity (kWithin), calculated in WGCNA. Hub genes identified by intramodular connectivity are generally functionally important transcripts within a module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Langfelder et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We further analyzed among-transcript connections involving a family of odorant binding protein genes (<italic>Obp56h</italic>).

We used the genotype of these SNPs in Y<sup>M</sup> males (which possess two standard third chromosome alleles) to determine the standard chromosome III allele.

We also identified positions where III<sup>M</sup> males appear monoallelic for an allele not found in Y<sup>M</sup> males.

In these experiments, we used the same two house fly strains as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hamm et al., 2009</xref>: a III<sup>M</sup> strain called CS and a Y<sup>M</sup> strain called IsoCS. These two strains have a common genetic background (CS), and only differ in which proto-Y chromosome they carry. Both strains are represented in the RNA-seq data we analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Meisel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Son et al., 2019</xref>), and IsoCS was also included in a previous RNA-seq study comparing the effects of proto-Y chromosome and temperature on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adhikari et al., 2021</xref>). Our experiment differed from previous work because we reared larvae from each strain at either 18°C and 29°C, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hamm et al., 2009</xref>, worked with flies raised at 28°C. We used the same larval wheat bran diet as done previously, and we fed adults an ad libitum supply of water and an ad libitum 1:1 mixture of dry-milk:sugar. This is also the same diet and rearing protocol used for the flies in the RNA-seq data sets that we analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Meisel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Son et al., 2019</xref>). Male flies were isolated from females within ~1 hr of eclosion, and each sex was kept separately to ensure that flies had not mated prior to the experiment.</p><p>We carried out two distinct competitive courtship experiments: (1) inter-strain competition between males with different genotypes (i.e. Y<sup>M</sup> vs. III<sup>M</sup>) that were reared at the same temperature (363 successful mating trials out of 490 total attempts across 27 experimental batches); and (2) intra-strain competition between males with the same genotype that were reared at different temperatures (104 successful mating trials out of 129 total attempts across 7 batches). When we competed flies with different genotypes raised at the same temperature, all males were aged 4–6 days post pupal emergence. When we compared flies with the same genotype raised at different temperatures, 29°C males were aged 4–5 days post emergence and 18°C males were aged 6–7 days post emergence. We aged flies from the colder temperature for more days than flies from the warmer temperature because developmental rate is positively correlated with developmental temperature in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atkinson, 1996</xref>). The ages we selected ensure that all males were physiologically capable of mating, while also sampling flies at similar physiological ages across experiments.</p><p>The two males in each experiment were labeled using red and blue luminous powder (BioQuip) by shaking the flies in an 8 oz paper cup. The color assigned to males was switched in each successive batch (i.e. blue Y<sup>M</sup> and red III<sup>M</sup> in one batch, and then red Y<sup>M</sup> and blue III<sup>M</sup> in the next batch). In addition, we included the genotype or developmental temperature of the blue-colored male as a fixed effect in our statistical analysis (see below), which provides an additional control for color.</p><p>For each replicate of the competitive courtship assay, we placed the two different males in a 32 oz transparent plastic container, along with a single virgin female. Each plastic container also contained a 1:1 mixture of dry milk:sugar in a 1 oz paper cup and water in a glass scintillation vial plugged with a cotton roll. Virgin females from the LPR strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Scott et al., 1996</xref>) raised at 25°C were used for all combinations of males. The LPR strain has a different genetic background than the males used in the assay, minimizing any effects of co-adaptation between females and a particular subset of males. All flies were transferred into the mating containers using an aspirator and without anesthesia. All matings were performed in a 25°C incubator because copulation latency is too long for experimentally tractable measurement at lower temperatures. The color (i.e. genotype) of the first male to mate was recorded, as well as the time to mate.</p><p>We used the glmer() function in the lme4 package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) to test for the effects of genotype and temperature on male mating success.

Experimental batch (b) was modeled as a random effect, with the winning male (W: CS or IsoCS) as a response variable. We then assessed significance of fixed effects (type II sum of squares) using the Anova() function in the car package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Fox et al., 2013</xref>).

In these experiments, we used the same IsoCS (Y<sup>M</sup>) and CS (III<sup>M</sup>) strains as above and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hamm et al., 2009</xref>. We also tested one other strain from each genotype. CSrab (III<sup>M</sup>) was created by backcrossing the III<sup>M</sup> chromosome from the rspin strain isolated in New York onto the CS background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Shono and Scott, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Son et al., 2019</xref>). CSaY (Y<sup>M</sup>) was created by backcrossing the Y<sup>M</sup> chromosome from the aabys genome reference strain onto the CS background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Scott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Meisel et al., 2015</xref>). Virgin females used in the assays were all from the LPR strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Scott et al., 1996</xref>), which has a different genetic background than all males tested. In addition, we also assayed LPR males to determine how copulation latencies of III<sup>M</sup> and Y<sup>M</sup> males compare to those of males from the same genetic background as the females.</p><p>We first attempted to test flies reared at the same temperatures as in our competitive courtship assays (18°C and 29°C), as well as at an intermediate developmental temperature (22°C). However, we did not generate enough flies at 18°C, and so we only have data for flies raised at 22°C and 29°C. Our results demonstrate that 22°C is a sufficiently low temperature to detect effects of both genotype and developmental temperature on courtship success (see below). All larvae from each male strain were reared in 32 oz plastic containers on the same wheat bran diet described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hamm et al., 2009</xref>). Upon emergence, unmated male and female progeny were separated and fed water and a 1:1 mixture of dry milk:sugar ad libitum until assays were conducted. Assays of males raised at 22°C were conducted 10–11 days after eclosion, while those of males raised at 29°C were conducted 6–7 days after eclosion. This ensures that males were assayed at similar physiological ages. Females were all raised at 25°C, and unmated females were aged 8–9 days after eclosion.</p><p>We followed a similar protocol as in a previous experiment testing copulation latency in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Shorter et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, five males from a single strain were aspirated without anesthesia into an 8 oz container covered with a fine mesh cloth secured by rubber band. Five LPR females were similarly transferred into the container, marking the start of the courtship assay. The house flies were then observed every 10 min over the course of 4 hr. Copulation latency was determined in two ways. First, we measured the amount of time elapsed between the start of an assay and each mating within a container, defined as a male remaining attached to a female for at least 1 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hamm et al., 2009</xref>). Male house flies typically remain attached to females for &gt;60 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bryant, 1980</xref>), making it unlikely, although possible, for us to miss matings within 10 min intervals. Individuals who did not mate were excluded from this analysis. Second, we used a binary variable noting whether each male mated during the 4 hr assay. Although we were unable to distinguish between individual males in this assay, we did not observe any males mate more than once within 4 hr in a pilot study conducted between one male and five females, suggesting that observed matings were by different males. All trials were conducted at 22–23°C.</p><p>To determine the effects of male type on the amount of time taken to mate, we used the glmer() function in the lme4 package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) to create a mixed effects model as follows:<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">L</mml:mi><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">G</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">T</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">G</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">T</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>including male genotype (G), developmental temperature (T), and their interaction as fixed effects, batch (b) and strain (s) as random effects, and our response variable as copulation latency (L) in minutes. For the binary measure of copulation latency, we used a binomial logistic regression of the same model, with whether a fly mated as our dependent variable. We then assessed significance of fixed effects (type II sum of squares) using the Anova() function in the car package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Fox et al., 2013</xref>). Pairwise comparisons between male types (III<sup>M</sup>, Y<sup>M</sup>, and LPR) were conducted using Z-tests of proportions.</p><p>Lastly, we conducted a survival analysis, with unmated males treated as right-censored observations since information about their mating latency was incomplete. Specifically, we used the Surv() function in the coxme package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Therneau, 2022</xref>) to convert our copulation latency measurements (in minutes) to a right-censored survival object. We then created a Cox proportional hazards regression model using the same parameters as above, with copulation latency (in minutes) as our response variable. We assessed significance of fixed effects using analysis of deviance for a Cox model using the Anova() function, and we report hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals for copulation latency effect sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Burke and Holwell, 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Assaying copulation latency in CG2120 upregulated <italic>D. melanogaster</italic></title><p>We used CRISPR/dCas9 transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) to increase the expression of <italic>CG2120</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.

Control males were generated by substituting the <italic>CG2120</italic> sgRNA strain with a strain carrying an sgRNA that targets the QUAS sequence from <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> (BDSC stock 67539). All flies were raised at 25°C on a medium consisting of cornmeal, yeast, sugar, and agar.</p><p>We measured copulation latency in <italic>CG2120</italic> upregulated males and control males. In each experiment, we used a single unmated male from one of the crosses described above. That male was combined with a single unmated female from either the CantonS or OregonR strain in a vial containing our standard medium. The flies were observed for up to 2.5 hr at 25°C, and the time at which they began to copulate was recorded as our measurement of copulation latency.

We used the lmer() function in the lme4 package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) to determine how each variable affects copulation latency (C). We compared that full model with one excluding the interaction term with a χ<sup>2</sup> test in the Anova() function in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">R Development Core Team, 2019</xref>) in order to test if including the interaction term offers a significantly better fit. If the interaction term did not significantly improve the fit of the model, we compared the model without the interaction term with one without any effect of the female strain (i.e. F excluded from the model). If there was not a significant difference in fit between the models with and without F, we modeled female strain as a random effect. To test for an effect of <italic>CG2120</italic> upregulation on copulation latency, we compared the fit of the model with male genotype as the only fixed effect and two random effects (f and b) with a model that only had the random effects (i.e. no fixed effects) using the Anova() function.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Kiran Adhikari is affiliated with Oxford Biomedica Solutions LLC.

The set of evidence obtained by combining observations in house fly and functional test in the model fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is solid, but the causal effect of the odorant protein expression and the fly behaviour will need to be functionally validated in house fly as well.

I read the manuscript, the reviews and the response to the reviews. I concur with the reviewers that the work is important. The two reviewers saw the merit of the work which is very data-rich. The authors' work leveraged that two Y chromosomes (Y-M and III-M) are involved in male mating choice and compiled analyses of gene expression in M. domestica male heads to identify genes that are differentially expressed between carriers of the two Y-chromosomes, with an emphasis on odorant binding proteins. The results suggest that Obp56h is differentially expressed between the two genotypes. This gene has been implicated with variation in male mating behavior in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. The rest of the piece works with the premise that Obp56h is the responsible allele for variation in Musca and studies (i) the genetic interactions between Obp56h and other genes in the gene network and (ii) between interaction between the allele and environment (i.e., temperature).

The authors report that odorant binding proteins of the Obp56h family are differentially expressed between flies carrying the IIIM Y chromosome and the YM Y chromosome. They suggest that these family members mediate the courtship differences. Since Obp56h is not located on either Y chromosome, the Y chromosomes' effects on Obp56h expression must be in trans. The authors used network analysis to identify potential IIIM or YM regulators of Obp56h. They show that upregulating neural expression of a transcription factor homologous to one of those genes, and that binds up- and down-stream of Obp56h, affects copulation latency in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. They hypothesize that its IIIM linked Musca domestica homolog is upregulated, causing the courtship differences in males carrying this chromosome. The analyses are appropriate and done well.

I read the manuscript, the reviews and the response to the reviews. I concur with the reviewers that the work is important. The two reviewers saw the merit of the work which is very data-rich. The authors' work leveraged that two Y chromosomes (Y-M and III-M) are involved in male mating choice and compiled analyses of gene expression in M. domestica male heads to identify genes that are differentially expressed between carriers of the two Y-chromosomes, with an emphasis on odorant binding proteins. The results suggest that Obp56h is differentially expressed between the two genotypes. This gene has been implicated with variation in male mating behavior in D. melanogaster. The rest of the piece works with the premise that Obp56h is the responsible allele for variation in Musca and studies (i) the genetic interactions between Obp56h and other genes in the gene network and (ii) between interaction between the allele and environment (i.e., temperature).

Based on the comments raised by the editor and reviewers from Review Commons (see below), we have added several components to this study that strengthen our hypothesis that the regulatory mechanism that influence male mating behavior (copulation latency) may be conserved between <italic>Musca domestica</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. In addition, we have made significant edits to the tone of the manuscript to highlight the strengths of our manuscript. Specifically, we reframe the main theme of this study by focusing on the fitness effects Y chromosomes can manifest through <italic>trans</italic> effects on autosomal genes. We further highlight these points with the addition of a functional experiment in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> that verifies the role of one candidate <italic>trans</italic> regulator of male copulation latency (which we propose the name <italic>speed date, spdt</italic>). We believe that the revisions made since first submitting this manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic> have significantly improved the overall quality of our work, and we thank the reviewers and Reviewing Editor again for their time and consideration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General Statements [optional]</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their positive and constructive comments about our research topic, experimental design, and analysis. The majority of revisions we were asked to make were minor, and we were able to incorporate most of the reviewer comments as edits to the manuscript. These changes have improved the quality and clarity of this manuscript. Most of the remaining comments involved experiments that are simply not feasible in the house fly system because of limited genetic tools. When experiments such as those were suggested, we toned down our conclusions in order to not overstate the interpretations of our results.</p><p>While reviewer #1 suggested mostly minor revisions, reviewer #2 raises valid concerns regarding the conclusions we can draw based on the correlational evidence we present. We found these comments incredibly helpful and believe that incorporating these comments has provided a more appropriate tone for our discussion and conclusion components of this manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2 also suggested some additional experiments that would improve the overall quality of this study. While we agree that these experiments (spatial expression patterns, functional genetic data from house flies, and cuticular hydrocarbon and desiccation resistance assays between III<sup>M</sup> and Y<sup>M</sup> house flies) would further our understanding of the functional role of <italic>Obp56h</italic> genes in house fly, we are unfortunately limited in the resources available to conduct some of these experiments in house fly. However, we have noted a cuticular hydrocarbon experiment we are currently conducting and analyzing as part of another project in the III<sup>M</sup>/Y<sup>M</sup> house fly system. If reviewers believe that this data set would be a necessary component for this manuscript, we would certainly consider incorporating those data if logistically feasible within the requested period of time.

I would suggest adding more some more information of this type to the supplementary information (e.g. model scripts and tables with model outputs). I don't have any particular concerns that the statistical analysis is incorrect, and there are no issues when it comes to replication, but since the phenotypic data was analysed in several different ways, it would help the clarity of the results to include this information.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the description of these analyses should be clarified.

However, the findings are all correlational, making the larger conclusions too speculative and uncertain. The overly speculative conclusions include elimination of temperature as a contributor to maintenance of variation and the model that Obp expression explains the differences in copulation latency and is part of a conserved trans-regulatory loop. Without functional genetic data for Obp56h in housefly, much of the language in the discussion should be tamped down to better match the strength of the evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that this was one of the more substantial concerns that this reviewer had with the manuscript, and we certainly don’t want to extrapolate our conclusions beyond what the correlational data show. We also note that it is not feasible to perform functional genetic experiments in house fly because we lack the molecular genetic toolkits available in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (e.g., GAL4-UAS RNAi, female germline CRISPR). As such, we have tried to incorporate cautionary statements within the discussion and conclusions sections of this manuscript to tamp down the language to better match the strength of the evidence we provide.</p><p>In addition, we have added several experiments and analyses since these reviewer comments. One such experiment was the copulation assay experiment testing the functional effect of <italic>CG2120</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> via CRISPRa activation. We believe that these edits have helped set a more appropriate tone for our manuscript, especially relating to the discussion and conclusions. Furthermore, we believe that the addition of this experiment has provided some of the functional genetic data that the reviewer was encouraging us to include.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors depend heavily on functional experiments done in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> to support their inferences about the likely function of Obp56h in housefly. However, the Obp56h gene family has duplicated, and presumably diverged, in the housefly lineage. Thus, the manuscript would benefit from more detailed discussion/overview on the other known roles of Obps in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as well as other insects. For instance, discussion of the Obp LUSH's role in binding cVA or Obp59a's role in sensing humidity could lend further support to the author's predictions.</p></disp-quote><p>Obps are an extremely diverse group of genes with a wide variety of functions. While our manuscript only deals with a single Obp family (with only 1 gene copy in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>), we agree with the reviewer that it would be of some value to describe the diversity of Obp functions that have been characterized in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other insects. We believe that this could be especially relevant to our work because some Obps have been shown to affect multiple organismal phenotypes, which are candidate systems in which pleiotropic constraints could limit the response to selection. We now describe some of the diversity of Obps, along with the relevance to our work, within the Results and Discussion (lines 918-926).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study would benefit from additional data on the spatial expression patterns of theObp56h family across the major chemosensory organs in head tissue (the labellum, maxillary palps, antennae) using qPCR or RT-PCR. This would provide evidence that Obp56h is expressed in these chemosensory tissues in the housefly and may clarify relationships with potential interacting genes, like the gustatory receptor.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these assays would certainly add clearer evidence towards the functional relevance of some of the correlations in gene expression we observed (in particular the relationship between <italic>Obp56h</italic> genes and <italic>Gr98c</italic>). Unfortunately due to logistical reasons, this is currently unfeasible for us to carry out within a reasonable time in house fly. However, we have mined available microarray and RNA-seq from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> to identify where in the head <italic>Obp56h, Gr98c</italic>, and other hub genes are expressed. Using the FlyAtlas microarray dataset, we confirmed that <italic>Obp56h</italic> is highly expressed in head. <italic>Obp56h</italic> is also moderately expressed in the brain, but not in the eye. In contrast, <italic>Gr98c</italic> is expressed very low in all head tissues. We also looked at the expression of other hub genes in the co-expression network. The major locus of co-expression for <italic>Obp56h</italic> and the hub genes appears to be in the labellum. We now report this in the revised manuscript (Methods on lines 226-251; Results on lines 746-751, and Figure S7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the authors argue that Obp56h expression may be pleiotropically constrained due to tradeoffs with stress response and highlight desiccation resistance in particular as a potential mechanism. The study would benefit from experiments that test this hypothesis directly by comparing desiccation resistance among the two male genotypes. Though a potential caveat of this experiment is that it's not clear whether differences in Obp56h expression would affect CHC level as it may function for chemo-sensation, not production, either way the results would provide useful information.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment here. We are actually currently conducting a series of cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) assays in this house fly system for a separate research project. While the experiment remains to be completed and analyzed, we would perhaps be willing to incorporate these data if reviewers find that this CHC data set would be a necessary component of this current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2A, B need the 100 mark on their Y-axes. The sample size in panel B is small. Is each of its points the average of the 10 replicate samples? How consistent were all 10 replicates' results?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the 100 mark on the Y-axes of Figures 2A and 2B, making it consistent with the Y-axis of panel C. The reviewer is right that each point in panel B is a measure based on one experimental batch (i.e., each data point is a batch). There are 5 batches for III<sup>M</sup> males and 5 batches for Y<sup>M</sup> males. Each batch consists of 10 competitive mating assays. Each competitive assay in Figure 2B consists of combining one female with one 18°C male and one 29°C male. Therefore, a single data point in this panel represents the proportion of 18°C males that successfully mated relative to the number of successful matings that occurred across the 10 assays in a batch. The consistency in this measure across batches (i.e., % 18°C males that successfully mated) can be seen in panel B. The reviewer should note that, if temperature-dependent <italic>Obp56h</italic> expression were highly predictive of male mating success, we would expect that III<sup>M</sup> males raised at 29°C to outperform III<sup>M</sup> males at 18°C, which is clearly not the case even with only 5 experimental batches of III<sup>M</sup> males. We have edited the discussion of these results in lines 500-506.</p><p>Moreover, we would like to point out to the reviewer that these assays involving males raised at two different temperatures are especially challenging to perform because it is difficult to obtain males of the same age that were raised at two different temperatures. This is because temperature greatly affects developmental rate, and syncing development at 2 temperatures is hard to do. We only performed assays when we were able to adequately sync the development of flies at 18°C and 29°C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Relatedly, Figure 2AandB are confusing to interpret without being able to see all of the datapoints (for instance, the text says &quot;IIIM males were more successful than YM males regardless of developmental temperature&quot; but the graph only shows the percentage of IIIM males that had mated, presumably they did better than YM males because the median is above 50%?). It may help to plot the data in a different way (stacked bar chart, or maybe total % of males mated with the genotypes in 2 different colors so that any difference is more apparent).</p></disp-quote><p>Figures 2A and B shows the % of III<sup>M</sup> males mated in an assay where the outcome could either be III<sup>M</sup> or Y<sup>M</sup>. Since this is a dichotomous mating assay, the percent of Y<sup>M</sup> males that mated in these assays (or the percent of 29°C that mated in the case of panel B) is simply the remaining percentage. This could be ambiguous in a mate choice assay conducted with &gt;2 male types, but it is not ambiguous in our work. Each data point shows the results from one experimental batch, with the average across batches shown as a horizontal line. If reviewers believe that presenting this as a stacked bar chart is more informative, we would be willing to make this change, but the batch level data would be missing if we only summarized across batches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is problematic to interpret tests of mating latency that were done at the same temperature, for animals raised at different temperatures.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this result is limited in that sense, and we would ideally like to perform all mating assays at multiple temperatures. However, there is a limited temperature range within which mating assays can be performed in house fly. At temperatures below 25°C, matings do not occur frequently enough within a reasonable time frame for us to gather sufficient experimental data. However, as reviewer 1 pointed out, developmental temperature might be more important than courtship temperature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 423, 432, having few successful matings makes it impossible to measure copulation latency</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is referring to the result that many males, particularly those developed at 29°C, did not mate within the 4 hours of the behavioral observations. We agree that greater sample sizes, or perhaps a longer observation period (&gt; 4 hrs) is needed to more accurately measure copulation latency for the two lines reviewer 2 refers to. For that reason, we have tried to focus more on the more robust behavioral results obtained from the single-choice mating assays (such as the significantly greater proportion of III<sup>M</sup> males that mated within 4 hrs when developed at 22°C, as shown in Figure 2C). Despite the limitations of measuring copulation latency in minutes or the fact that flies reared at 29°C mated infrequently, we felt that omitting these results entirely would confuse readers more than leaving them in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Chromosome V could have diverged in the different populations. The assertion that itis unlikely to differ between YM and IIIM lines is not supported by data.</p></disp-quote><p>We worked with nearly isogenic strains in which either the Y<sup>M</sup> or III<sup>M</sup> chromosome was placed on a common genetic background. We are very confident that the Chromosome V is (nearly) genetically identical across most of the strains. We know the genetic ancestry of these strains because we created them by backcrossing. They are all inbred for the same alleles on that common genetic background. While there may be some new mutations that occurred in the strains subsequent to their creation, those mutations are unlikely to have meaningful effects for two reasons. First, they would have to be generated by new mutations (i.e., not previously existing segregating variation) given the shared inbred genetic background of all strains. Second, the time since creation is so short that it is highly unlikely that those new mutations rose from a frequency of 1/2N to (near) fixation.</p><p>We did include some strains with different backgrounds, but we were careful to consider the background effect in those data. For example, we repeated the RNA-seq analysis by excluding those strains with different backgrounds and obtained similar results (see lines 570-578). Second, we performed some of our assays using males from the LPR strain (see Figure 2C), which has a different background from all other strains used in the mating assays. This was done deliberately to determine the effect of the LPR background on copulation latency because the females come from the LPR strain. Importantly, we find that the III<sup>M</sup> chromosome on the common genetic background reduces copulation latency beyond the effect of the LPR background.</p><p>For these reasons, we are quite confident that chromosome V is NOT the cause of the phenotypic differences between the Y<sup>M</sup> and III<sup>M</sup> strains we used in our experiments. This is a core component of our inference that <italic>trans</italic> effects of III<sup>M</sup> (and/or Y<sup>M</sup>) are responsible for expression differences of <italic>Obp56h</italic> genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 18, It is hard to know how meaningful cross-genera comparisons are particularly when the directions of the effects differ between the two genera.</p></disp-quote><p>There are two inferred directions of effect. First, genes that are downregulated upon knockdown of <italic>Obp56h</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have house fly orthologs that are more downregulated in III<sup>M</sup> male house flies than expected by chance (Figure S6A in the revised manuscript). This cross-genera comparison is in the same direction in both species. We think that this is notable and worth emphasizing in the manuscript. Second, genes that are upregulated upon knockdown in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have house fly orthologs that tend to be downregulated in III<sup>M</sup> house flies (Figure S6B). We think that the reviewer is referring to this result, which is in opposite directions. Therefore, one of two cross-genera comparisons have effects in the same direction. As for how meaningful cross-genera comparisons are, it is certainly true that these are not definitive proofs of evolutionary conservation, but we find the result promising enough to warrant future investigation. We have elaborated on this specific result in lines 648-661.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several other conclusions are too speculative, such as whether Md-gd participates inToll signaling, or the basis for suggesting LOC1010893651 as the transcription factor regulating Obp56h.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken the reviewer’s general concern regarding the over-emphasis of our results into consideration during our revisions. We believe that the changes made throughout the results and discussion have emphasized the correlative nature of this study as well as the need for functional experiments to more confidently prove the conclusions we have drawn. Nonetheless, there is substantial evidence in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> that <italic>gd</italic> encodes a serine protease involved in activation of Toll signaling (LeMosy et al. PNAS April 24, 2001 98 (9) 5055-5060; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.081026598). This function is likely conserved across flies given the conservation of the protein coding sequence (60% amino acid identity between the protein coding sequences, including both the Trypsin-like serine protease region and the canonical Nterminal region). Similarly, we speculate that <italic>LOC1010893651</italic> may be the transcription factor that regulates <italic>Obp56h</italic>, and we emphasize the “may” in the revisions. In addition, we believe that our additional experiment testing the effect of CRISPRa activation of <italic>CG2120</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> adds even further evidence for the relationship between <italic>CG2120</italic> and reduced copulation latency in flies with reduced expression of <italic>Obp56h</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 522: &quot;…DE <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> X chromosome genes Obp56h knockdown flies&quot; should have &quot;in&quot; between genes and Obp56h.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this typo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 556-558: it seems a bit too speculative to hypothesize the trans regulatory feedback loop between house and fruit flies works through similar molecular functions based on a GO term, especially when that GO term is as vague as &quot;stress response&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that basing the argument on a single GO term, especially one as vague as “stress response”, is not a solid foundation for similar molecular functions underlying the <italic>trans</italic> regulatory loop in house flies and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. What we intended to say was that the shared GO term contributes to the other evidence we report for an evolutionarily conserved <italic>trans</italic> regulatory loop. We believe that the results described elsewhere in the paragraph (summarized in Figure S5) and results shown later (e.g., Figures 4, 6, and 8) are much stronger evidence for a conserved molecular pathway, whereas the GO term similarity is simply another (perhaps less substantial) piece of evidence. We have clarified this in the revisions (lines 648-661).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 726, the sex chromosome of Musca domestica and <italic>Drosophila</italic> melanogaster may have originated from the same autosome, but they are unlikely to still be the &quot;same&quot; chromosome.

The authors report that odorant binding proteins of the Obp56h family are differentially expressed between flies carrying the IIIM Y chromosome and the YM Y chromosome. They suggest that these family members mediate the courtship differences. Since Obp56h is not located on either Y chromosome, the Y chromosomes' effects on Obp56h expression must be in trans. The authors used network analysis to identify potential IIIM or YM regulators of Obp56h. They show that upregulating neural expression of a transcription factor homologous to one of those genes, and that binds up- and down-stream of Obp56h, affects copulation latency in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. They hypothesize that its IIIM linked Musca domestica homolog is upregulated, causing the courtship differences in males carrying this chromosome. The analyses are appropriate and done well. The authors' models and speculations are consistent with the data but are based on correlations or cross-genera observations.</p><p>The authors addressed some of the issues raised in my review by weakening the strength of interpretations they made from correlative data. This is an improvement, but there is still concern about speculative and correlative conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the results from our correlative analyses should not be interpreted as causal evidence, and we believe that the changes incorporated in this round of edits have reduced the potential for readers to interpret our conclusions as overly speculative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The rebuttal described experimental constraints of the system, such as rearing temperature, that made it difficult or impossible to address some issues I raised. These points are well taken. Can they be made explicit in the paper's text? For example please add to the paper that &quot;chromosome V is (nearly) genetically identical&quot; between the strains.</p></disp-quote><p>We have incorporated this change. Specifically, in Lines 183 – 187, we have provided more transparency by noting that these flies, although from a common genetic background, are unlikely to be entirely genetically identical across their genomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I did not understand why doing qPCR for Obp56h in dissected tissues is not feasible (rebuttal to comment 3) There are concerns about using <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> databases as a proxy given the evolutionary distance between the genera and the Obp56h duplications in Musca.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that only analyzing data from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is less than ideal, and there are limitations to using these data as a proxy for house fly gene expression. We have added a statement noting that tissue-specific expression data from house fly would be needed to gain further insight on the function of this module in lines 339-340. Ideally, we would have looked at tissue-specific expression data in Musca domestica in addition to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. However, there are two considerable challenges to this. First, measuring expression of the multiple Obp56h genes in house fly using qPCR would require designing paralog-specific primers and/or probes, which we have determined is not feasible given the sequence similarity between paralogs (this is not as big of a challenge with RNA-seq data because we used a probabilistic read mapping approach that can model read mapping ambiguity). While we could use qPCR to measure expression of the candidate trans regulators in our network in house fly (e.g., CG2120), there is a second challenge to doing so: we do not have the technical expertise to perform tissue dissections to collect comparable data as available in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNA-seq datasets. Therefore, to measure Obp56h gene e expression in house fly tissues samples similar to those available in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNA-seq data we analyzed would require fine-scale tissue dissection followed by RNA-seq, which we believe is beyond the scope of the work we presented in the manuscript. We believe that the findings from the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> data sets we were able to analyze, although not of primary importance, add to our overall understanding of the potential function of the Obp56h gene family and is therefore worth including.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The use of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to test their hypotheses was clever given the technical limitations with Musca. But its relevance to the Musca findings is not fully convincing, as the process and roles of players within it may not be conserved.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a lack of evolutionary conservation may limit some of the conclusions we draw from our data. We have attempted to be clear in our manuscript about those limitations and their implications. However, we believe that the vast amount of concordant and corroborating evidence (though often correlational) provided in this manuscript suggests that the genetic pathway that influences copulation latency has been conserved to a great extent. While we could collect additional data to add further evidence of the level of conservation between these two systems, these additional datasets would be time consuming, labor intensive, and expensive to collect (e.g., RNA-seq from house fly dissected tissue samples, discussed above). We are also concerned about adding a large data set to a manuscript that has already been noted as being data-dense. That said, we are currently pursuing follow-up experiments (RNA-seq from above, CHC profiling discussed below) that could build upon the results presented in our manuscript. Some of these data may be available to include in a revised manuscript if the reviewers require it, although this will delay publication substantially.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the results of the CHC experiment support the authors' model it would strengthen the paper to add them.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that the CHC experiment would indeed provide invaluable insight into the mechanism that might maintain this polymorphism of proto-Y chromosomes in nature. However, as the first reviewer noted, this is already a fairly data-dense manuscript, and we worry that incorporating additional studies at this point may come at the risk of hurting the clarity of our findings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
