KRAS-positive colorectal cancers (CRCs) have a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) characterized by aberrant DNA hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of many genes. The factors involved in, and the mechanistic basis of, CIMP is not understood. Among the CIMP genes are the tumor suppressors <italic>p14</italic><sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup>, <italic>p15</italic><sup><italic>INK4B</italic></sup>, and <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>INK4A</italic></sup>, encoded by the <italic>INK4-ARF</italic> locus. In this study, we perform an RNA interference screen and identify ZNF304, a zinc-finger DNA-binding protein, as the pivotal factor required for <italic>INK4-ARF</italic> silencing and CIMP in CRCs containing activated KRAS. In KRAS-positive human CRC cell lines and tumors, ZNF304 is bound at the promoters of <italic>INK4-ARF</italic> and other CIMP genes. Promoter-bound ZNF304 recruits a corepressor complex that includes the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, resulting in DNA hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing. KRAS promotes silencing through upregulation of ZNF304, which drives DNA binding. Finally, we show that ZNF304 also directs transcriptional silencing of <italic>INK4-ARF</italic> in human embryonic stem cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02313.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02313.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02313.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Colorectal cancer, which affects the large intestine, is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, ranking fourth after cancers of the lung, stomach, and liver. Like these other cancers, this disease is caused by mutations to genes that allow cells to multiply in an out of control manner. Mutations that change the gene encoding a protein called KRAS are found in many different types of cancer. Moreover, about 70% of colorectal cancers with a KRAS mutation also have an excess of small chemical marks on other genes, some of which are known to suppress the growth of tumors. These marks ‘switch off’ these genes, and although the identities of the enzymes that typically leave these marks on DNA are known, the link between these enzymes and the KRAS protein is unknown.</p><p>Now Serra, Fang et al. have identified a protein, called ZNF304, that is required by KRAS to switch off a large number of genes, including multiple tumor suppressors. In the absence of ZNF304, these tumor suppressor genes remained switched on in cancer cells with the KRAS mutation, so the growth of the tumor was slowed down. ZNF304 is a protein that binds to stretches of DNA, including regions of DNA at the start of several tumor suppressor genes, and it recruits the enzymes that add the chemical marks that switch off these genes.</p><p>Serra, Fang et al. found that the levels of ZNF304 protein were elevated in colorectal cancer cells with the mutated KRAS, and showed that this was due to the combined activities of two other proteins that prevented ZNF304 from being broken down in the cell. Mutant KRAS caused an increase in the levels of these two proteins, which in turn caused the elevated ZNF304 levels and the excessive marking of the DNA in the tumor suppressor genes.</p><p>Furthermore, some of these same tumor suppressor genes are switched off in the earliest cells in a human embryo—which have the potential to become any of 200 or so cell types in the human body. In these embryonic stem cells, Serra, Fang et al. showed that ZNF304, but not KRAS, was also involved in keeping these genes switched off until the stem cells started changing into specific types of cells.</p><p>Since they are a crucial part of the pathway linking a cancer-causing mutation to increased tumor growth, the proteins identified by Serra, Fang et al. could represent promising targets for the development of new anti-cancer drugs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02313.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02313.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>CpG island methylator phenotype</kwd><kwd><italic>INK4-ARF</italic></kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>ZNF304</kwd><kwd>KRAS</kwd><kwd>DNMT1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM033977</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>068101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A pathway directed by the KRAS oncoprotein leads to aberrant hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of many genes including tumor suppressors, thereby promoting tumor development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epigenetic dysregulation of gene expression plays a major role in the initiation and progression of cancer (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baylin and Jones, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Esteller, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hassler and Egger, 2012</xref>). Among the various epigenetic alterations of cancer genomes, abnormal gains of DNA methylation in normally unmethylated gene promoter CpG islands have been the most extensively investigated. DNA hypermethylation can alter genetic stability and genomic structure, and is associated with transcriptional silencing of gene expression (commonly referred to as epigenetic silencing; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baylin and Jones, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Esteller, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hassler and Egger, 2012</xref>). Numerous studies have identified specific genes affecting cellular growth control that become hypermethylated and transcriptionally silenced in many cancers.</p><p>Colorectal cancers (CRCs) provide a striking example of alterations in DNA methylation that occur during tumor development. A subset of CRCs have a so-called CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) characterized by aberrant DNA hypermethylation of many genes. In fact, CRCs can be categorized into three distinct subclasses based on their epigenetic and genetic profiles: CIMP-1 (also called CIMP-high), characterized by intense methylation of multiple genes, microsatellite instability and BRAF mutations; CIMP-2 (also called CIMP-low), typified by methylation of a more limited group of genes and mutation in KRAS; and CIMP-negative, distinguished by infrequent methylation and p53 mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaneda and Yagi, 2011</xref>). Specific panels of CIMP marker genes have been developed to classify CRCs into these three subclasses. These CIMP marker genes have potential clinical value, and are currently being evaluated as biomarkers for risk, diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of therapeutic responsiveness (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Egger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gyparaki et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Among the CIMP genes are three well-known tumor suppressors: <italic>p14</italic><sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup>, <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>INK4A</italic></sup> (also known as <italic>CDKN2A</italic>), and <italic>p15</italic><sup><italic>INK4B</italic></sup> (also known as <italic>CDKN2B</italic>) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gil and Peters, 2006</xref>). These three genes are located in close proximity to one another (within a 35 kb region) at the <italic>INK4-ARF</italic> locus, yet each is transcribed from a distinct promoter. Interestingly, <italic>p14</italic><sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup> and <italic>p16</italic><sup><italic>INK4A</italic></sup> share exons two and three, but each is translated in a different reading frame, yielding unrelated polypeptides. Inactivation of the <italic>INK4-ARF</italic> locus is one of the most frequent events in cancers (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim and Sharpless, 2006</xref>). For example, <italic>INK4-ARF</italic> is transcriptionally silenced in 30–45% of all CRCs and in 70% of CRCs that harbor an activating KRAS mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burri et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dominguez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lind et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>INK4-ARF</italic> locus is also silenced in some non-malignant cells. For example, <italic>INK4-ARF</italic> is silenced in embryonic, fetal, and adult stem cells, but in more differentiated cells, it becomes poised for expression and increasingly responsive to aberrant mitogenic signals such as those elicited by activated oncogenes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sherr, 2012</xref>). This process is reversed when somatic cells are induced to regain pluripotency through reprogramming. Expression of <italic>INK4-ARF</italic> limits stem cell self-renewal, suggesting that coordinated <italic>INK4-ARF</italic> expression may normally act to restrict stem cell numbers. Accordingly, the <italic>INK4-ARF</italic> locus has been shown to be a barrier for reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In actively growing human diploid fibroblasts, the <italic>INK4A-ARF</italic> locus is silenced by histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) directed by Polycomb group proteins. When such cells are exposed to cellular stress, such as oncogenic signals, the H3K27me3 mark on the locus is decreased, resulting in expression of <italic>INK4A-ARF</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacobs et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bracken et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kotake et al., 2007</xref>). Transcriptional activation is due, at least in part, to upregulation of the H3K27 demethylase JMJD3, which removes H3K27me3 from <italic>INK4A-ARF</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agger et al., 2009</xref>). Whether the mechanism of <italic>INK4-ARF</italic> silencing in stem cells and primary differentiated cells is related to, or distinct from, that in cancer cells is unknown.</p><p>The factors, regulatory pathways, and mechanisms underlying the aberrant promoter hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing characteristic of CIMP-positive CRCs remain to be determined. In addition, the relationship between the initiating genetic events responsible for tumorigenesis (e.g., acquisition of activating mutations in oncogenes) and the epigenetic alterations in CIMP-positive CRCs is not understood. To begin to address these questions, in this study, using <italic>p14</italic><sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup> as a representative CIMP gene, we perform an RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify factors required for <italic>p14</italic><sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup> silencing. Our results reveal a KRAS-directed pathway that mediates silencing of the entire <italic>INK4-ARF</italic> locus, is responsible for CIMP in CRCs, and is related to the pathway that silences <italic>INK4-ARF</italic> in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An RNAi screen to identify mediators of <italic>INK4-ARF</italic> transcriptional silencing</title><p>To screen for factors involved in transcriptional silencing of <italic>INK4-ARF</italic>, we generated a reporter construct in which the <italic>p14</italic><sup><italic>ARF</italic></sup> promoter was used to direct expression of the blasticidin-resistance (<italic>Blast</italic><sup><italic>R</italic></sup>) gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

However, the mechanistic basis of epigenetic silencing is not understood. According to one model, an epigenetic event, such as hypermethylation of a CpG-rich promoter region of a TSG, occurs randomly due, for example, to loss of fidelity or mutation of an epigenetic enzyme. The hypermethylation results in silencing of the TSG, which confers a selectable growth advantage (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hassler and Egger, 2012</xref>). In a second model, transcriptional silencing occurs through a specific pathway, comprising a defined set of components, initiated by an oncoprotein.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A ZNF304-corepressor complex mediates <italic>INK4-ARF</italic> silencing in KRAS-positive CRCs</title><p>In this report, we have identified a specific pathway that mediates CIMP in KRAS-positive CRCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The pathway is initiated on DNA by binding of the transcriptional repressor, ZNF304, which recruits a corepressor complex that includes SETDB1, KAP1 and DNMT1, leading to promoter hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing. Activated KRAS regulates the pathway by maintaining high levels of ZNF304, which drives DNA binding. The basis by which activated KRAS increases ZNF304 levels is transcriptional upregulation of PRKD1, a serine/threonine kinase, and USP28, a deubiquitinase, two of the factors that were isolated in our primary RNAi screen. We further showed that PRKD1 phosphorylates USP28, which interacts with and stabilizes ZNF304 from proteolytic degradation.</p><p>ZNF304 is a member of large family of transcription factors. About two-thirds of the approximately 1500 transcription factors encoded by mammalian genomes contain C2H2 zinc-fingers and more than half of these harbor an N-terminal KRAB transcriptional repression domain (KRAB-ZFP proteins; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lupo et al., 2013</xref>). In a previous study, we have found that silencing of the <italic>Fas</italic> tumor suppressor in RAS-transformed NIH 3T3 cells requires ZFP354B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gazin et al., 2007</xref>), which like ZNF304 is a KRAB-ZFP protein. Moreover, like ZNF304, ZFP354B levels are increased by activated RAS. These findings suggest that KRAB-ZFP transcription factors may have a widespread role in transcriptional silencing of TSGs in cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implications for the role of KRAS in CIMP and tumorigenicity</title><p>Approximately 70% of CRCs containing activated KRAS are CIMP-positive. However, whether activated KRAS is merely associated with or is directly responsible for CIMP remained to be determined. In this study, we have shown that activated KRAS directs a pathway that silences <italic>INK4A-ARF</italic> and a large number of other genes characteristic of CIMP-positive CRCs. Our results show how a single oncoprotein-directed pathway can silence multiple, unrelated genes.</p><p>Although we have shown that in CRC cells KRAS directs and is required to maintain transcriptional silencing of <italic>INK4A-ARF</italic>, in primary cells oncogenic signals (such as activated KRAS) induce transcription of <italic>INK4A-ARF</italic>, which leads to p53 and Rb pathway activation and ultimately growth arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sherr, 2012</xref>). Thus, transformation of a primary to a cancer cell involves a switch converting KRAS from an activator to a repressor of <italic>INK4-ARF</italic>.

Thus, there may be some general mechanism for activation of KRAB-ZFPs in ESCs.

Several studies have identified subgroups of genes in which the H3K27me3 present in ESCs is replaced by abnormal DNA hypermethylation in cancer cells. This phenomenon, which has been referred to as ‘epigenetic switching’, results in the permanent silencing of key regulatory genes that may contribute to cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>This differential repression pattern is exactly what we found for <italic>INK4-ARF</italic> in hESCs and KRAS-positive CRC cells.

The plasmid was linearized and stably transfected into DLD-1 cells using an Amaxa nucleofactor. Immediately after nucleofection, the cells were placed in complete growth medium for 72 hr. Viable cells were allowed to grow into colonies and then selected with 500 µg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). Surviving colonies were individually isolated, expanded, and tested for blasticidin sensitivity; to minimize non-specific survival in the shRNA screen, clones with the lowest resistance to blasticiden, indicating complete reporter silencing, were chosen for further characterization. Clones were treated with 10 µM 5-aza-2′-deoxycytodine (Calbiochem) every 24 hr for 72 hr. After 24 hr treatment, 0, 5, or 10 µM blasticidin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added for 6 days, and cells were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet to assess viability.

Your article has been favorably reviewed by a Senior editor (Jim Manley) and a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors (Kevin Struhl).</p><p>We are very pleased to inform you that your article has been accepted for publication: this is a superb paper that deserves to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. The authors describe a detailed pathway in which activated KRAS ultimately leads to DNA methylation of the INK4-ARF and a number of other CIMP loci. The pathway was elucidated through a genome-wide RNAi screen and a large number of standard molecular biological experiments. It involves a DNA-binding transcription factor and its associated co–repressor complex, a DNA methylase, a deubiquitinase, a protein kinase, and the AP-1 factor June Moreover, the authors provide clear evidence that this pathway is relevant in human cancer by analyzing patient samples. Lastly, they also show that aspects of this pathway also occur in embryonic stem cells, providing a new link between such stem cells and the cancer state. Although the Green laboratory published a seminal paper showing that DNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes can arise from a detailed genetic pathway as opposed to previous belief that methylation occurs randomly (and then propagated), this paper uses a completely different system. As such, it is important for its own sake as well as providing a new example of the general principle, which I think is largely under-appreciated in the haze of cancer and chromatin work. The paper is extremely well written, and I have no specific comments other than to cite the work of Sonia Kohai.</p><p>[Editors’ note: no revisions were requested so there is not an accompanying author response.]</p></body></sub-article></article>
