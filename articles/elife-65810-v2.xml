These helicases bind viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to enable an interferon pathway in vertebrates, and antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) in invertebrates. Animals encode and express long dsRNA similar to viral dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Whipple et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blango and Bass, 2016</xref>), and thus, a key question is how RLRs distinguish cellular and viral dsRNA to avoid an aberrant innate immune response. The founding member of the RLR helicase family, mammalian RIG-I, recognizes di- and triphosphates on the blunt termini of viral dsRNA to distinguish this nonself species from self-transcripts, which are capped or monophosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goubau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schlee, 2013</xref>). The invertebrate RLR helicase, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Dicer-2 (dmDcr-2), also distinguishes termini, but in this case blunt termini are distinguished from the 3’ overhangs that are found on certain cellular dsRNAs, such as microRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Welker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sinha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sinha et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>While the helicase domains of dmDcr-2 and RIG-I are similar, other domains differ in accordance with the different mechanisms of antiviral defense. Like all metazoan Dicers, dmDcr-2 is a multidomain enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), with an L-shape that places the helicase and PAZ domains at the base and top, respectively, and the RNase III domains at the center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sinha et al., 2018</xref>). The PAZ domain of dmDcr-2 shares structural homology with Argonautes, which show higher affinity for two nucleotide (nt) 3’-overhanging (3’ovr) dsRNA termini compared to blunt (BLT) termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tian et al., 2014</xref>). By interacting with the 3’ovr terminus, the PAZ domain allows Dicer to ‘measure’ the distance to the RNase III domains, thus explaining the characteristic lengths of ~20–25 base pairs for siRNAs and miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacRae et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). The PAZ and adjacent Platform domain were considered the only Dicer domains that bound dsRNA termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2011</xref>), but a recent cryo-EM structure of dmDcr-2 showed that BLT dsRNA binds to the helicase domain in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sinha et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Steady-state biochemical and cryo-EM studies reveal diverse activities for dmDcr-2, including dsRNA binding, unwinding, translocation, and cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sinha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sinha et al., 2018</xref>), but how these events are coordinated and coupled with ATP binding and hydrolysis in real time is entirely unclear. Transient kinetic experiments are well suited for delineating mechanistic details on a biologically relevant time scale (second–minute) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Williams, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gutfreund, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fisher, 2005</xref>), and importantly, such studies have been extremely informative in deciphering the role of ATP in self–﻿nonself discrimination by RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Devarkar et al., 2018</xref>). Here we used a stopped-flow system and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate the dmDcr-2-catalyzed reaction. We find that ATP-binding to dmDcr-2 promotes initial recognition of dsRNA termini and mediates clamping by the helicase domain. ATP hydrolysis induces local unwinding, followed by reannealing of dsRNA in conjunction with directional translocation of dmDcr2 on dsRNA until it arrives at the cleavage site. Intriguingly, our studies suggest that an ATP-dependent long-range communication between the helicase and Platform–PAZ domains modulates dsRNA cleavage and siRNA release.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Binding kinetics of dsRNA to dmDcr-2 is termini-dependent</title><p>The equilibrium binding affinity of dmDcr-2 for dsRNA depends on molecular features at the dsRNA termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sinha et al., 2015</xref>). To identify transient intermediates of the enzyme•dsRNA interaction, and to reveal the kinetic basis of termini-dependent discrimination, we performed fluorescence-based stopped-flow experiments. Cy3-end-labeled 52 basepair dsRNAs (52-dsRNAs) with BLT or 2 nt 3’ovr termini were prepared by annealing top (sense) and bottom (antisense) strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; Materials and methods). dmDcr-2 binds dsRNA termini, and one end was blocked with two deoxynucleotides and biotin, to allow binding and kinetic analysis only from the Cy3-labeled end. To simplify determination of kinetic parameters, stopped-flow experiments were performed under pseudo first-order conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gutfreund, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fisher, 2005</xref>) using 10-fold excess of dmDcr-2 over dsRNA.

However, transient kinetic assays revealed interactions of both termini in the absence of nucleotide (black traces), and this was monitored on a long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) and short (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>) time scale. The BLT•dmDcr-2 complex may be less stable without nucleotide, possibly explaining why it was undetectable in prior equilibrium assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sinha et al., 2015</xref>). The kinetics of dmDcr-2 binding to BLT dsRNA were biphasic (<italic>t1<sub>1/2</sub></italic> = 0.25 s, <italic>t2<sub>1/2</sub></italic> = 49.8 s), but monophasic for 3’ovr dsRNA (<italic>t<sub>1/2</sub></italic> = 27.8 s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Prior studies suggest dmDcr-2 has two binding sites (helicase and Platform–PAZ) for dsRNA termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sinha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sinha et al., 2018</xref>). While equilibrium experiments indicate binding to the helicase domain is ATP-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sinha et al., 2015</xref>), we considered that even without nucleotide, the biphasic kinetics might reflect interactions with two binding sites. Indeed, experiments performed with dmDcr-2 lacking the helicase domain (dmDcr-2<sup>ΔHel</sup>) showed monophasic binding kinetics for both BLT and 3’ovr dsRNA in the absence of nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Further, the half-life of binding to 3’ovr dsRNA in the absence of nucleotide was similar for dmDcr-2 and dmDcr-2<sup>ΔHel</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), consistent with the idea that 3’ovr dsRNA binds to the Platform–PAZ domain.</p><p>We further investigated termini-dependent interactions of dsRNA by measuring the fluorescence lifetime of the Cy3-end-labeled dsRNA bound to dmDcr-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; Materials and methods). To avoid cleavage of dsRNA during the longer time scale required for time-resolved measurements, we used dmDcr-2 with a point mutation in each RNase III domain (dmDcr-2<sup>RIII</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The dmDcr-2<sup>RIII</sup>•Cy3-BLT-dsRNA complex showed two lifetimes (1.21 ns and 2.28 ns), but dmDcr-2<sup>RIII</sup>•Cy3-3’ovr dsRNA only one (1.28 ns) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, in the absence of nucleotide, BLT dsRNA exists in two distinct microenvironments while bound to dmDcr-2, supporting the idea that the observed biphasic kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,I</xref>) represents interactions with two sites. Moreover, the fluorescence amplitude associated with the lifetime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>) suggests that a major fraction (~88%) of BLT dsRNA is bound to the helicase domain, likely because of its higher binding specificity for this domain compared to the Platform–PAZ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2004</xref>). These data support the idea that in the absence of nucleotide, 3’ovr dsRNA binds to dmDcr-2’s Platform–PAZ domain, while BLT dsRNA binds poorly to this domain, and primarily to the helicase domain.</p><p>In the transient kinetic experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), addition of the non-hydrolyzable analog ATPγS (red trace) or ATP (blue trace), showed biphasic kinetics for binding of dmDcr-2 to either BLT or 3’ovr 52-dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), and this was also measured over shorter times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). The fast-phase was similar with ATPγS or ATP, suggesting it is associated with ATP binding and unaffected by hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Further, the fast phase for binding BLT dsRNA (<italic>t<sub>1/2</sub></italic> = 0.6–0.8 s) was approximately sixfold faster than binding to 3’ovr dsRNA (<italic>t<sub>1/2</sub></italic> = 4.0–5.5 s). In contrast to the initial fast phase, the slow phase became sixfold and threefold faster, respectively, for BLT and 3’ovr dsRNA due to ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Importantly, the half-life of this slow phase includes subsequent molecular events of the dmDcr-2 catalytic cycle, such as dsRNA unwinding/rewinding and translocation, which are coupled with the free energy of ATP hydrolysis (see below).</p><p>While the biphasic binding kinetics observed without nucleotide appeared to derive from interactions with two binding sites, ATP binding is reported to mediate a conformational change in dmDcr-2’s helicase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sinha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sinha et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, we considered that the biphasic kinetics observed with nucleotide might reflect an initial encounter of dsRNA termini with the helicase domain, followed by a slow isomerization of the complex (dmDcr-2•ATPγS•dsRNA). We tested this possibility by measuring the fluorescence lifetime of Cy3-end-labeled 52-dsRNA bound to dmDcr2<sup>RIII</sup>•ATPγS under equilibrium conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Single fluorescence lifetimes were observed, 2.15 and 1.31ns, respectively, for BLT and 3’ovr 52-dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–G</xref>), ruling out the existence of two binding sites with ATPγS, and suggesting a slow isomerization step after initial binding of dsRNA termini to dmDcr-2’s helicase domain (see below). As described subsequently, this two-step binding mechanism (bimolecular followed by isomerization) was further validated by dissociation off-rate measurements, and evaluation of kinetically determined K<sub>d</sub> values using the microscopic rate constants of dsRNA interaction with dmDcr2•ATPγS. Interestingly, the initial encounter and isomerization of dmDcr-2 with BLT dsRNA are approximately sixfold and twofold faster, respectively, as compared to the corresponding steps for 3’ovr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, + ATPγS). This observation points to a kinetic control mechanism for termini-dependent discrimination of dsRNA by dmDcr-2, which could markedly impact the efficiency of an antiviral response (see Discussion). Our binding kinetics experiments revealed a two-step binding of both BLT and 3’ovr dsRNA to the helicase domain in the presence of ATPγS. Thus, the presence of ATPγS mediates a binding site switch for 3’ovr dsRNA, from the Platform–PAZ domain to the helicase domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Residence time of enzyme-bound dsRNA is termini-dependent</title><p>The kinetics of dmDcr-2 binding to dsRNA with ATPγS indicates a differential mode of interaction of BLT and 3’ovr dsRNA with the helicase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and is predicted to affect residence time of the enzyme-bound dsRNA. We measured dissociation off-rates for dsRNA bound to dmDcr-2 with ATPγS, using the stopped-flow system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–H</xref>; see Materials and methods). The dissociation of enzyme-bound BLT and 3’-ovr dsRNA in the presence of ATPγS was biphasic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>), as also shown over a shorter time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>); this is consistent with two-step binding kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and the principle of microscopic reversibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krupka et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fisher, 2005</xref>).

This raised the question of why dmDcr-2 unwinds dsRNA, since presumably it would need to rewind it for subsequent cleavage by the dsRNA-specific RNase III active sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nicholson, 2014</xref>).</p><p>To directly monitor ATP-dependent unwinding of dsRNA by dmDcr-2 in real time, and to test whether rewinding occurs, we performed stopped-flow experiments utilizing BLT and 3’ovr 52-dsRNA that contained a Cy3–Cy5 donor–acceptor Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair at one terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). We anticipated that transient unwinding and rewinding of Cy3–Cy5 labeled dsRNA by dmDcr-2 would produce a sequential loss and gain in FRET signal over time. Instead of donor (Cy3) fluorescence, we specifically followed the time-dependent change in acceptor (Cy5) FRET signal to monitor transient unwinding, because the fast phase of dmDcr-2 binding to dsRNA termini with ATP leads to an enhancement in Cy3 fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, BLT, <italic>t1<sub>t/2</sub></italic> = 0.8 s; 3’ovr, <italic>t1<sub>t/2</sub></italic> = 5.5 s) on a time scale that could interfere with the increased Cy3 signal from a distance change between the Cy3–Cy5 FRET pair upon unwinding. While dmDcr-2 alone (black) did not produce a detectable change in the FRET signal of BLT or 3’ovr dsRNA, a biphasic change in FRET as a function of time was observed in the presence of ATP (blue trace) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). The half-lives for ATP-dependent unwinding of BLT and 3’ovr were 0.5 s and 1.0 s, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), which correlates with the twofold difference in the rate of ATP hydrolysis by dmDcr-2 while bound to these dsRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Donelick et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the fluorescence amplitudes associated with unwinding (<italic>A1</italic>) and rewinding (<italic>A2</italic>) in the presence of ATP were almost the same for BLT dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), that is, the FRET associated with the unwound state returned to the value observed in the initial annealed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). By contrast, for 3’ovr dsRNA, the amplitude for the rewinding phase was only 30% of the unwinding value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). This suggested that, unlike BLT dsRNA, 3’ovr dsRNA remained partially unwound at the end of this assay. As observed for human Dicer, possibly the unwound state of 3’ovr dsRNA (as compared to BLT) is stabilized by interactions with the Platform–PAZ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tian et al., 2014</xref>).

Interestingly, the speed of dmDcr-2 translocation is comparable to that of the ATP-dependent translocation of RIG I on BLT dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Myong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Devarkar et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Real-time monitoring of ATP-dependent translocation/arrival of dmDcr-2 at the cleavage site.</title><p>Cartoons show BLT (<bold>A</bold>) and 3’ovr (<bold>B</bold>) 52-dsRNA with a covalently linked Cy3 at the 18th nucleotide of the top (sense) strand, and deoxynucleotide (CC) and biotin to prevent binding of dmDcr-2 to one end.

Consistent with our binding studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), without nucleotide, 3’ovr dsRNA directly interacts with the Platform–PAZ domain, which presumably directs the dsRNA to the RNase III active sites for cleavage. Therefore, it seems likely that the enhancement in fluorescence from Cy3 at position 18 of 3’ovr dsRNA in the absence of nucleotide reflects an interaction with the protein near the RNase III domains. Similarly, with ATPγS, the observed PIFE may reflect formation of a stable, non-productive enzyme–substrate complex wherein the Cy3-label is engaged with the helicase domain upon clamping on dsRNA termini.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>ATP-dependent cleavage of dsRNA is dictated by dsRNA termini</title><p>After delineating the early kinetic events of the dmDcr-2-catalyzed reaction that precede dsRNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), we wished to gain mechanistic information about how these events fine-tune substrate cleavage and product release. Toward this goal, we performed transient kinetic experiments to directly monitor dsRNA cleavage and siRNA release in real time. Notably, the dmDcr-2-catalyzed cleavage of dsRNA and siRNA release was kinetically well separated from earlier molecular events (binding, unwinding/rewinding, and translocation), enabling reliable evaluation of cleavage parameters (see below; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).</p><p>We prepared BLT and 3’ovr 52-dsRNA with a Cy3-Cy5 FRET pair that spanned the primary cleavage site in 52-dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>; dotted lines), so that dmDcr-2-catalyzed cleavage coupled with siRNA release would lead to a loss of FRET. We mixed 10-fold excess dmDcr-2 (alone or with nucleotide) with FRET-labeled 52-dsRNA in the stopped-flow system and monitored the reaction for ~5 min (to observe the entire catalytic cycle) by recording the time-dependent change in Cy5 FRET signal upon excitation of Cy3 (see Materials and methods). As in the translocation assay, which used dsRNA without a FRET acceptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>), we anticipated that an increase in Cy3 fluorescence due to PIFE would also lead to an increased Cy5 fluorescence due to a greater extent of energy transfer from Cy3 to Cy5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hwang and Myong, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stennett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, the time-dependent increase in FRET signal observed for BLT and 3’-ovr dsRNA in the presence of dmDcr-2 and ATP was similar to the increase in PIFE signal observed in the translocation assay (compare <italic>t<sub>1/2</sub></italic> and <italic>t1<sub>1/2</sub></italic> values with ATP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>). As anticipated, the time-dependent increase in FRET signal due to arrival of dmDcr-2 at the cleavage site was followed by a slow loss of FRET for both BLT and 3’ovr dsRNA (blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). We attributed this time-dependent slow loss of FRET signal to the cleavage of dsRNA coupled with siRNA release. Control experiments performed with cleavage incompetent dmDcr-2 (dmDcr2<sup>RIII</sup>) only showed a time-dependent increase in FRET signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming this interpretation. The half-life for the ATP-dependent cleavage/product release for BLT dsRNA (<italic>t2<sub>1/2</sub></italic> = 43 s) was twofold faster than that of 3’-ovr dsRNA (<italic>t2<sub>1/2</sub></italic> = 83 s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), possibly reflecting a differential interaction of dsRNA termini (after translocation) with the Platform–PAZ domain that poises the enzyme for substrate cleavage (see below) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sinha et al., 2015</xref>). The twofold difference in dsRNA cleavage/siRNA release also correlates with the difference in ATP-hydrolysis rate observed with dsRNA with different termini, indicating that ATP-hydrolysis is important for substrate cleavage and/or product release (see below). Further, a higher amplitude for the FRET loss associated with BLT dsRNA cleavage/siRNA release compared to 3’ovr dsRNA suggests an incomplete release and/or rebinding of 3’ovr siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gan et al., 2006</xref>).

For binding of enzyme (even without nucleotide) to BLT dsRNA, the second phase of the anisotropy decay curve was absent, consistent with a highly restricted local tumbling of hydrated 52-dsRNA inside the helicase domain and/or a marked reduction in the global dynamics of the helicase domain. The fast correlation time became longer by ~3.5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>), suggesting a reduced conformational fluctuation of the helicase domain in the immediate vicinity of the Cy3 linked to the BLT terminus, which is consistent with the approximately twofold increase in fluorescence life-time of the probe under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stennett et al., 2015</xref>). Although the fast correlation time for dmDcr-2<sup>RIII</sup> alone and with ATPγS were similar, the value of Δr, representing the extent of conformational dynamics, was reduced by ~2.4-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E,K</xref>), again consistent with an ATPγS-mediated enhanced rigidity in the closed conformational state of the helicase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sinha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sinha et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to BLT dsRNA, both internal dynamics and local tumbling of 3’ovr 52-dsRNA were observed when dmDcr-2<sup>RIII</sup> was added with or without nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–K</xref>). Internal dynamics of 3’ovr dsRNA alone (0.32ns) was similar to that observed when dmDcr-2<sup>RIII</sup> was added (0.35ns), but became approximately twofold slower for dmDcr-2<sup>RIII</sup> with ATPγS (0.56 ns; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with a smaller change in molecular rigidity at the 3’ovr terminus compared to BLT when interacting with the helicase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–G</xref>). Further, the Δr value for BLT 52-dsRNA bound to dmDcr-2•ATPγS (Δr, 0.05) was ~3.5-fold lower than that for 3’ovr bound to dmDcr-2•ATPγS (Δr, 0.18; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). This is consistent with the approximately fourfold slower dissociation off-rate of enzyme-bound BLT dsRNA as compared to 3’ovr dsRNA in the presence of ATPγS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>To gain insights into how conformational dynamics of the Platform–PAZ domain engaged with dsRNA termini is correlated with substrate cleavage and siRNA release, we compared anisotropy parameters of BLT and 3’ovr 52-dsRNA bound to dmDcr-2<sup>RIII</sup> with ATP, after translocation places the termini in the Platform–PAZ domain. Notably, the long/slow correlation time (ϕ2) was again absent for BLT 52-dsRNA (i.e. with ATP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,K</xref>), but both fast and slow correlation times were observed for 3’ovr 52-dsRNA in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J,K</xref>). Furthermore, the fast correlation time was approximately twofold shorter for 3’ovr as compared to BLT termini (ϕ1, 0.39ns, 3’ovr; 0.68ns, BLT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>), consistent with a higher local rigidity of the Platform–PAZ domain at the BLT terminus with ATP (as compared to 3’ovr); this is also consistent with a higher increase in fluorescence life-time of Cy3-BLT dsRNA upon binding to dmDcr-2<sup>RIII</sup>•ATP, which is caused by an increase in molecular rigidity near the fluorophore, as compared to that of 3’ovr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stennett et al., 2015</xref>). Since ATP-dependent kinetic events of the dmDcr-2 catalytic cycle, namely, unwinding, translocation, and dsRNA cleavage are all approximately twofold faster for BLT dsRNA than for 3’ovr dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>), the reduced fast conformational fluctuation of the Platform–PAZ domain correlates with enzyme catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broos et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Unruh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henzler-Wildman and Kern, 2007</xref>). Additionally, the notable absence of a long correlation time (ϕ2) for BLT dsRNA bound to dmDcr-2<sup>RIII</sup> in the presence of ATP, representing a total loss of local tumbling/rotation of BLT dsRNA within the Platform–PAZ domain prior to its cleavage, suggests that a markedly reduced global dynamics of the Platform–PAZ domain may also contribute to the processive cleavage of BLT dsRNA observed in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Welker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sinha et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Invertebrate Dicers involved in antiviral defense require ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Welker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cenik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sinha et al., 2015</xref>), but how the ATP-dependent helicase domain coordinates Dicer activities, and exactly what these activities are, is poorly understood. Using a real-time, stopped-flow method, and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, we interrogated the role of ATP in dmDcr-2 catalysis, and defined dsRNA binding, unwinding, rewinding, translocation, and cleavage, as reaction intermediates.

Our studies suggest that ATP binding and hydrolysis by the helicase domain promote terminus-dependent conformational transitions ~80 Å away in the Platform–PAZ domain, and further that these dynamics fine-tune substrate cleavage and siRNA release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Termini-dependent dsRNA discrimination by dmDcr-2 for enhanced antiviral defense</title><p><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> requires the helicase domain of dmDcr-2 to mount an effective antiviral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marques et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Donelick et al., 2020</xref>), but definitive evidence that this domain discriminates termini of viral dsRNA in vivo, in flies, awaits validation. However, our studies reveal dramatic differences in the interaction and processing of BLT and 3’ovr termini, firmly establishing that the enzyme has evolved the ability to discriminate these termini.

Transient kinetic analysis of dsRNA binding to dmDcr-2 was performed using a stopped-flow system (SFM 3000, BioLogic Sciences Instruments) under pseudo first-order conditions in cleavage assay buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O, 1 mM TCEP) at 25°C. The premixing concentrations of dmDcr-2 (or dmDcr-2•ATP/ATPγS) and Cy3-end-labeled dsRNA in stopped-flow syringes were 2 μM and 0.2 μM, respectively. The nucleotide-bound form of dmDcr-2 (dmDcr-2•ATP/ATPγS) was prepared by incubating 2 μM dmDcr-2 for 5 min with a large excess (8 mM) of ATP/ATPγS to ensure rapid binding. The binding reaction was started with rapid mixing of equal volumes of enzyme (or enzyme–nucleotide) with dsRNA. Reaction progress was monitored by exciting the sample at 530 nm and measuring fluorescence emission using a 550 nm long pass-filter (NewPort). At least 4–10 kinetic traces were obtained for each experimental condition and values reported as averages. Averaged traces were analyzed using single or double exponential rate equations, yielding values for the observed rate constant (<italic>k<sub>obs</sub></italic> = 0.693/t<sub>1/2</sub>). Data analysis was performed using the Origin software package (OriginLab corporation).

The excess enzyme over substrate ensured that dsRNA remained bound during the first turnover, thus making precise measurement of kinetic parameters feasible. dsRNA used in the cleavage assay had a FRET pair at the primary cleavage site, and cleavage and siRNA release were recorded by exciting at 530 nm (Cy3 excitation) and monitoring the time-dependent change in FRET signal (Cy5 fluorescence emission) using 670 nm long pass filter.

Data were collected with a polarization-resolved epifluorescence setup whose source is the second harmonic of a tunable-wavelength pulsed Ti:sapphire laser (Coherent Chameleon Ultra II, repetition rate of 80 MHz, &lt;200 fs pulse duration). Excitation pulse energy was kept low (2 pJ/pulse) to prevent sample photodamage, and excitation wavelength was set to 529 nm (FWHM ≤3.5 nm). Excitation beam polarization was set to the vertical axis with high extinction ratio polarizers before being directed to the sample with a 562 nm long-pass dichroic, and focused using a 75 mm focal length aspheric lens. Samples were held in a 4 mm pathlength quartz cuvette. Fluorescence was collected with the same lens and filtered with the same dichroic mirror before passing through a bandpass filter (576–596 nm transmission window) to further eliminate any scattered light from the excitation beam. The fluorescence signal was split into vertical and horizontal polarization channels using a set of polarizing beam splitters, and the signal in each channel was detected with identical single-photon Si photodiodes (MPD systems), whose output was routed to a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) module (PHR 800 and Picoharp 300, PicoQuant). All spectral cleanup, focusing, collection, and detection optical elements were mounted on a 30 mm cage system to prevent deleterious stray light (&lt;1 Hz dark count rates). To match the signal-to-noise ratio in the data of each polarization channel (which have different collection efficiencies), count rates on the TCSPC module were equalized to within a factor of 2 by placing a neutral density filter (optical density = 1.0) in the path of the vertical channel. The instrument response function for setup was ≤60 ps and data resolution was kept at 16 ps. For each sample, data collection was integrated for 110 s. Individual traces of intensity vs. time delay for the vertical and horizontal polarization channels were stored and exported as ASCII files for further processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data analysis (time-resolved fluorescence)</title><p>Raw data for vertically and horizontally polarized fluorescence traces were imported into Matlab for processing and analysis. The temporal axis for each channel was matched to account for different sample-to-detector path lengths (~380 ps shift in time delay axis). Counts due to background signal were estimated as average of signal before the steep rise due to arrival of excitation pulses, and subtracted from data. Quantitative match of the signal collection efficiency in the orthogonal polarization channels was achieved by finding the factor g required to overlap the long-time (&gt; 2 ns) traces recorded for the free chromophore in buffer solution (tail-matching). The resulting fluorescence lifetime (300 ps), anisotropy amplitude (0.40), and rotational diffusion lifetime (440 ps) of this control sample (Cy3-NHS) reproduced previously reported values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sanborn et al., 2007</xref>). The scaling factor g for the control sample of each experimental run was used for all samples in that run.

<italic>Drosophila</italic> Dicer-2, that is of interest to scientists within the field of RNA editing and gene expression. The findings provide a better understanding of the role that the helicase domain of the protein plays in coupling ATP turnover to RNA end discrimination and RNA editing. The findings inform our understanding Dicer mechanism and its ability to distinguish between self and non-self RNAs. The impact of the study extends to an audience beyond the immediate RNA community, because of the pivotal role of Dicer and related enzymes in cellular function and in immunity, and because there is a dearth of rigorous, quantitative biophysical studies on proteins that interact with RNA. Overall, the work adds new, important insight to our mechanistic understanding of RNA-protein interactions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Transient kinetic studies of the antiviral <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dicer-2 reveal roles of ATP in self–nonself discrimination&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Only by the iterative analysis of multiple kinetic experiments to monitor binding, unwinding and translocation, that are reported in our manuscript, is this conclusion validated. Evidence for the binding site switch is given by:</p><p>a. Figure 1 (e.g., Figure 1I) shows that the kinetics for dmDcr-2 binding to a 3’ovr dsRNA are monophasic in the absence of nucleotide, but become biphasic with nucleotide. The second-order rate constant for the bimolecular step with ATPγS (1.6×10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, i.e. <italic>k<sub><sup>+</sup>1</sub></italic>, see Figure 2-supplement 1) is an order of magnitude higher than that without nucleotide (2.5×10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>; in the single step binding of 3’ovr dsRNA to enzyme without nucleotide (Figure 1D, black trace) <italic>k<sub><sup>+</sup>1</sub></italic> = <italic>k<sub>obs</sub></italic>/[dmDcr-2] when <italic>k<sub><sup>+</sup>1</sub> </italic>&gt;&gt;<italic>k<sub>-1</sub></italic>). In considering the data reported in our manuscript, it seems very unlikely that the change from monophasic to biphasic kinetics, and the order of magnitude change in rate constant, could represent anything other than a change in binding site. Again, however, we emphasize that this conclusion takes into account all of the experiments reported in our manuscript.</p><p>b. The ATP-dependent unwinding of BLT dsRNA by dmDcr-2 occurs in the helicase domain, as first visualized in our cryo-EM structure (Sinha et al., 2018). In our manuscript we monitor unwinding/rewinding (Figure 3), and indeed, unwinding is completely dependent on ATP, and importantly, is observed with both BLT and 3’ovr dsRNA. While unwinding of 3’ovr dsRNA is 2-fold slower than that of BLT dsRNA, the similarity of the measured kinetic parameters (Figure 3, see panel E) indicates that both BLT and 3’ovr dsRNA are binding and being unwound by the helicase domain. By contrast, while unwinding does not occur without nucleotide, dmDcr-2 mediates slow cleavage of 3’ovr dsRNA in the absence of nucleotide (Figure 5D, black trace), consistent with the nucleotide-independent binding of this dsRNA terminus to the Platform–PAZ domain. Further, prior steady state assays and our kinetic studies have demonstrated that this nucleotide-independent cleavage (~20-23 nt from the dsRNA terminus) occurs even with a truncated protein lacking the helicase domain (Figure 5—supplement 2C and D, cyan trace). In order to emphasize the latter point, we have extended a sentence to acknowledge this prior observation (Page 14, line 308; sentence beginning “This result is consistent with prior studies…”).</p><p>c. The presence of a helicase-mediated and ATP-dependent arrival/translocation of dmDcr-2 to the enzyme’s cleavage site on 3’ovr dsRNA (prior to substrate cleavage; Figure 5D, blue trace), in contrast to the complete lack of translocation without ATP (Figure 5D, black trace), again supports a nucleotide-dependent switch in 3’ovr dsRNA binding site from the Platform–PAZ domain to the helicase domain.</p><p>In regard to other aspects of this comment: (1). We agree that the ∆Hel mutant protein cannot be used to monitor ATP-dependent effects, and note that the included ∆Hel mutant experiments were performed only to interrogate binding in the absence of nucleotide. To clarify this further, we have added the phrase “..in the absence of nucleotide..” to the sentence on page 5, line 104; sentence beginning “Indeed, experiments performed with dmDcr-2…”. (2). Kd values that separately interrogate interactions with the Platform–PAZ domain versus the helicase domain are not available, unfortunately. We also note that in our transient kinetic studies, the initial encounter of a dsRNA terminus (with or without nucleotide) to distinct domains of dmDcr-2 is primarily dictated by its binding <italic>on-rates</italic>, unlike steady-state assays where equilibrium binding affinity (Kd) determines ligand binding specificity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Are the measured off rates and on rates of the two RNAs consistent with the reported Kd values of these RNA complexes?</p></disp-quote><p>We considered this a very important issue to clarify and have added a new Supplemental figure that includes detailed information for evaluating Kd values for dsRNA binding to dmDcr-2•ATPγS, using the microscopic rate constants obtained from our transient studies (Figure 2—Supplement 1 of revised manuscript). As illustrated in the new Supplemental figure, the Kd values estimated from the <italic>on</italic>- and <italic>off-rates</italic> are in agreement with those of reported Kd values obtained from equilibrium binding assays. Here we note that small differences in the kinetically- and equilibrium-determined Kd values for dsRNA interaction with dmDcr-2 could arise due to differences in methods and/or the experimental conditions used in these assays, such as, protein/dsRNA concentration and whether reactions were performed with ATP or a non-hydrolyzable analog (Jarmoskaite et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. To support the FRET unwinding experiments, it is important that the authors show both acceptor fluorescence increase (shown) and donor fluorescence decrease (not shown). The mirroring of the signals will be a more definitive proof for a FRET signal supporting transient dsRNA unwinding while distinguishing any signals from protein binding and translocation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for appreciating our experimental strategy, and we agree that it would be ideal to show both donor and acceptor fluorescence. However, for reasons described below, this approach is problematic. Notably, dsRNA substrates used for binding and unwinding/rewinding studies (Figures 1 and 3) have Cy3 at the same site within the dsRNA. During the fast phase of dsRNA binding to dmDcr-2 with nucleotide, the donor (Cy3) fluorescence is enhanced upon experiencing a rigid microenvironment inside the helicase domain (Figure 1 and Figure 1—supplement 2). Importantly, the time-scales for the fast binding and transient unwinding phase of dsRNA termini are similar: For BLT, compare Figure 1I, +ATP, 0.8s and Figure 3E +ATP, 0.5s; for 3’ovr, compare Figure 1I, +ATP, 5.5s and Figure 3E +ATP, 1s. Thus, the Cy3 signal from binding would interfere with any enhancement of the Cy3 signal from a distance change in donor-acceptor pair during transient unwinding. In order to mitigate such interference, we chose to monitor the Cy5 FRET signal to monitor the ATP-dependent transient unwinding of dsRNA catalyzed by dmDcr-2. (We note that in the translocation experiments of Figure 4, the half-lives for translocation to the Cy3-labeled 18<sup>th</sup> base pair of the dsRNA are 14s (BLT) and 29s (3’ovr), and therefore, they are kinetically well-separated from the transient unwinding events (<italic>t<sub>1/2</sub></italic>, 0.5-1.0s) thus precluding any interference.)</p><p>To address this reviewer’s concern, we have added a sentence describing our rationale in the revised manuscript (Page 10, Lines 203-208; sentence beginning, “Instead of donor (Cy3) fluorescence…”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. In my estimate the model should be updated to include the effects of ATP, ATPγs and the different overhangs on the kinetic parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer and have modified our model shown in Figure 7 to more fully illustrate the data reported in our paper. In the modified figure we incorporate information on the impact of ATP and ATPγS, and provide kinetic parameters that allow comparisons of blunt and 3’ overhanging termini. We have also revised the legend to clarify information in our revised figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Another option is to eliminate or otherwise de-emphasize this part.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that a complete understanding of the observed correlation will require additional experimentation that is beyond the scope of this manuscript, and we have added a sentence to our revised manuscript to address this issue (Page 22, Lines 521-523, sentence beginning, “That said, future studies,…”). We have also expanded our discussion of how conformational fluctuations can be coupled to slower motions to enhance catalysis (Page 21, Lines 495-505; second half of first paragraph of section called “The importance of conformational fluctuations…”).</p><p>We do feel strongly that the results of our fluorescence anisotropy experiments are exciting and set the stage for further experimentation, and we have retained these experiments in our revised manuscript. However, this reviewer’s comments made us realize that our description of these experiments was confusing and their logic was sometimes lost. To address this issue, we have made small changes throughout the Result section describing these experiments (Page 15, line 319; section called “Conformational dynamics of helicase and Platform–PAZ domains impact dmDcr-2 catalysis”). Similarly, we have revised the section of the Discussion relating to these experiments (Page 21-23, lines 487-557; section called “The importance of conformational fluctuations of dmDcr-2 in catalysis”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. More information on the binding step needs to be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We have studied the second-order reaction of dsRNA binding to dmDcr-2 under pseudo first-order conditions, where the concentration of enzyme is so large (compared to substrate) that it is regarded as constant during the binding reaction. The pre-mixing concentration of dmDcr-2 (2μM) is 10-fold-excess over dsRNA (0.2μM) in the stopped-flow syringes. The equilibrium binding affinities of BLT and 3’ovr dsRNA to dmDcr-2 are ~50-60nM (Donelick et al., 2020), and therefore, the enzyme is saturating with respect to the substrate in our experimental condition. However, we note that the precise measurement of the second-order rate constant is not contingent upon the use of a saturating concentration of dmDcr-2 if the pseudo-first condition is met. The concentrations of dsRNA and dmDcr-2 were carefully chosen so that there is substantial change in the fluorescence signal (with a high signal to noise ratio) arising from the change in free Cy3-dsRNA concentration upon its binding to dmDcr-2 over time, and to avoid any kinetic complexity linked with potential non-ideal (aggregative) behavior of dmDcr-2 at high μM concentration. We have estimated the second-order rate constant (<italic>k<sub><sup>+</sup>1</sub></italic>) for binding of dsRNA using the relevant kinetic scheme/equation, and the concentration of enzyme after mixing (1µM; see new Figure 2—supplement 1A-C), and found values to be 1.1×10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> and 1.6×10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, for BLT and 3’ovr dsRNA binding to dmDcr-2•ATPγS. The kinetically-determined Kd values for the enzyme-substrate interaction in the presence of ATPγS is in close agreement with Kd values obtained from equilibrium binding studies (Figure 2—supplement 1 of revised manuscript)—suggesting the validity of our <italic>minimal</italic> kinetic model without an additional isomerization step.</p><p>The half-life for the fast phase of BLT dsRNA binding to dmDcr-2 with ATP (0.8±0.2s) and ATPγS (0.6±0.1s) are essentially the same within the limit of experimental error (Figure 1I). However, this reviewer’s comment made us realize that using 0.6 is confusing. All of the nucleotide-dependent steps in Figure 7 have now been changed to the ATP values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Provide control that excess of unlabeled RNA to trap dissociating enzyme in actually traps all released (and otherwise present) protein (Figure 2, point 6).</p></disp-quote><p>In our dissociation off-rate measurements, a further 5-fold increase in the concentration of unlabeled dsRNA (total of 15-fold excess) did not alter the observed rate of dissociation. We thank the reviewer for realizing we had neglected to mention this. We have added a line to the methods noting this important control (Page 35, lines 807-808 in revised manuscript; first sentence of section called, “Measurement of dissociation off-rates”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Provide kinetic data from PAGE timecourse(s) for substrate cleavage, to validate the model. Those data probably already exist with the substrates at the conditions tested.</p></disp-quote><p>Although gel-based PAGE assays allow easy visualization of the stable intermediates and/or end products of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, they do not provide any information about the transient intermediates that are generated and decayed in the millisecond-second time-scale of the catalytic cycle. This is primarily because PAGE assays rely on manual mixing, which is inefficient, and takes several seconds. Since one turnover of the dmDcr-2 catalytic cycle is completed within 43-84 seconds (e.g. see Figure 5E), a reliable interrogation of the transient kinetic mechanism of dmDcr-2 without employing a rapid/fast-mixing device (stopped-flow system) is infeasible. In our stopped-flow system, homogenous mixing of dsRNA with dmDcr-2 is completed within 1.2 milliseconds (dead time). Due to the fast mixing, we were able to dissect the sequence of key molecular events of the dmDcr-2 catalytic cycle: binding, unwinding/rewinding, translocation, and dsRNA cleavage/siRNA release. Nonetheless, the kinetic parameters we report here are consistent with observations made in our prior end-point assays. For example, the higher rate of ATP-dependent cleavage of BLT dsRNA, as compared to 3’ovr, measured in our transient kinetic studies, are qualitatively similar to the termini-dependent cleavage rates observed with dmDcr-2 by our lab previously, using a PAGE assay (Sinha et al., 2015).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors suggest that a higher observed rate for cleavage of BLT dsRNA, compared to its residence time on dmDcr-2 enhances the processivity of dmDcr-2 on long BLT dsRNA. In the context of the study, processivity (multiple consecutive translocation steps) has neither been demonstrated nor has it been measured. Revise this passage.</p></disp-quote><p>While prior equilibrium studies from our laboratory (Welker et al. MC 2011; Sinha et al., MC 2015) indicate dmDcr-2 acts processively with blunt dsRNA and ATP, we completely agree that the transient kinetic studies we describe here do not measure processivity, but rather, a single catalytic cycle of dmDcr-2 that produces one siRNA. Nonetheless, our experiments indicate that the enzyme remains bound to BLT dsRNA after producing one siRNA, in contrast to 3’ovr dsRNA where dmDcr-2 dissociates at the end of the catalytic cycle; the latter observations are consistent with the processivity observed for BLT, but not 3’ovr, dsRNA in prior studies.</p><p>In light of this reviewer’s comment we have revised the noted sentence (Page 19, paragraph 1, lines 435-439; sentence beginning, “Furthermore, a higher observed rate for cleavage of BLT dsRNA…”) to clarify that we are discussing how the experiments reported here fit with the previously reported processivity. In revising our manuscript, we have paid attention to this issue at other times where processivity is mentioned (Page 17, lines 394-405; sentence beginning, “Additionally, the notable absence of a long correlation time…”; Page 22-23, lines 524-552; last paragraph of Discussion, “Our finding that…”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
