the most common causes of cancer deaths. Barrett’s oesophagus (BO) is the only known precancerous precursor to OAC, but our understanding about the molecular events leading to OAC development is limited. Here, we have integrated gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles of human biopsies and identified a strong cell cycle gene expression signature in OAC compared to BO. Through analysing associated chromatin accessibility changes, we have implicated the transcription factor KLF5 in the transition from BO to OAC. Importantly, we show that KLF5 expression is unchanged during this transition, but instead, KLF5 is redistributed across chromatin to directly regulate cell cycle genes specifically in OAC cells. This new KLF5 target gene programme has potential prognostic significance as high levels correlate with poorer patient survival. Thus, the repurposing of KLF5 for novel regulatory activity in OAC provides new insights into the mechanisms behind disease progression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Acid fluids present in the gut can sometimes ‘go up’ and damage the oesophagus, the pipe that connects the mouth and the stomach. As a result, a small number of individuals can develop Barrett’s oesophagus, a condition where cells in the lining of the lower oesophagus show abnormal shapes. In certain patients, these cells then become cancerous, but exactly how this happens is unknown. This lack of understanding contributes to late diagnoses, limited treatment and low survival rates.</p><p>Many cancers feature ‘signature’ mutations in a set of genes that controls how a cell can multiply. Yet, in the case of cancers of the lower oesophagus, known genetic changes have had a limited impact on our understanding of the emergence of the disease. Here, Rogerson et al. focused instead on non-genetic changes and studied transcription factors, the proteins that bind to regulatory regions of the DNA to switch genes on and off.</p><p>A close inspection of cancer cells in the lower oesophagus revealed that, in that state, a transcription factor called KLF5 controls the abnormal activation of genes involved in cell growth. This is linked to the transcription factor adopting a different pattern of binding onto regulatory regions in diseased cells. Crucially, when the cell growth genes regulated by KLF5 are activated, patients have lower survival rates. Further work is now required to examine whether this finding could help to identify patients who are most at risk from developing cancer. More broadly, the results from the work by Rogerson et al. demonstrate how transcription factors can be repurposed in a disease context.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>KLF5</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>oesophageal cancer</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Clinical PhD and PhD funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rogerson</surname><given-names>Connor</given-names></name><name><surname>Britton</surname><given-names>Edward</given-names></name><name><surname>Ang</surname><given-names>Yeng</given-names></name><name><surname>Sharrocks</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Programme grant and studentship 103857/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ogden</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name><name><surname>Sharrocks</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genome-wide redistribution of KLF5 binding leads to activation of a cell cycle gene expression programme and proliferation control in oesophageal cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oesophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer worldwide, and its 5-year survival rate of 15% makes it the sixth most-common cause of cancer-related death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferlay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pennathur et al., 2013</xref>). A subtype of oesophageal cancer, oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC), is the predominant subtype in many Western countries and its incidence is rising rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coleman et al., 2018</xref>). Patients with OAC often present at a late stage with advanced disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smyth et al., 2017</xref>). The lack of molecular knowledge of OAC, combined with lack of tailored therapies, contribute to the low survival of OAC patients.</p><p>The accepted model of OAC development is the progression from an intestinal metaplastic condition of the lower oesophagus, known as Barrett’s oesophagus (BO), to OAC through increasing stages of dysplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burke and Tosh, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spechler and Souza, 2014</xref>). Many mutations found in OAC are also present in BO, especially <italic>TP53</italic>, which suggests a stepwise transition to OAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ross-Innes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stachler et al., 2015</xref>). Focal amplifications differ as they largely occur in OAC compared to BO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stachler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamamoto et al., 2016</xref>). The amplified genes can be grouped into functional biological pathways with the RAS-ERK signalling pathway (e.g. ERBB2; EGFR; KRAS) and GATA transcription factors (GATA4; GATA6) being the most common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frankell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2017</xref>). The morphology of BO differs from the oesophageal epithelia by the presence of a columnar epithelium and secretory goblet cells, rather than squamous epithelium (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spechler and Souza, 2014</xref>). Genomic and transcription events have been observed to differ between BO and OAC. Mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> are more frequent in BO from patients that had progressed to OAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stachler et al., 2018</xref>) and <italic>SMAD4</italic> mutations appear to occur exclusively in OAC, although at a low frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weaver et al., 2014</xref>). Increased TGFβ signalling through other SMAD family members, SMAD2/3, promotes growth in OAC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blum et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, increased expression and increased activity of AP-1 transcription factors occurs in the transition from BO to OAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blum et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maag et al., 2017</xref>). Despite these studies, the definitive molecular mechanisms of progression to OAC are poorly understood and biomarkers to identify patients at risk of progression are lacking.</p><p>Changes to the chromatin landscape have been implicated in many cancers and chromatin accessibility changes during tumourigenesis are a major factor in altering regulatory element activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corces et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denny et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kelso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rendeiro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tome-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhou and Guo, 2018</xref>). We recently used Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to ascertain the molecular basis of BO and identified a set of transcription factors that define the BO chromatin landscape and are retained in OAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rogerson et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we took a similar approach to discover important transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that are specifically operational in OAC and hence contribute to the molecular basis of disease progression from BO to OAC. We compared the open chromatin landscape in BO and OAC patient biopsies and uncovered KLF5 as an important transcriptional regulator that is repurposed to directly drive a cell cycle gene expression signature during the progression of BO to OAC.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) tumourigenesis is associated with enhanced cell cycle gene activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of possible transcription factor network induction during OAC development.

We analysed public human BO and OAC RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maag et al., 2017</xref>). These samples separate well after principal component analysis (PCA), therefore we retained all samples for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Performing differential gene expression analysis, we identified 905 differentially expressed genes between BO and OAC (±1.5 x; <italic>Q</italic>-value &lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Of these 905 genes, 465 are upregulated in OAC and 440 are downregulated in OAC compared to BO. To validate these findings, we analysed RNA-seq data from our own sample collection (3 BO and 3 OAC). Genes that were upregulated in OAC from the discovery dataset were significantly upregulated in the validation dataset and likewise for downregulated in OAC genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To gain insights into biological pathways behind these differentially expressed genes, we used two approaches. Firstly, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) uncovered two cell cycle associated terms, ‘G2M checkpoint’ and ‘E2F1 targets’, as the most significant upregulated gene sets in OAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Conversely, ‘Fatty acid metabolism’ and ‘p53 pathway’ are the most significant downregulated gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Secondly, biological pathway gene ontology analysis of upregulated genes revealed many cell cycle associated terms, such as ‘Nuclear division’, ‘Regulation of mitotic cell cycle’ and ‘DNA replication’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Example genes such as <italic>CDC25B</italic>, <italic>CENPI</italic> and <italic>E2F1</italic> all showed significant upregulation in OAC compared to BO in both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Downregulated genes uncovered metabolic associated terms, such as ‘alcohol metabolic process’, ‘monocarboxylic acid metabolic process’ and ‘Lipid catabolic process’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Representative example genes from these pathways such as <italic>IDI1</italic>, <italic>ADH4</italic> and <italic>CIDEC</italic> all show significant downregulation in both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These initial results indicate a strong upregulation of genes associated with cell cycle processes during the progression from BO to OAC accompanied with the inactivation of genes controlled by the p53 pathway and genes associated with metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Chromatin accessibility changes in the transition from BO to OAC</title><p>To identify putative transcriptional regulators that may drive the transition to OAC and impact on this enhanced cell cycle profile, we analysed the accessible chromatin landscape using ATAC-seq from patient biopsies. To supplement our previous ATAC-seq datasets from BO and OAC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rogerson et al., 2019</xref>), we performed ATAC-seq on two additional OAC biopsies, which were quality-checked and reproducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). We wanted to focus on the differentially expressed genes in OAC compared to BO, therefore we generated a set of accessible regions representing potential regulatory regions that are associated with this set of genes. We took all ATAC-seq peaks from all samples within +/- 250 kb of a TSS of a differentially expressed gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). After merging so that only unique peaks remained, 35,220 regions were used for further analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We first performed principal component analysis on normalised ATAC-seq signal of all BO and OAC samples to identify differences between samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This led to clustering of all BO samples and clustering of most OAC samples. OAC samples T_003 and T_005 did not cluster with the other OAC samples and were therefore removed from the subsequent differential accessibility analysis. We then carried out differential accessibility analysis between BO and OAC on this peak set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). A total of 1495 regions were significantly differentially accessible (±2 x; <italic>Q</italic>-value &lt;0.1), the majority of which increased in accessibility (1327/1495). An example gene locus which shows differential accessibility in OAC is centred on <italic>KRT19</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Within this locus, both gene promoters (14%; 1/7) and distal regulatory regions (86%; 6/7) gain accessibility in OAC. To assess whether the observed changes of accessibility near differentially expressed genes are common to other OACs, we compared our ATAC-seq data to independent, previously published ATAC-seq datasets from TCGA-ESCA oesophageal adenocarcinoma samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, bottom; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corces et al., 2018</xref>). TCGA-ESCA samples showed similar open chromatin peak profiles and clustered with our OAC samples with the exception of one sample, which clusters with our BO samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The chromatin accessibility profiles nearby genes differentially expressed in OAC are therefore reproducible across patients.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Altered chromatin accessibility landscape during OAC carcinogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of ATAC-seq analysis.

In differential accessible regions, motifs for KLF (e.g. KLF4, KLF5 and KLF1) and AP-1 (e.g. FOS, JUNB, JUND, JUN and FOSL1/2) transcription factors showed the highest footprinting score in OAC, whereas motifs for homeobox transcription factors (e.g. HNF1A, HOXA5 and NKX2-5), ARID3A and MEF transcription factors (e.g. MEF2A and MEF2C) showed more footprinting in BO. To provide more evidence for transcription factor occupancy, we then plotted ATAC-seq signal across their motifs. Both FOS (AP-1) and KLF4 (KLF) motifs show a clear increase in footprint depth in OAC, indicative of more transcription factor binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We have previously identified AP-1 as an important regulator in OAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britton et al., 2017</xref>), but the role of KLF transcription factors in OAC is poorly understood. We therefore focussed on the potential role of KLF transcription factors in the progression of BO to OAC.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>KLF5 control a cell cycle gene expression programme in OAC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bar chart of percentage targets and percentage background of de novo discovered motifs at increased accessible regions in OAC compared to Barrett’s oesophagus.

KLF5 was clearly the highest expressed among the KLF family in OAC. KLF5 has been previously implicated in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma as a tumour suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tarapore et al., 2013</xref>) and has been identified as pro-tumorigenic in gastric cancer via amplifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chia et al., 2015</xref>). To determine the gene regulatory functions of KLF5, we carried out siRNA-mediated knockdowns of KLF5 in OE19 cells, a cell line we identified as having a similar chromatin landscape to OAC biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rogerson et al., 2019</xref>) and exhibits strong tumourigenic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hassan et al., 2017</xref>). Knockdown of KLF5 was evident after 3 days siRNA transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and RNA-seq replicates were highly correlative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Carrying out differential expression analysis identified 4934 genes (2637 upregulated and 2297 downregulated) with significant changes in gene expression (±1.3 x; <italic>Q</italic>-value &lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Biological pathway GO term analysis revealed several enriched terms including ‘DNA replication’ and ‘Regulation of mitotic cell cycle’ for downregulated genes, and terms involving ‘Oxidative phosphorylation’ and ‘mitochondrial gene expression’ for upregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). The terms associated with downregulated genes are reminiscent of the terms enriched in genes upregulated in OAC (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, GSEA also found similar gene sets: ‘mitotic spindle’; ‘G2M checkpoint’ and ‘E2F targets’ for downregulated genes and ‘oxidative phosphorylation’; ‘xenobiotic metabolism’ and ‘fatty acid metabolism’ for upregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). Since the genes regulated by KLF5 are involved in similar processes as the genes aberrantly expressed in OAC, we asked whether any of the same genes are in each dataset. 21% (97/465) of the genes upregulated in OAC significantly overlap with those downregulated with siKLF5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and many of these are associated with cell cycle related functions, including genes encoding core cell cycle proteins like CCNE1, E2F1 and various MCM proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Further analysis of the biological pathways enriched within these 97 genes identified very similar GO terms to those enriched in genes upregulated in OAC compared to BO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). GSEA also identified the same gene set terms: ‘G2M checkpoint’ and ‘E2F1 targets’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>Next, we asked whether these genes are directly regulated by KLF5, and carried out replicate ChIP-seq for KLF5 in OE19 cells which were highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). We therefore took the overlap of peaks between biological replicates forward for downstream analyses, resulting in 13,542 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). These peaks are highly enriched in the KLF5 motif, demonstrating the validity of the dataset, and also in AP1(FRA1) and GATA (GATA6) motifs, which we have previously revealed in genome wide studies as implicated in OAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rogerson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Focussing on the 97 genes that are upregulated in OAC and also downregulated after KLF5 depletion, 97% have a KLF5 ChIP-seq peak within 0.5 Mb of the TSS and the median distance between a KLF5 ChIP-seq peak and the TSS of all significantly downregulated genes was 11,975 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>). In contrast, KLF5-binding regions are further away (&gt;20 kb) from the TSS of genes that were either unaffected by KLF5 depletion or whose expression was increased. This is indicative of direct activation by KLF5. An example gene is <italic>CDC25B</italic> which harbours multiple KLF5 ChIP-seq peaks surrounding its locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

We therefore we used these cell-lines to model KLF5 activity in BO and OAC. To gain a more comprehensive view of KLF5 function, we performed ChIP-seq for KLF5 in CP-A cells and used spike-in normalisation to better assess differential binding relative to OE19 cells. Anti-KLF5 antibodies precipitated KLF5 in CP-A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and biological replicates were highly reproducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

An example locus is <italic>CCNE1</italic>, which demonstrates increased KLF5 binding in OE19 cells at the promoter and putative enhancers associated with open chromatin regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Regions that are bound by KLF5 in OE19 cells are enriched in motifs for KLF, GATA, Forkhead, AP-1 and TCF transcription factors, whereas regions bound by KLF5 in CP-A cells are enriched for a different set of motifs with, TEAD, RUNX and p53 transcription factor families in addition to KLF and AP-1 motifs detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). These results are in-keeping with our previous work showing AP-1 and GATA6 functionality in OAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rogerson et al., 2019</xref>). Regions specifically bound by KLF5 in OAC cells also exhibited increased accessibility in OE19 cells and importantly, accessibility is also elevated around these binding sites in OAC tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). These findings are therefore consistent with a broad role of KLF5 in OAC.</p><p>To further probe the potential biological significance of the differentially bound KLF5 regions, we associated these with the nearest gene and determined the enriched GO terms for genes associated with cell-type-specific KLF5 peaks that also show preferential expression in BO or OAC. OE19-specific KLF5-binding events are associated with genes involved in ‘cell division’ control, whereas CP-A-specific KLF5 binding is associated with ‘epithelial cell differentiation’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The latter observation is consistent with the potential loss of cell identity in OAC. However, since oncogenic events during the progression from BO to OAC are poorly understood, we decided to focus on regions that acquire KLF5 binding in OE19 cells. To relate specific KLF5-binding events to gene expression changes, we took the set of 97 genes that are upregulated in OAC and downregulated by KLF5 depletion (i.e. activated by KLF5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and found that there are 371 OE19-specific KLF5-binding peaks within a 0.5 Mb locus centred on the TSS. To further explore how KLF5 activates these genes in OAC, we assessed the transcription factor binding motif distribution (identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) within this set of OE19-specific KLF5 peaks. We detected KLF5 binding motifs in 257/371 of these regions, and strikingly, 56% (145/257) of the peaks also house a mixture of FOXA, AP-1, GATA and TCF motifs, in addition to the KLF motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). This suggests that KLF5 functions in a combinatorial manner with these other transcription factors to activate gene transcription during progression from BO to OAC. However, a large portion of these peaks (44%) contain only a KLF motif suggesting a more independent role for KLF5 in these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). To test whether these motif enrichments reflect transcription factor binding, we integrated our ChIP-seq data of transcription factors active in OAC (GATA6 and HNF4A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rogerson et al., 2019</xref>), with KLF5-binding data. Since only GATA motifs are enriched in these regions we would expect co-binding with GATA6 and not HNF4A. We therefore compared ChIP-seq profiles for these transcription factors, and see extensive co-binding of GATA6 at these sites but no evidence of co-binding with HNF4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Finally, the predicted target gene co-regulation by KLF5 and GATA6 was validated by depletion of each factor in OE19 cells, which leads to a large significant overlap in downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). However, this co-regulated gene set contains only two of the cell cycle associated genes regulated by KLF5, suggesting that this combination of transcription factors is not directly involved in controlling this process. Turning back to the cell cycle genes directly activated in OAC through OAC-specific binding of KLF5, we tested whether KLF5 is relevant for their expression in CP-A cells. As expected from the lower KLF5-binding levels in these cells, depletion of KLF5 had little effect on these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>), consistent with a newly acquired function in OAC cells.</p><p>To establish whether the 371 KLF5-bound regions that are associated with KLF sensitive genes are relevant to OAC, we turned back to our ATAC-seq data and clustered the data to reveal two clusters. One set of regions is already partially open in CP-A cells that increase in accessibility in OE19 cells (cluster 1) and another set are closed in CP-A cells and become more accessible (cluster 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F</xref>, left). Importantly, the same pattern of accessibility is evident using ATAC-seq signal from BO and OAC tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F</xref>, right). To identify any potential differences between these clusters, we performed motif analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). The most common motif in both clusters were KLF motifs and the most striking difference is the large proportion of AP1 motifs specifically associated with cluster one suggesting a potential role for AP1 in priming binding of KLF5 to these regions.</p><p>Together, these results indicate an altered DNA-binding profile for KLF5 in BO and OAC, and this altered binding is associated with chromatin opening. This altered binding profile for KLF5 in OAC reflects a direct role in controlling genes involved in cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>KLF5 converges with ERBB2 on cell cycle gene regulation and controls cell proliferation in OAC</title><p>Our results indicate a role of KLF5 in controlling increased cell cycle gene expression in OAC; however, it is unclear how this relates to genetic events that potentially impact on the same process.

We performed differential accessibility analysis, which identified 717 regions with decreased chromatin accessibility and 733 regions with increased accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). De novo motif analysis of the regions that exhibit reduced chromatin accessibility following ERBB2 depletion, revealed that the majority contain AP-1-binding motifs as expected from the established connections between ERK pathway signalling and AP1 transcription factors. However, the binding motif for KLF transcription factors was also detected, albeit in a subset of the regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>). We then used our KLF5 ChIP-seq dataset from OE19 cells to validate KLF5 binding at regions with reduced chromatin accessibility following ERBB2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These regions are relevant in the context of OAC as they also show increased chromatin accessibility in OAC tissue compared to BO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The convergence of ERBB2 signalling on KLF5 transcription factor activity suggested that they might also converge on the same genes. We therefore carried out RNA-seq in OE19 cells treated with siRNA against ERBB2. The RNA-seq data were highly reproducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and resulted in 778 genes down- and 664 genes up-regulated (two-fold change; FDR &lt; 0.05, FPKM &gt; 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). There is a large, statistically significant overlap between directly activated KLF5 target genes and genes downregulated by <italic>ERBB2</italic> depletion. Moreover, a closer comparison reveals that the expression of the majority of the directly activated KLF5 target genes was reduced upon ERBB2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Most of these common target genes are cell cycle related. These results therefore indicate that ERBB2 and KLF5 converge on a similar set of regulatory regions to drive the expression of cell cycle regulatory genes. To establish whether ERBB2 can redistribute KLF5 binding and activate its target genes, we created BO-derived CP-A cell lines that stably over express ERBB2 to mimic the effect of amplification seen in OAC. These cells exhibit high levels of ERBB2 expression, maintain ERK and AKT activation in serum starved conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and exhibit growth factor-independent proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Several cell cycle related genes that are activated by KLF5 in OAC cells are also activated by ERBB2 overexpression in BO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, we were unable to detect any increases in KLF5 occupancy at a panel of KLF5-binding regions associated with cell cycle genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These findings therefore reaffirm the convergence of ERBB2 signalling and KLF5 on the activation of a cell cycle gene signature but ERBB2 is not sufficient to trigger KLF5 redistribution.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>KLF5 controls cell proliferation in OAC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap of ATAC-seq signal at regions (peak centre ±2.5 kb) with significantly differential accessibility (±2 x; Q &lt; 0.05) in OE19 cells treated with siERBB2.

We first depleted KLF5 in OE19 cells using siRNA which resulted in the reduction of KLF5 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>), and the growth of cells was significantly impeded after siKLF5 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Second, we validated this growth defect by using CRISPR interference technology. Stable transfection of dCas9-KRAB and subsequent transfection of sgRNAs targeting the promoter of KLF5 (sgKLF5) into OE19 cells resulted in the reduction of KLF5 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>). CRISPRi knockdown of KLF5 also significantly reduced the growth of OE19 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), mirroring the result with siKLF5. We further explored the role of KLF5 in cell growth and cell cycle progression by performing similar assays while perturbing KLF5 target genes (<italic>CCNE1</italic>, <italic>CDC25B</italic>, <italic>KIF14</italic>, <italic>CLSPN</italic> and <italic>NR4A1</italic>). All these genes showed significant reductions in expression upon siRNA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>). The growth of OE19 cells was significantly reduced with the treatment of siRNA against <italic>CCNE1</italic>, <italic>KIF14</italic> and <italic>CLSPN</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Knockdown of these genes also significantly altered cell cycle patterns, particularly knockdown of <italic>CLSPN</italic> which induced a prominent S-phase block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D</xref>). These results provide more evidence for the role of KLF5 in the growth of cells and highlight the role of KLF5 target genes in this phenotype.</p><p>To assess whether the expression of KLF5 and its target genes has any clinical relevance, we sourced OAC expression and survival data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2017</xref>) and plotted a survival of patients with high and low expression (±median) of KLF5 itself and KLF5 target genes up to 24 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Those with a higher expression of KLF5 showed no difference in patient survival, whereas patients with high target gene expression exhibited a significantly lower survival rate compared to those with low expression. This result is in keeping with the hypothesis that it is the activation of KLF5 target genes by its redistribution across chromatin, rather than its expression level that is important. It is noteworthy that CLSPN expression alone is predictive of increased patient survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) and its enhanced expression in OAC compared to BO makes this a useful potential biomarker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these results confirm the functional role of KLF5 in cell cycle control in OAC and convergence of action with the ERBB2 signalling pathway. This is clinically important as patients with highly expressed KLF5 target genes have a worse prognosis that those without.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Genome sequencing efforts of patients with BO and OAC have provided insights into the molecular causes of BO and OAC and show the mutational relationships between these disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ross-Innes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stachler et al., 2015</xref>). This has provided evidence for a model of OAC developing from BO. The molecular mechanisms involved in progression to OAC are poorly understood; however, BO offers a therapeutic window of opportunity to identify those more at risk of OAC development. In addition to genetic events, epigenetic changes and alterations to the chromatin landscape are also likely to play an important role in disease progression. Here, we demonstrate that there are marked changed in chromatin accessibility and associated gene expression, indicating active changes at the chromatin level during carcinogenesis. One of the major contributing factors to this change is the transcription factor KLF5. KLF5 is re-purposed in OAC cells and its chromatin-binding profile is massively rewired to drive increased expression of cell cycle associated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Conversely, this rewiring results in the loss of KLF5 binding to many regulatory regions occupied in Barrett’s cells. This loss is potentially associated with the loss of cell identity, and may also contribute to the development of the cancer phenotype.</p><p>Cell cycle deregulation is one of the key hallmarks of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>) and here we uncovered a cell cycle gene expression signature, comprised of genes that are overexpressed in OAC. Recent research identified the cell-cycle as a perturbed pathway in OAC and suggested the possibility of CDK4/6 inhibitors as a therapeutic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frankell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mourikis et al., 2019</xref>). We have previously uncovered a deregulated FOXM1 regulatory network active in OAC, a key regulator of late cell cycle gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wiseman et al., 2015</xref>). By integrating ATAC-seq data to identify upstream regulators of this signature, we also uncovered AP-1 and KLF5 as putative transcription factors in this process. We have previously identified AP-1 as an important factor in OAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britton et al., 2017</xref>) and others have shown an increase in AP-1 family transcription factors between non-dysplastic BO and low-grade dysplastic BO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maag et al., 2017</xref>). What is less clear is the role of KLF5 in the progression of BO to OAC. KLF5 has been shown to have a tumour promoting function in pancreatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2018</xref>) and basal-like breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qin et al., 2015</xref>). KLF5 is also frequently amplified in gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) and has recently been shown to regulate gene expression in OAC in combination with other transcription factors, GATA6, ELF3 and EHF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). This was reinforced by a recent study that identified KLF5 as a master transcription factor on which OAC cell-lines were dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reddy et al., 2019</xref>). Paradoxically, KLF5 has been shown to have a tumour suppressor role in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tarapore et al., 2013</xref>) and breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). The expression of the related protein, KLF4, together with three other genes, was able to stratify OAC from BO, albeit KLF4 expression is reduced in progression from BO to OAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maag et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have begun to suggest a role for KLF5 in cell cycle control. For example, KLF5 binds to a <italic>CCNE1</italic> promoter proximal element in bladder cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pattison et al., 2016</xref>) and KLF5 increases the expression of <italic>Ccnb1</italic> and <italic>Mcm2</italic> downstream of oncogenic Ras in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nandan et al., 2005</xref>). Here, we provide evidence that KLF5 exhibits a widespread role; directly controlling cell proliferation through activation of cell cycle associated genes. We also show that reduction of KLF5 levels, or several of its target genes, in OAC cells impairs growth. Indeed, this is exemplified by <italic>CLSPN</italic> which may have therapeutic potential as its gene product, Claspin, has recently been shown to have a broader role in cancer cell viability by protecting cancer cells from replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bianco et al., 2019</xref>). KLF5 directly binds and regulates core cell cycle genes for example <italic>CDC25B</italic>, <italic>CCNE1</italic> and <italic>MCM2</italic>, some of which are cell cycle transcription factors for example E2F1, MYBL2, thus providing a mechanism for propagating its effects on cell cycle control. We also show KLF5 expression is almost unchanged between BO and OAC. By profiling KLF5 chromatin binding in BO and OAC cells, we have demonstrated an altered KLF5 binding profile. The regions bound by KLF5 specifically in OAC cells are enriched in motifs for several transcription factors, including the GATA family which suggests a combinatorial regulatory code. This is in keeping with our finding that there is extensive overlap between the binding of KLF5 and GATA6 which is reinforced by recent studies that show that KLF5 binds with GATA6 in OAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2020</xref>) and gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chia et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The overlap in regulatory potential with GATA6 provides a plausible link to one of the major genetic events that drive the BO to OAC transition. Our work also suggests a link to another major pathway that is activated through gene amplification in OAC, the ERBB2-driven RAS-ERK pathway. Knockdown of ERBB2 reduced the expression of many KLF5 target genes and KLF5 motifs were found at regions with reduced chromatin accessibility upon ERBB2 knockdown. However, ERBB2 overexpression in BO cells is insufficient to trigger KLF5 redistribution, indicating that other pathways contribute to KLF5 redistribution in OAC, but this needs further investigation. Nevertheless, it is clear that ERBB2 signalling and KLF5 activity converge on the same cell cycle genes and both are required for their activation, indicating functional synergy. The signalling pathways are more unclear in the context of BO, the precancerous precursor. We see enrichment of the TEAD motif only in CP-A cells and not OE19 cells, suggesting that KLF5 may be operating through the Hippo signalling pathway in BO. In other contexts, KLF5 has been shown to cooperate with TEAD transcription factors, downstream of YAP/TAZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) and KLF5 is stabilised by YAP in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhi et al., 2012</xref>). Further work is needed to substantiate these links in BO.</p><p>In summary, we have used integrative analysis of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq from BO and OAC patient samples to uncover a cell cycle signature regulated by KLF5. Using a multi-omics approach, we found an oncogenic role of KLF5 in OAC, a transcription factor that has not been shown to be mutated, amplified and/or over-expressed in OAC. This study highlights the power of supplementing expression data with genome-wide chromatin profiling methods such as ATAC-seq. This provides molecular insights into the mechanisms by which BO progresses to OAC and identifies a signature of transcription factor gene targets that have potential prognostic significance and could be used as biomarkers in the clinic.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines, cell culture conditions and patient biopsies</title><p>OE19 and CP-A cells were purchased from ATCC and tested negative for mycoplasma.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Irwin Davidson as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is 'in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>'. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study uses integrated genomics approaches on both patient material and model cell lines to investigate changes in chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and KLF5 genomic occupancy in Barrett's Esophagus (BO) compared to esophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) in an attempt to explain the changes in gene expression that drive the transition from the pre-cancerous to cancerous state. The results show changes in ATAC-seq accessibility and redistribution of KLF5 genomic occupancy in particular around a collection of 97 genes that appear as key KLF5 targets involved in cell cycle and up-regulated in OAC. The study further shows that ERBB2 signaling, a gene frequently amplified during BO to OAC progression partly regulates the redistribution of KLF5 to sites regulating the cell cycle genes.</p><p>While the reviewers were convinced by the data showing the redistribution of KLF5 genomic occupancy between the BO and OAC states and appreciated the integration of patient data with model cell lines, one of the major conclusions is that this redistribution participates actively in the transition between the two states. This is implied by the loss of function data, but in the opinion of the reviewers, gain of function showing that ERBB2 overexpression drives KLF5 redistribution and the OAC gene expression program is also necessary. Other revisions are also required that involve data analyses and changes to the text. We will be happy receive a revised version of the manuscript once the revisions have been completed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors show that siRNA mediated silencing of ERBB2 results in loss of KLF5 binding (not shown directly but through ATAC-seq) at specific sites selectively occupied in OAC. In a complementary experiment can the authors show that gain of ERBB2 expression in CP-A cells (or in another pertinent experimental system), enhances cell proliferation, promotes KLF5 redistribution and enhances expression of the key KLF5 cell cycle genes.

In our conclusions, we were careful to state that this was convergence rather than direct pathway intersection. We used this as further evidence to demonstrate the importance of the KLF5 regulon for gene regulation OAC. However, the reviewers make a valid point that we should test whether the functional interaction if direct or indirect. We now demonstrate that overexpression of ERBB2 in a Barrett’s cell line (CP-A) is sufficient to drive growth factor-independent activation of a panel of cell cycle genes from the KLF5 regulon (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2C), consistent with its ability to drive growth factor-independent cell proliferation (Figure 5—figure supplement 2B). However, ERBB2 did not promote enhanced KLF5 binding to the regulatory regions of cell cycle genes in these cells (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2D). These results are consistent with ERBB2 and KLF5 converging on the same genes but with no direct link between ERBB2 overexpression and KLF5 redistribution. Importantly, we now also show that KLF5 does not regulate a panel of cell cycle genes in Barrett’s (CP-A) cells (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2E) which we previously showed to be regulated and bound by KLF5 in OAC cells. This provides further evidence for KLF5 specifically functioning in the context of OAC to drive cell cycle gene activation.</p><p>Thus, our original conclusions are still valid and we have now altered the Discussion to be more definitive about the lack of direct links between ERBB2 and KLF5 redistribution, the trigger for which still needs to be determined though future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors show that siRNA mediated silencing of ERBB2 results in loss of KLF5 binding (not shown directly but through ATAC-seq) at specific sites selectively occupied in OAC.

We have demonstrated that ERBB2 is sufficient to drive growth factor-independent cell proliferation of Barrett’s (CP-A) cells (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and B) and enhances expression of a panel of KLF5 target genes in these cells (see new Figure 5—figure supplement 2C). This is fully consistent with our loss of function experiments performed in OAC cells. However, we were unable to detect increases to KLF5 occupancy at a panel of regulatory regions (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2D) indicating that ERBB2 alone is insufficient to trigger KLF5 redistribution. In the original paper we concluded that KLF5 and ERBB2 converge on the same set of genes but not necessarily through direct interaction. This new data has allowed us to reaffirm this conclusion and rule out a causative effect of ERBB2 on KLF5 redistribution. This is not surprising given the complexities of cancer cell rewiring and future studies will be needed to investigate the underlying mechanism further. Note that our ATAC-seq data do point to a loss of KLF5 binding a subset of regions following ERBB2 inhibition but these are not relevant to the cell cycle phenotype we observe here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should discuss a potentially opposing hypothesis for the role of KLF5 in OAC, that loss of KLF5 binding sites between CP-A and OE19 cells (Figure 4B) also has a direct role in gene expression changes and OAC phenotypes.

We added discussion of this to the paper and point out a potential role for this change (i.e. KLF5 binding loss) in the transition to OAC potentially by potentially losing developmental identity. Further work will be needed to further develop this hypothesis which is outside the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors demonstrate that KLF5 and GATA6 knockdown affects a statistically enriched set of target genes in OE19 cells (Figure 4G), but this is only relevant if these same genes are NOT regulated by KLF5 and GATA6 in non-OAC cell lines (like the CP-A cells). If these genes are truly de novo targets in OAC, they should be KLF5/GATA6 independent in CP-A or other lines. Can the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we depleted KLF5 in CP-A cells and tested a panel of genes that are dependent on KLF5 for their activity in OE19 cells. No significant decreases in target gene expression were observed (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2E), demonstrating that they are KLF5-independent in Barrett’s cells but become dependent on KLF5 activity in OAC-derived OE19 cells. We have not tested GATA-dependency as this is not central to this paper on cell cycle functions of re-purposed KLF5, and the contribution of GATA-6 to the broader gene regulatory network warrants further extensive work that is beyond the scope of the current paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should fully describe the RNA-seq results of the siERBB2 experiment. How many genes are de-regulated? If the genes in Figure 5D correspond to only a small subset of those de-regulated by ERBB2 silencing, then this would call their relevance into question and there is no indication of their statistical significance compared to the full repertoire of ERBB2 regulated genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested the significance of the overall overlap of KLF5 activated direct target genes (i.e. down with siKLF5) and ERBB2 activated genes (i.e. down with siERBB2 treatment) and show that this is highly significant whereas genes reciprocally regulated show a negligible, non-significant overlap (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1F). This reaffirms our conclusions that ERBB2 signalling and KLF5 converge on the same set of genes which are largely involved in cell cycle control (note that in Figure 5D, we do not take a fold cut off for the effect of ERBB2 to better illustrate the directionality of change).</p></body></sub-article></article>
