however, there are no whole brain, noninvasive investigations into timescales of neural processing in animal models. To that end, we used the spatial resolution and sensitivity of ultrahigh field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) performed at 10.5 T to probe timescales across the whole macaque brain. We uncovered within-species consistency between timescales estimated from fMRI and electrophysiology. Crucially, we extended existing electrophysiological hierarchies to whole-brain topographies. Our results validate the complementary use of hemodynamic and electrophysiological intrinsic timescales, establishing a basis for future translational work. Further, with these results in hand, we were able to show that one facet of the high-dimensional functional connectivity (FC) topography of any region in the brain is closely related to hierarchical temporal dynamics. We demonstrated that intrinsic timescales are organized along spatial gradients that closely match FC gradient topographies across the whole brain. We conclude that intrinsic timescales are a unifying organizational principle of neural processing across the whole brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neural timescales</kwd><kwd>functional connectivity</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>ultrahigh filed</kwd><kwd>resting-state</kwd><kwd>spontaneous activity</kwd><kwd>intrinsic neural timescales</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41 EB027061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ugurbil</surname><given-names>Kamil</given-names></name><name><surname>Zimmermann</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH118257</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heilbronner</surname><given-names>Sarah R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R56 EB031765 and R01 EB031765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zimmermann</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH128177</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zimmermann</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Digital Technologies Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zimmermann</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Minnesota Institute of Robotics</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zimmermann</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain &amp;

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hasson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Honey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kiebel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murray et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raut et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soltani et al., 2021</xref>). Hierarchical temporal dynamics are a fundamental computational property of the brainâfast-changing sensory input is encoded by the fast dynamics of sensory areas, which is in turn integrated into temporally extended representations encoded by the slower dynamics of higher-order areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavanagh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raut et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soltani et al., 2021</xref>). Temporal integration and information processing over multiple timescales are crucial for understanding how the brain deals with the complexity of the real world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zimmermann et al., 2018</xref>); hence, understanding whole-brain temporal dynamics is highly important.</p><p>As one moves from sensory to associative areas, neural processing reflects a hierarchy of progressively longer âtemporal receptive windowsâ (TRWs)âdefined as the length of time during which an area accumulates information during task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hasson et al., 2008</xref>). In other words, the range of the TRW of each area reflects its functional role, with sensory areas having short TRWs, to enable fast sensory processing, and associative areas having longer TRWs, allowing them to process information unfolding over longer periods of time. Not only does neural processing display these timescales during task performance, but we now know that temporal specialization arises from a regionâs intrinsic dynamics, that is, temporal dynamics that are present even in the absence of direct sensory stimulation. This was first described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murray et al., 2014</xref> analyzing action potentials of single neurons in the macaque. They showed that timescales of baseline neuronal activity vary across cortical areas, revealing a hierarchical progression from fast timescales in sensory areas, to slower timescales in association areas. These intrinsic fluctuations in the neural signal, also described as intrinsic neural timescales (INTs), are thought to set the duration over which brain regions integrate inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murray et al., 2014</xref>). They are hypothesized to be the result of multiple neuronal mechanisms, including local dynamics and recurrent connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murray et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Soltani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watanabe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DemirtaÅ et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Additional studies have replicated and extended the INT hierarchy, reinforcing the idea that brain regions exhibit unique timescales in their intrinsic activity, which reflect functional specialization in terms of temporal integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavanagh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cirillo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fascianelli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murray et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ogawa and Komatsu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rossi-Pool et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maisson et al., 2021</xref>). The concept of INT hierarchy has even been extended to subcortical regionsâspecifically the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nougaret et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, a large-scale network model, based on anatomical connectivity (AC) and the strength of local recurrent connectivity, has been used to successfully reproduce the temporal hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaudhuri et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that AC is closely related to INTs.</p><p>Alterations in hierarchical INT patterns can result in cognitive and behavioral abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watanabe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wengler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zilio et al., 2021</xref>). For example, abnormal INT patterns have been associated with core symptoms of high-functioning individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watanabe et al., 2019</xref>). Likewise, delusions and hallucinations are associated with INT alterations at different hierarchical levels, leading to symptom-specific changes in hierarchical INT gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wengler et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, investigations into INTs have the potential to clarify hierarchical dysfunction in whole-brain dynamics in neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><p>Traditionally, INTs have been investigated using invasive electrophysiology, which is not suited to uncover whole-brain dynamics. It is also challenging to collect in humans, particularly for large data sets (as would be needed to assess differences across populations). One way to overcome this problem is using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which offers whole-brain coverage and can be performed across species and in larger sample sizes. However, it is not yet clear whether hemodynamic INTs derived from fMRI reflect similar neural phenomena as those derived from electrophysiology. To clarify this issue, electrophysiological and hemodynamic INTs must be compared directly within the same species. To that end, recent advancements in nonhuman primate (NHP) neuroimaging, based on the use of very high magnetic fields (10.5 T) for significantly boosting signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lagore et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yacoub et al., 2020</xref>), make it possible to study hemodynamic INTs in the macaque brain. Moreover, taking advantage of the whole-brain coverage of fMRI, we are investigating INT topography. This is important since more recent work has shown that there is significant heterogeneity within regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavanagh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cirillo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nougaret et al., 2021</xref>), even though initially INTs were assigned to cortical regions as a whole.</p><p>In addition to INTs, gradients of functional connectivity (FC) can also describe the functional architecture of neural processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vos de Wael et al., 2020</xref>). Gradient approaches map macroscale brain features to low-dimensional manifold representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vos de Wael et al., 2020</xref>). Gradient mapping has the potential to uncover overlapping functional topographies by treating the high-dimensional connectivity structure as a spatial variance decomposition problem. Notably, this approach finds patterns in the high-dimensional FC similarity structure that describe the spatial direction of maximum FC variance. For example, areas in the early visual cortex are known to exhibit at least two gradual modes of functional change (i.e., eccentricity and polar angle maps), which can be successfully retrieved from resting-state FC via gradient mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haak et al., 2018</xref>). The existence of multiple overlapping principles of topographic organization is likely a general property of the whole brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harvey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jbabdi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marquand et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Przezdzik et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we carry out an investigation into the multidimensional functional architecture of the macaque brain by probing its spatial and temporal intrinsic dynamics. This allows us to achieve several significant goals. First, we are able to relate fMRI hemodynamic timescales to the gold standards of electrophysiology within the same species. Second, with these results in hand, we are able to show that one facet of the high-dimensional FC topography of any region in the brain is closely related to INT topography. We show that the hierarchical intrinsic dynamics of neural processing manifest into gradients of INTs and FC which follow the same gradual topographical arrangement. In sum, we reliably describe one facet of the macroscale functional organization of the brain, with respect to spatial and temporal dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>INT hierarchies</title><p>First, we set out to replicate and validate findings from electrophysiological INT estimation with ultrahigh field fMRI. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murray et al., 2014</xref> initially described (in macaques) a visual cortical hierarchy of seven cortical areas: middle temporal (MT) area, lateral intraparietal (LIP) area, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), lateral PFC (LPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC); and a somatosensory hierarchy including primary somatosensory (S1) and secondary somatosensory (S2) cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâB</xref>, left). This cortical hierarchy has been replicated and further extended by assigning INTs to the dorsal premotor (PMd) cortex, frontopolar cortex (PFp), ventral and dorsal LPFC (VLPFC and DLPFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavanagh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cirillo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fascianelli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâD</xref>, left).

The areas were defined bilaterally for each panel to match the recording sites of the data setâthe Cortical Hierarchy Atlas of the Rhesus Macaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jung et al., 2021</xref>) and Subcortical Atlas of the Rhesus Macaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hartig et al., 2021</xref>) were used when possible (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The hemodynamic INTs were estimated as the sum of the autocorrelation function (ACF) values in the initial positive periodâthat is, this measurement considers both the number of lags and the magnitude of the ACF values. Hence, the INT does not have a time unit and it is used as a proxy of the timescale of that area, with higher values reflecting longer timescales.

By replicating these physiological hierarchies, we demonstrate that fMRI is well-suited to investigate aspects of whole-brain temporal dynamics. Minor deviations from hierarchies estimated from single-unit recordings (e.g., in STN, sgACC, and pgACC) can be attributed to several factors such as a high degree of INT heterogeneity within these regions, and differences between studies in the atlases used and size of the areas under investigation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref> for the INT stability analysis).</p><p>Our definition of INTs combines the effects of ACF magnitude and timescale (i.e., the 0-crossing lag). Since it has previously been shown that the magnitude of the ACF values, parameterized as the lag-1 ACF value, differs across brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shinn et al., 2021</xref>), we further examined whether the observed hierarchies are driven by magnitude, timescale, or both. In line with previous results, the lag-1 ACF values systematically varied across the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shinn et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, the lag-1 ACF values and the 0-crossing lag were linearly related to INTs as operationalized in this study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> for voxel-wise whole-brain maps of the lag-1, 0-crossing lag, and INTs). The maps suggest that magnitude and timescale are closely related. To exclude the possibility that the observed hierarchies are driven by magnitude, rather than timescale, we re-computed them by using the 0-crossing lag as a proxy for INT. To obtain a time estimate of hemodynamic timescales, the 0-lag crossing lag was multiplied by the TR (i.e., 1.1 s). The hierarchical ordering of both cortical and subcortical areas is consistent (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>) with that based on our INT measure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Hence, while the ACF magnitude is closely related to our INT index and the 0-crossing lag, temporal hierarchies are not driven by heterogeneity in the ACF magnitude.</p><p>We next investigated previously unexamined regions, making unique use of our high resolution, whole-brain coverage. Specifically, we reveal a hierarchy of INTs in the dorsal visual pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodale et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goodale and Milner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). INTs gradually increase from the entry point of visual information to higher-order areas involved in visuo-motor integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, inset). INTs are hierarchically organized within the occipito-parietal, parieto-premotor, and parieto-prefrontal components of the dorsal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kravitz et al., 2011</xref>). Also, in line with the occipito-parietal pathway being the source of the other two pathways, it is lower in the hierarchy. Taken together, we replicate electrophysiological INT hierarchies and demonstrate the invaluable contribution of using whole-brain fMRI to extend this research by describing a previously uncharacterized fine-grained temporal hierarchy along the visual pathway as an example.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reveals a hierarchical ordering of timescales in the dorsal pathway for visuospatial processing.</title><p>Group-averaged (N=9) intrinsic neural timescales (INTs) were estimated for each area of interest by averaging across voxels.

However, until this point, there have been major gaps in investigating temporal integration across the brain, across species, and across populations. This is because, traditionally, temporal integration has been studied primarily using single-unit electrophysiology in NHPs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). Although there is some evidence that BOLD signals from fMRI may allow for whole-brain interrogation of timescales in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watanabe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wengler et al., 2020</xref>), such an approach had not yet been validated. Here, we focused on investigating whole-brain INT and FC topographies at different levels of description, to first validate, within-species, the study of INTs using BOLD fMRI, and then investigate the relationship between temporal and spatial dynamics of the resting brain with ultrahigh resolution fMRI across the whole macaque brain.</p><p>We have demonstrated the feasibility of estimating INTs from fMRI in the NHP brain. We did so by showing that hemodynamic INT hierarchies closely match those derived from NHP electrophysiology. While some recent human neuroimaging studies have investigated whole-brain hemodynamic INTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raut et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watanabe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wengler et al., 2020</xref>), temporal hierarchies derived from electrophysiology have not been replicated via fMRI, nor within species. Furthermore, in a previous paper, INTs derived from fMRI data in human subjects were elegantly validated with EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watanabe et al., 2019</xref>). The present findings are in agreement with these results, finding slower and faster INTs in frontoparietal areas and sensory-related areas, respectively. This points toward cross-species homologies in cortical INTs, hence, laying the groundwork for future translational work. Nevertheless, the step presented here is essential, because we were able to demonstrate the equivalence of the fMRI estimates of INT hierarchies with single-neuron spiking results within the same species. This finding provides validation for the complementary use of hemodynamic and electrophysiological INTs. Using fMRI in this context has several advantages. First, it can be performed on the whole brain. Second, it can easily be employed across different human populations in the future, dramatically expanding the possible uses of INT investigations.</p><p>We did observe minor deviations from electrophysiological INTs in our data. These may be in large part attributable to a high degree of INT heterogeneity within individual anatomical regions. This observation is in line with previous reports of heterogeneity within neural populations in single-unit recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cirillo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nougaret et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that averaging INTs within anatomical regions might not provide a full description of macroscale organization.</p><p>It is worth noting that the current study could not resolve the exact correspondence between the time constants estimated from spiking activity and BOLD. The relationship between neural activity and the BOLD signal has been revealed via simultaneous electrophysiological-fMRI recordingâthat is, a spatially localized increase in the fMRI signal directly and monotonically reflects an increase in neural activity, with the mean onset time of the BOLD signal relative to the neural activation being 2 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>). As a result of sensory stimulation, BOLD signal is delayed by ~2â3 s, followed by a ramp of 6â12 s to a plateau or peak value. Local field potentials (LFPs), and to a lesser extent multiunit activity, can predict the BOLD signal when convolved with the neuro-vascular impulse response function. In sum, the hemodynamic response is roughly a low-pass-filtered expression of the total neural activity; with LFPs, however, having a greater contribution to the signal. This has several implications for the interpretation of hemodynamic timescales: (1) they are more likely to reflect timescales related to LFPs rather than spiking activity; (2) the time constants estimated from spiking activity might not be linearly related to those estimated from fMRI. A further complication for the interpretability of hemodynamic timescales is that INTs have only been estimated from spiking activity, but not LFPs. The exact relationship between timescales derived from spiking activity, LFPs and the BOLD signal remains an empirical question. We hypothesize that hemodynamic timescales generally increase monotonically with those estimated from electrophysiology. In that respect, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watanabe et al., 2019</xref> bring preliminary evidenceâthat is, timescales derived from electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI have been shown to differ by 2 orders of magnitude. This is reasonable considering the BOLD time courseâwhen convolved with the hemodynamic response function, the INTs estimated from EEG were similar in magnitude to those estimated from fMRI. Nevertheless, we show that temporal hierarchies are a general principle of organization, irrespective of the method used to estimate them.</p><p>To further demonstrate the potential of INTs estimated from fMRI, we extend the current literature by providing a finer description of the hierarchy of visual INTs compared to those previously described with electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murray et al., 2014</xref>). Remarkably, areas along the dorsal visual pathway follow the INT hierarchical ordering predicted by functional specialization and connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kravitz et al., 2011</xref>), with primary visual areas showing the fastest timescales and prefrontal areas showing the longest. Our findings bring further evidence that the dorsal pathway is not a unitary system, but rather subdivided into multiple parallel pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Binkofski and Buxbaum, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kravitz et al., 2011</xref>). This demonstrates the importance of fine-grained, large-scale descriptions of the brain for uncovering multiple hierarchies.</p><p>We investigated timescales and connectivity topographies at different levels of description to probe whether one aspect of the multidimensional functional architecture of the brain is related to temporal structure. We show that INT topographies are closely related to the overlapping FC gradient dimensions. Previous studies have demonstrated that FC gradient dimensions in sensory cortex corresponded with known organizational principles such as eccentricity and polar angle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haak et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, FC gradients followed M1âs somatotopic map. Our findings put forward a significantly more unified framework that generalizes over the entire brain. INTs form a topographic organizational principle ranging from sensory to associative cortex. While other organizational principles can and likely always will be represented across topographic networks of the brain, intrinsic timescales appear to be special in their general extent.</p><p>It is noteworthy that there are crucial methodological differences between the gradient and INT estimation approaches: (1) the gradient estimation pipeline consists of multiple steps to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and consequently, the amount of noise (e.g., the FC matrix was made sparse; applying the cosine similarity kernel to build an affinity matrix; and applying a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique to estimate the gradients); (2) the gradients were estimated bilaterally. In comparison to gradients, where the spatial correlation between the voxelsâ time series is just the initial step in the pipeline, the INT measure consists of the temporal autocorrelation of individual voxels. No extra steps have been taken for noise reduction. Hence, while gradients are the result of a complex processing pipeline, INTs are a relatively simple calculation. As a result, there is a higher amount of variability in the INT maps which could potentially lead to the underestimation of the FC-INT relationship. With respect to the second point, the symmetry of the gradients could be a byproduct of estimating the gradients bilaterally. Other studies e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Przezdzik et al., 2019</xref> have derived gradients for each hemisphere individually and no major asymmetries have been reported. We estimated the gradients bilaterally because of an issue that is inherent with experimental ultrahigh fields. Specifically, RF transmit field (or B1) inhomogeneities lead to asymmetric signal intensities. We were worried that these effects might introduce asymmetries between the two hemispheres. We have reason to believe that this issue is partially being taken care of by estimating the gradients bilaterally, but the INTs are still susceptible to these effects. This could also result in the underestimation of the FC-INT relationship since there are visible asymmetries in the INT maps.</p><p>One potential limitation of the current study is using anesthetized subjects. Although obtaining high-resolution images of awake NHPs at ultrahigh fields would be ideal, it is still an enormous technical challenge that the field is working to overcome. Using our low anesthesia strategy, we were able to obtain a relatively large sample size of NHPs (because extensive training was not required). It is important to note that it was previously shown that our anesthesia protocol demonstrates no observable biases to whole-brain connectivity analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yacoub et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that this protocol has a relatively low impact on reproducibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Autio et al., 2021</xref>). To our knowledge, the largest effect of vasodilative anesthetics (such as isoflurane) is an overall blunting of responses which is counteracted by ultrahigh field MRI. Finally, besides the possible effects on the hemodynamic response, anesthesia introduces a crucial difference between the current study and previous researchâwhile in previous studies, it was not controlled for the subjects engaging in various cognitive processes, in anesthetized subjects, this confound is potentially removed. Overall, future research should replicate current results to exclude a possible effect of anesthesia.</p><p>We show that resting-state fMRI in NHPs is crucial for bridging the gap between human and animal models, but also across the various techniques of investigating the brain. Nevertheless, macaques have a disadvantage as a model organism for fMRI because of their small head size (~6% of the human brain) which makes the use of standard field strength magnets problematic for acquiring high-resolution data. As a result, collecting high-resolution, high SNR whole-brain data has been extremely difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yacoub et al., 2020</xref>). We show here that one way of overcoming this problem is to use ultrahigh field strengths in combination with high channel count receiver arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lagore et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">UÄurbil et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yacoub et al., 2020</xref>). Ultrahigh magnetic fields not only enhance SNR but also increase the BOLD contrast, especially for the microvascular BOLD contributionsâwhich leads to mapping signals with higher precision to sites of neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ugurbil, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">UÄurbil, 2018</xref>). In conclusion, our unique approach made it possible to obtain whole-brain high-resolution data to investigate FC and INTs across both cortical and subcortical structures.</p><p>INTs, like AC and FC, are one way of characterizing the organization of the brain. Critically, combined maps of all three will require a nonhuman animal model such as the macaque, as AC cannot be directly measured in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grier et al., 2020</xref>). It is clear that AC, FC, and INTs are related, although the precise nature of the relationships is somewhat speculative. For instance, vertex FC strength is related to human INTs estimated from fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raut et al., 2020</xref>). Our own results show that cortico-striatal INTs and FC gradients broadly track AC. AC establishes the pathways which the signals underpinning FC use. However, the fact that the pathways exist and are used does not tell us what types of information transformations occur along the way. Through cascaded processing, longer and longer TRWs can be built, measured as longer INTs. Thus, we expect that the space of potential INTs is constrained by both AC and FC. Future exploration of these organizational principles, including using pharmacological interventions and electrical stimulation, will likely clarify the causal relationships at play.</p><p>We show that INTs are topographically organized along FC gradients throughout the NHP brain. Although we focused our analysis on the frontal and parietal lobes, and the striatum, we also showed that a whole-brain analysis recapitulates the same conclusion: resting-state temporal and spatial dynamics are closely related. Future investigations should examine this relationship in other cortical and subcortical brain areas. A promising avenue would be to examine the FC-INT link throughout the brain across different levels of parcellation (and different types of parcellations). While we show that intrinsic timescales are related to FC, other studies have related them to other anatomical and functional markers (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ito et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watanabe et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, further investigations and careful experimentation are needed to understand (1) how temporal dynamics relate to other functional and anatomical characteristics across the brain; (2) their functional relevance and translational potential.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal preparation</title><p>We obtained data from nine adult macaque monkeys (<italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>: five female, and <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>, three male and one female).

A custom in-house built and designed RF coil with an 8-channel transmit/receive end-loaded dipole array of 18-cm length (individually) combined with a close-fitting 16-channel loop receive array head cap, and an 8-channel loop receive array of 50Ã100 mm<sup>2</sup> size located under the chin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lagore et al., 2021</xref>). The size of 14 individual receive loops of the head cap was 37 mm with two larger ear loops of 80 mmâall receiver loops were arranged in an overlapping configuration for nearest neighbor decoupling. The resulting combined 32 receive channels were used for all experiments and supported threefold acceleration in phase encoding direction. The coil holder was designed to be a semi-stereotaxic instrument holding the head of the animal in a centered sphinx position via customized ear bars. The receive elements were modeled to adhere as close to the surface of the animalâs skulls as possible. Transmit phases for the individual transmit channels were fine-tuned for excitation uniformity for one representative mid-sized animal and the calculated phases were then used for all subsequent acquisitions. Magnetic field homogenization (B0 shimming) was performed using a customized field of view with the Siemens internal 3D mapping routines. Multiple iterations of the shims (using the adjusted FOV shim parameters) were performed, and further fine adjustment was performed manually on each animal. Third-order shim elements were ignored for these procedures.</p><p>In all animals, a B1+ (transmit B1) fieldmap was acquired using a vendor provided flip angle mapping sequence and then power calibrated for each individual.

At the single-subject level, the INT of each voxel was quantified as follows. For each run, the ACF of each voxelâs fMRI signal was estimated. The ACF is the correlation of y<sub>t</sub> (time series) and y<sub>t+k</sub> (lagged time series), where k represents the time lag in steps of TR. Next, the sum of ACF values was calculated in the initial positive period. The upper limit of this period was set at the point where the ACF first becomes negative as the time lag increases. The result was used as an index of the INT of the brain region. At the single-subject level, the number of INT maps was dependent on the number of functional runs. The maps were not smoothed, because individual variation in FC gradients and INTs has been shown to have functional significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Przezdzik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Watanabe et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To examine the correspondence between fMRI-based and electrophysiology-based INT hierarchies, the values of individual voxels were averaged within areas.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Daeyeol Lee as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Effects of anesthesia. Compared to previous human neuroimaging studies and NHP electrophysiological experiments, a significant weakness of this study is that the experiments were performed in anesthetized animals. This is even more problematic, since the analyses in this study mostly focus on the fronto-parietal network, which might be more affected by anesthetics. Although it has been shown that the FC can be studied in anesthetized animals, how specific methods of anesthesia might influence by the measures of INT should be discussed more thoroughly.</p><p>2. INT measure. They authors put forth the INT measure as related to intrinsic timescale. INT is defined as the integrated area under the autocorrelation function (ACF) up until the first point where the ACF goes below zero. This is different than how intrinsic timescale has been measured in single-neuron spike trains or in prior fMRI studies. While a longer timescale would be expected to increase INT, the problem is that INT (as an integrated area) combines effects of autocorrelation timescale and autocorrelation amplitude.</p><p>â It would be insightful to visualize INT properties at the whole-brain or whole-cortex level (instead of only a single lobe), including (i) INT values themselves, (ii) the lag-one autcorrelation value reflecting autocorrelation amplitude, and (iii) the zero-crossing lag time used to compute INT.</p><p>â A highly relevant paper (which is not currently cited) is Ito et al., (2020) NeuroImage, &quot;A cortical hierarchy of localized and distributed processes revealed via dissociation of task activations, connectivity changes, and intrinsic timescales&quot;. Figure 5 of Ito shows a cortex-wide map of intrinsic timescale as defined in single-neuron studies (i.e. fitting time constant of decay). Figure 6 then shows this is related to cortical hierarchy as reflected in the T1w/T2w map (which in principle could be tested by the authors here too). Ito's analysis was performed on the parcellated timeseries, not the voxel level as in the present study, which is a notable methodological difference.</p><p>â That INT combines effects of timescale and amplitude would not be a problem if the autocorrelation amplitude does not vary across brain regions. However, it appears that it does for whatever reasons (neural and/or in fMRI measurement such as SNR). A relevant preprint is by Shinn et al., (2021) bioRxiv, âSpatial and temporal autocorrelation weave human brain networksâ. In human cortex, again using parcellated timeseries, Figure 1F there shows systematic variation across cortical parcels of the lag-1 autocorrelation value. In the present study, it is currently unknown whether INT is reflecting regional differences in autocorrelation timescale (as interpreted), amplitude (not considered), or both.</p><p>â Contribution of autocorrelation amplitude to INT may potentially explain why a cortex-wide map of INT does not follow an expected hierarchy as much the more restricted views within one lobe as the current manuscript focuses. For instance, Figure 1 shows that INT values for somatosensory cortex (Figure 1A) are larger than association regions (Figure 1B). Is this potentially due to autocorrelation amplitude being larger in somatosensory cortex?</p><p>â Perhaps some smoothing or parcellation would be required to better tease apart autocorrelation timescale from autocorrelation amplitude.</p><p>â A highly relevant paper (which is not currently cited) is Ito et al., (2020) NeuroImage, &quot;A cortical hierarchy of localized and distributed processes revealed via dissociation of task activations, connectivity changes, and intrinsic timescales&quot;.

Does the calculation of fMRI-based neuronal time constants obscure the unit of time? True comparison with ephys data is not possible without clarifying the relationship of the two quantities compared. In the ephys measurements time constants are in units of seconds and often below 1s. In contrast, BOLD response has a sluggish time course (tens of seconds) due to the properties of the hemodynamic response function. The smoothing of spiking and field-potential activity with the HRF introduces substantial auto-correlation in BOLD and is expected to reduce our ability to distinguish small differences of time constants discovered with ephys. Because the analyses in this paper do not explore the complications caused by the slow and noisy BOLD measurements, it is impossible to know if the observed temporal hierarchy has the same nature and origin as those reported with ephys. It would be useful to perform additional analyses and modeling that clarifies this missing link. If that is not possible, at the very least I would recommend explicit reporting of the units of time constants based on BOLD in the figures, and discussing if the differences of BOLD time constants across regions match the differences of spiking activity time constants in previous publications. Also, throughout the paper, figures should clearly indicate the unit for INT.</p><p>4. Functional connectivity gradients: Figures 3 and 4 rely on functional connectivity gradients calculated within a single lobe, against which INT topography is correlated. On such a restricted geometry as a single lobe, a functional connectivity gradient may be reflecting a simpler property, namely the geometry of the restricted cortical sheet. In other words, given the sheet geometry of the frontal lobe, does an anterior-posterior topography fall out naturally as the first gradient (e.g. with distance-dependent falloff) and medial-lateral as second gradient? If so, it is difficult to strongly interpret these results as linking INT to functional connectivity when the gradient is a generic consequence of the sheet geometry. In human neuroimaging such functional gradients are typically calculated at the whole-cortex level which reveals less trivial topographies (e.g. Margulies et al., 2016, PNAS). These results and interpretations should be considered in light of this concern.</p><p>5. There is no strong relationship between within area FC and INT maps in figure 4. Unlike the FC maps that seem to monotonically change along a cortical axis, the INT maps seem to have non-monotonic changes. For example, the INT map for OFC has maximum values both in the anterior-medial and caudal-lateral regions. Similar discrepancies between the INT and FC maps are apparent for PFC. Also, unlike the FC maps, the INT maps seem asymmetrical in the two hemispheres. Unfortunately, the visualization and stats are too dense to probe what is going on.

Either way, the authors are encouraged to improve their presentation method and analyses in order to provide adequate information for readers. One possibility is to use old-fashioned scatter plots with error bars, where individual data points are different locations within the striatum and the axes are striatal INTs and cortico-striatal INTs.

Effects of anesthesia. Compared to previous human neuroimaging studies and NHP electrophysiological experiments, a significant weakness of this study is that the experiments were performed in anesthetized animals. This is even more problematic, since the analyses in this study mostly focus on the fronto-parietal network, which might be more affected by anesthetics. Although it has been shown that the FC can be studied in anesthetized animals, how specific methods of anesthesia might influence by the measures of INT should be discussed more thoroughly.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise an important question and concern, and we would like to apologize for this omission. In a previous paper from our lab (Yacoub et al., 2020) we were able to demonstrate that our low isoflurane + dexamethasone (Autio et al., 2021)ng autocorrelation amplitude, and (iii) the zero-crossing la anesthesia demonstrates no observable biases to whole brain connectivity analysis, and stimulation experiments in our lab (unpublished) demonstrate non altered hemodynamic response function properties. In fact, hemodynamic properties seem to be significantly more affected by the common use of contrast agents such as ferromolecules (Pelekanos et al., 2020). In our experience, the largest effect of vasodilative anesthetics (such as isoflurane) is an overall blunting of responses which the use of ultrahigh magnetic fields counteracts. We have added the following paragraph to the discussion of the manuscript for transparency:</p><p>âOne potential limitation of the current study is using anesthetized subjects. Although obtaining high resolution images of awake NHPs at ultrahigh fields would be ideal, it is still an enormous technical challenge that the field is working to overcome. Using our low anesthesia strategy, we were able to obtain a relatively large sample size of NHPs (because extensive training was not required). It is important to note that it was previously shown that our anesthesia protocol demonstrates no observable biases to whole-brain connectivity analysis (Yacoub et al., 2020). Moreover, it has been shown that this protocol has a relatively low impact on reproducibility (Autio et al., 2021). To our knowledge, the largest effect of vasodilative anesthetics (such as isoflurane) is an overall blunting of responses which is counteracted by ultrahigh field MRI. Finally, besides the possible effects on the hemodynamic response, anesthesia introduces a crucial difference between the current study and previous research â while in previous studies it was not controlled for the subjects engaging in various cognitive processes, in anesthetized subjects, this confound is potentially removed. Overall, future research should replicate current results to exclude a possible effect of anesthesia.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. INT measure. They authors put forth the INT measure as related to intrinsic timescale. INT is defined as the integrated area under the autocorrelation function (ACF) up until the first point where the ACF goes below zero. This is different than how intrinsic timescale has been measured in single-neuron spike trains or in prior fMRI studies. While a longer timescale would be expected to increase INT, the problem is that INT (as an integrated area) combines effects of autocorrelation timescale and autocorrelation amplitude.</p><p>â It would be insightful to visualize INT properties at the whole-brain or whole-cortex level (instead of only a single lobe), including (i) INT values themselves, (ii) the lag-one autcorrelation value reflecting autocorrelation amplitude, and (iii) the zero-crossing lag time used to compute INT.</p><p>â A highly relevant paper (which is not currently cited) is Ito et al., (2020) NeuroImage, &quot;A cortical hierarchy of localized and distributed processes revealed via dissociation of task activations, connectivity changes, and intrinsic timescales&quot;. Figure 5 of Ito shows a cortex-wide map of intrinsic timescale as defined in single-neuron studies (i.e. fitting time constant of decay). Figure 6 then shows this is related to cortical hierarchy as reflected in the T1w/T2w map (which in principle could be tested by the authors here too). Ito's analysis was performed on the parcellated timeseries, not the voxel level as in the present study, which is a notable methodological difference.</p><p>â That INT combines effects of timescale and amplitude would not be a problem if the autocorrelation amplitude does not vary across brain regions. However, it appears that it does for whatever reasons (neural and/or in fMRI measurement such as SNR). A relevant preprint is by Shinn et al., (2021) bioRxiv, &quot;Spatial and temporal autocorrelation weave human brain networks&quot;. In human cortex, again using parcellated timeseries, Figure 1F there shows systematic variation across cortical parcels of the lag-1 autocorrelation value. In the present study, it is currently unknown whether INT is reflecting regional differences in autocorrelation timescale (as interpreted), amplitude (not considered), or both.</p><p>â Contribution of autocorrelation amplitude to INT may potentially explain why a cortex-wide map of INT does not follow an expected hierarchy as much the more restricted views within one lobe as the current manuscript focuses. For instance, Figure 1 shows that INT values for somatosensory cortex (Figure 1A) are larger than association regions (Figure 1B). Is this potentially due to autocorrelation amplitude being larger in somatosensory cortex?</p><p>â Perhaps some smoothing or parcellation would be required to better tease apart autocorrelation timescale from autocorrelation amplitude.</p></disp-quote><p>The possible confounding effect of a systematic regional variation of ACF amplitude is an important consideration that we have overlooked and thank the reviewers for pointing out. To further examine this issue: (1) we plotted whole-brain INTs, lag-1, and 0-crossing lag (see Figure 1 Supplement 1); (2) correlated the maps; (3) re-computed the hierarchies by using the 0crossing lag multiplied by the TR (i.e., to obtain a time estimate; see Figure 1 Supplement 2). In this study, while the amplitude as reflected by the lag-1 ACF value varies across the brain, it is not dissociated from the timescale as reflected by the 0-crossing lag. The three voxel-wise maps are highly correlated (Pearsonâs r &gt; 0.90) and re-computing the hierarchies by only using the 0-crossing lag does not change the relative âtemporalâ position of the various areas. Notably, the variations in the lag-1 ACF value were small, with values ranging from 0.92 to 0.95 for subcortical and 0.92 and 0.97 for cortical voxels. In consequence, it is not surprising that the hierarchies are not impacted by removing the amplitude of the ACF values from the INT measure. We thus extend the findings by Shinn et al., (2021) by showing that the lag-1 ACF value is closely related to our INT measure as well. Compared to solely using the lag-1 ACF value, our INT measure can be used to estimate the time constants of the various areas as reflected by BOLD, an added benefit in our opinion.</p><p>In contrast to previous studies, we decided to use this INT measure for two reasons: (1) it has already been validated via simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings by Wanatabe and Masuda (2019); (2) we avoided curve fitting to reduce the adverse effects of the low sampling rate of fMRI recordings.</p><p>To clarify these important points to the reader, we added Supplement 1 and 2 to Figure 1. Moreover, we added the following paragraph to the Results section:</p><p>âOur definition of INTs combines the effects of ACF magnitude and timescale (i.e., the 0-crossing lag). Since it has previously been shown that the magnitude of the ACF values, parameterized as the lag-1 ACF value, differs across brain areas (Shinn et al., 2021), we further examined whether the observed hierarchies are driven by magnitude, timescale, or both. In line with previous results, the lag-1 ACF values systematically varied across the brain (Shinn et al., 2021). Moreover, the lag-1 ACF values and the 0-crossing lag were linearly related to INTs as operationalized in this study (see Figure 1 Supplement 1 for voxel-wise whole-brain maps of the lag-1, 0-crossing lag and INTs). The maps suggest that magnitude and timescale are closely related. To exclude the possibility that the observed hierarchies are driven by magnitude, rather than timescale, we recomputed them by using the 0-crossing lag as a proxy for INT. To obtain a time estimate of hemodynamic timescales, the 0-lag crossing lag was multiplied by the TR (i.e., 1.1s). The hierarchical ordering of both cortical and subcortical areas is consistent (see Figure 1 Supplement 2) with that based on our INT measure (see Figure 1). Hence, while the ACF magnitude is closely related to our INT index and the 0-crossing lag, temporal hierarchies are not driven by heterogeneity in the ACF magnitude.â</p><p>The reviewers bring up another interesting point about T1/T2(*) weighted anatomical images and their potential relationship to our findings. While we have acquired T2 weighted images in most of our animals they are unfortunately not purely T2 but rather a variable flip angle approach. This approach was taken due to technical difficulties porting standard sequences to our 10.5T instrument. We have recently made additional progress on allowing âpurerâ T2 TSE images, but for this dataset, we do not have the correct modalities available. We hope we can provide that in the future. We think there are multiple interesting parameters that should be examined in the future for their relationship with INTs, including T1/T2(*) as well as other neuroimaging and histologically derived measures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â A highly relevant paper (which is not currently cited) is Ito et al., (2020) NeuroImage, &quot;A cortical hierarchy of localized and distributed processes revealed via dissociation of task activations, connectivity changes, and intrinsic timescales&quot;.

Watanabe and Masuda (2019) have shown that hemodynamic INTs differ by two orders of magnitude from those estimated from EEG. We hypothesize a similar relationship, but it is very unlikely that the hemodynamic INTs reflect only what has been previously estimated based on spiking activity. For transparency, we are adding the following paragraph to the Discussion:</p><p>âIt is worth noting that the current study could not resolve the exact correspondence between the time constants estimated from spiking activity and BOLD. The relationship between neural activity and the BOLD signal has been revealed via simultaneous electrophysiological-fMRI recording-i.e., a spatially localized increase in the fMRI signal directly and monotonically reflects an increase in neural activity, with the mean onset time of the BOLD signal relative to the neural activation being 2s (Logothetis, Pauls, Augath, Trinath, and Oeltermann, 2001). As a result of sensory stimulation, BOLD signal is delayed by ~ 2-3 s, followed by a ramp of 6-12 s to a plateau or peak value. Local field potentials (LFPs), and to a lesser extent multi-unit activity (MUAs), can predict the BOLD signal when convolved with the neuro-vascular impulse response function. In sum, the hemodynamic response is roughly a low-pass-filtered expression of the total neural activity; with LFPs however, having a greater contribution to the signal. This has several implications for the interpretation of hemodynamic timescales: (1) they are more likely to reflect timescales related to LFPs rather than spiking activity; (2) the time constants estimated from spiking activity might not be linearly related to those estimated from fMRI. A further complication for the interpretability of hemodynamic timescales is that INTs have only been estimated from spiking activity, but not LFPs. The exact relationship between timescales derived from spiking activity, LFPs and the BOLD signal remains an empirical question. We hypothesize that hemodynamic timescales generally increase monotonically with those estimated from electrophysiology. In that respect, Watanabe and Masuda (2019) bring preliminary evidence â i.e., timescales derived from electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI have been shown to differ by two orders of magnitude. This is reasonable considering the BOLD time course-when convolved with the hemodynamic response function, the INTs estimated from EEG were similar in magnitude to those estimated from fMRI. Nevertheless, we show that temporal hierarchies are a general principle of organization, irrespective of the method used to estimate them.â</p><p>Moreover, we have estimated the hemodynamic time constants by multiplying the 0-crossing lag by the TR. With those results in hand, we have re-computed the INT hierarchies from Figure 1 (see Figure 1 Supplement 2) to get an estimate for the areas that have been previously investigated with electrophysiology. With respect to the unit for INT, since the hemodynamic INTs were estimated as the sum of the ACF values in the initial positive period (our measure of INT considers both the number of lags and the magnitude of the ACF values), the INT does not have a time unit and it is used as a proxy of the timescale of that area, with higher values reflecting longer timescale. (See Figure 1 Supplement 2 for an estimate of the time constant of each area). To make this clear throughout the manuscript, we added the following paragraph to the Methods section and in the figure captions throughout the manuscript.</p><p>âSince the hemodynamic INTs were estimated as the sum of ACF values in the initial positive period, this measurement considers both the number of lags and the magnitude of the ACF values. As a result, the INT does not have a time unit and it is used as a proxy of the timescale of that area, with higher values reflecting longer timescales. We have nonetheless estimated the time constants associated with the INT hierarchies that have been previously described with electrophysiological recordings by multiplying the 0-crossing lag by the TR (see Figure 1 Supplement 2 for an estimate of the time constants).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Functional connectivity gradients: Figures 3 and 4 rely on functional connectivity gradients calculated within a single lobe, against which INT topography is correlated. On such a restricted geometry as a single lobe, a functional connectivity gradient may be reflecting a simpler property, namely the geometry of the restricted cortical sheet. In other words, given the sheet geometry of the frontal lobe, does an anterior-posterior topography fall out naturally as the first gradient (e.g. with distance-dependent falloff) and medial-lateral as second gradient? If so, it is difficult to strongly interpret these results as linking INT to functional connectivity when the gradient is a generic consequence of the sheet geometry. In human neuroimaging such functional gradients are typically calculated at the whole-cortex level which reveals less trivial topographies (e.g. Margulies et al., 2016, PNAS). These results and interpretations should be considered in light of this concern.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this insightful comment and question. Although previous studies have applied gradient approaches to the whole-brain, we avoided this approach for two reasons: (1) this is usually achieved by considerably downsampling the data, which would erase the spatial resolution provided by the ultra-high field; (2) the result would reflect the overall inter-areal connectivity differences, since inter-areal connectivity patterns are generally more pronounced than intra-areal patterns, rather than the fine-grained connectivity patterns within the individual areas. With respect to the first point, downsampling the data would potentially blur import functional details. It has been previously shown that gradients estimated for smaller regions of interest uncover important functional details across individuals â and even more, these gradients cand predict performance (PrzeÅºdzik, Faber, FernÃ¡ndez, Beckmann, and Haak, 2019). With respect to the second point, we were not interested in capturing large-scale modes of connectivity change, but rather the functional organization of individual areas.</p><p>To address the comment raised by the reviewers, we parcellated the brain using the 6<sup>th</sup> level (most fine grained) of the CHARM (Jung et al., 2021), and we calculated the FC matrix using the resulting timeseries. This resulted in a 134x134 FC matrix. This was used as input to our pipeline of estimating gradients. While the first gradient reflected an overall anterior-posterior axis of connectivity change, the second gradient captured the change in whole-brain INTs. (Pearsonâs r = 0.70; see Figure 3 Supplement 1). We therefore conclude that the whole-brain result supports our initially proposed interpretation.</p><p>In addition to the addition of Figure 3 Supplement 1, we add the following paragraph to the Results section:</p><p>âAlthough we were mainly interested in the fine-grained functional organization of individual areas, we asked whether the INT-FC relationship holds at the whole-cortex level (see Figure 3 Supplement 1). It is important to note that the whole-cortex estimation reflects overall inter-areal FC differences rather than the fine-grained FC patterns in smaller areas; that is because inter-areal connectivity differences are more pronounced than intra-areal differences. The whole-cortex INT map was highly correlated with the second gradient estimated from the cortical FC matrix (r = 0.70). With these results in hand, we conclude that INTs and FC gradients are closely related and represent a functional principle of organization across the cortex.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. There is no strong relationship between within area FC and INT maps in figure 4. Unlike the FC maps that seem to monotonically change along a cortical axis, the INT maps seem to have non-monotonic changes.

Deeper analyses and explanation are necessary (please see the next comment for a potential solution).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment and agree with the assessment. It is important to note that there are crucial differences between the gradient and INT estimation approaches: (1) the gradient estimation pipeline consists of several steps that significantly reduce noise (e.g., the connectivity matrix was made sparse; applying the cosine similarity kernel to build an affinity matrix; and applying a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique to estimate the gradients); (2) the gradients were estimated bilaterally. With respect to the first point, the INT estimation in comparison was done for each voxel individually and no follow-up noise reduction steps have been applied. Previous studies have smoothed the resulting INT maps, but we have decided not to do so since it could erase important functional details. Hence, while the gradients are the result of several processing steps, INTs are a relatively straightforward measure. As a result, the gradient maps appear smooth while the INT maps may appear more variable from voxel to voxel. With respect to the second point, the symmetry of the gradients (although not always present, e.g., see Figure 4C) could be a result of estimating the gradients bilaterally. Other studies (Haak, Marquand, and Beckmann, 2018; PrzeÅºdzik et al., 2019) have derived the gradients for each hemisphere individually and no major asymmetries have been reported. Nevertheless, this could be a future avenue for further investigating the relationship between INTs and FC gradients. We have decided to estimate the gradients bilaterally because of some of the issues that are inherent with ultrahigh fields. RF transmit field (or B1) inhomogeneities is one of the major drawbacks of high field MRI, even with our high number of transmit channels. The inhomogeneity is a cause for regions of increase and decreased signal intensity in the data. We were worried that these effects might introduce asymmetries between the two hemispheres. We have reason to believe that this issue is partially being taken care of by estimating the gradients bilaterally, but the INTs are still susceptible to these effects. As a result, we believe that the correspondence between INTs and FC gradients might in fact be underestimated in this study. In future studies, we hope to perform full B1 shimming to counteract these shortcomings, but for safety reasons (energy deposition was only modeled for fixed phases of our coil), we did not have that ability before.</p><p>For transparency and better interpretation, we added supplementary plots that show that the overall direction of FC and INT change is similar when the values are averaged according to functional subdivisions of the areas under consideration (see Figure 4 Supplement 1; Figure 5 Supplement 1). Additionally, we have worked on the presentation of the INT and FC gradient maps (see the new versions of Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 4 Supplement 2). We are also adding the following paragraph to the discussion of the manuscript:</p><p>âIt is noteworthy that there are crucial methodological differences between the gradient and INT estimation approaches: (1) the gradient estimation pipeline consists of multiple steps to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and consequently, the amount of noise (e.g., the FC matrix was made sparse; applying the cosine similarity kernel to build an affinity matrix; and applying a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique to estimate the gradients); (2) the gradients were estimated bilaterally. In comparison to gradients, where the spatial correlation between the voxelsâ time series is just the initial step in the pipeline, the INT measure consists of the temporal autocorrelation of individual voxels. No extra steps have been taken for noise reduction. Hence, while gradients are the result of a complex processing pipeline, INTs are a relatively simple calculation. As a result, there is a higher amount of variability in the INT maps which could potentially lead to the underestimation of the FC-INT relationship. With respect to the second point, the symmetry of the gradients could be a byproduct of estimating the gradients bilaterally. Other studies (e.g., Haak et al., 2018; PrzeÅºdzik et al., 2019) have derived gradients for each hemisphere individually and no major asymmetries have been reported. We estimated the gradients bilaterally because of an issue that is inherent with experimental ultrahigh fields. Specifically, RF transmit field (or B1) inhomogeneities lead to asymmetric signal intensities. We were worried that these effects might introduce asymmetries between the two hemispheres. We have reason to believe that this issue is partially being taken care of by estimating the gradients bilaterally, but the INTs are still susceptible to these effects. This could also result in the underestimation of the FC-INT relationship since there are visible asymmetries in the INT maps.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.
