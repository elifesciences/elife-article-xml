been licensed targeting virus-encoded ion channels, or ‘viroporins’, contrasting the success of channel blocking drugs in other areas of medicine. Although resistance arose to these prototypic adamantane inhibitors of the influenza A virus (IAV) M2 proton channel, a growing number of clinically and economically important viruses are now recognised to encode essential viroporins providing potential targets for modern drug discovery. We describe the first rationally designed viroporin inhibitor with a comprehensive structure-activity relationship (SAR). This step-change in understanding not only revealed a second biological function for the p7 viroporin from hepatitis C virus (HCV) during virus entry, but also enabled the synthesis of a labelled tool compound that retained biological activity. Hence, p7 inhibitors (p7i) represent a unique class of HCV antiviral targeting both the spread and establishment of infection, as well as a precedent for future viroporin-targeted drug discovery.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hepatitis c virus</kwd><kwd>p7</kwd><kwd>viroporin</kwd><kwd>antiviral drugs</kwd><kwd>virion egress</kwd><kwd>virus entry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0700124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bentham</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name><name><surname>Wetherill</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Griffin</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011703</institution-id><institution>Yorkshire Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Foster</surname><given-names>Toshana L</given-names></name><name><surname>Griffin</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012536</institution-id><institution>Leeds Hospital Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>9R11/14-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wetherill</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Griffin</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC.PC.13066</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name><name><surname>Gosein</surname><given-names>Rajendra</given-names></name><name><surname>Foster</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name><name><surname>Griffin</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Exploiting virus-encoded ion channels as drug targets drove a multi-faceted approach to deriving potent small molecules targeting HCV p7, simultaneously providing new insights into its fundamental biology.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents a global clinical challenge as a major cause of chronic liver disease, with severe complications including cirrhosis, liver failure and primary liver cancers (hepatocellular- and intrahepatic cholangio- carcinomas (HCC, iCCA)). Acute infection is predominantly asymptomatic which, combined with limited awareness and population screening, means that liver disease is often advanced upon diagnosis. WHO estimates put the total number of deaths due to HCV infection in 2015 at more than 400 000, with ~1.75 million new infections annually.</p><p>HCV antiviral therapy, originally comprising recombinant type one interferon (IFN) combined with the guanosine analogue ribavirin, has been revolutionised by new direct-acting antivirals (DAA). DAA are an unprecedented drug development success, capable of achieving high rates of cure with favourable toxicity profiles enabling their use in patients with advanced disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumert et al., 2019</xref>). Current DAA target three proteins within the viral replicase (NS3/4A protease, NS5A and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP)), with drug combinations available for treating each of the eight viral genotypes.</p><p>However, the absence of an HCV vaccine, or other means of prophylaxis, makes DAA-based eradication strategies proposed for ~71 million chronically infected individuals immensely challenging. DAA availability remains limited by cost, coincident with poor diagnostic rates and rapidly increasing burden in low/middle-income countries (LMIC). Resistant viral variants are an increasing concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pawlotsky, 2016</xref>), with recent reports of increased resistance amongst some rarer viral subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fourati et al., 2019</xref>). Compliance within high-risk populations is low and successful DAA therapy does not prevent re-infection. Moreover, recent studies suggest that DAA are less able to reduce the risk of HCC in treated patients compared with IFN-based therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumert and Hoshida, 2019</xref>). This may be linked to virus-induced host epigenetic signatures that are not reversed following DAA cure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamdane et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perez et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>HCV is an enveloped positive sense RNA virus with a ~ 9.6 kb genome encoding a single large polyprotein translated from an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) in the 5ʹ-untranslated region. The polyprotein is spatially organised into structural components at the amino terminus and replicase proteins towards the carboxyl terminus; these are released by host and viral proteases, respectively. In addition, p7 and NS2 play pivotal roles during virion assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gentzsch et al., 2013</xref>) involving protein–protein interactions with one another, as well as other viral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jirasko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jirasko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boson et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the 63 amino acid p7 protein is capable of oligomerising (forming hexamers and/or heptamers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luik et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clarke et al., 2006</xref>) within membranes to form an ion channel complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breitinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Premkumar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pavlović et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Griffin et al., 2003</xref>) with a distinct, but equally essential role during virion secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Steinmann et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2007</xref>). This comprises the raising of secretory vesicle pH, which is necessary to protect acid-labile intracellular virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentham et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wozniak et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Prototypic compounds, such as adamantanes and alkyl imino-sugars, inhibit p7 channel activity as well as virion secretion in culture, but with relatively poor potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Griffin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Steinmann et al., 2007b</xref>). However, identification of explicit resistance polymorphisms confirmed that such effects are specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foster et al., 2011</xref>). This includes Leu20Phe, which confers resistance in genotype 1b and 2a p7 to adamantanes, including rimantadine. Thus, despite poor potency, prototypic inhibitors highlight druggable regions upon p7 channel complexes suited to targeting by improved compounds.</p><p>The majority of p7 structural studies support the folding of protomers into a hairpin conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luik et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Montserret et al., 2010</xref>). This is in agreement with immuno-gold labelling of p7 channel complexes by electron microscopy (EM)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luik et al., 2009</xref>), immunofluorescence studies of epitope-tagged p7 expressed in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrère-Kremer et al., 2002</xref>), and the membrane topology necessary to orient NS2 correctly within the ER membrane during translation of the viral polyprotein. Resultant p7 channel models comprise hexa- or heptameric assemblies of tilted protomers and a lumen formed by the N-terminal helix containing a well conserved (~90%) His17 residue, as proven biochemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chew et al., 2009</xref>). However, a solution NMR structure of a complete hexameric p7 channel complex comprised protomers in an unusual intertwined triple-helix configuration (PDB: 2M6X) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">OuYang et al., 2013</xref>). This structure retained a wider channel lumen compared to hairpin-based structures and exposed conserved basic residues to the lipid bilayer. Functionality of this sequence was not demonstrable, possibly due to mutagenesis of conserved cysteine residues to enhance recombinant expression. Furthermore, recent studies have questioned the validity of this structure due to potential artefacts caused by alkyl-phosphocholine detergents used as membrane mimetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oestringer et al., 2018</xref>; the original authors contest this notion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). However, molecular dynamics simulations favour the stability and channel gating characteristics of hairpin-based structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chandler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holzmann et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, both hairpin- and triple-helix-based channel structures retain an adamantane- binding site upon the channel periphery that includes position 20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">OuYang et al., 2013</xref>). Unsurprisingly, the conformation and amino acid content of this site differs significantly between structures. Previously, we used a hairpin-based heptameric channel complex as a template for in silico high throughput screening, based upon a genotype 1b monomeric hairpin p7 solution NMR structure (PDB: 3ZD0). Resultant chemical hits displayed considerably improved potency compared with rimantadine that was independent of Leu20Phe mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foster et al., 2014</xref>). However, initial hits lacked convergence around a common pharmacophore and this prevented understanding of a structure-activity relationship (SAR).</p><p>We now present a second-generation lead-like oxindole based inhibitor of p7 channel activity complete with a comprehensive SAR: ‘JK3/32’. The resultant step forward in potency and specificity has not only led to the identification of a second biological role for p7 channel activity during virus entry, but also enabled the generation of a fluorescently labelled tool compound that retained biological activity. This distinguishes p7 inhibitors (p7i) from other DAAs by targeting two discrete stages of the virus life cycle separate to genome replication and sets a new precedent for viroporin-targeted drug design.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Refining a rapid throughput assay for secreted HCV infectivity</title><p>p7 channel activity is essential for the secretion of infectious virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wozniak et al., 2010</xref>), making secreted infectivity an ideal biomarker readout for inhibitor antiviral effects. To expedite testing of secreted HCV infectivity following treatment with high numbers of compounds and/or concentration points, we adapted previously published protocols using the IncuCyte ZOOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stewart et al., 2015</xref>) to quantify infection of naïve cells immunostained for NS5A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Incorporation of a longer, more hydrophobic group (N-ethylphenyl, 1191–137), was less well tolerated. Introduction of a NH (JK3-38), N-Ph (JK3-42) and a N-heterocyclic substituent (2,5-dimethylisoxazolylmethyl, 1191–106) abrogated antiviral effects. Attempts at substitution at the ‘northern’ phenyl ring was not well tolerated, with 4<italic>-</italic>OMe (e.g. JK3/32) or H (21-RS-8) preferred over 4-cyano (1191–112) and 2-methoxy (1191–104). 4-alkynyloxy was only moderately less active than 4-OMe (compare 1191–146 (EC<sub>50</sub> 2.48 μM) to 1191–140 (EC<sub>50</sub> 0.46 μM)), suggesting that further synthetic expansion from this site was possible, consistent with the modelling which directed this vector outwards from the binding pocket into the membrane. The linker at the 3-position of the oxindole core was sensitive to modification. The hydrazone analogue (21-RS-7) was much less active whilst replacement of the NH for a carbonyl group (21-RS-17) was also not well tolerated. This is consistent with the enamine linker adopting an important bridging unit for correct placement of the N1 substituent into the deep hydrophobic pocket. Substitution of the oxindole core at the 5- and 6-positions with F atoms (1191–124 and 1191–121, respectively) was generally well tolerated. Consistency between observed SAR and the heptameric 3ZD0-based model supports that rational design based upon this system generates authentic, specific p7-targeted antivirals; JK3/32 SAR was not consistent with the 2M6X structure (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Molecular dynamics supports stable JK3/32 binding at the peripheral site</title><p>We next undertook atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of genotype 1b p7 channel complexes with JK3/32 bound at the peripheral site to assess the stability of interactions predicted by docking studies over time.

However, we previously defined both strain- and polymorphism-dependent resistance to prototypic adamantane and alkyl imino-sugar p7i (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foster et al., 2011</xref>), providing a means to assess p7 target engagement during entry.

Virus entry experiments recapitulated this pattern, with the latter two compounds displaying dose-dependent efficacy when added to infectious innoculae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).

Hence, p7 sequence dictated p7i-mediated blockade of HCV entry, providing genetic evidence for virion-resident channels. Consistently, JK3/32 only blocked infection when introduced during virus infection, concordant with a direct effect upon virion-resident channels, whereas the NS5Ai Daclatasvir only interfered with HCV infection when added post-entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>).</p><p>Next, we used Lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with HCV glycoproteins to establish whether JK3/32 effects were p7-specific, or might instead interfere with receptor binding, particle integrity or membrane fusion.

Not only does IAV enter cells via this pathway, it also retains virion-associated M2 viroporin proton channels, thereby serving as an additional control for JK3/32 specificity. Accordingly, JK3/32 did not affect IAV entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). In addition, JK3/32 did not interfere with clathrin-dependent uptake of fluorescent-tagged epidermal growth factor (EGF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>).

Thus, whilst the R21 compound could not serve as a negative control during JFH-1 entry experiments, the discrete sensitivity compared to resistant 1b/3a channels implied that polymorphisms within the JFH-1-binding site underpinned this phenotype. Such genetic evidence for a compound distinct to JK3/32, yet targeting the same binding site, would further support not only the relevance of the peripheral binding site, but also the functional requirement for p7 channel activity during HCV entry.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Susceptibility of genotype 2a JFH-1 HCV to R21 further supports a role during entry as well as peripheral site specificity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of R21 potency vs. virion secretion of JFH-1 with rimantadine.

Compared to the J4 sequence, JFH-1 contains Y45T, L50F and L51C, whereas the S52 sequence contains Y45T and L51A; sequence divergence in other regions of the protein is more common. We therefore examined previously derived structure homology models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foster et al., 2014</xref>) of p7 channels from these three genotypes to examine how sequence changes might affect predicted interactions with the R21 compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, the Y45T/L50F change in JFH-1 reduced exposure of the R21 molecule to the surrounding environment, permitting a more stable interaction compared to the 1b or 3a channels; L51C was too distant from R21 to exert any obvious changes in binding. Furthermore, the Y45T change disrupts interactions between Y45 and Y42 seen in the 1b channel model allowing the dimethoxyphenyl group to better fit within the cavity. In addition, L50F prevents distortion of the benzyl group seen within the 1b structure, again promoting stability within the JFH-1-binding site. As genotype 3a lacks the L50F change, we infer that the Y45T/L50F dual polymorphism underpins JFH-1 R21 susceptibility.</p><p>We next speculated that the Y45T/L50F polymorphisms might simultaneously confer partial JK3/32 resistance as well as R21 sensitivity to genotype 1b channels. Given that we had been unable to select JK3/32 resistance in culture, the limited change in EC<sub>50</sub> between genotypes, and mutations in this region (e.g. Y42F, W48F) of the protein reduce particle production and infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Steinmann et al., 2007a</xref>), we again used molecular modelling to investigate potential phenotypes. New structure homology models were generated for the genotype 1b (J4) channel complex, incorporating Y45T/L50F or the Y45T/L51C polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Consistent with experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), both of the dual polymorphisms led to reduced JK3/32- binding efficiency when present in the J4 background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), making it likely that Y45T alone might be responsible for this phenotype. By contrast, neither of the changes were able to enhance the binding of R21 to the genotype 1b channel complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We conclude, therefore, either that all three changes may be relevant despite the distance of position 51 from the binding site, or that overall structural differences within the JFH-1 channel are the correct context in which Y45T or the other polymorphisms might act. Note, only intra-, rather than inter-ligand binding differences are relevant due to the differential exposure of ligands to the environment, and distinct start-point binding poses within wild type channels.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Predicted binding of JK3/32 and R21 to mutated J4 p7 channel complexes.</title><p>Structure homology models of the genotype 1b J4 p7 channel complex containing either Y45T/L50F or Y45T/L51C double mutations, were generated and energy-minimised using Maestro (Schrödinger). (<bold>A</bold>) JK3/32 was re-docked into the peripheral binding site for the wild type or mutated channel complexes using Glide (see Materials and methods), identifying interactions within the binding site.

We predicted that the northern 4-OMe group should tolerate the addition of a flexible linker without significant loss to binding affinity.

First, correlation between SAR and channel models constructed using hairpin-shaped protomers (based upon the 3ZD0 monomeric NMR structure), rather than the 2M6X hexamer, supports their biological relevance. Second, the SAR across the series provides evidence for a number of structurally related analogues with defined potency and genotype specificity; whilst previously reported initial hit compounds showed similar potency in some cases, their structural diversity meant that they lacked a common scaffold which made it harder to identify a consensus pharmacophore for binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foster et al., 2014</xref>). Third, our understanding of SAR and the way in which JK3/32 is predicted to interact with the p7 channel complex, enabled creation of the first – to our knowledge – labelled tool compound based upon a viroporin inhibitor. The success of this molecule further corroborated our understanding of SAR and predicted interactions between p7i and structure models of the p7 channel complex. Lastly, drugs based upon JK3/32 would represent antivirals with a distinct mechanism of action compared with current HCV DAA that target the viral replicase. Moreover, these may potentially target two discrete stages of the virus life cycle, namely virion secretion and entry. Hence, this work sets a new precedent for viroporin-targeted drug development that should enable the field to advance beyond the previous clinical precedent set by amantadine- and/or rimantadine-based influenza therapy.</p><p>The potency and selectivity demonstrated by JK3/32 was consistent with the SAR demonstrated within the series, docking predictions within the peripheral binding site, as well as MD simulations of the bound JK3/32 ligand over time. Each binding site occurs between adjacent hairpin-formation protomers and the majority of residues are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). This includes Tyr45 and Trp48, which form key H-bond interactions with the JK3/32 indole carbonyl. Only Leu20 (~46% conserved) shows appreciable variation within the binding site, with the rimantadine-resistant Phe20 occurring in just ~3.6% of isolates in the EU HCV database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>); Val (~30%) or Ala (~12%) are more common. Moreover, Phe20 stabilises rather than disrupts interactions with JK3/32 during MD simulations, and JK3/32-related compounds are unaffected by this mutation in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foster et al., 2014</xref>). We infer that the high degree of conservation within this site explains why JK3/32 specific resistance was not selectable in culture, despite several attempts.</p><p>In addition to L20F adamantane resistance, HCV also displays genotype-dependent resistance to other inhibitor classes; for example, genotype 3a resistance to alkyl imino-sugars helped to identify a F25A resistance polymorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foster et al., 2011</xref>). By contrast, the sensitivity of JFH-1 p7 to rimantadine, but not amantadine, is not easily attributable to a single residue, suggesting that multiple interactions and/or the global structure of the channel complex may play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Griffin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foster et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">StGelais et al., 2009</xref>). Whilst relative JK3/32 resistance occurred for genotypes 2a (JFH-1) and 3a (S52) compared to 1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), JFH-1 p7 alone displayed discrete sensitivity to R21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref>). Comparison of amino acid variability within the peripheral site highlighted Y45T/L50F as a dual polymorphism potentially capable of influencing R21 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Interestingly, introducing these changes into the genotype 1b channel model led to reduced JK3/32 binding, consistent with experimental data, yet did not increase predicted binding of R21 to the J4 channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Thus, whilst engineering such mutations into the J4 p7 background may lead to a modest increase in JK3/32 resistance as seen for JFH-1, a discrete resistance phenotype may be more complex to achieve and may incur a significant fitness cost as seen for mutations proximal to this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Steinmann et al., 2007a</xref>). A requirement for two or more changes may also explain the high genetic barrier in JK3/32 resistance experiments. Nevertheless, the discrete resistance phenotype for the R21 compound supports the relevance of the peripheral binding site and provides orthogonal validation that p7 channel activity is required during HCV entry. In addition, should resistance emerge in the future to JK3/32 progeny involving positions 45 and 50, this could conceivably be countered using compounds evolved from the R21 chemotype alongside in combination therapies. This further demonstrates the added value of the JK3/32 series SAR compared with other prototypic inhibitors.</p><p>It was interesting to note that JK3/32 SAR was compatible with 3ZD0-based hairpin-based channel models, but not those based upon the genotype 5a (EUH1480 isolate) 2M6X channel complex solution structure. 2M6X comprises triple-helix protomers and also contains Phe20 within a peripheral adamantane binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">OuYang et al., 2013</xref>), although this site differs significantly in amino acid composition and structure compared to the 3ZD0-based hairpin heptamer model. Unfortunately, the recombinant protein used for structure determination did not display ion channel activity, making it impossible to determine drug sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">OuYang et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, a related genotype 5a (SA-13) also retains Phe20 and is rimantadine-sensitive in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meredith et al., 2013</xref>), supporting that Phe20 mediated rimantadine resistance is context-specific. The EUH1480 p7 sequence was modified to enhance recombinant expression, primarily at Cys residues. Amongst these, Cys2 is only found within GT5a (present in just 0.07% of p7 sequences overall, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and Cys27 is highly conserved across all genotypes (&gt;95%). It is conceivable that these mutations were responsible for the lack of observable channel activity for this protein.</p><p>Unlike the peripheral rimantadine binding site in 3ZD0-based models, the region bound by amantadine in the 2M6X complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">OuYang et al., 2013</xref>), comprising Phe20, Val25, Val26, Leu52, Val53, Leu55 and Leu56, is poorly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Only Leu52 and Leu55 represent consensus residues at their respective positions, with all the others being minority species. Moreover, three of the seven residues vary between the otherwise closely related SA-13 and EUH1480 genotype 5a strains (positions 26, 53, and 55). Unsurprisingly, JK3/32 binding and SAR is incompatible with this site within the 2M6X complex, or more importantly, with a genotype 1b homology model based upon the 2M6X structure (data not shown). Taken together, our findings add to the NMR-specific concerns recently raised regarding 2M6X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oestringer et al., 2018</xref>) and support that biologically functional p7 channels comprise arrangements of hairpin protomers.</p><p>JK3/32 was compared to a patented p7i advanced into early phase human studies in South East Asia, BIT225 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luscombe et al., 2010</xref>) (N-Carbamimidoyl-5-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)−2-naphthamide, Biotron Ltd, Australia). BIT225 is an amiloride-related compound selected as an inhibitor of genotype 1a p7 (H77 strain) from a bacterial screen, with activity against recombinant protein at 100 μM in suspended bilayers. As a surrogate for HCV in culture, BIT225 potently inhibited replication of the <italic>Pestivirus</italic>, BVDV (EC<sub>50</sub>314 nM), although specificity was not attributed to the BVDV p7 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luscombe et al., 2010</xref>). However, BIT225 later showed genotype-dependent efficacy versus HCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meredith et al., 2013</xref>), with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 10 μM or 30 μM (genotype 2a and 5a chimaeric HCV, respectively); interestingly, these concentrations are far higher than those effective versus BVDV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luscombe et al., 2010</xref>). Whilst we observed a similar anti-HCV EC<sub>50</sub> of 17.7 μM versus genotype 1b chimaeric HCV, this coincided with the CC<sub>50</sub> of 18.6 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), making it impossible to define a selective antiviral effect. Notably, Huh7 cell cytotoxicity was not determined in previous HCV studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meredith et al., 2013</xref>), whereas BVDV studies reported a CC<sub>50</sub> of 11.6 μM for Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells, with appreciable (~16%) cytotoxicity at just 4 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luscombe et al., 2010</xref>). We conclude that BIT225 may show greater potency versus BVDV than HCV, and that selective antiviral effects cannot be determined for HCV in the Huh7 system. This contrasts with the considerable selectivity index observed for JK3/32 (&gt;500, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>JK3/32 inhibition of secreted HCV infectivity showed cross-genotypic potency, including versus genotype 3a, which can be more difficult to treat using current DAAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). Thus, we were naturally cautious regarding the higher concentrations required to block HCV entry, although this effect was reproducible compared to the inactive R21 analogue for genotypes 1b and 3a, showed genotype-dependent variation and was coincident with entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–c,e</xref>). Lentiviral pseudotype assays supported that JK3/32 did not affect E1/E2 mediated receptor binding or membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>), plus it did not affect IAV entry or clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g,h</xref>). Moreover, strain/polymorphism-dependent resistance to prototypic p7i and the R21 compound provided genetic evidence of target engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5b</xref>) and we were effectively able to rule out cell-dependent effects using our fluorescent-tagged JK3/32 derivative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), supporting irreversible dosing of virion-resident p7 channels.</p><p>We speculate that the different biological roles of p7 channel activity during secretion and entry may explain why higher p7i concentrations are required to block the latter process. During secretion, p7 must counteract active proton gradients generated by vATPase in order to prevent acidification within large secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wozniak et al., 2010</xref>), conceivably requiring a considerable number of viroporin complexes. By contrast, during entry, virion-resident p7 would promote core acidification in the same direction as proton gradients generated within endosomes, presumably achieved by a small number of channel complexes. Thus, inhibiting a fraction of p7 channels within a secretory vesicle might prevent vATPase antagonism, whereas saturating inhibitor concentrations would be required during entry to prevent activation of even a single virion-resident p7 channel. This hypothesis may also explain why cell-to-cell infection appears less sensitive to p7i as virions presumably bypass acidifying secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meredith et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Studies of HCV harbouring mutations within the highly conserved p7 basic loop (consensus: K33, R35, p7 sequence) have provided evidence contrary to the presence of p7 channels within virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Steinmann et al., 2007a</xref>). Specifically, highly efficient chimaeric J6/JFH-1 HCV harbouring basic loop mutations is able to produce secreted infectious virions, albeit at significantly reduced titre (~4-log10 reduction). Basic loop mutant particles displayed equivalent specific infectivity compared with wild type, suggesting that p7 function is not required during entry. Moreover, in the less efficient JFH-1 background where basic loop mutants effectively abrogate secreted infectivity, restoration of a limited level of secreted infectivity occurred upon either <italic>trans</italic>-complementation with IAV M2, or Bafilomycin A (BafA) treatment of infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentham et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wozniak et al., 2010</xref>). These observations suggest that supplementing p7 function during virion secretion is sufficient to restore infectivity, negating the requirement for p7 to act during entry.</p><p>However, this interpretation assumes that basic loop mutations specifically affect ion channel activity in isolation, yet no published evidence exists to support this notion. Instead, basic loop mutations induce defects in p7 stability and E2-p7-NS2 precursor processing within infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentham et al., 2013</xref>), as well as severe disruption of membrane insertion observed in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">StGelais et al., 2009</xref>). It is likely that cell phenotypes directly link to defective membrane insertion, suggesting that p7 may spontaneously insert into membranes rather than depending upon the signal recognition particle. Spontaneous membrane insertion would explain why p7 lacking an upstream signal peptide forms functional channels within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griffin et al., 2004</xref>), as well as how HCV harbouring deletions of half of the p7 protein remain viable for replication despite the predicted effect of such mutations upon polyprotein topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brohm et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, whilst only a minority of basic loop mutant p7 proteins might successfully insert into membranes, this should result in the formation of functional channel complexes. This scarcity of p7 complexes would profoundly disrupt virion secretion in the model proposed above due to an inability to counteract vATPase. However, a minority of virions might conceivably contain sufficient functional p7 complexes. Provision of M2 and/or BafA would therefore rescue secretion of such particles by allowing them to survive within acidifying vesicles, which could then proceed to infect naïve cells.</p><p>One limitation of our study is the absence of p7 immunological detection within purified HCV virions. We previously generated the only published p7-specific polyclonal antisera, which required extensive concentration to detect relatively high protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">StGelais et al., 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, these are the only reagents described for the detection of native p7 protein, as confirmed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jirasko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luik et al., 2009</xref>). Whilst we applied these reagents to virion detection, stocks expired prior to a conclusive outcome. Others used recombinant viruses expressing epitope tagged p7 to investigate the presence of channel complexes within virions by co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vieyres et al., 2013</xref>). However, whilst p7 was not detectable within either anti-ApoE or Anti-E2 precipitates, the levels of core protein present were also low; by analogy with M2, we expect p7 to be present in stoichiometrically low numbers compared with canonical virion components. Similarly, p7 was not detected by mass spectrometry (MS) conducted upon affinity-purified HCV particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lussignol et al., 2016</xref>), yet this was also true for the E1 glycoprotein, which should show equivalent abundance to E2 resulting from heterodimer formation.</p><p>Thus, poor reagent quality combined with low protein abundance hampers direct detection of p7 within virions, representing a significant challenge that we intend to address by the addition of an affinity tag to the ‘click’-labelled JK3/32 derivative. Concentration of virions and signal amplification will be essential as gradient infectivity peaks have an approximate particle molarity of 0.5 fM, based upon infectivity measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). IAV particles contain only 16–20 M2 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pinto and Lamb, 2006</xref>), meaning that even a high particle: infectivity ratio of 1000:1 would likely yield a maximal virion-associated p7 concentration in the tens of pM. Hence, a virion-associated fluorescence signal was not observed within peak infectivity fractions where the baseline unbound JK3/32-488 concentration was ~2 nM.</p><p>The favourable potency and selectivity index demonstrated by JK3/32 could serve as a high quality starting point for a more comprehensive p7-targeted drug development programme. Blocking p7 activity would interfere with two distinct stages of the virus life cycle compared to existing replicase-targeted DAAs, namely virion secretion and entry. Hence, p7i could be ideal for delivering effective antiviral prophylaxis against de novo exposure (e.g. needle stick/iatrogenic or perinatal) or transplanted graft re-infection, in addition to use alongside conventional DAA combination therapies treating chronic infection. Whilst blocking both entry and secretion may require higher plasma concentrations compared with targeting secretion alone, the favourable selectivity index for JK3/32 suggests this should be feasible and future development may further optimise potency and bioavailability.</p><p>In summary, viroporins represent an untapped reservoir of antiviral drug targets that has historically been under-explored following the shortcomings of adamantane M2 inhibitors. Our work shows that it is possible to take a step-change in targeting these proteins, providing a new approach to antiviral therapy and generating novel research tools with which to dissect viroporin function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (include species and sex here)</td><td>Hepatitis C virus full length infectious cell culture clone: <break/>JFH-1</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wakita et al., 2005</xref>.

Following phenol/chloroform extraction, 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> Huh7 cells were electroporated with 10 µg HCV RNA. Electroporated cells were seeded at 2.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/ well in 100 µL volume in 96 well plates and incubated 4 hr. Compound dose responses were prepared at 400x in DMSO, diluted 1:20 into media in an intermediate plate, and 1:20 into the final cell plate to yield final 0.25% (v/v) DMSO. All compound treatments were dosed in duplicate. Dosed cells were incubated 72 hr before performing 1:4 dilution (50 µL) of virus-containing supernatant onto a plate of naïve Huh7 cells (150 µL), seeded at 8 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/well 6 hr previously.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Gisa Gerold (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, the authors used an unbiased approach to screen for novel inhibitors of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). With this strategy combined with chemical evolution to improve the initial hit compound, they successfully identified a new HCV inhibitor which was named JK3/32. The authors then computationally identified a putative binding site for this compound on the HCV p7 channel, and systematically analysed the requirement for certain functional groups for the activity of this inhibitor. With the use of JK3/32, the authors propose a new function of the HCV p7 viroporin for viral entry into the host cell. Altogether, this study sheds light on the importance of viroporin inhibitors as new generation drug classes for HCV treatment.</p><p>All three reviewers were very positive about your manuscript. They all agreed that it gives very interesting and valuable insights into HCV biology.</p><p>During our discussion with the three reviewers on your manuscript we identified two important points that we would like you to address experimentally with the highest priority in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>First, we would like to ask you to more directly demonstrate that p7 is indeed the target of the new inhibitor you identified by using mutational studies on p7. One way to approach this would be to mutate the amino acids responsible for JK3/32 binding (Trp48, Tyr45, Leu52).</p><p>Second, to provide experimental evidence of the genotype-specificity of JK3/32, the compound flunarazine, which specifically inhibits viral entry of the genotype 2a by targeting a hydrophobic region close to the putative E1 fusion loop (Banda et al., 2019), should be added in Figure 4C as positive control/for comparison with JK3/32. In addition, since the studies of the prototypical p7 inhibitors (Figure 4E) are done with JFH-1virus (Genotype 2a), it should also be included in Figure 4C.</p><p>Please find below the individual reviewer comments that I would like to ask you to address as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>The authors have performed an extensive amount of chemical, virological and in silico analysis and generated an interesting manuscript with important new findings. The issue of p7's potential role in entry is always important to consider and they have made advances in that direction. The identified compound is also interesting as a starting point for new p7 inhibitors, as the authors have pointed out. Overall this is an excellent paper that this reviewer believes is worthy of publication in this journal.</p><p>Notes on Strengths:</p><p>– The observed EC50 of 184nM for JK3/32 is significant given that it behaves similarly to SOF in compound titration assays (Figure 1B).</p><p>– JK3/32 did not affect replicons.</p><p>– The lack of effect on IAV is convincing regarding target specificity.</p><p>– The labelled tool provides a useful reagent for multiple types of future work.</p><p>I have some concern with Figure 4A. Is the effect on entry dose-dependent? The authors have presented only 0 and 4uM tests on entry and although the data is statistically significant, should we consider an ~2.5-fold decrease in entry as biologically significant? There is also some concern that effects were only seen at μM compound concentrations (Figure 4A and C). Additional concern is also raised by the fact that the authors report they were not able to generate resistance to the compound after multiple attempts. They have discussed this in the subsection “ HCV entry is dependent upon p7 ion channel function”, and attributed it to sequence conservation and perhaps necessity in the compound binding site.</p><p>The data showing that pseudotyped viruses were not affected by the compound (Figure 4F) does indeed suggest that p7 is involved in entry and is then inhibited by the compound in the context of HCVcc. However, how can the authors be sure that the p7 function during virus assembly/release that would protects E1E2 from premature degradation is not inhibited by the compound and then indirectly affecting entry because released particles would have deficient envelopes? In this case, the current pattern of results would remain – one would expect to see an inhibition of HCVcc entry but not HCVpp. So does this data really suggest p7 is active during entry? This is not easy to discern experimentally, but perhaps the authors might discuss this possibility in the context of premature degradation of E1E2.</p><p>The demonstration of p7 being present within the virion would be the conclusive evidence that has been sought after for years to prove p7 might be involved in entry. The authors are well aware of this and have addressed is as well as anyone could do. The future experiments discussed in the eleventh paragraph of the Discussion will be innovative approaches to readdress this issue.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>In Shaw et al. the authors describe an unbiased approach for screening novel inhibitors of HCV. Using this strategy followed by chemical evolution to improve the initial hit, they successfully identify a new inhibitor: JK3/32. The authors were then able to computationally identify a putative binding site for the molecule on the HCV p7 channel, and systematically test the requirement of several functional groups for inhibitor activity. Using JK3/32, the authors suggest a new function of p7 in viral entry.</p><p>1) One question I cannot answer is whether the identified compound is different enough from previously identified drugs to represent a substantial breakthrough from what is already known.</p><p>2) Figure 1—figure supplement 2: Is the increase in activity of some human kinases statistically significant? Have the authors considered whether an increase in activity could also lead to toxicity in cells?</p><p>3) Figures 2/3: Is it possible to confirm the binding site of JK3/32 to p7 directly using mutational analysis to strengthen the computational and simulation analysis reported here? It seems the authors do something similar in Atkins et al., 2014? Perhaps the effects of JK3/32 on different viral genotypes could shed some light on this, provided viruses containing natural mutations within the binding site have already been identified.</p><p>4) Figure 4: As with above, can it be demonstrated that direct mutations to p7 affect viral entry? Experiments described in Figure 5 convincingly demonstrate that the effect of JK3/32 is unlikely an off-target effect on the host cells, but it would be helpful to more directly establish that this effect is due to binding only to the p7 channel. This is particularly true in light of the apparent difficulty of providing evidence that p7 channels exist directly in virions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Shaw et al. identifies a potent HCV p7 inhibitor (p7i) by structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. In addition, rational SAR-based compound design in combination with atomistic molecular dynamics revealed the basic compound structure for their inhibition studies and pinpointed the potential binding pocket of JK3/32. Interestingly, the authors could show that JK3/32 is not only inhibiting viral secretion but also interferes with HCV cell entry. This study is well designed and performed. Moreover, it supports the role of p7 as an important viral protein for HCV entry. Altogether this study brings to light the importance of viroporin inhibitors as new generation drug classes for HCV treatment.</p><p>The following suggestions would increase the overall clarity of the study and improve the quality of the data.</p><p>1) The molecular dynamics simulation studies would be benefit from the addition of the RMSD values of the unbound protein (without JK3/32) for comparison</p><p>2) A detailed scheme of the molecular interactions of JK3/32 with Leu20Phe p7 mutant as for 3B would be a nice addition to the current Figure 3C.</p><p>3) Entry inhibition studies (Figure 4) would benefit from a positive control drug such as flunarizine, which targets the potential fusion peptide within E1.</p><p>4) The HCVpp experiments with prototypical glycoproteins (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C) and VSV-Gpps are missing the GNA control.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52555.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All three reviewers were very positive about your manuscript.

One way to approach this would be to mutate the amino acids responsible for JK3/32 binding (Trp48, Tyr45, Leu52).</p></disp-quote><p>We naturally agree that this question is of major importance and in fact alludes to three overlapping aspects of the work, namely:</p><p>1) Specific interactions between JK3/32 and the (genotype 1b) p7 channel complex</p><p>2) The SAR for our inhibitor series relating to the peripheral binding site, extending to other HCV genotypes</p><p>3) The functional role for p7 channel activity during virus entry</p><p>The pandemic lockdown has frustrated our attempts to conduct experiments that directly address point one, yet we have now included data that we feel convincingly address the other two points and offers insight around the first.</p><p>Selection of a resistance polymorphism would provide excellent evidence for JK3/32 target engagement across all three areas listed above. In this regard, we undertook multiple cell culture experiments where we attempted to select JK3/32 resistance by sequential passage with increasing inhibitor concentration, and were unable to detect changes by deep sequencing even prior to elimination of the virus from culture (even at just a single EC<sub>50</sub>). This was not rescuable by subsequent blind passage in the absence of drug. This led to our conclusion that the invariant nature of the binding site residues prevented resistance from arising. However, it is also possible that a single substitution is not sufficient for resistance to evolve.</p><p>Mutation of key interacting residues such as W48 or L52 is certainly one approach to disrupting JK3/32 binding. However, these are 100% conserved within naturally occurring p7 sequences, suggesting important functional roles. Accordingly, a W48F mutation (and Y42F) in a genotype 2a JFH-1 background caused significant defects in both virion infectivity and core protein secretion (Steinmann et al., 2007).</p><p>Previously, we identified the F25A imino-sugar resistance polymorphism via inter-genotypic variation within the predicted binding site in molecular models (Foster et al., 2011). However, JK3/32 displays variable activity against the three HCV genotypes included in this study rather than discrete resistance, making it possible, or even likely, that individual mutations might not give a clear picture of JK3/32 binding.</p><p>Thus, an inhibitor with a discrete resistance phenotype would represent a better means of validating the peripheral binding site and the role of p7 during virus entry. Whilst this was shown for rimantadine and the L20F polymorphism (Figure 4D), a member of the JK3/32 inhibitor series would be more relevant to future development.</p><p>Frustratingly, we had overlooked the existence of such a compound due to its use as a negative control for the majority of our genotype 1b experiments, namely R21. Unlike genotype 1b and 3a, the R21 compound displays moderate efficacy against the JFH-1 strain (EC<sub>50</sub>=4.1 μM vs. secreted infectivity, revised Figure 5A). This led to us not including JFH-1 in the JK3/32 data presented in Figure 4, as an appropriate negative control was not available; the reviewers rightly noted this exception. However, R21 did indeed inhibit JFH-1 entry, supporting that JK3/32 series inhibitors targeting the peripheral binding site block an important aspect of HCV entry mediated by p7 channel activity (revised Figure 5B).</p><p>As implied above, genotypic variation within the JK3/32 series is likely due to both the composition of key residues in the peripheral binding site as well as the context of the overall channel structure. For example, the L20F rimantadine resistance polymorphism increased susceptibility of JFH-1 to certain compounds from our first hit series, whilst it reduced sensitivity for genotype 1b (Foster et al., 2014).</p><p>Thus, we hypothesised that variation in the JFH-1 binding site may not only explain R21 sensitivity, but may also provide insight into potential resistance mechanisms for other genotypes and members of the SAR series, including JK3/32. As shown in revised Figure 5, aside from L20, only positions Y45, L50 and L51 (genotype 1b sequence) display limited variability within the 1b, 2a and 3a binding sites. Compared to J4, JFH-1 (genotype 2a) shows a Y45T/L50F/L51C change, whilst S52 (genotype 3a) contains Y45T/L51A. We had engineered several of these mutations into the J4/JFH-1 virus background prior to the COVID19 lockdown, albeit with some trepidation regarding their potential effects upon viral fitness, as discussed above.</p><p>Using established p7 structural homology models (Foster et al., 2014), we examined predicted interactions between R21 and the genotype 1b, 2a and 3a binding sites (revised Figure 5C). Y45T and L50F in JFH-1 (position 51 is likely too distant to directly influence interactions) are predicted to influence the way in which R21 interacts with the peripheral binding site, generating a deeper binding pocket that better incorporates the R21 structure. Y45T also disrupts an interaction between Y45 and Y42 present in the 1b channel model, allowing the “northern” R21 dimethoxy-phenyl ring to better-fit within the cavity. In turn, L50F allows the “southern” phenyl ring to fit within the pocket without the distortion seen in other genotypes; both mutations result in significantly reduced exposure of R21 to the surrounding environment. We infer that both Y45T and L50F are required for R21 sensitivity as the resistant genotype 3a channel lacks the latter change.</p><p>We next generated genotype 1b channel models containing either Y45T/L50F or Y45T/L51C to assess whether Y45T, L50F or both might alter predicted drug binding (revised Figure 6). Interestingly, both mutations reduced the predicted interaction efficiency with JK3/32, suggesting that Y45T underpins the decreased susceptibility of JFH-1 and S52 channels to the compound but that this does not itself constitute a resistance polymorphism. However, introducing the double mutations into the genotype 1b background did not increase the predicted binding efficiency of R21.</p><p>Thus, we conclude that resistance to JK3/32 may potentially arise via the Y45T mutation, but this would also require either additional adjacent changes to the binding site, or potentially further alterations to the global channel structure achieved via more distal amino acid changes. Interestingly, it seems likely that compounds evolved from R21 might therefore be used to counter resistance emerging to JK3/32. Taken together, we believe these observations explain our failure to select JK3/32 resistance in culture, suggest that single or even double mutations in the J4 sequence as suggested may not serve as an alternative, and yet also provide orthogonal validation of the peripheral binding site as well as the requirement for p7 during HCV entry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, to provide experimental evidence of the genotype-specificity of JK3/32, the compound flunarazine, which specifically inhibits viral entry of the genotype 2a by targeting a hydrophobic region close to the putative E1 fusion loop (Banda et al., 2019), should be added in Figure 4C as positive control/for comparison with JK3/32. In addition, since the studies of the prototypical p7 inhibitors (Figure 4E) are done with JFH-1virus (Genotype 2a), it should also be included in Figure 4C.</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy to conduct flunarazine experiments, as requested, as soon as we are able (see above). However, we infer that this experiment is a means of confirming that an additional class of inhibitor is capable of preventing HCV entry. In this regard, we point out that our revised manuscript now shows data on four structurally distinct p7 inhibitor compounds that prevent HCV entry (rimantadine, <italic>N</italic>N-DNJ, JK3/32 and R21), with the L20F and other (predicted) polymorphisms confirming site and class specificity (i.e. L20F prevents rimantadine, but not <italic>N</italic>NDNJ activity; JFH-1 susceptible to R21 etc.). Moreover, GNA also specifically prevents the entry of HCV-pseudotyped Lentiviruses compared to those coated with the VSV-G protein (Figure 4F, Figure 4—figure supplement 1) and we have provided numerous controls for effects upon cellular processes and global virus uptake.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please find below the individual reviewer comments that I would like to ask you to address as well.</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>The authors have performed an extensive amount of chemical, virological and in silico analysis and generated an interesting manuscript with important new findings. The issue of p7's potential role in entry is always important to consider and they have made advances in that direction. The identified compound is also interesting as a starting point for new p7 inhibitors, as the authors have pointed out. Overall this is an excellent paper that this reviewer believes is worthy of publication in this journal.</p><p>Notes on Strengths:</p><p>– The observed EC50 of 184nM for JK3/32 is significant given that it behaves similarly to SOF in compound titration assays (Figure 1B).</p><p>– JK3/32 did not affect replicons.</p><p>– The lack of effect on IAV is convincing regarding target specificity.</p><p>– The labelled tool provides a useful reagent for multiple types of future work.</p><p>I have some concern with Figure 4A. Is the effect on entry dose-dependent? The authors have presented only 0 and 4uM tests on entry and although the data is statistically significant, should we consider an ~2.5-fold decrease in entry as biologically significant? There is also some concern that effects were only seen at μM compound concentrations (Figure 4A and 4C).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that Figure 4A shows a single concentration, yet Figure 4C contains titrations of JK3/32 and R21 for both J4/JFH-1 and S52/JFH-1 chimaeric viruses, as revised Figure 5 does for JFH-1.</p><p>The point regarding the relevance of the observed fold-reduction is difficult to answer and may relate to the discussion regarding saturation of virion-resident channels in our original submission. Nevertheless, the effect <italic>is</italic> dose dependent and the experiment in the original Figure 5 (now revised Figure 7) where direct treatment of purified virus with 10 μM JK3/32 caused a drastic reduction in titre, suggests that saturation is achievable above a threshold drug concentration.</p><p>We naturally shared the concerns of the reviewer regarding the higher concentrations required, as discussed extensively within the manuscript, and these drove us to undertake numerous control experiments.</p><p>We also highlight that four different p7 inhibitors herein exert dose-dependent effects upon virus entry in either a polymorphism (L20F), or genotype-dependent fashion, namely: rimantadine, imino-sugars, JK3/32 and R21.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional concern is also raised by the fact that the authors report they were not able to generate resistance to the compound after multiple attempts. They have discussed this in the subsection “ HCV entry is dependent upon p7 ion channel function”, and attributed it to sequence conservation and perhaps necessity in the compound binding site.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see discussion and description of new data above. We have no reason to doubt that a high genetic barrier exists to JK3/32 resistance exists based upon the high degree of conservation within the binding site. However, the polymorphism-dependent actions of rimantadine and the R21 compound support the specificity of the peripheral binding site, and the relevance of p7 channel activity during entry. We regret that we have been unable to assess our HCV mutants due to the ongoing pandemic, albeit with fairly low confidence that a definitive phenotype might have been achieved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data showing that pseudotyped viruses were not affected by the compound (Figure 4F) does indeed suggest that p7 is involved in entry and is then inhibited by the compound in the context of HCVcc. However, how can the authors be sure that the p7 function during virus assembly/release that would protects E1E2 from premature degradation is not inhibited by the compound and then indirectly affecting entry because released particles would have deficient envelopes?</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies for any confusion. The experiments involving Lentiviral pseudotypes involved the addition of inhibitors during entry, rather than during particle production. We have clarified this in the text. Please see below regarding discussion of p7 function during secretion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this case, the current pattern of results would remain – one would expect to see an inhibition of HCVcc entry but not HCVpp. So does this data really suggest p7 is active during entry? This is not easy to discern experimentally, but perhaps the authors might discuss this possibility in the context of premature degradation of E1E2.</p></disp-quote><p>As above, inhibitors are not present during secretion in these experiments and we have further clarified the relevant text.</p><p>Whilst we have shown that p7 channel activity functions during secretion to protect the functionality of E1 and E2, we do not attribute this to premature degradation of these proteins. We do not see a reduction of E2 within inhibitor treated cells, for example (Foster et al., 2011); however, amantadine and <italic>N</italic>NDNJ can alter glycosylation patterns in both viral and cellular proteins (Griffin et al., 2008).</p><p>Where E1/E2 degradation does occur is in the context of p7 point mutations, such as those involving the conserved basic loop residues. However, evidence points to degradation of the precursor E2-p7-NS2 complex, rather than the glycoproteins in isolation (Bentham et al., 2014). We hypothesise (as described in the Discussion during description of specific infectivity measurements) that p7 may insert into the membrane post-translationally, independent of the SRP – this explains how HCV with deletion of half of the p7 sequence remains viable despite predicted effects upon polyprotein topology (papers from Thomas Pietschmann laboratory). Hence, basic loop mutations and some other changes seemingly cause E2 degradation because of aberrant E2-p7-NS2 processing.</p><p>Notably, the majority of intracellular particles are associated with the ER (Gastaminza et al., 2007) and so are not exposed to acidification that might be expected to induce glycoprotein degradation; p7 inhibitors therefore have little effect upon bulk intracellular infectivity and solely block secretion of infectious virus (Foster et al., 2011). Moreover, they are seemingly less effective against cell-to-cell spread, which presumably bypasses the acidifying secretory pathway followed by released virions (Meredith et al., 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The demonstration of p7 being present within the virion would be the conclusive evidence that has been sought after for years to prove p7 might be involved in entry. The authors are well aware of this and have addressed is as well as anyone could do. The future experiments discussed in the eleventh paragraph of the Discussion will be innovative approaches to readdress this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We wholly agree. Our previously published p7-specific antisera were previously employed in this regard (EM, antibody-mediated blockade of infection), yet the data were not reproduced to a satisfactory standard prior to supplies of our sera being sadly exhausted. Nevertheless, whilst preliminary data supported the presence of p7 within virions, we are keen to confirm this using our modified compounds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>In Shaw et al. the authors describe an unbiased approach for screening novel inhibitors of HCV. Using this strategy followed by chemical evolution to improve the initial hit, they successfully identify a new inhibitor: JK3/32. The authors were then able to computationally identify a putative binding site for the molecule on the HCV p7 channel, and systematically test the requirement of several functional groups for inhibitor activity. Using JK3/32, the authors suggest a new function of p7 in viral entry.</p><p>1) One question I cannot answer is whether the identified compound is different enough from previously identified drugs to represent a substantial breakthrough from what is already known.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that the reviewer refers to the first generation hit compounds (e.g. LDS19, Figure 1—figure supplement 3), rather than prototypic inhibitors such as rimantadine etc. The first gen compounds were screened in silico using our NMR-based channel structure template and some, including LDS19, showed similar potency to JK3/32 (Foster et al., 2014). However, LDS19 was one of a number of structurally distinct hits lacking a common pharmacophore, meaning that we were unable to derive an SAR.</p><p>The iterative development of LDS19 into JK3/32 and other structural analogues allowed us to correlate the functionally important aspects of the molecule with the predicted structure, generating a comprehensive SAR. In turn, this alignment of chemical variants with relative potency/lack thereof provided us with confidence around the biological relevance of our hairpin-based channel model, in preference to the genotype 5a structure. Moreover, we were able to predict and subsequently prove that e.g. R21 is unlikely to demonstrate potency vs. GT1b channels as well deriving the modified tool compound. Without this chemical and structural information, we would not have possessed the requisite tools to investigate the controversial role of p7 during HCV entry.</p><p>Thus, JK3/32 is clearly superior to prototypic p7i and BIT225 in terms of potency and specificity, yet is also a major leap forwards in the chemical toolbox with which to investigate fundamental biology, as well as taking forward for future drug development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1—figure supplement 2: Is the increase in activity of some human kinases statistically significant? Have the authors considered whether an increase in activity could also lead to toxicity in cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for not explaining this assay sufficiently. The data shown are an average of two in vitro measurements assessing recombinant/purified kinases activity in the presence of drug or carrier; we have added the appropriate error bars for standard deviations. This is a well-regarded service provided by the MRC PPU in Dundee, albeit capturing only a subset of the kinome expressed within Huh7 or other cells.</p><p>The reviewer rightly notes the apparent increase in activity for certain kinases. No statistically significant differences were discernible across the data set using multiple T-Tests, and the relevance of increased activity within an in vitro setting is not clear. Moreover, addition of 10-μM compound to native kinases presumably reflects a much higher level exposure than that likely to occur within a cell, even when using the JK3/32 concentrations required to inhibit virus entry.</p><p>Detailed exploration of potential off-target effects upon cellular kinases would comprise part of future drug development, yet the kinase screen herein constitutes just one aspect of the toxicity screening undertaken during this study. Whilst some compounds were indeed found to adversely affect cellular viability, JK3/32 and the majority of the related series showed encouraging selectivity indices, based upon both producer cell confluency (IncuCyte) and metabolic activity (MTT).</p><p>In addition, we tested several compounds for effects upon cellular confluency over time, again using the IncuCyte. The additional data, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, shows negligible effects for JK3/32, whereas BIT225 (potently) and rimantadine (high concentrations) do indeed affect this process. We can incorporate this data into the manuscript if required, although not all of the series was assessed in this way – please do let us know.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52555-resp-fig1-v4.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figures 2/3: Is it possible to confirm the binding site of JK3/32 to p7 directly using mutational analysis to strengthen the computational and simulation analysis reported here? It seems the authors do something similar in Atkins et al., 2014? Perhaps the effects of JK3/32 on different viral genotypes could shed some light on this, provided viruses containing natural mutations within the binding site have already been identified.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see above for discussion of this very important aspect of the study.</p><p>The sequences studied in Atkins et al., 2014 were complete p7 sequences cloned from a genotype 1a patient cohort, then inserted into a H77/JFH-1 infectious clone backbone. Thus, we had no direct input into the nature of these mutations. Notably, several mutations caused variable effects upon viral “fitness” in terms of protein expression, infectious virus production, and indeed inhibitor sensitivity. This is perhaps unsurprising given studies from e.g. the Bartenschlager laboratory showing complementation of p7 mutations by changes in NS2, and other viral proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4: As with above, can it be demonstrated that direct mutations to p7 affect viral entry? Experiments described in Figure 5 convincingly demonstrate that the effect of JK3/32 is unlikely an off-target effect on the host cells, but it would be helpful to more directly establish that this effect is due to binding only to the p7 channel. This is particularly true in light of the apparent difficulty of providing evidence that p7 channels exist directly in virions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be an ideal experiment, yet it is unfortunately the case that mutations intended to disrupt p7 ion channel function have deleterious effects upon alternative functions. Extensive discussion of the most commonly employed mutation in this regard, substitutions of the cytosolic basic loop, is already present within the manuscript.</p><p>We have undertaken extensive mutagenesis of the p7 sequence in several HCV genotypes, analysing phenotypes both in vitro and in the context of virus infection. Often mutations have effects upon E2-p7-NS2 processing/stability, as discussed in the response to reviewer 1. As described above, it remains to be seen whether rational mutagenesis of the peripheral binding site might attenuate JK3/32 binding in the J4 p7 context.</p><p>Finally, returning to the three points raised at the start of this rebuttal, we infer that the reviewer appears more interested in determining genetic evidence for the role of p7 during entry, rather than the specific interactions underpinning JK3/32 binding. We again note that a single amino acid change in the p7 sequence specifically alters the sensitivity of HCV to a p7 inhibitor, namely rimantadine. Moreover, if our predictions are correct then the action of R21 upon JFH-1 entry is similarly supportive. Thus, genetic evidence of a requirement for p7 channel activity during entry already – in our view – exists within the data presented herein, yet we obviously regret not being able to conduct further experiments to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>The manuscript by Shaw et al. identifies a potent HCV p7 inhibitor (p7i) by structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. In addition, rational SAR-based compound design in combination with atomistic molecular dynamics revealed the basic compound structure for their inhibition studies and pinpointed the potential binding pocket of JK3/32. Interestingly, the authors could show that JK3/32 is not only inhibiting viral secretion but also interferes with HCV cell entry. This study is well designed and performed. Moreover, it supports the role of p7 as an important viral protein for HCV entry. Altogether this study brings to light the importance of viroporin inhibitors as new generation drug classes for HCV treatment.</p><p>The following suggestions would increase the overall clarity of the study and improve the quality of the data.</p><p>1) The molecular dynamics simulation studies would be benefit from the addition of the RMSD values of the unbound protein (without JK3/32) for comparison</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies, this was only included in supplementary figures for rimantadine previously – this is now rectified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A detailed scheme of the molecular interactions of JK3/32 with Leu20Phe p7 mutant as for Figure 3B would be a nice addition to the current Figure 3C.</p></disp-quote><p>We entirely agree, and this has now been included, although the Leu20Phe mutation data is now moved to Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2 due to space constraints.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Entry inhibition studies (Figure 4) would benefit from a positive control drug such as flunarizine, which targets the potential fusion peptide within E1.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see above discussion. Again, we are happy to conduct such experiments when feasible, but also feel that the accumulation of genotype and compound-specific activity during entry is similarly supportive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The HCVpp experiments with prototypical glycoproteins (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C) and VSV-Gpps are missing the GNA control.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies, this is now included showing HCV-specific effects with no effect upon VSV-G pseudotyped viruses.</p></body></sub-article></article>
