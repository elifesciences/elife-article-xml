Multiple mechanisms contribute to NMJ repair and maintenance; however muscle stem cells (satellite cells, SCs), are deemed to have little impact on these processes. Therefore, the applicability of SC studies to attenuate muscle loss due to NMJ deterioration as observed in neuromuscular diseases and aging is ambiguous. We employed mice with an inducible Cre, and conditionally expressed DTA to deplete or GFP to track SCs. We found SC depletion exacerbated muscle atrophy and type transitions connected to neuromuscular disruption. Also, elevated fibrosis and further declines in force generation were specific to SC depletion and neuromuscular disruption. Fate analysis revealed SC activity near regenerating NMJs. Moreover, SC depletion aggravated deficits in reinnervation and post-synaptic morphology at regenerating NMJs. Therefore, our results propose a mechanism whereby further NMJ and skeletal muscle decline ensues upon SC depletion and neuromuscular disruption.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09221.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09221.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09221.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>New muscle fibers are made throughout our lives to replace those that have been damaged by normal wear and tear, and to meet new physical demands. These new muscle fibers develop from a pool of muscle stem cells. To create and maintain fully working muscles, nerve cells called motor neurons must also properly attach to the muscle fibers. These nerve cells transmit messages from the brain that tell the muscles what to do. If the muscle-nerve connections do not form correctly, or are severed, muscles can waste away. This may occur as part of a neuromuscular disease, and also happens to some extent as a normal part of aging.</p><p>It was thought that muscle stem cells do not affect how the muscle-nerve connections form.

During the healing process, the muscle stem cells are active near the regenerating connections.

Closer inspection of the muscle-nerve connections also revealed poorer quality connections were formed in the stem-cell deficient mice.</p><p>Further study of how stem cells help to form strong nerve-muscle connections may allow scientists to develop new treatments for age- or disease-related muscle loss.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09221.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09221.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>denervation</kwd><kwd>motor neuron</kwd><kwd>sarcopenia</kwd><kwd>satellite cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000090</institution-id><institution>Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-14-1-0454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chakkalakal</surname><given-names>Joe V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR059646</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dirksen</surname><given-names>Robert T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH/NIA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG051456</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chakkalakal</surname><given-names>Joe V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NYSTEM</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>University of Rochester Training Grant C026877</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Wenxuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Skeletal muscle stem cells play important roles in the regeneration of neuromuscular junctions, and so present new targets for therapies to treat neuromuscular decline observed in the context of aging and various neuromuscular diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscle is composed of long multinucleated cells, muscle fibers (myofibers), which function as primary effectors for force production and contribute to the regulation of whole body metabolism. Although primarily a post-mitotic tissue, adult skeletal muscle possesses a remarkable capacity for regeneration. This capacity is endowed by a population of resident stem cells, satellite cells (SCs), identified by the expression of the paired box transcription factor Pax7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tajbakhsh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brack and Rando, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yin et al., 2013</xref>). In adults, SCs normally reside in a quiescent state at the interface between the myofiber and overlying basal lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yin et al., 2013</xref>). However, in response to degenerative stimuli, Pax7+ SCs activate and divide to produce myogenic progenitors for skeletal muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tajbakhsh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yin et al., 2013</xref>). Since the initial identification of SCs over 50 years ago, many studies have examined roles for these cells in a plethora of distinct models of skeletal muscle injury, adaptability and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mauro, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>). Both depletion of Pax7+ SCs and targeted disruption of Pax7 have shown these cells to be an essential source of myonuclei for skeletal muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gunther et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">von Maltzahn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lepper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murphy et al., 2011</xref>). Depletion studies have revealed roles for Pax7+ SCs in late stages of experimentally induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fry et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, SCs were also shown to function as a source of growth factors to facilitate bone fracture healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abou-Khalil et al., 2015</xref>). Similar strategies have shown SCs contribute to myofibers and regulate aspects of skeletal muscle integrity during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keefe et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In adults, each myofiber is innervated by a single axon from a motor neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</xref>). Innervation occurs at a specialized site in the central region of myofibers, the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). The NMJ, which occupies approximately 0.1% of the surface area of a myofiber, initiates action potential propagation required for excitation/contraction coupling to generate force for movement and maintain myofiber properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassel-Duby and Olson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schiaffino and Reggiani, 2011</xref>). Consistent with a vital role for NMJ integrity in skeletal muscle maintenance, neuromuscular disruptions elicit severe myofiber atrophy, and are frequently associated with skeletal muscle dysfunction observed in the context of neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonzalez-Freire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moloney et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The regeneration of NMJs in response to peripheral nerve lesions can occur, however the length and quality of recovery depends on the severity of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buti et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Williams et al., 2009</xref>). Remarkably, the initial reinnervation of synaptic basal lamina by motor axons can proceed in the absence of myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanes et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</xref>). However, in the absence of myofibers and associated SCs, the continued maintenance of reinnervated NMJs on basal lamina ghosts eventually declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanes et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</xref>). These observations indicate that myofiber derived factors or associated SCs may be required for the continued differentiation and maintenance of regenerated NMJs. Accordingly, myofiber components and derived factors have been identified to assist in the progressive differentiation of developing and regenerating NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fox et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Williams et al., 2009</xref>). In models of chronic denervation, where reinnervation is prevented, SCs activate and divide; however, the derived progenitors migrate into interstitial spaces, undergo defective differentiation or are lost via apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dedkov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borisov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruusgaard and Gundersen, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, little turnover of myonuclei and fusion of myogenic progenitors to chronically denervated parent myofibers have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruusgaard and Gundersen, 2008</xref>). Collectively, these studies have suggested SCs have limited, if any, roles in the regeneration of NMJs upon neuromuscular disruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gundersen and Bruusgaard, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Through the use of targeted genetic strategies we sought to reexamine the fates and roles of SCs in a model of peripheral nerve injury that enables NMJ regeneration. In this study we find a limited proportion of SCs activate and divide during NMJ reestablishment. Remarkably, while SC depletion did not lead to additional loss of skeletal muscle mass, it was sufficient to reduce myofiber size, increase inter-myofiber connective tissue (MCT) accumulation, and aggravate myofiber type transitions connected to NMJ disruption. These phenotypes were associated with further declines in force generation capacity. Examination of fate revealed increased SC activity and fusion of indelibly labeled SC-derived progenitors to myofibers predominantly in the vicinity of regenerating NMJs. Consistent with a role for SCs in the regeneration of NMJs, we found that SC depletion led to deficits in NMJ reinnervation, reductions in post-synaptic morphology and loss of post-synaptic myonuclei. Collectively our findings reveal fates and roles for SCs in the regeneration of NMJs and regulation of skeletal muscle integrity upon neuromuscular disruption.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SC depletion exacerbates myofiber atrophy and induces connective tissue accumulation in skeletal muscles after neuromuscular disruption</title><p>To examine the roles of SCs in skeletal muscles upon neuromuscular disruption we generated <italic>Pax7</italic><sup><italic>CreER/+</italic></sup><italic>; Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>DTA/+</italic></sup> (P7DTA) and <italic>Pax7</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup><italic>; Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>DTA/+</italic></sup> (Ctrl) mice.

We employed 1-2 mm sciatic nerve transection (SNT) to disrupt lower-limb NMJs. This form of surgery leads to complete denervation of adult NMJs. Although delayed, reinnervation as assessed by immunofluorescence (IF) and physiological measures does occur 4–6 weeks after SNT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buti et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Williams et al., 2009</xref>).

Gross examination of TA skeletal muscles 6 weeks after SNT surgery revealed overall reductions in girth, which were not noticeably different between P7DTA and Ctrl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). While the mass of TA, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles 6 weeks after SNT relative to contralateral sham controls remained low, SC depletion did not induce further loss of muscle mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). Examination of individual myofibers from EDL muscles that had been fixed prior to isolation from lower limbs revealed only modest reductions in myonuclear density after SNT and SC depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and C</xref>). Based on these moderate losses, a small albeit significant level of myonuclear turnover was observed in P7DTA sham muscles. Therefore, the magnitude of myonuclear loss after SNT relative to sham in P7DTA skeletal muscles is small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Next we examined myofiber size based on Laminin IF analysis of transverse sections from TA muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Despite 6 weeks of recovery, Ctrl myofiber size after SNT remained ∼25% lower relative to contralateral sham, however, SC depletion led to further SNT-induced myofiber atrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Distribution analysis of myofiber size did not reveal any significant differences between Ctrl and P7DTA muscles after sham surgery, but a significant shift towards smaller sizes after SNT surgery was observed upon SC depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). No change in myofiber numbers was observed after SNT and SC depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Results from the Peterson group revealed that SC depletion led to a fibrotic response in long-term overloaded muscles and elevated MCT accumulation in aged muscles, suggesting that SCs regulate the myofiber extracellular environment through inhibiting fibroblast function during skeletal muscle remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fry et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, multiple populations of muscle interstitial cells (MICs) have been identified with fibro-adipogenic potential, such as Fibro-adiopogenic progenitors (FAPs), PDGFRα+ MICs or ADAM12 + perivascular cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Uezumi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dulauroy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malecova and Puri, 2012</xref>). These cells may serve as functional niche components for SCs, and their cross-talk with SCs may regulate muscle regeneration and fibrosis associated with NMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malecova and Puri, 2012</xref>). How the functional interactions between SCs, fibroblasts and MICs affect fibrosis either through cell contact or the release of soluble factors requires further study.</p><p>Myofiber type transition and declines in force generation capacity are highly correlated with NMJ disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Windisch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Rodent models revealed that peripheral nerve lesions cause fast to slow myofiber transitions and a substantial increase in the proportion of type IIA myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Windisch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>). A preferential loss of fast-type type IIB neuromuscular synapses has been reported in aged and NMD-afflicted muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frey et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, we showed an induction of type IIA and loss of type IIB myofibers after SNT. This SNT-induced increase of type IIA myofibers was aggravated upon SC depletion, in line with our later finding that more P7DTA NMJs remain denervated after SNT. Concomitantly, after SNT and SC depletion we observed a notable induction of hybrid myofibers, a typical feature of NMD-afflicted and aged skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klitgaard et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krivickas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Palencia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stevens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rowan et al., 2012</xref>). The mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of MyHC coexpression are still elusive. One possibility is induction of multiple MyHC isoforms following denervation and reinnervation by multiple motor neurons that specify distinct myofiber types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pette and Staron, 2000</xref>). Our results also revealed that SC depletion led to declines in force generation capacity after neuromuscular disruption. Both accumulated MCT content and abnormal expression of contractile proteins could partially account for the loss of whole skeletal muscle force generation after SC depletion and SNT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldwin and Haddad, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kjaer, 2004</xref>). Also, impaired NMJ regeneration in response to neuromuscular disruption might contribute to the additional loss of force generating capacity in SC-depleted muscles compared to Ctrl after SNT<italic>.</italic> In support, declines in force generating capacity are a feature of partially denervated and aged skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Urbanchek et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kalliainen et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Limited if any cellular turnover and no net loss of myonuclei has been reported in chronically denervated skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruusgaard and Gundersen, 2008</xref>). Therefore, it has been concluded that muscle mass loss in the context of denervation-induced atrophy primarily reflects imbalances between protein synthesis and degradation as opposed to cellular turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gundersen and Bruusgaard, 2008</xref>). Our SNT surgery, however, leads to complete denervation and the eventual reinnervation of the vast majority of myofibers 4–6 weeks after surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buti et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Williams et al., 2009</xref>). Chronic denervation models do have greater levels of myofiber atrophy than observed with the SNT employed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Snow, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruusgaard and Gundersen, 2008</xref>). Although chronic denervation leads to SC activation, it is generally accepted that limited fusion of SC derived progenitors to atrophying parent myofibers occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borisov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruusgaard and Gundersen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gundersen and Bruusgaard, 2008</xref>). Rather, SCs and derived progenitors tend to migrate into interstitial spaces where they undergo apoptosis, are believed to contribute to the formation of nascent myofibers with distinct basal lamina juxtaposed to parent atrophying myofibers, or contribute to other forms of failed myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borisov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruusgaard and Gundersen, 2008</xref>). It will be of interest to determine whether SCs are a source of nascent myofibers and failed myogenesis, and how this contributes to myofiber size changes during chronic denervation.</p><p>Even though only a small percentage of SCs were found to activate after SNT, surprisingly we found that SC activation and SC-derived progenitor fusion primarily occurred in central portions of myofibers, in the vicinity of NMJs. Moreover, more denervated and degenerated (based on post-synaptic morphology) NMJs observed in SC depleted skeletal muscles after SNT were associated with significant declines in the number of post-synaptic myonuclei at NMJs. These phenotypes indicate the importance of regionalized SC activity for regenerating NMJs. Central nucleation was not a prominent feature of myofibers 4–6 weeks after SNT. Recently transient central nuclei were observed along the length of aging myofibers at random locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Whether such transient degenerative regenerative events occur in the vicinity of NMJs in response to SNT as part of program of myogenic progenitor differentiation and fusion remains to be determined. The factors that control SC activity and derived progenitor fusion at central myofiber regions in the vicinity of NMJs during NMJ disruption are unknown. One possibility is the local expression of SC fate regulators that support progenitor activity and fusion from myofibers, the principal SC niche cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bischoff, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yin et al., 2013</xref>). Alternatively, denervation may trigger the expression of factors that suppress SC activation and differentiation at extra-synaptic myofiber regions. Factors implicated in SC quiescence and activation include loss of Notch signaling and increased fibroblast growth factor (FGF) or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yin et al., 2013</xref>). TGFβ superfamily signaling, which is elevated in denervated skeletal muscle, is a well-established suppressor of myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kollias and McDermott, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sartori et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, Jak/Stat and Wnt signaling are factors that regulate SC derived myogenic progenitor differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Price et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tierney et al., 2014</xref>). Whether any of these factors limit SC activation and differentiation in the vicinity of denervated NMJs will require molecular dissection of myofibers at distinct regions.</p><p>Post-synaptic myonuclei are specialized for the expression of synapse-enriched genes required for the development, differentiation, consolidation and maintenance of both pre- and post-synaptic components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schaeffer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hippenmeyer et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with vital roles, the etiology of some NMDs includes reductions in post-synaptic myonuclear number and integrity. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is characterized by a loss of post-synaptic myonuclei together with deficits in skeletal muscle innervation, post-synaptic AChR morphology and the induction of gene expression programs consistent with denervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mejat et al., 2009</xref>). A feature of Slow-channel syndrome, a congenital myasthenia disorder, includes apoptotic activity and the accumulation of DNA damage at post-synaptic myonuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). Genetic studies have also shown the importance of post-synaptic myonuclei towards NMJ development. Mice null for Syne-1, a nuclear anchoring protein, display loss of post-synaptic myonuclei together with gross deficits in the innervation of embryonic skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, reductions of post-synaptic myonuclei in SC-depleted skeletal muscles after SNT could manifest in the loss of gene expression programs required for the regeneration and maintenance of NMJs.</p><p>Similar to what we observed with SC-depleted skeletal muscles after NMJ disruption, myofiber type transitions, decreases in NMJ regenerative capacity and force generation are also features of aged and NMD-afflicted skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Verdu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Urbanchek et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kalliainen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hegedus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rowan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kang and Lichtman, 2013</xref>). Since loss of SC number and function is also associated with aging and NMDs, it will be of interest to determine in these contexts the interrelationship between reduced integrity of Pax7+ SCs impaired NMJ regeneration and correlated skeletal muscle dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pradat et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hayhurst et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6, <italic>Pax7</italic><sup><italic>CreERT2</italic></sup> (017763) <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>mTmG</italic></sup> (007576) and <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>DTA</italic></sup> (009669) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>mTmG</italic></sup> or <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>DTA</italic></sup> mice were crossed with <italic>Pax7</italic><sup><italic>CreERT2</italic></sup> mice to generate <italic>Pax7</italic><sup><italic>CreER/+</italic></sup>; <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>mTmG/+</italic></sup> (P7mTmG) or <italic>Pax7</italic><sup><italic>CreER/+</italic></sup>; <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>DTA/+</italic></sup> (P7DTA) mice and control CreER negative (Ctrl) littermates.

The hindquarter was then carefully shaved and depilation completed with generic Nair hair removal cream prior to skin cleansing with gauze.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor), Amy Wagers (Reviewing Editor), and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and we have drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All the reviewers found your manuscript to be well written, with clear and compelling data using state-of-the-art techniques. Using inducible depletion of muscle satellite cells in vivo, the work shows convincingly that there are significant effects of satellite cell loss on myofiber size, accumulation of fibrotic tissue, myonuclear number, NMJ regeneration and muscle contractile activity in the context of experimentally induced denervation. Given ongoing discussions in the field regarding the contribution of satellite cells to these processes, the work is both timely and important, and likely to be of broad interest. The reviewers did have a few suggestions and queries to clarify certain points of data analysis and interpretation, which should be addressed on revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Given that mice were only followed for 6 weeks after satellite cell depletion, concluding that the modest decline in satellite cell numbers with aging contributes to NMJ impairments and muscle dysfunction associated with aging is overly speculative. Following mice for a longer period of time, into old age, in the absence of nerve transection is required to determine if satellite cells play a role in normal maintenance of the NMJ. Please temper these conclusions or provide additional data (if available).</p><p>2) There appears to be a disconnection in the quantification of different morphological features of the muscles. Nerve transection results in a decrease in myonuclear number only in control mice, not in P7DTA mice, and yet approximately 60% of fibers appear to have undergone satellite cell fusion in the lineage tracing experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). This apparent discrepancy should be discussed.</p><p>3) The representative images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> do not match the quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. In particular, far less than 20% of fibers appear to be labeled in Sham mice, which seems unlikely over the course of only 4 weeks. Similarly, the images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> do not reflect that 20% of the muscle area is occupied by collagen in Sham mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Please address these apparent discrepancies.</p><p>4) Given that nearly 100% of NMJs are at least partially denervated and 75% degenerated at 6 weeks in P7DTA mice, the rather modest effect on fiber size is surprising. Comparison to mice, 6 weeks following nerve transection in which regeneration is totally blocked, would be helpful for perspective and to judge the relative impact of satellite cell depletion on the process of nerve regeneration. Presumably those data are available in the authors' lab or in the literature.</p><p>5) The data regarding the occurrence of centrally nucleated fibers are a bit confusing as presented (in the subsection “Neuromuscular disruption stimulates SC contribution in the vicinity of NMJs”). It would be helpful to present these in graphical format. Also, are the authors indicating that the contribution of satellite cells to myofibers that is spurred by denervation does not produce central nucleation? Or that the incorporated nuclei are localizing specifically to the synaptic region? Some discussion in the text on this point would be useful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09221.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Given that mice were only followed for 6 weeks after satellite cell depletion, concluding that the modest decline in satellite cell numbers with aging contributes to NMJ impairments and muscle dysfunction associated with aging is overly speculative.

Regardless, we agree that the magnitude of myonuclei loss was modest in response to SNT in P7DTA muscles. We believe this reflects in part the moderate loss of myonuclei in P7DTA sham myofibers. We have included some sentences for this observation (in the subsection “SC depletion exacerbates myofiber atrophy and induces connective tissue accumulation in skeletal muscles after neuromuscular disruption”). We apologize if we have given the impression that there is a direct correlation between the proportion of myofibers within a given muscle that have undergone a fusion event (in theory 1 out of hundreds of myonuclei within a myofiber), and myonuclear number within an individual myofiber. We have included a statement to clarify that myofiber proportions within an entire skeletal muscle should not be correlated with myonuclei loss within an individual myofiber (in the subsection “Neuromuscular disruption stimulates SC contribution in the vicinity of NMJs”).</p><p><italic>3) The representative images shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7A</italic></xref> <italic>do not match the quantification in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7B</italic></xref><italic>.
