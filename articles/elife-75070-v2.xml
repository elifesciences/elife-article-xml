However, its clinical application remains controversial, hampered by two major factors: (1) Many of the CNS injury sites, such as the optic nerve (ON), are deeply buried, preventing access for local TH. The alternative is to apply TH systemically, which significantly limits the applicable temperature range. (2) Even with possible access for ‘local refrigeration’, cold-induced cellular damage offsets the benefit of TH. Here we present a clinically translatable model of traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) by applying clinical trans-nasal endoscopic surgery to goats and non-human primates. This model faithfully recapitulates clinical features of TON such as the injury site (pre-chiasmatic ON), the spatiotemporal pattern of neural degeneration, and the accessibility of local treatments with large operating space. We also developed a computer program to simplify the endoscopic procedure and expand this model to other large animal species. Moreover, applying a cold-protective treatment, inspired by our previous hibernation research, enables us to deliver deep hypothermia (4 °C) locally to mitigate inflammation and metabolic stress (indicated by the transcriptomic changes after injury) without cold-induced cellular damage, and confers prominent neuroprotection both structurally and functionally. Intriguingly, neither treatment alone was effective, demonstrating that in situ deep hypothermia combined with cold protection constitutes a breakthrough for TH as a therapy for TON and other CNS traumas.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Hypothermic therapy is a radical type of treatment that involves cooling a person’s core body temperature several degrees below normal to protect against brain damage. Lowering body temperature slows blood flow, which reduces inflammation, and eases metabolic demands, similar to hibernation. It can also reduce lasting damage to the brain and aid recovery when used to treat people who have gone into cardiac arrest, where their heart suddenly stops beating.</p><p>Recently, there has been renewed interest in using hypothermic therapy to treat people who have sustained traumatic brain injuries, which can cause brain swelling, and other nerve injuries. However, its use remains controversial because clinical trials have failed to show that inducing mild hypothermia provides any benefit for people with severe nerve injuries. This might be because cooling cells to near-freezing temperatures can damage their internal structural supports, called microtubules, thwarting any therapeutic benefit.</p><p>Traumatic optical neuropathy is a type of injury in which the optic nerve – the nerve that connects the eyes to the brain – is damaged or severed, causing vision loss. There is currently no clinically proven treatment for this condition, nor is there a system that can test local treatments in large animals as a prior test to using the treatment in the clinic. Therefore, Zhang et al. wanted to establish such a animal model and test whether local hypothermic therapy could help protect the optic nerve.</p><p>Zhang et al. used a surgical tool guided by an endoscope (a thin plastic tube with a light and camera attached to it) to injure the optic nerves of goats, and then deliver hypothermic therapy. To cool the surgically-injured nerves to a chilly 4C, Zhang et al. applied a deep-cooling agent, using a second reagent (a cocktail of protease inhibitors) to protect the cells’ microtubules from cold-induced damage, an insight gained from a previous study of hibernating animals. This was critical, as the hypothermic therapy was only effective when the secondary protective agent was applied. The combination therapy developed by Zhang et al. relieved some aspects of nerve degeneration at the injury site and activated an anti-inflammatory response in cells, but did not restore vision.</p><p>To simplify surgical techniques, Zhang et al. also developed a computer program which generates virtual surgical paths for up-the-nose endoscopic procedures based on brain scans of an animal’s skull. This program was successfully applied in a range of large animals, including goats and macaque monkeys.</p><p>Zhang et al.’s work establishes a method to study treatments for traumatic optical neuropathy using large animals, including hypothermic therapy. The methods developed could also be useful to study other optic nerve disorders, such as optic neuritis or ischemic optic neuropathy.</p></abstract><kwd-group

hypothermic (TH) has a long history and was firstly described in the Edwin Smith papyrus over 5000 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Although TH has shown neuroprotection in animal models of central nervous system (CNS) trauma such as spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) by reducing neuroinflammation and alleviating metabolic demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martirosyan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rey-Funes et al., 2017</xref>), its clinical application following CNS injury remains controversial. Randomized controlled clinical trials of TH for traumatic brain injury (TBI) failed to show beneficial effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clifton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clifton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kramer et al., 2012</xref>). In SCI, TH has not been proven to be neuroprotective in randomized controlled clinical trials, and its effect in animal models is inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martirosyan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>At least two major factors hamper the clinical application of TH in CNS trauma. First, many CNS injury sites are located deeply, preventing access for local TH. Instead, TH is applied systemically. But systemic drops in body temperature increase the risk of cardiopulmonary disorders, coagulopathy, and electrolyte disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schubert, 1995</xref>), so systemic TH is mainly limited to 34°C and 36°C. The limited temperature range of TH may account for its inadequate efficacy. Secondly, even if CNS trauma is accessible for local deep hypothermia, the cold destroys neuronal microtubules andmay counteract the benefit of TH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ou et al., 2018</xref>). Our previous study discovered a cold-protective mechanism in hibernators, and found that cold-protective reagents such as protease inhibitors (PI) rescue cold-induced cell damage. If these reagents were applied during local TH, then TH would be a more precise, safe, and effective tool to treat CNS traumas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ou et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The optic nerve (ON), which collects axons from retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), is an ideal CNS tissue to study CNS trauma because it is structurally simple.However, its deep location in the orbit and skull base hampers preclinical tests of local treatment for optic neuropathy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Minimally invasive trans-nasal endoscopy is widely used in modern neurosurgeries to access the distal ON (pre-chiasmatic and chiasmatic ON) in case of tumor or optic canal fracture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chamoun and Couldwell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Casler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goudakos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yan et al., 2017</xref>). The large sphenoid sinus along the distal ON provides sufficient space for local treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Here, we back-translated clinical trans-nasal endoscopy in large animals to safely expose the distal ON, allowing local damage, observation, and modulation. To facilitate clinical translation, we established a de novo TON model in goats and non-human primates by performing pre-chiasmatic ON crush. These models recapitulated clinical features of TON such as the injury site, the time course of progression, and the capability of local treatment via trans-nasal endoscopy.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Trans-nasal endoscopic-mediated exposure of pre-chiasmatic ON in goat is feasible and safe.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of anatomic segments of ON and sphenoid sinus (green circle) in human.

Next, we developed a computer program to detail feasible surgical pathways and to optimize the size of endoscopic tools according to a CT scan of the skull. This program was successful in goats, minipigs, beagles, and rhesus macaques. We trust that this software will help other research groups to replicate our novel TH strategy, and will facilitate preclinical tests for other local TON treatments.</p><p>This novel combination of TH and a cold-protection strategy can be readily applied not only in TON patients using the same procedures and devices, but also can potentially revolutionize conventional TH for other CNS trauma such as SCI and TBI. Furthermore, this translatable TON model allows pre-clinical testing of local treatments for axonopathy. Therapeutic approach for TON may move from less effective strategies (for example, observation alone, or systemic medication; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yu-Wai-Man and Griffiths, 2013</xref>) towards more targeted and potentially more effective treatment <italic>via</italic> minimally invasive trans-nasal endoscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Goat is an advantageous species for trans-nasal endoscopic access of the chiasmatic and pre-chiasmatic ON</title><p>We first looked for animal species suitable for trans-nasal exposure of the chiasmatic and pre-chiasmatic ON. Skull computerized tomography (CT) scan showed that the frontal cortex of the domestic pig and beagle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, asterisk) falls between the nasal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, number sign) and the pre-chiasmatic ON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, blue rectangle), thus blocking surgical access. The narrowest portion of rhesus macaque’s sphenoid bone body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, red circle) is too narrow (around 2.5 mm in width) to allow a conventional endoscopic microdrill (2.9 mm in diameter) to pass through. On the other hand, the size of the goat’s sphenoid bone body (13 mm in width) is similar to that of the human’s sphenoid sinus (20 mm in width), and there is no cortex in between the nasal cavity and the pre-chiasmatic ON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

This model faithfully resembles the key features of clinical TON, including specific injury site, spatiotemporal pattern of neurodegeneration, and the capability to locally modulate the injured pre-chiasmatic ON. RNA sequencing revealed that early changes were confined to the primary injury site and were enriched in inflammation, ischemia, and metabolism. Local co-delivery of hypothermia with cold-protective reagents showed significant structural and functional neuroprotection, but neither treatment was neuroprotective by itself. To ensure other research groups can faithfully replicate this endoscopy (for TH or for other ON treatments), we made a computer program to optimize surgical paths based on skull CT scans.

Drugs delivered systemically or regionally (that is, intraocularly, intra-orbitally, etc.) can hardly reach the injured distal ON at sufficient and stable concentrations due to the blood brain barrier, diffusion/dilution, and impaired axonal microvasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Upadhyay, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coles, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thale et al., 2002</xref>).

Instead, we targetted hypothermia to the injured pre-chiasmatic ON according to early transcriptomic changes in ischemia, inflammation, and metabolism pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Previous study also indicated that hypothermia-induced elevated expression of cold-shock proteins may contribute to neuronal protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rey-Funes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Larrayoz et al., 2016</xref>,) especially in the mild hypothermia range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). Hypothermic treatment may directly prevent neuronal degeneration, and early treatment is necessary to alleviate further progression of neural damage after optic nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rey-Funes et al., 2017</xref>) as well as after other CNS trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Markgraf et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Although hypothermic therapy was tested as a treatment for CNS trauma for many years, it has not shown neuroprotective effects in randomized controlled trials of TBI or SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martirosyan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dietrich and Bramlett, 2017</xref>). It is unclear why TH was ineffective, but cold-induced neural damage may counteract any therapeutic effects. Our recent work showed that the cold degrades neuronal microtubules, but neurons can be spared with reagents such as PI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ou et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, neurons were protected when TH was combined with PI. Neither treatment alone was effective. This novel combinatory strategy can be readily applied to TON patients using established endoscopic procedures, reviving TH as a therapy for TON and other CNS traumas.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Advantages of our TON model compared with other TON models</title><sec id="s3-3-1"><title>Clinical translatability</title><p>Compared with the conventional retrobulbar ON crush model, our model with pre-chiasmatic ON injury resembles key clinical features of TON such as the specific injury site and the time course of neural degeneration, and allows local trans-nasal treatment using clinical endoscopic procedures and tools. As such, the pre-clinical tests of local treatment for TON succeeded in our model, and can be readily translated to TON patients. Recently, rodent models have been developed using indirect mechanisms (apply periorbital ultrasound or skull weight drop) to induce distal ON injury. Compared with direct optic nerve compression or crush, these models are likely more clinically relevant since most clinical TON cases are indirect and due to force transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evanson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastakis et al., 2019</xref>). However, due to force scattering, unwanted and uncontrolled collateral damage to the eyeball, contralateral optic nerve, orbit, or skull often occurr in these models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evanson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tao et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, the success rate of these modeling methods is not as high as direct optic nerve crush; for example, 10% mice died immediately after head weight drop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evanson et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the extension of these modelling methods to large animal species has not been reported. Therefore, clinically translatable, local treatment of injured ONs via trans-nasal endoscopy cannot be performed in these small animal models.</p><p>Non-human primates including rhesus macaques have human-like visual systems and pathophysiological responses to CNS injury which do not exist in other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Preuss, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Friedli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nardone et al., 2017</xref>.) Our work provides goat and non-human primate TON models to meet different experimental needs and budget plans for mechanistic studies or pre-clinical tests of effective treatments. Of note, the macaque model shows much more GCC thinning ( &lt; 50%) at 3 months after injury than the goat model, likely due to much higher retinal ganglion cell density in the macaque (~1000 cells/1 mm<sup>2</sup>, Figure S7) than the goat (~200 cells/ 1 mm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-2"><title>Accessibility to the injury site within a large operating space (sphenoid sinus)</title><p>In this study, histological and transcriptomic analyses found that axonal damage was initially confined to the primary injury site. The affected pathways (ischemia, inflammation, and metabolism) offer potential therapeutic targets. In our model, the chiasmatic and pre-chiasmatic ON can be exposed safely under direct visual guidance within the spacious sphenoid sinus, facilitating in situ damage, observation, and treatment of the ON with complex devices.</p><p>Traditional retrobulbar approach in rodent model allows access only to the most proximal ON within the crowded orbit. Furthermore, exposure of the retrobulbar ON is much harder in human or large animal models, and requires lateral orbitotomy, which causes transient orbital edema and retinal dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Although access to the distal ON can be achieved by a conventional intra-cranial approach with corticectomy or a recently developed intra-orbital approach by blind injection, these approaches may cause unwanted collateral damage to the important adjacent tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mesentier-Louro et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the operating space is restricted in these approaches due to crowding in the cranial cavity or orbital apex.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-3"><title>Facilitation eye-brain reconnection</title><p>According to our study, the axonal density of the intra-orbital ON segment remained statistically intact 1 mpi; therefore, ON regeneration can start from the pre-chiasmatic ON segment. On the contrary, the traditional retrobulbar ON crush model requires a much longer ON regeneration distance to reconnect with the brain (i.e. the distance is doubled compared with our TON model), making functional regeneration extremely challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, our TON model allows local modulation of the microenvironment of the pre-chiasmatic and chiasmatic ON to fuel and guide ON regeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations of this study</title><p>Our TON model is clinical relevant in terms of injury site, subsequent spatiotemporal pattern of retrograde axonal degeneration, and availability of trans-nasal local treatment. However, the mechanism of optic nerve injury in our model differs from that in most clinical TON cases, in which the intra-canalicular optic nerve is injured by an indirect mechanism (stretching and shearing forces), rather than by direct compressing forces. Additionally, the current local treatment did not achieve functional recovery of the eye-to-brain pathway, and its long-term therapeutic effect is unclear. In contrast, while cold treatment at the injury site has the advantages of being local, precisely controlled, and deeper hypothermia, previous articles that applied cold treatment to the whole animal also obtained positive results in vision preservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rey-Funes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rey-Funes et al., 2021</xref>), indicating that cold treatment applied to the retina or to the whole animal may be further explored and perhaps in conjunction with local hypothermia. Another limitation of this study is a small sample size in each therapeutic group. We were aware that an analysis of sample size and power were needed for each comparison. However, due to ethical issue and limitations of housing space and other resources, we only used 3–6 goats/rhesus macaques in each group according to our previous experimental experience. Additionally, we did not repeat TH in rhesus macaques due to budget limitations and ethical concerns. In the near future, we will optimize TH with different onset times of treatment, therapeutic durations, temperature ranges, dosages, and formulae of cold-protective reagents in the goat, and then test the optimized TH strategy in the non-human primate model. Warmer temperatures in between 27°C and 33°C may achieve neuroprotection without damaging cytoskeleton, which needs to be further optimized through in vitro and in vivo studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Further application of this model</title><p>In the present study, we safely exposed the chiasmatic and pre-chiasmatic ON within the spacious sphenoid sinus. This allows for several promising avenues of research. (1) Access to the ON allows for other ON disorder models, such as optic neuritis or ischemic optic neuropathy, simply by introducing local damage. (2) Optical and electrical diagnostic tools may be placed in situ, including confocal endomicroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belykh et al., 2019</xref>) and endoscopic OCT. (3) In situ treatments can be tested at the pre-chiasmatic and chiasmatic ON, to prevent axonal degeneration and promote long-distance axonal regeneration by modulating the micro-environment. These treatments could be partnered with intra-vitreal manipulations to maximize RGC survival and ON regeneration. (4) Our work may potentially be applied in other CNS traumas such as SCI or diffused axonal injury in TBI, as well as early axonal degeneration in Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and normal aging (<xref

Four- to 7 month-old male Saanen goats weighing 19–22 kg were purchased from the Caimu Livestock Company (Hangzhou, China) and housed in the animal facility of the Wenzhou Medical University. The rhesus macaques aged from 5 to 7 years weighing 5–7 kg were housed in the animal facility of the Joinn Laboratory. All animals were housed in an air-conditioned room (21°C ± 2°C) under a normal light/dark cycle (12/12 hr) with food ad libitum. Goats were euthanized with 10% potassium chloride (40 ml, intravenously) after general anesthesia using xylazine (3 mg/kg, IM).

Anesthesia was maintained with 3% isoflurane in oxygen and air (1:1) at a rate of 2 L/min by using a mechanical ventilator. Then atropine, ceftiofur sodium, gentamicin, dexamethasone, esmolol hydrochloride, and hemocoagulase atrox were injected (detailed information of each drug is listed in the ‘Key Resources Table’).</p><p>After skin preparation with povidone-iodine solution (20 ml, 5%, Zhejiang Apeloa Inc, China), a vertical double-T-shaped incision on the nose was made through the skin and periosteum. Following blunt dissection, the underlying nasal bone was removed to access the nasal cavity. Under trans-nasal endoscopy (Delong, HD380B), the middle turbinate and posterior olfactory nerve filaments were partially removed by an endoscopic microdebrider (Medtronic, 1884004) powered by the Integrated Power Console system (Medtronic, Integrated Power Console ENT Surgery, 1898001) to expose the ipsilateral anterior wall of the sphenoid bone. To increase surgical operating space, the nasal septum and part of the contralateral olfactory nerve filaments were also resected to fully expose the anterior bony wall of the sphenoid bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref><bold>, left panel</bold>). To access the pre-chiasmatic ON within the sphenoid bone, an endoscopic microdrill (Medtronic, diamond microdrill, 1882969) was employed to drill the overlying cortical bone. The posterior myeloid tissue within the sphenoid bone body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref><bold>, right panel</bold>) was aspirated and drilled to create an artificial sphenoid sinus, within which the chiasmatic and pre-chiasmatic ON lay posteriorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alfredo Martinez (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both of the reviewers agreed that the work is well-conducted, but there are some concerns, as detailed below, that need to be addressed. Also, it is felt that conclusions regarding the immediate physiological relevance are overstated and need to be scaled back.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Zhang et al. describes a new surgical procedure to access the optic nerve in large mammals to provide therapeutic hypothermia. The study has been performed with care and represents a significant step forward in the use of therapeutic hypothermia in the treatment of ocular conditions. Nevertheless, I would like to offer some suggestions to try to improve the manuscript:</p><p>1) In the introduction, the authors may want to add some previous references about the application of therapeutic hypothermia in rodents to prevent optic nerve-induced vision losses (see, for instance, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28761115/).</p><p>2) Once the authors have the optic nerve available, they apply a very deep hypothermia (0ºC). Previous studies have shown that a local reduction of 4-10ºC is enough to unleash the beneficial effects of therapeutic hypothermia (see, for instance, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33897437/). There is no wonder this extremely cold treatment results in the destruction of neuron´s cytoskeleton. Moreover, this may be the reason why the protease inhibitors are needed. Authors should discuss the possibility of using warmer temperatures to induce the beneficial effects and, probably, avoid the need of using the inhibitors.</p><p>3) Authors say that therapeutic hypothermia works by reducing neuroinflammation and alleviating metabolic demand (lines 59-60). This is true but, in the last few years, different groups have been working on the hypothesis that cold-shock proteins may be involved in the beneficial effects of therapeutic hypothermia (see, for instance, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33897437/; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27556928/). These proteins belong to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNPs) family and bind specific mRNAs, prolonging their half-life, and increasing their protein expression. Since these proteins are usually involved in survival pathways, this is an interesting mechanism to explain the benefits of hypothermia. Interestingly enough, in their transcriptomic study, authors show that the protein group with a higher gene ratio was &quot;ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis&quot; (Figures S3B and S4C). This could indicate the involvement of cold-sock proteins in their model. Authors may want to add a paragraph to the discussion commenting on this issue.</p><p>4) An important piece of data that is missing is how much time passed from the moment of the crush until the application of the hypothermic treatment. The authors conclude that their treatment did not translate into a significant rescue of the FVEP or PLR, although there was some reduction in neural degeneration (lines 216-227). This lack of &quot;complete&quot; prevention may be related with the time that passed from the injury until the treatment. Previous studies in the rat have shown an almost complete prevention of vision loss when applying hypothermia within the first hour after injury (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28761115/). In the same line of thought, the authors also say that &quot;making functional regeneration is extremely challenging&quot; (lines 350-351). I tend to agree with them. But my thought is that hypothermic treatment should be directed to prevent neuronal degeneration rather than to induce axon regeneration. Here, again, the important question is the time passed from the injury until the treatment. This point should be properly discussed.</p><p>5) I´m a little confused about the statistical analysis. The authors say (correctly) that they used normality tests to decide whether parametric or non-parametric tests should be used (lines 627-629). But then I see a lot of 2-way ANOVA tests performed with sets containing just 3 or 4 independent data. In my experience, the probability of getting normal distributions with such small numbers is rather unlikely. I would appreciate if the authors could confirm that all the experiments where they used parametric tests had been confirmed as having a normal distribution. Otherwise, non-parametric tests should be performed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Beyond the critiques in the Public Comments section, I have the following:</p><p>1. The Introduction (particularly lines 86 – 96) summarize the experimental results too much rather than just introducing the experimental questions and approach. If anything, this summary would be better suited for the Discussion.</p><p>2. In Figure 1, the term &quot;sham&quot; is used in describing the surgery to expose the prechiasmal optic nerve without injuring it. This term is not used in the text of the Results section, and so it is confusing to the reader. (For instance, &quot;sham&quot; might refer to just putting the endoscope into the nasal cavity without penetrating bone). It should be made clear that sham is doing the entire procedure and just stopping short of intentionally crushing the nerve.</p><p>3. In multiple places in the figure legends, the RGC marker RBPMS is mistakenly written as &quot;RBMPS&quot;.</p><p>4. Figure 2A: to increase understanding, the right-most panel should show some compressed optic nerve tissue being pressed against the remaining wall of the optic canal. The fact that no optic nerve is shown at all in this panel is confusing (as if it has been removed).</p><p>5. Figure 2B: are the two panels at different magnifications? Should adjust so that they are the same magnification or provide a scale bar.</p><p>6. Figure 2C: the placement of asterisks at PLR = 1 is confusing, because these look like data points. I believe that the actual data is a PLR of 0 for all post-injury time points (shown as colored line segments that are easy to overlook).</p><p>7. Figure 3A: Are the authors surprised that even at 3 months post-injury the GCC thickness is &gt;70% that of the contralateral eye? In humans, I would expect much more thinning than this by 3 months. Furthermore, the macaque model shows much more GCC thinning at this time point. Is this a species-specific effect?</p><p>8. Figure 3A: Why is there a dip in GCC thickness in the inferonasal region (NI) at all time points (including baseline)? This was not observed in Figure 1I.</p><p>9. Figure 5I: looking at the y-axis (where the lowest value is 80% rather than 0%), it is clear that there is not much true difference between the GCC thickness of any of these conditions, although it looks like the p-value was slightly below 0.05. If any argument is going to be made about RGC cell body protection, then I think retinal flat mounts stained with RBPMS for soma counting (as in Figure 1J or 3B) would be essential.</p><p>10. The transcriptional profiling in Figure 4 has very little relation to the rest of the paper. If this were compared to optic nerve mRNA after optic nerve crush and hypothermia/PI treatment and significant changes between the two conditions were noted, this would be much more interesting.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75070.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript by Zhang et al. describes a new surgical procedure to access the optic nerve in large mammals to provide therapeutic hypothermia.

We agree that a local reduction of 4-10ºC is enough to unleash the beneficial effects of therapeutic hypothermia. In the ex vivo experiment, we did apply deep hypothermia (0 ºC), but in the in vivo experiment, we applied 4 ºC, but not 0 ºC, local hypothermia to the injured optic nerve. Figure 5E, 5G shows that, although the water temperature in the tank was 0 ºC, the surface temperature of the cling film, which contacted the sponge over the injury site, was measured to be 4 ºC.</p><p>We apologize for the confusion and stress this point in the Results section. Nonetheless, because, in our previous study, we found that 4 ºC deep hypothermia will cause neuronal skeleton dysfunction, we added protease inhibitors as hibernation-mimicking cold protection in the present study. We have added more discussion about the need to optimize the hypothermia therapy temperature. For example, in the Discussion we now say, “Warmer temperatures in between 4-10ºC may achieve neuroprotection without damaging cytoskeleton, which needs to be further optimized through in vitro and in vivo studies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Authors say that therapeutic hypothermia works by reducing neuroinflammation and alleviating metabolic demand (lines 59-60).

We have checked the mRNA expression of RNA-binding motif protein 3 (RBM3) and cold inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) at day 1 post hyperthermia treatment in our Crush injury model. We found that they were not elevated compared to the non-treatment optic nerve. Their mRNA expression changes were very stable: their log2 Fold Change was -0.0178 and 0.0064, respectively. A potential explanation is that some cold-shock proteins such as RMB3 are more involved when hypothermia is mild (30-33C, via a systemic hypothermia approach) but not in deep hyperthermia (4C), as documented in the literature (PMID: 23415676; PMID: 27147467)</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Potential differences</th><th>Previous studies (PMID: 33897437; 27556928)</th><th>This study</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Delivery of hypothermia</td><td align="left" valign="top">Systemic hypothermia</td><td align="left" valign="top">Local hypothermia</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Temperature of hypothermia</td><td align="left" valign="top">Mild (30-33C)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Deep (4C)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Species</td><td align="left" valign="top">Rodent</td><td align="left" valign="top">Goat</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Sampling tissue</td><td align="left" valign="top">Retina (soma of RGCs, where the nucleus and most ribosomes lie)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Pre-chiasmatic optic nerve (distal axons of RGCs)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>To address the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added the following discussion and cited these two references (PMID: 33897437; 27556928) in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Previous studies also indicated that hypothermia-induced elevated expression of cold-shock proteins may contribute to neuronal protection<sup>34，35</sup>, especially in the mild hypothermia range <sup>36,37</sup>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) An important piece of data that is missing is how much time passed from the moment of the crush until the application of the hypothermic treatment.

Previous studies in the rat have shown an almost complete prevention of vision loss when applying hypothermia within the first hour after injury (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28761115/). In the same line of thought, the authors also say that &quot;making functional regeneration is extremely challenging&quot; (lines 350-351). I tend to agree with them. But my thought is that hypothermic treatment should be directed to prevent neuronal degeneration rather than to induce axon regeneration. Here, again, the important question is the time passed from the injury until the treatment. This point should be properly discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the timing of TH treatment is essential. To address the reviewer’s concern, we have added the specific time information to the revised manuscript, as follows: “Immediately after the ON crush injury, the sponge was placed at the injury site and then the local cooling tubes were inserted over the gelfoam sponge. Local hypothermia started within 20 minutes after optic nerve crush.”</p><p>We also agree with the reviewer that hypothermic treatment should prevent neuronal degeneration rather than induce axon regeneration. We have added the following discussion in the revised manuscript: “Hypothermic treatment may directly prevent neuronal degeneration, and early treatment is necessary to alleviate further progression of neural damage after optic nerve injury (PMID: 28761115), as well as after other CNS trauma (PMID: 28629741, PMID: 11765843).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) I´m a little confused about the statistical analysis. The authors say (correctly) that they used normality tests to decide whether parametric or non-parametric tests should be used (lines 627-629). But then I see a lot of 2-way ANOVA tests performed with sets containing just 3 or 4 independent data. In my experience, the probability of getting normal distributions with such small numbers is rather unlikely. I would appreciate if the authors could confirm that all the experiments where they used parametric tests had been confirmed as having a normal distribution. Otherwise, non-parametric tests should be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We used residual analysis to check the assumption of normal distribution of the raw data before 2-way ANOVA analysis, because it is believed to be a better way to check ANOVA assumptions than statistical tests (Kozak, M. &amp; Piepho, H.-P. What's normal anyway? Residual plots are more telling than significance tests when checking ANOVA assumptions. Journal of Agronomy and Crop Science 204, 86-98 (2018)).</p><p>Residuals are the differences between the raw data and the estimated values; residual normality was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test or Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in GraphPad (9.0) software. Of note, residual normality is tested automatically when performing two-way ANOVA test in the GraphPad (9.0) software.</p><p>To make our approach clearer, we have added the following statement in the Methods section: “Residual analysis was used to check the assumption of normal distribution of the raw data before 2-way ANOVA analysis, because it has been shown to be a better way to check ANOVA assumptions than statistical tests50.”</p><p>We thank the reviewer for his reminding. When we re-checked the statistics, we found that the raw data in original Figure 3C did not pass residual normality test before two-way ANOVA test. Therefore, we used unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney test instead to compare the axon densities between 1mpi and 3mpi at different optic nerve sites (#1, 2, 3, 4).</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we confirm that all the results in which parametric tests had been used had a normal distribution. The result of the normality test for each analysis in this manuscript is available in the supplementary file named “statistics.xlsx”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Beyond the critiques in the Public Comments section, I have the following:</p><p>1. The Introduction (particularly lines 86 – 96) summarize the experimental results too much rather than just introducing the experimental questions and approach. If anything, this summary would be better suited for the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s constructive comments and have simplified these experimental results in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 1, the term &quot;sham&quot; is used in describing the surgery to expose the prechiasmal optic nerve without injuring it. This term is not used in the text of the Results section, and so it is confusing to the reader. (For instance, &quot;sham&quot; might refer to just putting the endoscope into the nasal cavity without penetrating bone). It should be made clear that sham is doing the entire procedure and just stopping short of intentionally crushing the nerve.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. To make it clear, we state in the Results section that “For goats in the sham group, the ON was exposed without crush.” We also mention in the Methods section that “In the sham surgery group, the ON was exposed by drilling off its anterior bony wall without ON crush (Figure 1G)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In multiple places in the figure legends, the RGC marker RBPMS is mistakenly written as &quot;RBMPS&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We are indebted to the reviewer for his careful review. We have corrected “RBMPS” into “RBPMS” in Figure 1J and 3B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 2A: to increase understanding, the right-most panel should show some compressed optic nerve tissue being pressed against the remaining wall of the optic canal. The fact that no optic nerve is shown at all in this panel is confusing (as if it has been removed).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion and we have modified Figure 2A accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 2B: are the two panels at different magnifications? Should adjust so that they are the same magnification or provide a scale bar.</p></disp-quote><p>We updated the two panels in Figure 2B at the same magnification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 2C: the placement of asterisks at PLR = 1 is confusing, because these look like data points. I believe that the actual data is a PLR of 0 for all post-injury time points (shown as colored line segments that are easy to overlook).</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the actual data is a PLR of 0 for all post-injury time points. We have changed the placement of asterisks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 3A: Are the authors surprised that even at 3 months post-injury the GCC thickness is &gt;70% that of the contralateral eye? In humans, I would expect much more thinning than this by 3 months. Furthermore, the macaque model shows much more GCC thinning at this time point. Is this a species-specific effect?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the contrast between our model and human patients in the time course of progressive GCC thinning. According to a small case series report in human patients with TON (PMID: 22893082), the final status of GCC at 20 months after injury was 64%, 68%, 71%, and 74% of the contralateral eye in cases 1 through 4, respectively. Therefore, at least in this small series, human patients did not experience more severe GCC thinning than we found in our goat model at 3 months. Many other TON clinical studies focus on retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning. However, the boundary between RNFL and ganglion cell layer became fuzzy in goat after optic nerve injury. Therefore, we did not quantify RNFL in this study.</p><p>The macaque model shows much more GCC thinning (&lt;50%) at 3 months after injury than the goat model, likely due to much higher retinal ganglion cell density in the macaque (~1000 cells/1 mm^2, Figure S7) than in the goat (~200 cells/ 1mm^2, Figure 5A, B in our previous study (PMID: 32598972)).</p><p>To address the reviewer’s comment, we have added the following discussion in the revised manuscript: “Of note, the macaque model shows much more GCC thinning (&lt;50%) at 3 months after injury than the goat model, likely due to much higher retinal ganglion cell density in the macaque (~1000 cells/1 mm^2, Figure S7) than the goat (~200 cells/ 1mm^2, (PMID: 32598972)”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 3A: Why is there a dip in GCC thickness in the inferonasal region (NI) at all time points (including baseline)? This was not observed in Figure 1I.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1 and 3 showed the OCT thickness of two different groups of goats. The dip in GCC thickness in the NI region indicated that for these goats in the optic nerve crush group (Figure 3), the surgery eyes had thinner GCC in the NI region than their contralateral eyes (control eyes) at baseline. In the sham group (Figure 1), the surgery eyes had thinner GCC in the NS regions and thicker GCC in the TS region at baseline.</p><p>These regional differences in GCC thickness between ipsilateral and contralateral eyes at baseline will not affect our results because our study is based on longitudinal observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figure 5I: looking at the y-axis (where the lowest value is 80% rather than 0%), it is clear that there is not much true difference between the GCC thickness of any of these conditions, although it looks like the p-value was slightly below 0.05. If any argument is going to be made about RGC cell body protection, then I think retinal flat mounts stained with RBPMS for soma counting (as in Figure 1J or 3B) would be essential.</p></disp-quote><p>In the control group without treatment, the average GCC thickness ratio of the injured eyes at 1 mpi was 88% of the baseline ratio. In other words, 12% GCC thickness was lost at 1 mpi.</p><p>In the hypothermia+PI group, the GCC thickness ratio of the injured eyes at 1 mpi was 91% of the baseline ratio, so 9% GCC thickness was lost at 1mpi.</p><p>Therefore, 25% (25% = (12%-9%)/12%) of GCC thickness was saved at 1 mpi due to local treatment with hypothermia/PI. The therapeutic effect, although not substantial, was encouraging evidence for the potential of local treatment.</p><p>As shown in Figure 3B, RGCs density ratio of the injury eye to the contralateral control eye was almost 100% at 1 mpi in the no treatment group (little RGC loss at 1 mpi). Therefore, we did not carry out RGCs density analysis between the no treatment group and the hypothermia group at 1 mpi.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The transcriptional profiling in Figure 4 has very little relation to the rest of the paper. If this were compared to optic nerve mRNA after optic nerve crush and hypothermia/PI treatment and significant changes between the two conditions were noted, this would be much more interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>Transcriptional profiling in Figure 4 revealed early mRNA expression changes at different sites in our TON model, helping us understand the pathophysiological process and identify potential therapeutic targets.</p><p>Transcriptomic analysis in Figure 4 revealed early changes in ischemia, inflammation, and metabolic pathways in the injured optic nerve, justifying local hypothermia as a therapeutic candidate. Therefore, we applied local hypothermic therapy in our model (Figure 5).</p><p>We do agree with the reviewer that it is interesting to compare mRNA changes between no treatment and hypothermia/PI treatment. We have performed this comparison and added the new data as Figure 6 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We have included the following results in the revised manuscript: “To explore transcriptomic change after local treatment with deep hypothermia and PI, we sampled from the injured pre-chiasmatic ON segments at 1 day post injury (dpi) and compared transcriptomic expression between the hypothermia/PI treatment group and no treatment group. There were 264 differentially expressed genes after hypothermia/PI treatment, of which 220 genes were upregulated and 44 genes were downregulated (Figure 6A, B). Gene list analysis by Metascape revealed that many inflammatory, immune-related functional cluster groups of gene ontology terms were enriched, such as neutrophil degranulation, inflammatory response, and regulation of cell adhesion (Figure 6C). Scored pro-inflammatory response (GO:0050729: positive regulation of inflammatory response) and anti-inflammatory response (GO:0050728: negative regulation of inflammatory response) by GSEA revealed that the enrichment score of negative regulation of inflammation was higher than that of positive regulation, indicating that hypothermia/PI treatment negatively regulated inflammatory response overall (Figure 6D). SsGSEA analysis (Figure 6E) found that the anti-inflammatory response was significantly improved after hypothermia treatment. QuanTIseq analysis, which was used to predict cell types within each sample, found a significant decrease in the number of neutrophils and a significant increase in the number of B cells, T cells and mDCs (myeloid dendritic cells), indicating that innate immune response was suppressed while adaptive immune response was enhanced after hypothermia/PI treatment (Figure 6F). These results need to be confirmed by single cell sequencing in the future study.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
