chains from translating ribosomes. Puromycin has been used in molecular biology research for decades as a translation inhibitor. The development of puromycin antibodies and derivatized puromycin analogs has enabled the quantification of active translation in bulk and single-cell assays. More recently, in vivo puromycylation assays have become popular tools for localizing translating ribosomes in cells. These assays often use elongation inhibitors to purportedly inhibit the release of puromycin-labeled nascent peptides from ribosomes. Using in vitro and in vivo experiments in various eukaryotic systems, we demonstrate that, even in the presence of elongation inhibitors, puromycylated peptides are released and diffuse away from ribosomes. Puromycylation assays reveal subcellular sites, such as nuclei, where puromycylated peptides accumulate post-release and which do not necessarily coincide with sites of active translation. Our findings urge caution when interpreting puromycylation assays in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>puromycin</kwd><kwd>emetine</kwd><kwd>puromycylation</kwd><kwd>op-puro</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2R37GM059425-14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R37HD037047-20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seydoux</surname><given-names>Geraldine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5K99GM135450-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zinshteyn</surname><given-names>Boris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seydoux</surname><given-names>Geraldine</given-names></name><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG-2280-16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goldman</surname><given-names>Daniel H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG-2250-16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zinshteyn</surname><given-names>Boris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007445</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cassani</surname><given-names>Madeline</given-names></name><name><surname>Livingston</surname><given-names>Nathan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1746891</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cassani</surname><given-names>Madeline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Methods that use puromycin to localize active translation do not actually detect the site of translation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Puromycin is a potent translational inhibitor that binds to ribosomes from all domains of life and has been used as a chemical probe and selectable marker for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aviner, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yarmolinsky and Haba, 1959</xref>). Puromycin is unique among translational inhibitors in that it is itself a substrate of the ribosomal peptidyl-transferase reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nathans, 1964</xref>). Puromycin mimics the 3′ adenosine of a tRNA charged with a modified tyrosine, which binds in the ribosomal acceptor site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The ribosome transfers the nascent peptide chain on the P-site tRNA to puromycin, leading to spontaneous dissociation of the nascent peptide from the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nathans, 1964</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mechanisms of action of puromycin and other translational inhibitors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of structure of 3′ terminus of tyrosyl tRNA with that of puromycin. Key differences are highlighted in green. tRNA body not drawn to scale.

These probes can be used to quantify the amount of active translation from cells in a culture dish, tissue or organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chao et al., 2012</xref>). Subsequent development of the ribopuromycylation method (RPM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">David et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastide et al., 2018</xref>) pushed the technique a step further, claiming to detect the subcellular localization of actively translating ribosomes using a puromycin-specific antibody. In these initial publications, the authors argued that the translation elongation inhibitors cycloheximide or emetine prevent dissociation of the puromycylated peptides from the ribosome. Cycloheximide and emetine, however, bind in the E-site of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) far from the peptidyl-transferase center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garreau de Loubresse et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). Previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grollman, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colombo et al., 1965</xref>) established that these inhibitors prevent puromycin-induced splitting of ribosomes into individual subunits, but do not prevent the release of the majority of puromycylated peptides. Cycloheximide and emetine, in fact, are sometimes omitted from in vivo puromycylation assays based on the claim that short (approximately 5 min) labeling times capture peptides near their original site of translation before significant diffusion has taken place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">tom Dieck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biever et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glock et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holt et al., 2019</xref>). Puromycin-based imaging methods have been widely adopted, particularly in neurobiology, where translation in neuronal processes, far from the cell body, is crucial to neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">tom Dieck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biever et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glock et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">V'kovski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Langille et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonatopoulos-Pournatzis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Graber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Graber et al., 2017</xref>). Some studies have combined puromycin treatment with proximity-dependent ligation (PLA) to monitor the location of translation of a specific protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">tom Dieck et al., 2015</xref>), but this method again does not address diffusion of puromycylated peptides post-release from the ribosome.</p><p>In the present work, we establish that puromycin-based methods, as currently implemented, do not accurately localize translation at the subcellular level. We used a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system to show that puromycin nearly instantaneously releases nascent proteins from the ribosome, and that this release reaction is completely unaffected by emetine. To validate this finding in cells, we visualized sites of active translation using fixed cell single-molecule imaging with the SunTag reporter system. Brief treatment with puromycin nearly completely dissociated nascent peptides from their mRNAs, again, independent of the presence of emetine. Simple diffusion calculations predict that the released peptides could diffuse to nearly any point within even large mammalian cells within seconds or minutes. Thus, puromycylation methods described in the literature do not establish subcellular localization of translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The puromycin analog OPP labels nuclei in live <italic>C. elegans</italic> germlines in the presence or absence of emetine</title><p>O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) is a click-reactive cell permeable puromycin analog that is commonly used to localize sites of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). When incubated with live cells or tissues, OPP reacts with translating ribosomes and becomes covalently attached to elongating peptides. Post-labeling, OPP is detected by click-reactive chemistry which attaches a fluorescent probe to OPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Using this method to label translation in live <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonads, we observed bright labeling of live germlines upon a 5 min incubation with OPP. The OPP signal was most intense in nuclei, specifically in the chromatin-free center where nucleoli reside. A lower signal was also observed in the cytoplasm, which contains the majority of (if not all) functional ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klinge and Woolford, 2019</xref>). OPP labeling of nuclei was ablated by pre-treatment with anisomycin, a competitive inhibitor of puromycin that stops elongation by binding to the peptidyl-transferase center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grollman, 1967</xref>), thereby preventing puromycin from reacting with the nascent chain. In contrast, OPP labeling was unaffected by pre-treatment with emetine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Emetine-resistant puromycin labeling of nucleoli has been observed previously in tissue culture cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">David et al., 2012</xref>) and may reflect trafficking or diffusion of puromycylated peptides into the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kubota et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 1995</xref>).

Matching the conditions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">David et al., 2012</xref>, we treated the RRL with 208 μM emetine and 91 μM puromycin. When added separately, these two drugs effectively inhibit translation of full-length luciferase mRNA encoding a normal stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">David et al., 2012</xref>). Upon addition of puromycin to lysate programmed with truncated mRNA, we noticed the expected steep increase in luminescence (yellow trace) that was not inhibited by simultaneous addition of emetine (blue trace) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The luminescence of the no-puromycin control (purple trace) increased slowly over time, likely due to low levels of ribosome rescue activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shao et al., 2013</xref>) or spontaneous peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis in the lysate.</p><p>We next considered the possibility that blocking peptide release with emetine requires pre-incubation. To test this, we pre-treated the lysate with emetine 5 min before addition of puromycin. Because pre-treatment would decrease the total translation time and overall luminescence of a sample, it was critical to equalize the total uninhibited reaction time of all samples. This was accomplished in two different ways. In a first experiment, we treated all samples with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate (GDPNP) to inhibit the translational GTPases and prevent ongoing translation while leaving the ribosome free to react with emetine and puromycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Again, puromycin treatment (yellow trace) caused a sharp increase in luminescence that was not affected by emetine pre-treatment (blue trace) but was inhibited by anisomycin pre-treatment (green trace). The residual slow increase in the anisomycin trace is likely due to incomplete inhibition by anisomycin resulting from its stochastic dissociation during the reaction. In a second experiment, we added puromycin for the puromycin-only control at the same time that we started pretreating the other samples with inhibitors. This effectively inhibited translation in all samples at the same time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). While the increase in luminescence for the puromycin-only control (yellow trace) occurred earlier than for the pretreated samples, once the puromycin was added, the luminescence activity of the emetine pretreated sample (blue trace) matched that of the puromycin-only control. Taken together, these results show that pretreating translating ribosomes with emetine does not prevent the release of nascent peptides by puromycin in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Emetine does not prevent release of puromycylated peptides in cells</title><p>To directly test whether emetine blocks release of puromycylated nascent chains in vivo, we implemented the SunTag method for monitoring translation on single mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pichon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morisaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). This technique relies on a reporter mRNA encoding tandem repeats of the SunTag epitope near the 5′ end of the coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). When translated, each SunTag peptide is bound by a single chain variable fragment (scFV) of a GCN4 antibody fused to super folder GFP (scFV-sfGFP). An auxin-inducible degron (AID) near the 3′ end of the coding sequence allows controlled degradation of the fully-synthesized SunTag array, reducing fluorescence background and enabling detection of single fully-synthesized polypeptides. We performed fixed-cell imaging of U-2OS cells stably expressing both the SunTag reporter and scFV-sfGFP, detecting mRNA by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and SunTag signal by immunofluorescence (IF). With this single-molecule FISH and IF hybrid assay (smFISH-IF), we quantified the association of SunTag nascent chains with their encoding mRNAs under various treatment conditions.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Puromycin treatment causes loss of nascent peptide-mRNA co-localization, independent of elongation inhibitors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SunTag reporter schematic. In addition to the tandem SunTag repeats and the auxin-inducible degron, this reporter encodes nano luciferase and BFP, which are not used in the present experiments. The 3’ UTR also encodes tandem repeats of the MS2 stem loop, which can be used to label the mRNA red. However, since we detect mRNA by FISH, we do not use the MS2 stem loops in the present experiments. (<bold>B</bold>) Example cells imaged by FISH-IF.

Upon treatment with 91 μM puromycin for 5 min, an average of only 3% of mRNAs per cell colocalize with green signal, consistent with release of nascent chains upon puromycin treatment. Remarkably, pre-treatment with 208 μM emetine for 15 min yielded similar results: only 5% of mRNAs on average colocalized with SunTag signal. Importantly, pre-treatment for 5 min with elongation inhibitor anisomycin (37 μM), resulted in an average of 50% of mRNAs co-localized with green foci, as seen in untreated cells. Together, these data indicate that 5 min of puromycin treatment causes release of nascent polypeptides and diffusion away from ribosomes. Pre-treatment with emetine has no effect on puromycin-induced release.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Puromycylation treatment times are long compared to protein diffusion rates</title><p>While initial reports argued that emetine was required to stabilize the interaction of puromycylated peptides with ribosomes, some recent studies of local protein synthesis via the puromycylation method relied on treatment with puromycin alone for ~5–10 min, with the implication that detected nascent proteins do not appreciably diffuse away from their site of synthesis (i.e. ribosome) within the treatment time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colombo et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">tom Dieck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morisaki et al., 2016</xref>). To determine how far a nascent protein might diffuse on these timescales (i.e. the spatial resolution of the method), we calculated the expected displacement as a function of time, based on the previously measured diffusion coefficient of GFP in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Rienzo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This calculation depends on the dimensionality of space in which the molecule is confined. However, even in the most limiting case of one-dimensional diffusion—approximating movement along a very narrow neural projection—a protein is expected to diffuse ~100 µm in less than 1 min. This distance is large compared to both the scale of the relevant structures to which protein synthesis was localized in neurons (tens of microns) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">tom Dieck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biever et al., 2020</xref>), and to the diameter of HeLa cells (~20 microns) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borle, 1969</xref>), in which the method was demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">David et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, limiting puromycin treatment time to a few minutes does not ensure that nascent proteins remain confined to the subcellular region in which they are synthesized.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Proteins diffuse over long distances in the cell during common puromycin labeling times.</title><p>Calculation of expected displacement by diffusion as a function of time, using the equation &lt; <italic>x<sup>2</sup></italic> &gt; = <italic>2nDt</italic> where n is the dimensionality, D is the diffusion coefficient (126 µm<sup>2</sup>/s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Rienzo et al., 2014</xref>) and <italic>t</italic> is time. The calculation is shown for 1, 2 and 3 dimensions.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60303-fig5-v3.tif"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we have demonstrated that the puromycin method for visualizing localized translation does not faithfully detect nascent polypeptides at the site of their synthesis. Puromycylated polypeptides are released from the ribosome and can diffuse far away from the site of synthesis, even following short treatment times. Additionally, treatment with emetine does not prevent release of puromycylated peptides from the ribosome. This is in agreement with previous polysome gradient analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colombo et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grollman, 1968</xref>) and real-time SunTag imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) that has shown that neither emetine nor cycloheximide ultimately prevent release of these peptides. It is therefore likely that the specific subcellular localizations detected by this method are in many cases the end result of trafficking or diffusion of partially-synthesized puromycylated proteins. For example, the bright nucleolar labeling detected in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">David et al., 2012</xref> likely does not reflect nucleolar translation, but the trafficking of puromycylated N-terminal fragments of highly abundant ribosomal proteins (which have N-terminal nucleolar localization signals) to the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kubota et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, conclusions reached using this method should be treated cautiously, even in neurons, where cellular projections protrude relatively far from the cell body. We note that other reporter-based methods that rely on rapid, single turnover chemistry, such as the ‘flash’ activity of some luciferases, may allow for more accurate localization of the sites of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Na et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, in principle, derivatizing puromycin with a chemical moiety large enough to obstruct its passage through the ribosome exit tunnel would immobilize reacted nascent chains on the ribosome. The viability of this concept is demonstrated by the RiboLace method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clamer et al., 2018</xref>), which uses a puromycin-biotin conjugate bound to magnetic beads to capture translating ribosomes from cellular lysates. Of course, these beads are not cell permeable and are unsuitable for in vivo imaging. The methods outlined here will be useful for screening cell-permeable puromycin derivatives for their ability to faithfully localize protein synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

After another 2x PBS wash, 18,000 cells were plated per well and grown for 24 hr in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. 24 hr following plating, the media was supplemented with 1 µg/mL doxycycline hyclate (Millipore Sigma, #D9891) and 500 µM 3-indole acetic acid (IAA) (Sigma-Aldrich I2886).</p><p>Approximately, 24 hr following induction, cells were treated with either 91 µM puromycin in the medium for 5 min, 208 µM emetine in the medium for 15 min followed by 91 µM puromycin in the medium for 5 min, or 37 µM anisomycin in the medium for 5 min followed by 91 µM puromycin in the medium for 5 min. Control cells were left untreated. Following treatment, samples were prepared for smFISH-IF. All solutions were prepared in nuclease free water (Quality Biological 351-029-131CS). Cells were washed 3x with 1x PBS (Corning 46–013 CM) + 5 mM magnesium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich M2670-500G) (PBSM). Cell were then fixed for 10 min at room temperature in PBSM + 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences 50-980-492). Following fixation, samples were washed for 3 × 5 min in PBSM and permeabilized for 10 min in PBSM + 5 mg/mL BSA (VWR VWRV0332-25G) + 0.1% Triton-X100 (Sigma-Aldrich T8787-100mL). After 3 × 5 min washes in PBSM, cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 2xSSC (Corning 46–020 CM), 10% formamide (Sigma-Aldrich F9037-100ML), and 5 mg/mL BSA (VWR VWRV0332-25G). Following pre-hybridization incubation, samples were incubated for 3 hr at 37°C in 2xSSC (Corning 46–020 CM), 10% formamide (Sigma-Aldrich F9037-100ML), 1 mg/mL competitor <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA (Sigma-Aldrich 10109541001), 10% w/v dextran sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich D8906-100G), 2 mM ribonucleoside vanadyl complex (NEB S1402S), 100 units/mL SUPERase In (Thermo Fisher AM2694), 60 nM SunTag_v4-Cy3 smFISH probes, and 1:1000 chicken anti-GFP (Aves Labs GFP-1010). The coverslips were then washed 4x with 2xSSC (Corning 46–020 CM) + 10% formamide (Sigma-Aldrich F9037-100ML). The samples were then incubated with 2 × 20 min with a goat anti-chicken IgY secondary antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher A-11039). After 3x washes in 2xSCC, cells were mounted on pre-cleaned frosted glass cover slides (Fisher 12-552-3) with ProLong Diamond antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen P36962). After curing for 24 hr, the samples were imaged on a custom Nikon Ti-2 wide-field microscope equipped with a 60 × 1.4 NA oil immersion objective lens (Nikon), a Spectra X LED light engine (Lumencor), and an Orca 4.0 v2 scMOS camera (Hamamatsu). The microscope was under automated control by Nikon Elements software. x-y pixel size: 107.5 nm. z-step: 300 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>smFISH Analysis</title><p>Fixed cell image analysis was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goldman et al., 2020</xref>) with existing or custom MATLAB software. Spot detection of the mRNA and proteins channels were performed independently in FISH-Quant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>). In the protein channel, all released single peptides in the cytoplasm were detected and thresholded based on their Gaussian fitting parameters (intensity and width) and inspected to ensure accuracy. All released single peptides were then averaged into an idealized point spread function to calculate the integrated intensity of a single SunTag array. In the mRNA channel, only cytoplasmic RNAs were included for analysis. After determining all cytoplasmic mRNA positions, FISH-Quant’s transcription site quantification algorithm was employed to quantify the integrated intensity of the associated translation site. Briefly, a 11 × 11 bounding box was drawn at the position of each mRNA and Gaussian fitting was performed centered on the brightest pixel within this box. The integrated intensity of the translation site was then normalized against the intensity of the idealized single peptide to calculate the number of nascent chains associated with a given mRNA. The translation sites were filtered based on shape, intensity, and distance from the mRNA. Failure to converge on an accurate fit given these parameters resulted in the associated translation site intensity to have an intensity value of 0. Translation sites with an integrated intensity of less than one idealized single peptide were determined to be unassociated with SunTag signal. Only cells with greater than five and fewer than 35 mRNAs were considered.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health [2R37GM059425-14 to RG; 5R37HD037047-20 to GS; 5K99GM135450-02 to BZ] and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) (RG and GS).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Ron as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marvin Tanenbaum (Reviewer #2); Maria Ugalde (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The work presented here convincingly shows that the puromycylated signal comes from released, truncated polypeptides, and not the nascent chains associated with the ribosome. In a straightforward experiment, using the SunTag system, the puromycylated nascent chains were not present on ribosomes, but only after the peptides were released from the ribosome did the fluorescence of the tagged puromycylated peptides become evident indicating that puromycin released them immediately upon incorporation even in the presence of elongation inhibitors.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have different suggestions-one feels that the literature needs to be more fully referenced. One other suggests consideration of the statistical basis for the observations in Figure 2 (has it been repeated?) and that the use of cycloheximide would have made the manuscript more robust. Acceptance of the manuscript does not require additional experimentation however, but include your response to these comments in a revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors of this, and the co-submitted manuscript investigated the assumption that puromycin is a spatial indicator of translating ribosomes. This assumption is based on the puromycylation of nascent chains remaining associated with the ribosome on the mRNA, in effect freezing in its position there in the presence of elongation inhibitors. When detected by antibodies to the puromycin derivative, the signal supposedly indicated the sites of translation.</p><p>The work presented here convincingly shows that the puromycylated signal comes from released, truncated polypeptides, and not the nascent chains associated with the ribosome. In a straightforward experiment, using the suntag system, the puromycylated nascent chains were not present on ribosomes, but only after the peptides were released from the ribosome did the fluorescence of the tagged puromycylated peptides become evident indicating that puromycin released them immediately upon incorporation even in the presence of elongation inhibitors.</p><p>The work is of significance particularly since a number of high impact publications have relied on the puromycylation signal indicating the location of ongoing translation. Conclusions that derive from that assumption have to be re-evaluated, since some of them are clearly wrong (e.g. translation in the nucleus) or misleading (work on neurons). I feel it is important to publish this work before more erroneous conclusions contaminate the literature.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study by Enam and colleagues re-exams a frequently used assay based on puromycin incorporation to determine the sub-cellular site of mRNA translation. They convincingly show that puromycin treatment results in rapid release of nascent polypeptides, and that this is not inhibited by the translation elongation inhibitor emetine. I agree with the authors that it is important to point out this flaw in the puromycin incorporation assay, and their study does an excellent job in doing this. The main issue here is that there is already data in the literature that shows that nascent chains rapidly (tens of seconds) dissociate from the ribosome and move away from the site of translation, even in the presence of a translation elongation inhibitor (CHX). One example that comes to mind is the paper from the Zhuang lab (PMID: 27153499), where they show that nascent chains are fully released in 1-2 min upon addition of puro and CHX (note that they do actually observe a small delay in nascent chain release due to CHX). That being said, the Zhuang lab paper does not make a point out of this result and how it affects interpretation of OPP assays, and I believe that is still useful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Green's group questions the accuracy of the ribopuromycylation method (RPM) to report on the subcellular localization of translation. In RPM, translation elongation inhibitors (emetine and cyclohexamide) preclude the release of puromycylated peptides from the ribosome. Using three approaches, they demonstrate that emetine does not prevent the release of nascent peptides, which diffuse from the ribosome after puromycin treatment: 1) in vitro translation assay of luciferase reporters, 2) Localization of O-propargyl-puromycin (OPP) elongating peptides in the nucleus of <italic>C. elegans</italic> cells and, 3) Lack of co-localization of the SunTag translation reporter with its encoded mRNA in mammalian cells. Authors warn on the use of puromycylation assays as the sole approach to localize translation in cells.</p><p>Findings from this work will certainly help the scientific community to interpret the data from puromycylation experiments and to choose the best experimental approaches to assess the spatial regulation of translation. The authors state that experiments have been performed once or twice. Hence, the existing experimental evidence could benefit from additional data and analysis to support the main conclusion (even though a similar manuscript submitted to this journal by the group of Peter A. Seems shows similar findings).</p><p>1) Only emetine was used to inhibit translation elongation.

We agree that evidence for release of nascent chains after puromycin addition in the presence of cycloheximide or emetine inhibitors has existed for decades. To our knowledge, this was first shown by Colombo in 1965 and Grollman in 1968; in particular, the Grollman paper showed that there was at most very modest stabilization of nascent peptide on elongating ribosomes in the presence of emetine, while Colombo demonstrated that cycloheximide only transiently stabilized nascent peptides on the ribosome. We also appreciate that the group of single molecule imaging papers (looking at translating ribosomes) emerging several years ago used puromycin release of polypeptides as an experiment to identify elongating ribosomes in real time (Yan et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Morisaki et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016; Pichon et al., 2016). The paper from the Zhuang lab referenced by the reviewer (Wang et al., 2016) indeed shows a short delay in release of nascent peptide by puromycin in the presence of CHX, but it is not clear if this (as well as the effect seen by Colombo in 1965) is due to stabilization of puromycylated peptides on the ribosome, or slowed reactivity of puromycin with the unusual ribosome state induced by CHX (Budkovitch et al., Mol Cell 2011, PMID 22017870). Regardless of the mechanism, this slight stabilization would still ultimately result in complete dissociation of nascent peptide on the time scales used in puromycylation imaging experiments. Despite this literature, there remains widespread usage of “puromycylation” to localize elongating ribosomes, prompting us to make a specific point of this matter. In particular, given that the work by Yewdell and colleagues made a strong and specific point about the role of emetine in stabilizing puromycylated peptides on ribosomes, we felt it important to specifically address this point. We have added several sentences in the Discussion to more fully acknowledge the literature in this area.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) Only emetine was used to inhibit translation elongation.

Indeed, in the initial development of this approach, it was argued that emetine was more useful for stabilizing nascent peptides on ribosomes for this reason (David et al., 2012), though some recent studies utilizing RPM did not include emetine. We expect that CHX would produce similar results as seen in previous studies using metabolic labeling (Colombo 1965) and SunTag live imaging (Wang et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Experiment in Figure 2 has been done only once.

We also clarify that the experiment in Figure 3—figure supplement 1B was performed twice as noted in the figure legend. While we appreciate the fact that repeating an experiment in an identical manner makes the result of a single experiment more robust, the RRL experiments reported in Figure 3B, C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1B are fundamentally similar and were performed independently, and all support the same conclusion that emetine does not prevent release of puromycylated peptides from the ribosome. In light of current limitations on experimental time, we argue that sufficient robustness derives from these similar experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4.

This modeling exercise was simply meant to provide some sense of the time scales for diffusion that would be relevant to experiments routinely reported in the literature.</p></body></sub-article></article>
