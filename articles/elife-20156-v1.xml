limbs. However, the mechanisms by which spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression modify cellular behaviours to generate such deformations remain to be established. We use the Snapdragon flower as a model system to address this problem. Combining cellular analysis with tissue-level modelling, we show that an orthogonal pattern of growth orientations plays a key role in generating out-of-plane deformations. This growth pattern is most likely oriented by a polarity field, highlighted by PIN1 protein localisation, and is modulated by dorsoventral gene activity. The orthogonal growth pattern interacts with other patterns of differential growth to create tissue conflicts that shape the flower. Similar shape changes can be generated by contraction as well as growth, suggesting tissue conflict resolution provides a flexible morphogenetic mechanism for generating shape diversity in plants and animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20156.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20156.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20156.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plant and animal organs come in many different shapes, from pitcher-shaped leaves and butterfly wings, to orchid flowers and the convoluted shape of the brain. Unlike pottery or sculpture, no external hand guides the formation of these biological structures; they arise on their own, through sheets of cells developing into particular three-dimensional shapes. But how does this process of self-making operate? We know that patterns of gene activity are important, because mutations that disrupt these patterns change the shape of the organ. But it is not clear how these patterns lead to sheets of cells curving and bending themselves into their characteristic three-dimensional shapes.</p><p>Plants are particularly useful tools for studying how three-dimensional organs form because, unlike animals, their cells do not slide relative to each other, which makes the analysis simpler. Rebocho et al. used a combination of computational modelling and cell analysis to study how the intricately shaped flowers of plants known as Snapdragons form. The experiments show that genes control the shape of Snapdragon flowers by causing groups of cells to grow at different rates and in different directions. This pattern of growth creates internal conflicts that are resolved by sheets of cells curving in particular ways, accounting for the three-dimensional shape.</p><p>Rebocho et al. propose that the principles of tissue conflict resolution described in this work may also underlie the development and evolution of many other plant and animal organ shapes. A future challenge is to identify the cellular mechanisms that link patterns of gene activity to the generation and resolution of conflicting cell behaviours.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20156.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20156.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Antirrhinum majus</kwd><kwd>tissue conflict resolution</kwd><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>out-of-plane deformations</kwd><kwd>PIN1 polarity</kwd><kwd>orthognal cell files</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 568-2008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rebocho</surname><given-names>Alexandra B</given-names></name><name><surname>Coen</surname><given-names>Enrico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000563/2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rebocho</surname><given-names>Alexandra B</given-names></name><name><surname>Coen</surname><given-names>Enrico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J004588/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Southam</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Richard Kennaway</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Coen</surname><given-names>Enrico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic modulation in patterns of tissue conflict play a major role in the development and evolution of shape diversity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Out-of-plane deformation of tissue sheets plays a fundamental part in morphogenesis. In animals, it underlies processes such as gastrulation, neurulation, convolution of the cerebral cortex, gut folding, development of imaginal discs and dorsal appendages. Several models have been proposed to account for such deformations, involving a variety of processes such as differential surface contractions, oriented tissue tensions and differential growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Brodland, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clausi and Brodland, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hannezo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Osterfield et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Savin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tallinen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wyczalkowski et al., 2012</xref>). In plants, cell rearrangements and contractions play little or no role in morphogenesis, which is largely driven by growth. Nevertheless, out-of-plane tissue sheet deformations lead to the formation of elaborate structures such as floral spurs, the orchid labellum and pitcher-shaped leaves. These observations raise the question of how out-of-plane tissue deformations are generated in such diverse systems and how they relate to underlying patterns of gene activity and cell behaviours. Plants are a good starting point for addressing this question as lack of cell movement simplifies analysis.</p><p>A key feature of out-of-plane deformations is that they involve generation of curvature (local rotations out of the plane). Two mechanisms might account for the generation of local rotations for a tissue sheet. The first is that local rotations arise through forces external to the sheet pulling or pushing on particular regions. For example, petals (whorl 2) grow in between sepals (whorl 1) and stamens (whorl 3), and these adjacent organs could apply forces to shape the petal. However, homeotic mutants that change the identity of stamens to petals do not have a major effect on the complexity of whorl 2 petal shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradley et al., 1993</xref>), making it unlikely that such a mechanism plays a major role in this case. The second mechanism is that regions within the tissue sheet are specified to grow at different rates and/or directions. Local rotations can arise because they reduce or resolve potential conflicts brought about by such differential growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coen and Rebocho, 2016</xref>), as without regions curving or rotating relative to each other, greater levels of stress would be generated. We refer to this second mechanism, in which heterogeneity of specified growth within the tissue leads to local rotations that reduce potential stresses, as <italic>tissue conflict resolution</italic> (for a more mathematical definition of tissue conflict resolution see Materials and methods).</p><p>To clarify the notion of tissue conflict resolution we distinguish between two types of growth: specified and resultant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kennaway et al., 2011</xref>). Specified growth is how a region of tissue would deform if it was free from the mechanical constraints of its neighbouring regions. Resultant growth is how a region deforms in the context of neighbouring mechanical constraints, and includes anisotropies and local rotations that emerge from such constraints. Specified growth therefore refers to the intrinsic or active properties of a region, which may be influenced by local gene expression, while resultant growth also includes the passive changes that arise through connectivity with other regions. It is usually not possible to infer specified growth patterns directly from observed deformations (which reflects resultant growth). Modelling allows the consequences of particular hypotheses for specified growth to be evaluated and compared to the data on resultant growth, such as clones and shape deformations.</p><p>To illustrate how patterns of specified growth may lead to out-of-plane deformations, consider a square sheet of tissue marked with circular spots (virtual clones, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). If specified growth is equal in all directions (isotropic specified growth) and a growth-promoting transcription factor, GTF (red shading in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), is expressed uniformly, the tissue simply gets larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Alternatively, specified growth could also be anisotropic, in which case regions have the intrinsic property of growing preferentially in one orientation. A simple way to establish such orientations in a tissue is through a polarity field (arrows <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). If specified growth is higher parallel to the local polarity, the tissue elongates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). In both of these examples, all regions within the tissue grow in a similar way without constraining each other, so resultant growth is the same as specified growth. There is no tissue conflict and local rotations are not generated.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20156.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of 3D deformations through tissue conflict resolution.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Isotropic specified growth promoted by a uniformly expressed Growth-promoting Transcription Factor (GTF, red shading).

We may define three types of conflict leading to local rotations: surface, areal and directional. If GTF promotes isotropic growth and is expressed at higher level in the top compared to the bottom surface (red vs pink shading in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), the tissue folds as this reduces the potential conflict in growth between of the two surfaces (<bold><italic>surface conflict</italic></bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). If GTF is expressed at a higher level in the centre of the tissue compared to the surround (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), the <bold><italic>areal conflict</italic></bold> is reduced by the tissue buckling and formation of a round dome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). The direction (up or down) and pattern of buckling may be biased if the sheet has an initial slight curvature generated by surface conflict, or variable if it is initially flat with slight random perturbations in height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Even though specified growth is isotropic, anisotropies may result from areal conflict. For example, clones in regions with low specified growth become stretched circumferentially (blue box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) by nearby faster growing regions. These anisotropies are a passive result of residual stresses generated by differential growth, rather than being directly specified locally. Residual stresses arise because local rotations only partially resolve the areal conflict (for more details, see description of tissue conflict resolution in Materials and methods). Examples of buckling arising through areal conflict have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Green, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nath et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shi et al., 2014</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-20156-media3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20156.007</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Surface conflict model as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>.</title><p>Size of canvas is rescaled to better visualise the deformation of the canvas.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20156.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20156.007</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media4" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-20156-media4.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20156.008</object-id><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Areal conflict model as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>.</title><p>Size of canvas is rescaled to better visualise the deformation of the canvas.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20156.008">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20156.008</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>A third type of conflict is generated when the orientations of specified growth vary. For example, if the polarity field converges at the centre of the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and specified growth rate is higher parallel to the polarity, the <bold><italic>directional conflict</italic></bold> is partially resolved by buckling and formation an elongated dome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). Virtual clones are elongated along the radial axis of the dome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). In this example, directional conflict involves a non-parallel polarity field, but it could also involve variation in specified growth rates in relation to polarity. As with areal conflict, the direction of buckling can be biased through initial curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media5" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-20156-media5.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20156.009</object-id><label>Video 5.</label><caption><title>Directional conflict as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>.</title><p>Size of canvas is rescaled to better visualise the deformation of the canvas.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20156.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20156.009</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>Unlike surface and areal conflicts, directional conflicts have been little explored.

However, the precise pattern these conflicts take and their operation at the cellular level has not been tested.</p><p>Here we address this problem using a combination of cellular and tissue analysis, together with modelling at different levels of complexity. We show that an orthogonal pattern of directional conflict contributes to the out-of-plane deformation of the lower corolla. This pattern is likely established by a combination of orthogonal gene activity with a polarity pattern visualised by PIN1 localisation. The directional conflict interacts with surface and areal conflicts to generate the corolla shape and curvature. Dorsoventral genes modulate all three types of conflict accounting for a range of phenotypes in wild type and mutants. We propose that genetically controlled tissue conflict resolutions may provide a general mechanism for generating out-of-plane deformations in both plants and animals, despite different underlying cell behaviours.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Morphogenesis of wild type and <italic>div</italic></title><p>The bilaterally symmetric Snapdragon (<italic>Antirrhinum majus</italic>) corolla has five petals united for part of their length to form a tube with five separate lobes, which diverge at their sinuses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>).

The wedge comprises a platform (palate) that slopes up towards a ridge (rim) and a descending lip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). The rim rises to form two small peaks at the junctions between lateral and ventral petals (foci, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C–E</xref>). <italic>DIV</italic> is required for the development of the wedge-shaped fold. In <italic>div</italic> mutants, the wedge-shape of the lower corolla is lost and two small domes form at the foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–J</xref>).</p><p>To determine the regional origins of the wedge of wild type, we created a fate map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) using morphological landmarks such as sinuses between petals (blue arrows), main veins (yellow and orange lines) and trichomes (purple ellipse, from 14 DAI = <underline>D</underline>ays <underline>A</underline>fter petal <underline>I</underline>nitiation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–G</xref>). The first visible sign of wedge formation was a shallow furrow proximal to the petal sinuses at 12 DAI (yellow bracket, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Prior to this, the lower corolla showed no out-of-plane deformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). During the next 5 days, the furrow became more pronounced and the regions that will form the palate and lip could be identified as two crescents by 14 DAI (light and dark pink, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These crescents spanned the ventral petal together with half the lateral petal on each side, referred to as the flanks (boundary marked by the lateral midvein, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–G</xref>). The other halves of the lateral petals grew less in width and formed the hinge (green shading, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–G</xref>). Over the next seven days the crescent bulged further to form the wedge with a slope and steep lip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C–D</xref>). Thus, the wedge initiates from a narrow strip of tissue at the tube-lobe boundary that undergoes an out-of-plane deformation through a defined series of morphogenetic events.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20156.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Morphogenesis and fate map of <italic>div</italic> and wild-type lower corollas.</title><p>(<bold>A–G</bold>) Fate map of wedge emergence in the wild-type lower corolla.

The boundary between the palate and the proximal tube (red dashed line) can only be determined after palate trichome emergence at 14 DAI (purple ellipses).

For example, old walls (highlighted in blue) may surround a region of cells subdivided by randomly oriented recent walls (highlighted in green or white, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Or old walls may surround a region subdivided by a ladder of perpendicular recent walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), or a region subdivided by recent perpendicular walls (green), which are in turn further subdivided by more recent walls (white) perpendicular to these (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20156.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Inferring growth orientations from cell division patterns.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Confocal images of petal tissue showing different shapes of cell files (or clones).

This is the same framework used to model the deformations illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Within the GPT framework, specified anisotropic growth is oriented by a polarity field that propagates through the canvas. Regional gene activities modify local specified growth rates parallel (<italic>K<sub>par</sub></italic>) or perpendicular (<italic>K<sub>per</sub></italic>) to the polarity field. Plant cells can be readily imposed on this framework because cell topology is preserved: once a vertex is created by division, its relation to other vertices is maintained through subsequent growth (plant cells do not move relative to each other). We assume that when the area of a cell exceeds a threshold, it is divided along the shortest path through its centroid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Errera, 1886</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Besson and Dumais, 2011</xref>). The new wall is then shortened slightly to give more realistic angles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakielski, 2000</xref>). Cell wall colour and thickness reflect wall age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>).</p><p>If specified growth was isotropic and uniform, the resulting pattern of walls resembled that of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, with the blue outline highlighting the clone derived from the original cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Within the clone, cell walls were oriented randomly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). If specified growth was uniformly anisotropic, with growth oriented proximodistally (vertically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), a pattern similar to that seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> was generated, where division walls were largely perpendicular to the main orientation of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). If specified growth was initially oriented proximodistally and then switches to mediolateral, a pattern similar to that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> was generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Similar patterns of division occurred irrespective of initial cell geometries, although the shape of the final clone varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the calcofluor pattern gives an indication of the history of cell divisions, and orientations of growth. Lines perpendicular to the cell walls reflect growth oriented parallel (red lines) or perpendicular (yellow lines) to the proximodistal axis of the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>).</p><p>Calcofluor staining of developing <italic>div</italic> and wild-type petals showed that at 10 DAI, growth was largely oriented parallel to the proximodistal axis (red lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). In the next three days, cells in regions flanking the presumptive foci showed a switch to mediolateral growth (yellow lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–B and F–G</xref>). This growth pattern continued so that by 15 DAI a clear orthogonal pattern of cell files was observed in the <italic>div</italic> mutant, with cell files being elongated medially at the tube-lobe boundary flanking the foci, proximodistally at the petal junctions and mostly isotropic at the intersection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In wild type, the orthogonal pattern of cell files at 15 DAI was less clear than in <italic>div</italic> as the rim flanking the ventral-lateral petal showed a mixture of cell wall orientations, indicating greater proximodistal growth (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). There was also a region of enhanced mediolateral growth in the lateral (lilac box, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) and ventral lip (green box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). In addition, diagonally oriented cell files were observed near the sinus (orange lines in blue box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The observed pattern of growth at 15 DAI was maintained through later stages of <italic>div</italic> and wild-type development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–D and I</xref>) and correlated with the regions of the petal that formed out-of-plane deformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E and I</xref>). Thus, there was a switch to mediolateral growth in regions flanking the foci prior to and during the out-of-plane deformation, which was modulated by the activity of <italic>DIV</italic>. The timing of this switch was in line with the repatterning of growth predicted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Green et al., 2010</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20156.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Pattern of cell file orientations at the ventral-lateral junctions during <italic>div</italic> and wild-type development.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Confocal images of <italic>div</italic> and wild-type ventral-lateral (V–L) junctions at 10 DAI (<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>), 13 DAI (<bold>C</bold> and <bold>D</bold>) and 15 DAI (<bold>E</bold> and <bold>F</bold>).

To explore this idea further, we simulated orthogonal conflicts using a square initial canvas, similar to that used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. We introduced several transcription factors with different expression domains into the initial canvas: a factor expressed in a vertical strip (JUN, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), a horizontal strip (RIM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), the right half (HALFSIDE, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and upper half (DISTALSIDE, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We first assumed a polarity field converging at the centre, similar to that employed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>. To generate an orthogonal pattern of specified anisotropy, while keeping areal growth rate uniform across the canvas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), we assumed both RIM and JUN promoted specified growth parallel to the polarity (<italic>K<sub>par</sub></italic>) and inhibited specified growth perpendicular to the polarity (<italic>K<sub>per</sub></italic>) (the ratio of <italic>K<sub>par</sub></italic> to <italic>K<sub>per</sub></italic> is indicated by Kaniso in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Growth was specified to be isotropic where RIM and JUN overlap. This set of assumptions created an orthogonal pattern of specified anisotropic growth (red and yellow regions <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) next to quadrants of specified isotropic growth (green regions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Running a model based on these assumptions led to the formation of a dome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>), with clones more elongated within the orthogonal domains of high specified anisotropy than in adjacent quadrants (red ellipse, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

In animals, contractions as well as growth may be involved in generating out-of-plane deformations. In early animal embryogenesis it is common for deformations to occur without overall change in size. To determine how principles of tissue conflict resolution could apply in these contexts, we modelled deformations that preserve overall size. For these purposes, contraction could be considered as equivalent to negative growth.</p><p>For surface conflict, high specified isotropic growth of the upper surface was counterbalanced by an equal negative specified growth rate (contraction) for the lower surface, and gave a folded shape similar to that based on differential growth (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). For areal conflict, negative specified isotropic growth at the periphery was counterbalanced by high specified growth in the centre, and gave a shape again similar to that based on increased growth alone (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>). For directional conflict, enhanced growth parallel to polarity (positive <italic>K<sub>par</sub></italic>) was counterbalanced by negative specified growth perpendicular to the polarity (negative <italic>K<sub>per</sub></italic>), and gave a similar result to overall positive growth (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–H</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6P–Q</xref>).

To test whether a polarity field is present and determine its pattern of orientations, we analysed PIN1 auxin transport protein distribution as this is a possible readout of cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Steinmann et al., 1999</xref>). The Snapdragon genome has 11 <italic>PIN</italic> genes, three of which are PIN1 orthologues (<italic>PIN1a</italic>, <italic>PIN1b</italic> and <italic>PIN1c</italic>). RNA in situ hybridisation revealed that the three <italic>PIN1</italic> genes showed detectable expression in developing wild-type petals, with all PIN1 orthologues strongly expressed in the vascular tissue and epidermis in the palate region of the lower petals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine protein localisation, we raised peptide antibodies against each of the three proteins, as well as a generic antibody against a conserved domain in all three. The antibody raised to the PIN1a-based peptide gave the clearest signal. As this peptide shares some amino acids with the other PIN1s, we cannot be sure that the signal derives entirely from PIN1a and therefore refer to the signal obtained as PIN1 signal. Immunolocalisations on sectioned tissue showed that PIN1 signal is localised at the distal end of epidermal cells in early wild-type petal primordia, with abaxial and adaxial polarity converging at the tip of the petal primordia (day 9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). This is in agreement with PIN1 patterns observed in emerging primordia in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Connor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reinhardt et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>To analyse PIN1 polarity in regions undergoing out-of-plane deformations, we developed a whole-mount immunolocalisation protocol for plant tissue sheets, and software to quantify the distribution of PIN1 signal for each cell (PinPoint software). Prior to the repatterning of corolla growth in <italic>div</italic> and wild type, PIN1 is strongly expressed near the petal sinuses and margins, and is oriented proximodistally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2D–E</xref>). This pattern extends over more cells proximally when the orthogonal pattern of cell files begins to form (13 DAI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2F–G</xref>), overlapping with the distal region showing proximodistal cell files (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I–J</xref>). PIN1 is more extended in wild type than in <italic>div</italic>. Within the extended region, polarity is oriented proximodistally along the petal junction (3–4 central files within green dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2G</xref>). Either side of this, polarity points diagonally, towards the central files and nearby margins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2G</xref>).

We therefore used a strip of canvas as the initial configuration for our minimal model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). The strip was convex on the abaxial and concave on the adaxial surface, as observed for this region of the corolla before out-of-plane deformation. Growth rates were modulated by regional identity factors distributed along three axes – proximodistal, mediolateral and dorsoventral – similar to those employed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Green et al., 2010</xref>). The dorsoventral factor was a diffusible signal derived from the dorsal region, sRAD, and specified the hinge region of the lateral petal (red shading in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). The proximodistal factors included PALATE (PLT), RIM and LIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), which corresponded to distinct regions and cell types in the flower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keck et al., 2003</xref>). RIM was a diffusible signal that activated the expression of BRIM to subdivide the regions of PLT and LIP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). The mediolateral factors LAT and MED corresponded to the petal junctions and midvein regions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). All of these factors interacted combinatorially to control the specified rates of growth parallel (<italic>K<sub>par</sub></italic>) and perpendicular (<italic>K<sub>per</sub></italic>) to the polarity field (details of interactions are given in Supplementary Material and methods). As PIN1 cellular localisation was only observed around the sinus and was mainly proximodistal, we made the simplest assumption that polarity is maintained as proximodistal throughout the canvas (black arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Alternatively, polarity outside the PIN1 upregulation domain may reorient to point towards the petal junction to create a region of mediolateral polarity flanking a channel of proximodistal polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6T–U</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media13">Video 13</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20156.030</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Tissue-level model of <italic>div</italic> corolla development.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Modelling formation of <italic>div</italic> domes.

The strip is slightly curved to represent the initial petal shape, as shown in the side view of the canvas thickness (Side). During the setup phase, several identity factors are established in domains along three different axes: (1) dorsoventral – sRAD which grades into the lateral petals from the dorsal petals, (2) proximodistal - LIP, PLT, RIM and BRIM and (3) mediolateral - LAT at petal junctions, and MED in the midvein region.

To evaluate the contribution of each type of conflict to the final shape, we removed each individually. Removing surface conflict (by equalising growth rates on the two surfaces) led to the out-of-plane deformations protruding abaxially instead of adaxially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media15">Video 15</xref>). This was because the direction of bulging reflected the curvature of the initial strip of tissue, which was abaxially convex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Removing areal conflicts, by normalising the growth rates across the canvas, resulted in a crumpled strip with long hinge regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9H</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media16">Video 16</xref>). Removing all directional conflict by eliminating polarity, while maintaining the patterns of areal and surface conflicts, generated a curved strip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9I</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media17">Video 17</xref>).

We therefore assumed that <italic>DIV</italic> promotes <italic>K<sub>par</sub></italic> in the palate and lip regions from an early stage (Kaniso, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>; <italic>K<sub>area</sub></italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). <italic>DIV</italic> also enhanced surface conflict by increasing the extent of differential growth parallel to the polarity between the two surfaces near the rim, consistent with differential expression of cell division genes in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaudin et al., 2000</xref>)).

To simulate the observed deflection of polarity towards the wild-type sinus at 12 DAI, we assumed <italic>DIV</italic> activates expression of a new polariser sink at the sinus (blue arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>). To account for the observed patterns of orthogonal cell files in the wild type, we assumed that at 12 DAI <italic>DIV</italic> extends the region of high <italic>K<sub>per</sub></italic> flanking the foci into the lip region (white dashed lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>), enhancing directional conflict. <italic>K<sub>per</sub></italic> was also inhibited at the distal and proximal boundaries as a proxy for the restraining effect of adjacent tissue.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20156.039</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Tissue-level model of wild-type corolla development.</title><p>(<bold>A–J</bold>) Modelling of the wild-type wedge.

This directional conflict interacts with areal and surface conflicts to generate the observed shape. We propose these conflicts are generated through combinatorial patterns of gene activity along different axes of the flower, which modulate local rates and orientations of growth, and hence the pattern of conflicts. Dorsoventral genes, such as <italic>DIV</italic>, affect all three types of conflicts to various degrees, which resolve to generate flowers with altered shapes in different genotypes.</p><p>Computational modelling allows the role of each conflict to be revealed by simulations in which each conflict is removed, while preserving the others, producing virtual mutants with altered shapes. These phenotypes are distinct from virtual mutants obtained by removing dorsoventral gene activity from the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9G–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10G–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A–D</xref>). The difference may reflect evolutionary history through which genes modulate conflicts in multiple ways to modify flower shape. The end result is that each gene, such as <italic>DIV</italic>, has an effect on multiple conflicts.</p><p>Each conflict depends on combinatorial interaction of multiple genes, such as those specifying orthogonal domains needed for directional conflict. These expression domains are established along the mediolateral and proximodistal axes. Orthogonal gene expression domains are prevalent in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wolpert et al., 2015</xref>), although the genes establishing the orthogonal domains in the Snapdragon corolla remains to be identified.</p><p>In addition to orthogonal domains, directional conflict also requires a system for providing axial information within each region that allows specified growth to be oriented. Axial information cannot be specified directly by gene expression levels which provide only scalar information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lawrence et al., 2007</xref>). Axiality could be provided by a polarity field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosveld et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>) or through mechanical cues such as stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heisler et al., 2010</xref>); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hervieux et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesise that the axial information is primarily provided by a polarity field, with growth rates specified parallel or perpendicular to it. PIN1 localisation reveals a tissue cell polarity pattern that it is largely proximodistal at early stages. At the time of repatterning, PIN1 is upregulated at the petal junctions, where polarity remains largely proximodistal, rather than being inverted distal to the foci as had been previously hypothesised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Green et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, the growth orientations specified by these two polarity patterns would be similar, as specified anisotropic growth depends on axiality, which is the same whether the polarity is inverted or not. Thus, PIN1 localisation helps narrow down the possibilities for potential polarity fields guiding specified growth by providing data that cannot be inferred from growth analysis alone.</p><p>Although remaining proximodistal along the petal junctions, PIN1 polarity is deflected during repatterning towards the sinus. Growth orientations follow this line of deflection, consistent with polarity orienting growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I–J</xref>). The direction of polarity in the flanking regions which undergo mediolaterally oriented growth is unknown, as PIN1 signal is not observed in these regions. For simplicity we assume the polarity is maintained as proximodistal in these regions, and growth is enhanced perpendicular to the polarity. These assumptions can generate a Snapdragon corolla shape similar to that of a previous model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Green et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>An alternative to polarity fields for orienting anisotropic specified growth is to employ the residual stresses generated by areal conflicts. This idea has been explored in the case of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> sepal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hervieux et al., 2016</xref>), where it was proposed that stresses generated by differential isotropic specified growth could feed back to reinforce tissue regions in the direction of the local stress. Regions of tissue would then no longer grow isotropically if mechanically isolated (i.e. specified anistropic growth). However, simulations show that using local stresses to orient specified anisotropy does not allow a coordinated pattern of orientations to be specified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hervieux et al., 2016</xref>). This is because growth feeds back to modify the stresses and destabilises their orientations. To get around this problem, it was proposed that average stress orientation across the sepal orient specified anisotropic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hervieux et al., 2016</xref>). It is unclear, however, how such a sensing mechanism might operate and how it would allow an orthogonal pattern of orientations to be specified in the case of the Snapdragon flower.</p><p>Whatever the mechanism for orienting specified growth, it needs be connected with cellular properties. A growing plant tissue can be considered as a deforming mesh of cell walls which yields continuously to cellular turgor pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lockhart, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moulia and Fournier, 2009</xref>). This continuous process of mesh deformation is coordinated with introduction of new walls through cell division, keeping cell sizes within certain bounds and allowing mesh strength to be maintained as it grows. Specified growth depends on how genes control the degree of wall extensibility and cell turgor. Turgor pressure acts isotropically, while cell wall extensibility can be anisotropic because of the orientation and cross-linking of wall fibres such as cellulose. If a sheet of cellular tissue has uniform turgor and its walls have isotropic mechanical properties and yield to the pressure, the tissue gets uniformly larger. This situation corresponds to uniform isotropic specified growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Conflicts arise through spatial variation in turgor and/or wall extensibility. For example, the areal conflict illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> could arise if walls in the central region of a square tissue yield more readily in the plane to turgor pressure. Similarly, the surface conflict in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> could reflect walls yielding more readily in the upper layer of cells of the tissue.</p><p>Specified anisotropic growth depends on orientation and/or cross-linking of cellulose fibres in the cell wall, giving it anisotropic yielding properties. Tissue cell polarity could influence growth orientations by biasing alignments of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hashimoto, 2015</xref>), or other processes influencing cell wall anisotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cosgrove, 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2016b</xref>). Directional conflicts would then arise through variation in tissue cell polarity orientations and/or how cells modify wall extensibility in response to these orientations (e.g. wall stiffness parallel or perpendicular to the polarity, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coen and Rebocho, 2016</xref>)).</p><p>We show that tissue conflict resolutions can generate similar deformations with or without overall growth, suggesting they provide a flexible morphogenetic mechanism applicable to many systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). For example, pollen wall folding has been proposed to arise through differential shrinkage following water loss, which would correspond to areal and directional conflicts in shrink (negative growth) rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katifori et al., 2010</xref>). Gastrulation has been proposed to involve differential contraction of the apical and basal ends of cells, corresponding to a surface conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conte et al., 2008</xref>). The formation of the Drosophila wing involves deformation and out-folding of an epithelial sheet in the imaginal disc. Cell divisions within the dorsoventral boundary region of the disc tend to be oriented orthogonally to divisions in the nearby wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baena-López et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mao et al., 2011</xref>), mirrored by orthogonal expression domains (e.g. Dpp, Wingless) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neto-Silva et al., 2009</xref>). Formation of the wing may therefore involve a directional conflict. Animal epithelial deformations can also be generated in the absence of cell proliferation. The dorsal appendage in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is proposed to arise through differential tension oriented along orthogonal expression domains, corresponding to directional conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Osterfield et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, similar types of tissue conflict resolution may underlie deformations for both plant and animal tissues, even though the underlying cell behaviours can be very different.</p><p>According to the view presented here, tissue deformations arise through a dynamic interplay between gene activity and mechanical connectivity leading to local rotations through tissue conflict resolution. We show how genes can influence shape by changing the spatiotemporal pattern of tissue conflicts. This requires that genes modify local cell properties, such as wall extensibility in plants, actomyosin contractibility in animals, as well as tissue cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coen and Rebocho, 2016</xref>). Outstanding questions are how such cellular properties are genetically controlled to produce the various types of tissue conflict, and how they are modulated during evolution to generate diverse shapes such as floral spurs and pitcher-shaped leaves.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material</title><p><italic>Antirrhinum majus</italic> (snapdragon) wild type (JI7 and JI2) and <italic>div-13</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Almeida et al., 1997</xref>) were grown in the greenhouse at the John Innes Centre.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Staging of Stock7 flower development</title><p>Using the published staging reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vincent and Coen, 2004</xref>) for JI2 flower development, we adapted it to JI7.

We used the lateral petal midvein as the mediolateral limit of the wedge, which was visible at early stages just after petal emergence at 8 DAI. To mark the upper and lower limits of the wedge along the proximodistal axis, we used the lip-distal lobe boundary and the palate-distal tube boundary, respectively. The petal-distal lobe boundary ran along the sinus of the petals, so to mark this boundary we drew lines from the D-L petal sinus to the V-L sinus as well as the two V-L sinuses. This morphological landmark was easily marked from the time of petal emergence. The proximal wedge limit could only be marked after 14 DAI, when palate trichomes emerged. This limit could not be marked in <italic>div</italic>-13 as the lower petals did not develop palate trichomes (due to absence of ventral identity). The rim position was visible from 14 DAI, as a furrow in flattened petals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Optical tomography projection (OPT)</title><p>Snapdragon flower buds were dissected from inflorescences, sepals removed and the buds prepared for OPT as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2006</xref>).

After dehydration (50% and 70% ethanol), samples were embedded in paraffin (wax paramat-361148C, VWR) using a Tissue-TEK VIP processor (Sakura). 8 µm sections were cut, mounted on polysine slides (VWR) and dried overnight at 42°C. Slides were dewaxed in histoclear (2x for 10 min) (HS-200, National Diagnostics) and hydrated through a decreasing ethanol series (made in 1x saline solution: 0.85% (w/v) NaCl). Slides were washed in PBS solution before digesting the tissue with Pronase (0.125 mg/ml, P6911 Sigma-Aldrich) for 12 min. A 0.2% (v/v) Glycine-PBS solution was used to block the Pronase activity (3 min, RT), followed by a PBS wash and another fixation step with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min.

Two microliters of hydrolysed probe plus 100 µl of hybridisation buffer were used per slide, and covered with Hybrislip hybridisation cover (HS6024-CS, Grace biolabs). Slides were hybridised in a humid box overnight at 50°C. Next day, slides were washed 3 times in 0.2x SSC solution at 55°C for 25 min. Single stranded RNA was digested with RNaseA (0.02 mg/ml, R4875 Sigma-Aldrich) in NTE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA and 500 mM NaCl) at 37°C for 30 min.

Slides were dewaxed in histoclear (2x for 10 min) (HS-200, National Diagnostics) and hydrated through a decreasing ethanol series. To improve antigen retrieval, slides were boiled in 10 mM citrate (pH 6) for 15 min and then left to cool for 30 min at room temperature. Slides were rinsed in deionized water and blocked in BB (5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk in PBS pH 7.5) at RT for 3 hr. Immunohybridisation of AmPIN1 was carried out overnight at 4°C using 1:500 primary anti-AmPIN1 antibody in BB. After washing three times (10 min) with PBS containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton-x100, the slides were hybridised with Alexa594-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:500) for 3 hr.

A composite stack of Anti-PIN1-Alexa594 and calcofluor staining was loaded into the program. For each cell segmentation, we determined which cell the PIN signal belonged to by manually scrolling through the z-stack. In ambiguous cases this determination was aided by PIN signal following the curvature of cell walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). A representative segmentation plane was chosen near to the cell’s midplane and the cell boundary was manually segmented. The segmentation was used to create an image mask of the cell. A second image mask was created for each cell by morphologically eroding the cell boundary with a disk-shaped structuring element of radius five pixels (≈1.5 µm). A difference image was created by subtracting the eroded mask from the original cell mask. For each pixel in the difference image, a vector was calculated using the PIN1 pixel intensity as magnitude and angle measured from the cell centroid to the pixel, relative to the x-axis as orientation. The sum of these vectors was used to represent the polarity of each cell. Average vector fields were calculated by summing vectors for each cell within a 30 × 30 pixel window.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Definition of tissue conflict resolution</title><p>Mathematically, growth of a region is described by a growth tensor which can have both a strain (symmetric) and rotational (skew-symmetric) component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hejnowicz and Romberger, 1984</xref>). A specified growth tensor has a strain component but no rotational component, as we assume that each tissue region exerts no intrinsic rotational force. However, a resultant growth tensor may have both strain and rotational components. If all regions are specified to grow in a similar manner and no external forces act on the tissue, specified and resultant growth are the same. This is a conflict-free situation and no local rotations are generated (the resultant tensor has no rotational component). By contrast, if specified growth varies across a tissue it may create situations of potential conflict which are resolved or reduced through local rotation (i.e. the resultant growth tensor has a rotational component). Local rotations provide degrees of freedom not part of the specified growth which can allow potential stresses to be reduced. We refer to this mechanism for generating local tissue rotations as <italic>tissue conflict resolution</italic>.</p><p>In some cases, the potential conflicts in growth may be fully resolved through rotations, in which case the only difference between specified and resultant growth tensors is in the rotational component and there is no residual strain. For example, a conformal map is a planar deformation in which local rotations are generated through a gradient in isotropic specified growth without producing residual strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mitchison, 2016</xref>). If the tissue did not rotate locally to accommodate the gradient in specified growth, residual stresses would be generated. Thus, local rotations fully resolve the potential tissue conflict. In most cases, however, local rotations only partially resolve the conflicts and the specified and resultant growth tensors differ in the strain component (residual strain) as well as the rotational component. Some residual strain is inevitable in cases of tissue buckling (curvature through areal or directional conflicts), as the two surfaces of the tissue grow to a different extent, even though their specified strains are identical.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Computational modelling</title><p>See Supplementary Material and methods for a full description of tissue-level modelling.

Cells are drawn on the canvas and their vertices displaced with the canvas as it grows. New walls and vertices introduced when the cell area reached a threshold value. Division walls take the shortest path through the cell centroid. The model has three stages: (T0), when the canvas is established and the initial cells are introduced; (T1), a first phase of growth, and (T2) a second phase of growth. To distinguish between the age of cells walls formed at each stage, we specify that walls at an initial time point (T0) are marked with thick blue lines, cell walls that arise during T1 are shown with thinner green lines and cell walls that arise during T2 are marked with very thinner white lines.

Set up</title><p>The initial rectangular canvas is 1060 µm by 120 µm, based on average width and depth measurements of the incipient wedge at 10 DAI. The KRN has two phases: 10–12 DAI (phase I) and 12–24 DAI (phase II). POL production is promoted by SOURCE, expressed at the most proximal region of the rectangle, and degraded at SINK, expressed at the most distal region of the canvas, generating a proximodistal polarity field. By 10 DAI, the polariser gradient, the expression pattern of the identity factors and diffusible factors (prefixed with ‘s’) are established, and then fixed to the canvas for the rest of the simulation. Regional factors are established along three axes:</p><p>Dorsoventral axis: the dorsally expressed gene RAD is expressed at the most lateral petal edges and produces a signal (sRAD) that diffuses into the lateral petals (hinge region) and inhibits the ventrally expressed gene DIV.</p><p>Proximodistal axis: PALATE (PLT) is expressed in the proximal region. PALATEPROX (PLX) is expressed in the most proximal part of the palate. RIM is expressed at the distal limit of PLT. RIM promotes production of sRIM which diffuses and activates BRIM when the levels of sRIM are higher than 0.01. LIP is distal to RIM and is subdivided in the proximal region, LIPCLIFF (LIF), and a distal region, LIPDISTAL (LIS).</p><p>Mediolateral axis: graded factors are sMED, which is centred on the petal midvein, sSEC, which is centred on the secondary veins, and sLAT which is centred on the junction between petals.</p><p>Sectors (circular regions) were induced at around 12.5 DAI, with initial sector size scaled to the initial size of a cell (~10 µm). Growth in canvas thickness was maintained at 0.44 %/h in all models.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-2"><title>Figure 9 A-E.

The PRN is as described in the set-up phase for the previously published model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Green et al., 2010</xref>), and the polarity field maintained throughout the entire corolla development, except in the wild-type model (see below). The POL gradient is frozen on both surfaces in the tube region during EARLY and in the lip region during LATE. Virtual sectors are induced around the repatterning stage (14 DAI). Growth in canvas thickness is 0.3 %/h. To facilitate comparisons, equations have different colours depending whether they are common between the published and the current model (black), present in published model but modified in the current model (blue), present in the published model but removed from the current model (red) or new to the current model (purple).

LIPCLIFF (LIF), expressed at the proximal region of the LIP; and LIPDISTAL (LIS), at the distal region of the LIP. In the published model, DIV is initially expressed uniformly across the lower petals and becomes graded at 14 DAI, due to inhibition by LTS (expressed at the hinge region of the laterals). In the current model, DIV is graded from early stages through inhibition by sRAD. The sRAD signal is produced in the dorsal petals and diffuses into lateral petals, where it activates the HINGE identity factor (instead of LTS) and LPDP identity factor at the lateral-dorsal petal junction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16-3"><title>Figure 9K. <italic>div</italic> mutant</title><p>Same as the ground stage with the following modifications</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf42"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> in the dorsal and lower petal lobes modified (modified K.1.6a and K.1.6b and new K.1.20) and growth of the LIP in the DICH region boosted (modified K.1.4b).</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf43"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula></italic> boosted by LIPDISTAL (LIS) in lower petals while inhibited by HINGE.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Ottoline Leyser (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors study the process of tissue deformation, focusing on the petal deformation during the development of the bee landing pad in the snapdragon flower. The key question addressed is how such deformation results from individual cell behavior. As main tools, the authors combine experimental methods that allow to quantitatively follow tissue growth with computer simulations. As a main result, the authors propose the framework of 'tissue conflict', the idea that deformation can result from differences in the growth behavior of individual cells, and which result from specific patterns of gene expression at the cellular and tissue level.</p><p>All reviewers recommended this paper as an excellent contribution to this field that should be of wide general interest because of the important conceptual advance in provides.</p><p>As you will see below, however, there are points raised which require clarification before publication. Most of these points do not require new data but a better explanation and/or exploration of the existing data and its interpretation, and wider consideration of alternative interpretations. We would like to ask you therefore to address all requests.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The experiments and modeling aimed at elucidating the role of DIV in shaping snapdragon flowers provide a nice complement to other recent works from the Coen lab (Eldridge et al. 2016 Development, Sauret-Güeto et al. 2013 PLoS biol, Kuchen et al. 2012, Green et al. 2010 PLoS Biology, Kenneway et al. 2011 PLoS Comp Bio) illustrating how genetically specified growth and mechanics can shape organ form. In this framework the concepts of specified and resultant growth have been very valuable.</p><p>A systematic examination of growth patterns leading to out-of-plane deformations is interesting and useful for the understanding of the emergence of organ form. The simulation study at the start of the manuscript is a step in this direction, and extending this exploration into something more substantial would represent a significant contribution.</p><p>A key difficulty with the manuscript is that the central concept of &quot;tissue conflicts&quot; is not sufficiently well-defined. Specifically, it is not clear how &quot;tissue conflicts&quot; are related to aspects of growth (specified or resultant) or mechanics (stresses, strains and residual stresses). Comments in the manuscript seem to imply that &quot;conflicts&quot; either correspond to situations when specified growth induces residual stresses (e.g. Introduction: &quot;Even though growth is isotropic, anisotropies result from areal conflict&quot;), or growth is non-uniform. Either case seems somewhat problematic.</p><p>Residual stresses may in some cases be sufficient to generate out of plane deformations, however it is unclear whether they are from a theoretical perspective necessary. Consequently, it is unclear whether and to what degree residual stresses drive generation of 3D forms, or are a common by-product of growth that sometimes feeds back to geometry.</p><p>Similarly, non-uniform growth does not necessarily lead to out of plane deformations. For instance, Coleocetae has very non-uniform growth but none the less remains flat (Dupuy L, Mackenzie J, Haseloff J. 2010. Coordination of plant cell division and expansion in a simple morphogenetic system. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA 107: 2711-2716).</p><p>In either case, it is unclear what conceptual clarity is gained by introducing the notion &quot;conflicts&quot; or if there can be a proper mathematical conceptualization of a conflict-something which we have for residual stresses and growth. The danger therefore is that precise formulations are replaced with an appealing but imprecise notion.</p><p>Specific substantive comments:</p><p>1) Initial cell geometry presumably has a strong impact on the cell division patterns in the cell file simulations presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Without quantifying this effect, how is it possible to accurately interpret the results of these simulations? This seems a key issue to resolve.</p><p>2) Cell divisions in cell file simulations are performed by splitting cells along the shortest wall passing through the centroid. As this divides cells according to Errera's rule, it is unclear why the authors have chosen to cite Besson and Dumais (PNAS 2011) instead of Errera's original manuscript (Errera L (1886) Sur une condition fondamentale d'équilibre des cellules vivantes.). The simulated patterns presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> also appear to incorporate shortening of the new cell wall, which is not considered by Besson and Dumais, but instead the cell division method proposed in Nakielski, J. (2000) in Pattern Formation in Biology, Vision, and Dynamics.</p><p>3) Examining the longitudinal midsections of WT flowers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the form of the lower corolla appears to closely follow the anatomy of organs enclosed by the petals. This seems relevant but the authors do not seem to comment on it? As similar images are not provided for div mutants it is thus unclear to what degree the observed differences in corolla form between mutant and wild-type plants may relate to differences in the growth of adjacent portions of the flower.</p><p>4) The PIN quantification tool is interesting. A major challenge however is how to confidently quantify amount of signal at each side of the wall. The two flanking membranes are very thin and the signal is generally not sufficiently discrete in the magnifications they are looking. I can see how quantification would work for total amount of signal in the two sides flanking a wall but if they can quantify each side they need to explain the method more clearly. How do they deal with problems introduced by many sections being oblique which would skew the relative signal to the wall or slight non-uniformity in staining? How does calcofluor affect the method? Overall it would seem appropriate to provide information on fidelity and accuracy of the method.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper introduces the idea of tissue conflict as a &quot;general framework for viewing out-of-plane deformations with or without overall growth&quot; during morphogenesis. I prefer the term &quot;framework&quot; as used here, to &quot;mechanism&quot; as used elsewhere in the paper. The value of this framework is illustrated in the context of the analysis of petal deformation during the development of the bee landing pad in the snapdragon flower. The tissue conflict concept extends a conceptual toolbox generated by this team, encapsulated in a computational modelling environment. This work has provided important insights into the process of morphogenesis, which remains a largely enigmatic area of developmental biology because of the difficulty of thinking coherently in 4D. The addition of the tissue conflicts idea seems to me very promising, and this is successfully illustrated by the insights it provides into petal deformation, as regulated by the DIV gene.</p><p>The paper has the difficult task of presenting 4D results, both in general and in the specific case of the snapdragon corolla. The authors do a good job of leading the reader through these complexities. I have suggested some additions below that would have helped me further, but I recognize that different people will find different narratives/illustrations helpful.</p><p>In the Discussion, the authors consider how their framework for the analysis of morphogenesis compares to others in the field. They also consider the molecular-cellular basis for the properties they propose. These aspects are extremely helpful in allowing the reader to understand the relationship between the various heuristics currently in use.</p><p>Overall, I find this paper to be an excellent contribution to this field that should be of wide general interest because of the important conceptual advance in provides.</p><p>My specific suggestions for improvement are:</p><p>1) For me the OPT sections presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> provided a much easier entry point to understanding the out of plane deformations of interest than the illustrations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Could some sections of this sort be added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>?</p><p>2) I would have liked a more precise definition of exactly how the red, yellow and orange inferred growth orientation lines were drawn.

Specifically, it is not clear how &quot;tissue conflicts&quot; are related to aspects of growth (specified or resultant) or mechanics (stresses, strains and residual stresses). Comments in the manuscript seem to imply that &quot;conflicts&quot; either correspond to situations when specified growth induces residual stresses (e.g. Introduction: &quot;Even though growth is isotropic, anisotropies result from areal conflict&quot;), or growth is non-uniform. Either case seems somewhat problematic.</italic> </p><p><italic>Residual stresses may in some cases be sufficient to generate out of plane deformations, however it is unclear whether they are from a theoretical perspective necessary. Consequently, it is unclear whether and to what degree residual stresses drive generation of 3D forms, or are a common by-product of growth that sometimes feeds back to geometry.</italic> </p><p><italic>Similarly, non-uniform growth does not necessarily lead to out of plane deformations. For instance, Coleocetae has very non-uniform growth but none the less remains flat (Dupuy L, Mackenzie J, Haseloff J. 2010. Coordination of plant cell division and expansion in a simple morphogenetic system. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA 107: 2711-2716).</italic> </p><p><italic>In either case, it is unclear what conceptual clarity is gained by introducing the notion &quot;conflicts&quot; or if there can be a proper mathematical conceptualization of a conflict-something which we have for residual stresses and growth. The danger therefore is that precise formulations are replaced with an appealing but imprecise notion.</italic> </p><p>Based on the comments of this and the other reviewers we realise that the term ‘tissue conflict’ was too readily confused with residual stress. As the key point about tissue conflict is the way it becomes resolved to generate local rotations and curvature, we have changed the name to ‘tissue conflict resolution’ and defined it more clearly in the Introduction (see response to referee #2 below), and have given a more mathematical formulation in the Materials and methods. In particular, we have clarified that tissue conflict resolution refers to a mechanism for generating tissue rotations through differential growth, as distinct from rotations arising through external forces. We also cite a recent review covering planar and well as out-of-plane tissue conflict resolution (Coen &amp; Rebocho, 2016). The mathematical formulation given in the Materials and methods is below:</p><p>“Definition of tissue conflict resolution. Mathematically, growth of a region is described by a growth tensor which can have both a strain (symmetric) and rotational (skew-symmetric) component (Hejnowicz and Romberger 1984). […] Some residual strain is inevitable in cases of tissue buckling (curvature through areal or directional conflicts), as the two surfaces of the tissue grow to a different extent, even though their specified strains are identical.”</p><p><italic>Specific substantive comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Initial cell geometry presumably has a strong impact on the cell division patterns in the cell file simulations presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Without quantifying this effect, how is it possible to accurately interpret the results of these simulations? This seems a key issue to resolve.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer raises an interesting point. To address it we did simulations with various initial cell geometries. The resultant division patterns are very similar, although the outlines of the clones have a different shape. We have mentioned this finding in the Results (subsection “Morphogenesis of wild type and <italic>div</italic>”, seventh paragraph) and included a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Cell divisions in cell file simulations are performed by splitting cells along the shortest wall passing through the centroid. As this divides cells according to Errera's rule, it is unclear why the authors have chosen to cite Besson and Dumais (PNAS 2011) instead of Errera's original manuscript (Errera L (1886) Sur une condition fondamentale d'équilibre des cellules vivantes.). The simulated patterns presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> also appear to incorporate shortening of the new cell wall, which is not considered by Besson and Dumais, but instead the cell division method proposed in Nakielski, J. (2000) in Pattern Formation in Biology, Vision, and Dynamics.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these points and have modified the citations and explained the method used more fully:</p><p>“We assume that when the area of a cell exceeds a threshold, it is divided along the shortest path through its centroid (Errera 1886, Besson and Dumais 2011). The new wall is then shortened slightly to give more realistic angles (Nakielski 2000).”</p><p><italic>3) Examining the longitudinal midsections of WT flowers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the form of the lower corolla appears to closely follow the anatomy of organs enclosed by the petals. This seems relevant but the authors do not seem to comment on it? As similar images are not provided for div mutants it is thus unclear to what degree the observed differences in corolla form between mutant and wild-type plants may relate to differences in the growth of adjacent portions of the flower.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer rightly points out that the corolla tube follows the shape of the anther for some of its length and raises the question of whether the anther may have a role in shaping the petal. One argument against this is that in <italic>plena</italic> mutants, in which stamens are replaced by petals, corolla shape in whorl 2 is similar to wild-type. We now cite this finding in the Introduction (second paragraph, see also response to reviewer #3 below).</p><p><italic>4) The PIN quantification tool is interesting. A major challenge however is how to confidently quantify amount of signal at each side of the wall. The two flanking membranes are very thin and the signal is generally not sufficiently discrete in the magnifications they are looking. I can see how quantification would work for total amount of signal in the two sides flanking a wall but if they can quantify each side they need to explain the method more clearly. How do they deal with problems introduced by many sections being oblique which would skew the relative signal to the wall or slight non-uniformity in staining? How does calcofluor affect the method? Overall it would seem appropriate to provide information on fidelity and accuracy of the method.</italic> </p><p>We have added some close-up images of cells in the Supplementary material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2L</xref>) showing the calcofluor and PIN signal. These images show that PIN signal can usually be localised to one side of the wall. We have also further clarified the description of the method (subsection “Quantifying PIN1 polarity”), explaining that a section near the midplane was chosen for each cell as this reduces the problem of obliqueness and non-uniformity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This paper introduces the idea of tissue conflict as a &quot;general framework for viewing out-of-plane deformations with or without overall growth&quot; during morphogenesis. I prefer the term &quot;framework&quot; as used here, to &quot;mechanism&quot; as used elsewhere in the paper. The value of this framework is illustrated in the context of the analysis of petal deformation during the development of the bee landing pad in the snapdragon flower. The tissue conflict concept extends a conceptual toolbox generated by this team, encapsulated in a computational modelling environment. This work has provided important insights into the process of morphogenesis, which remains a largely enigmatic area of developmental biology because of the difficulty of thinking coherently in 4D. The addition of the tissue conflicts idea seems to me very promising, and this is successfully illustrated by the insights it provides into petal deformation, as regulated by the DIV gene.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this valuable point about mechanism versus framework. It is understandable as we did not explicitly mention the alternative mechanism, which is that external forces drive tissue rotation. To clarify this point, we have clarified tissue conflict resolution and the alternative mechanism in the Introduction:</p><p>“A key feature of out of plane deformations of a tissue sheet is that they involve generation of curvature (local rotations out of the plane). […] We refer to this second mechanism, in which heterogeneity of specified growth within the tissue leads to local rotations that reduce potential stresses, as tissue conflict resolution (for a more mathematical definition of tissue conflict resolution see Materials and methods).”</p><p><italic>The paper has the difficult task of presenting 4D results, both in general and in the specific case of the snapdragon corolla. The authors do a good job of leading the reader through these complexities. I have suggested some additions below that would have helped me further, but I recognize that different people will find different narratives/illustrations helpful.</italic> </p><p><italic>In the Discussion, the authors consider how their framework for the analysis of morphogenesis compares to others in the field. They also consider the molecular-cellular basis for the properties they propose. These aspects are extremely helpful in allowing the reader to understand the relationship between the various heuristics currently in use.</italic> </p><p><italic>Overall, I find this paper to be an excellent contribution to this field that should be of wide general interest because of the important conceptual advance in provides.</italic> </p><p><italic>My specific suggestions for improvement are:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) For me the OPT sections presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> provided a much easier entry point to understanding the out of plane deformations of interest than the illustrations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Could some sections of this sort be added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this problem to our attention, which indeed reflects the complexity of conveying shape change in 4D as the reviewer points out. Currently we give the mature flower phenotype first (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and then its development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The OPT sections in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are easier to understand because they are less complex than those of the mature flower (there are fewer overlaps and folds). For this reason, we would prefer to keep the current arrangement. Given that the description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> follows on immediately from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> we hope this is acceptable.</p><p><italic>2) I would have liked a more precise definition of exactly how the red, yellow and orange inferred growth orientation lines were drawn. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> the growth orientation lines in the zoomed in box from B do not map well onto the lines in the zoomed out image. Presumably the authors generated some scale-based rules for exactly how to draw these lines. These could maybe be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> where the approach is introduced.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue. Confusion seems to have arisen in relating the zoomed-in and zoomed-out versions. This is because we chose to show only the clearest regions of oriented division in the zoomed-out version. Thus, only the left region of the box from B is shown as red lines in the zoomed-out version. We have clarified this point by giving a fuller explanation in the figure legends and by correcting the zoomed-in version of B with some extra yellow lines that had been left out by mistake.</p><p><italic>3) I would have found it helpful if <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10A-D</xref> were more directly comparable, with equivalent illustrations presented in the same order even where there was no difference. DIV is required to work quite hard and it is important to be able to grasp quickly the extent of its activities.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A-D</xref> and incorporated elements from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A-D</xref> to make it more comparable.</p><p><italic>4) It would be helpful if the Discussion included a section on how resultant growth might be generated at the cellular level.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We did not include a more detailed discussion of cellular mechanisms to keep the paper short. We have now given a more detailed description of cellular level analysis in a recent review (Coen and Rebocho, 2016) and cite this in the paper at the end of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>[Please note I did not review the detailed computational model]</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is an elegant and overall well-executed study on morphogenesis in snapdragon petals.

The main contribution of the present study is to characterize a case were spatial differences in growth are directional (instead of differences in areal growth as in previous studies).</italic> </p><p>As with our response to referee #1 we have clarified our definition of tissue conflict resolution in the Introduction and Materials and methods, to make it clearer that it is a mechanism for generating local rotations, whether or not residual strain is involved. We agree with the reviewer that a major contribution of our paper is to characterise a case where deformation involves conflicting orientations of growth, but we felt it important to place this type of interaction in relation to other forms of tissue conflict resolution.</p><p><italic>2) It is possible to achieve the same 3D shape by various patterns of 2D growth, notably a pattern with no conflict (where resultant and target growth are identical). What is the experimental evidence that leads the authors to exclude an explanation with no conflict?</italic> </p><p>As we now mention in the Introduction, curvature can arise without tissue conflict resolution through external forces being applied to the tissue. We point out that the normal corolla shape of organ identity mutants argues against this type of mechanism playing a major role (see also response below). There can be cases of tissue conflict resolution in which no residual strain is generated (e.g. conformal maps mentioned in the mathematical definition of tissue conflict resolution). However, this does not apply to the buckling mechanisms we describe and give evidence for (i.e. cell file analysis and modelling), as residual strains are necessarily generated as the two surfaces of the tissue attain different resultant areas (even though they are specified to be the same).</p><p><italic>3) As stated by the authors, the 3D shape arises from residual stresses due to the spatial differences in growth rate or direction. However, they neglect mechanical stresses/forces due to other floral organs. Are other organs really negligible?

We have now pointed out in the Introduction that an alternative to tissue conflict resolution is that deformations arise through forces from other tissues. Evidence against this come from the observation that corolla shape in whorl 2 in <italic>plena</italic> mutants, where stamens are converted to petals, is similar to that in wild type, indicating that stresses from whorl 3 do not have a strong effect on petal shape.</p><p><italic>4) It is unclear what are the causal links between directional growth, cell divisions, and/or PIN1a polarity, and the putative underlying polarity field. How far do cell divisions show the main direction of growth? How independent is PIN1a localisation from the orientation of recent divisions?</italic> </p><p>We have clarified the causal relationships between cellular behaviours and tissue growth in a recent review (Coen &amp; Rebocho, 2016), now cited in our paper. For our simulations we make the plausible assumption that the plane of cell division does not directly direct growth but reflects the pattern of growth. We see a correlation between PIN1a localisation and orientations of division walls, the most notable being the correlation between diagonal walls and deflected PIN1a polarisation (noted in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion).</p></body></sub-article></article>
