illnesses, we comprehensively characterized key non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep parameters across multiple domains, their interdependencies, and their relationship to waking event-related potentials and symptom severity. In 72 schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and 58 controls, we confirmed a marked reduction in sleep spindle density in SCZ and extended these findings to show that fast and slow spindle properties were largely uncorrelated. We also describe a novel measure of slow oscillation and spindle interaction that was attenuated in SCZ. The main sleep findings were replicated in a demographically distinct sample, and a joint model, based on multiple NREM components, statistically predicted disease status in the replication cohort. Although also altered in patients, auditory event-related potentials elicited during wake were unrelated to NREM metrics. Consistent with a growing literature implicating thalamocortical dysfunction in SCZ, our characterization identifies independent NREM and wake EEG biomarkers that may index distinct aspects of SCZ pathophysiology and point to multiple neural mechanisms underlying disease heterogeneity. This study lays the groundwork for evaluating these neurophysiological markers, individually or in combination, to guide efforts at treatment and prevention as well as identifying individuals most likely to benefit from specific interventions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>wake-sleep</kwd><kwd>EEG</kwd><kwd>sleep

cognitive and behavioral dysfunction that significantly impacts the quality of life of affected individuals and their caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Charlson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stanley et al., 2017</xref>). It is highly heritable, exhibiting a heterogenous and polygenic architecture implicating many genetic risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ripke, 2014</xref>). Despite intensive research, current medications ameliorate positive symptoms only in a subset of individuals, often with side effects and with little impact on negative symptoms or cognitive deficits. Consequently, recovery outcomes have not improved over the past decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jääskeläinen et al., 2013</xref>). Given the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of SCZ, identifying reliable, objective biomarkers that index specific neurobiological deficits is crucial for developing the next-generation therapeutics.</p><p>Emerging evidence points to thalamus as a critical node that supports cognitive function, and to abnormal thalamocortical connectivity as a key neurobiological deficit in SCZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Woodward et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anticevic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Woodward and Heckers, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep offers a lens through which we may index thalamocortical function without confounds from waking behaviors such as active symptoms or altered motivation. Two hallmarks of NREM sleep measured by the electroencephalogram (EEG) – slow oscillations (SO) and spindles – reflect distinct thalamic and thalamocortical circuits. The slow (~1 Hz) neuronal oscillations with large amplitude are generated by cortical neurons and propagated by cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits, while spindles are bursts of oscillatory neural activity (typically between 10 and 16 Hz and ~1 s in duration) arising from reverberant interaction between thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and thalamocortical relay neurons and modulated by thalamocortical connections. The coupling of SOs and spindles mediates information transfer and storage during sleep that underpins NREM’s role in overnight memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walker and Stickgold, 2004</xref>). NREM traits show strong heritability in healthy populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambrosius et al., 2008</xref>), correlate with cognitive performances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geiger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Gennaro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Purcell et al., 2017</xref>), and afford objective, quantifiable markers of thalamic and thalamocortical functioning in large cohorts.</p><p>Impaired sleep spindles and SOs have been reported in SCZ patients. Despite relatively consistent support for a general reduction in spindle density and/or amplitude in SCZ patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferrarelli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferrarelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Göder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mylonas et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schilling et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wamsley et al., 2012</xref>), it is not clear how specific topographical and temporal spindle properties, which may reflect distinct thalamocortical connections, are associated with SCZ. For example, distinguishing fast and slow spindles (FS and SS) and their temporal coupling with SO are less studied in SCZ patients. More generally, a comprehensive examination of how NREM features (including existing and novel metrics) are altered in SCZ and how they relate to each other is not established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castelnovo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).

For example, one recent report suggested reductions in spindle density were significantly more extensive in patients experiencing auditory hallucinations compared to hallucination-free patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). Such a link is intriguing, considering the substantial evidence of altered auditory processing in SCZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erickson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Freedman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thuné et al., 2016</xref>), and that both spindles and auditory processing heavily rely on uninterrupted and precise function of thalamocortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferrarelli and Tononi, 2010</xref>). However, whether auditory abnormalities during wake and spindle deficits during sleep reflect similar or distinct thalamocortical dysfunctions in SCZ are yet to be investigated.</p><p>Here, using whole-night high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG), we comprehensively characterized alterations across multiple domains of NREM neurophysiology, their interdependencies and relationship to wake and clinical features in a new SCZ cohort of 72 patients and 58 healthy controls. We first sought to replicate the primary spindle density deficit and characterize the precise facets of spindle activity associated with SCZ, including topography, morphology, and novel metrics of intra-spindle frequency modulation. Second, we extend our analyses to broader NREM sleep EEG, including spectral features, functional connectivity, SOs, and their coupling with spindles, to determine which features track with disease state, and whether their association with SCZ is independent of spindle parameters. Third, we asked whether spindle deficits likely index the same thalamocortical dysfunctions reflected in auditory processing abnormalities during wake, by determining how sleep and wake metrics were correlated within individuals. Fourth, we investigated the relationship between disease-associated metrics and symptom severity within patients. Fifth, we attempted to replicate our sleep EEG findings by compiling an independent and demographically distinct replication dataset of 57 cases and 59 controls and applying the same analytic procedures. Finally, based on multiple domains of EEG metric, we constructed joint models to classify diagnostic status and assessed their predictive performance in the original sample, as well as their transferability to the independent collection of patients with distinct demographics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Whole-night sleep EEG and wake auditory event-related potential (ERP) data were acquired from 130 individuals – 72 patients diagnosed with SCZ (25 females, 34.8 ± 7.0 years of age) and 58 healthy volunteers (CTR, 25 females, 31.7 ± 6.3 years of age) with no personal or family history of SCZ spectrum disorders.

In addition, we demonstrated deficits in patients across multiple domains of NREM sleep including SO density and morphology, spectral power, SO/spindle coupling, and global connectivity, and replicated disrupted auditory processing during wake. Our findings in NREM were largely replicated in an independent and demographically distinct sample of patients and controls. A multivariate predictive model trained in GRINS using multiple NREM metrics was broadly transferable to the replication sample, and outperformed the model based on spindle density alone. Importantly, NREM sleep metrics were largely independent of one another, and did not correlate with wake ERP measures, suggesting multiple distinct thalamic and thalamocortical mechanisms underlying disease abnormalities. Taken together, these results support the utility of biomarkers that are based on a precise dissection of the sleep EEG, with the potential for risk and patient stratification that will ultimately map to distinct neurophysiological deficits.</p><p>Despite showing broadly comparable gross sleep macro-architecture in terms of stage duration and TST, we observed marked spindle impairments in SCZ, not associated with antipsychotic dose or adjunctive medication. Although we observed longer sleep latency in patients, it is not clear how generalizable this finding will be given the context of sleeping at the sleep center following ERP testing. Only a few studies have investigated SS and FS separately in SCZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferrarelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schilling et al., 2017</xref>) despite multiple reports of their distinct topography, functional specificity, and SO coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Purcell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cox et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mölle et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to finding that FS and SS density were largely uncorrelated and independently associated with SCZ, while reductions in the density and amplitude of both FS and SS were found in patients, the decrease in density was more prominent for FS, while the decrease in amplitude was more prominent for SS. Furthermore, despite observing similar average spindle deceleration (chirp) in both FS and SS, only FS showed more pronounced deceleration in patients. Although spindle chirp is a relatively novel metric, it has been shown that such intra-spindle frequency deceleration is a basic property of both SS and FS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrillon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schönwald et al., 2011</xref>). While the mechanisms of how chirp is regulated are not established yet, our findings of altered chirp in SCZ should motivate future studies to investigate this question. In addition to differences in topography, one key distinction between SS and FS is in their coupling with SOs. One study demonstrated intact SO/FS temporal coupling in patients that was associated with overnight consolidation in motor task performance, but did not study SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Demanuele et al., 2017</xref>). In GRINS, we observed reduced SO/spindle overlap in SCZ, but only for SS. Similarly, phase-frequency modulation was altered in SCZ only for SS. Spindles are generated in the TRN and modulated by thalamocortical connections. Interactions between different sub-regions of TRN and higher order or sensory thalamic nuclei have been described molecularly and functionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vantomme et al., 2020</xref>), and may underlie frequency-dependent differences in spindle mechanisms. Alternatively, it is possible that unidentified spindle oscillators outside of TRN in the thalamocortical circuits contribute to SS and FS distinctions. Additional neurobiological studies are warranted to clarify the source of these frequency differences in spindles. Regardless of their origin, SS density and amplitude had more evident associations with SCZ symptomatology (negative symptoms and disorganized thoughts) compared to FS, although this result has yet to be replicated in other samples. Considering that SS and FS properties were largely independent of each other, these distinct patterns of association with SCZ point to differences in their thalamocortical generation and propagation mechanisms and functional affiliations (e.g. relations to sleep-dependent memory consolidation).</p><p>Spectral power was reduced in SCZ in sigma and delta/theta frequencies. The former finding was expected due to spindle deficits and is consistent with previous studies with smaller samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferrarelli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferrarelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wamsley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Manoach et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Manoach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Göder et al., 2006</xref>). Spectral power in slow (0.5–1 Hz) or delta (1–4 Hz) bands has been used as a proxy for SO activity. Both unaltered and reduced slow/delta power have been reported in SCZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferrarelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Göder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wamsley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Manoach et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Manoach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Göder et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Keshavan et al., 1998</xref>).

Underpowered samples, methodological differences, and/or medication effects may account for these apparent discrepancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castelnovo et al., 2018</xref>). Using the current GRINS sample – which is at least twice as large as most of the previous studies – we observed SO alterations in patients, including increased SO density, duration, and flatter slope. Only SO density differences replicated here, although it is plausible that the limited four-channel montage was a limitation. Caveats include that we only considered SOs during N2 sleep, potential methodological effects of thresholding choices, and associations between SO metrics and adjunctive medication use. Overall, although our findings suggest that some form of SO abnormality is plausible in SCZ, these effects are not as large or robust as the spindle deficit, despite the putative role of SO in orchestrating spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Staresina et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Global patterns of functional connectivity during N2 sleep were also affected in SCZ. While there is substantial evidence of abnormal waking connectivity as a hallmark of SCZ from fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van den Heuvel and Fornito, 2014</xref>) and M/EEG studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mackintosh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maran et al., 2016</xref>), connectivity findings in sleep are more scarce and restricted to coherence in spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wamsley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Markovic et al., 2020</xref>) and slow/delta frequency bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartsch et al., 2019</xref>), mostly pointing to reduced connectivity in patients, although there is also evidence of increased coherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Markovic et al., 2020</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, only two prior studies have evaluated coherence at other frequencies during sleep. One study reported increased coherence across classical frequency bands in childhood onset SCZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Markovic et al., 2021</xref>); another study investigated NREM coherence in beta and gamma frequencies in a very limited sample yielding null results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yeragani et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The typically used magnitude squared coherence metric is very sensitive to volume conduction effects, precluding accurate estimation of true connectivity between channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sakkalis, 2011</xref>). Here, we used the PSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nolte et al., 2008</xref>), which mitigates volume conduction and shared reference issues. Summarized by channel, our results revealed a distinct pattern of directed connectivity across 3–20 Hz that was also seen in the ESZ replication dataset. We observed increased connectivity (higher absolute net PSIs) in SCZ for frequencies at 6–8 and 11–14 Hz. While increases in 6–8 Hz connectivity is partially congruent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Markovic et al., 2021</xref>), hyperconnectivity for sigma appears to be the opposite of previous findings of decreased sigma coherence in SCZ. It is important to note, however, that these findings do not necessarily contradict one another, but rather indicate that such decrease in coherence is mostly driven by a zero-lagged connectivity component, which would be highly influenced by volume conduction and attenuated in PSI estimates. When pairwise sigma magnitude squared coherence was explicitly tested in GRINS, we found no evidence of decreased connectivity. Our results of sigma hyperconnectivity in SCZ as indexed by net PSI was replicated in the ESZ cohort, suggesting its robustness.</p><p>We clarified that alterations in SO, spectral power, and connectivity represented largely independent phenomena from the sleep spindle deficit: a model based on multiple domains better classified disease status in an independent sample, compared to spindle density alone. Although still distant from diagnostic application in clinical settings, such results suggest that alterations in these aspects of sleep electrophysiology convey additional information on the neurobiological underpinnings of SCZ and may be helpful in stratifying patients with SCZ or distinguishing them from other neuropsychiatric conditions for which spindle density alterations have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farmer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ritter et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In addition to spindle deficits, we report novel EEG alterations in SCZ patients including intra-spindle frequency change (chirp), overlap between slow spindles and SO, and increase in PSI indicative of functional hyperconnectivity. While the neurobiology of these metrics is yet to be studied extensively, there are clues to the function of these EEG features. For example, TRN neurons gradually hyperpolarize and fire with fewer action potentials upon repeated bursting which may underlie the chirp during the ‘waning’ of spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barthó et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, chirp could reflect intrinsic biophysical properties of TRN and thalamocortical neurons during this phase. Similarly, a recent study suggested that spindles nested within SO play a causal role in learning and are important for offline processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Latchoumane et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting SCZ patients may be impaired during such reactivations of waking experience. The full relevance and functional implications of these findings in disease pathophysiology require further investigation, however.</p><p>With respect to the wake metrics, we broadly confirmed the previously reported ERP deficits in SCZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erickson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Freedman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thuné et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferrarelli and Tononi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atagun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bramon et al., 2004</xref>). Specifically, we observed impaired sensory gating (indexing deficits in filtering repetitive sensory stimuli), reduced MMN (reflecting abnormal automatic change detection process in auditory cortex), and decreased ASSR to 40 Hz auditory stimulation (associating with neural circuit abnormalities in this disorder) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erickson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Freedman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thuné et al., 2016</xref>). Leveraging the fact that our samples had both sleep and wake EEG recordings, we tested whether sleep spindle deficits and wake abnormalities were associated, as might be expected if they were to both depend on intact function of the same thalamocortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferrarelli and Tononi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pratt and Morris, 2015</xref>). In sleep, the TRN is crucial for spindle generation, whereas in wake, the TRN is dynamically involved in controlling thalamic sensory gain and in gating less important sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Halassa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wimmer et al., 2015</xref>). While very few direct reports link the TRN to the neurophysiological bases of auditory EEG potentials listed above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lakatos et al., 2020</xref>), there is a general agreement that efficient sensory processing inherently relies on precise coordination between thalamic nuclei and auditory cortex, and the TRN is a modulator between cortex and thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferrarelli and Tononi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernandez and Lüthi, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kimura et al., 2012</xref>). Only a few studies to date have investigated the links between wake and sleep cortical alterations in SCZ. One recent study demonstrated that increased functional connectivity as measured by MRI between thalamus and somatosensory and motor cortex in wake inversely correlated with spindle density, suggesting deficient TRN inhibition as a plausible common mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baran et al., 2019</xref>). However, our findings did not point to strong linkages between individual differences in sleep metrics and wake auditory processing abnormalities. Furthermore, in response to a recently reported link between spindle deficits and auditory hallucinations in SCZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sun et al., 2021</xref>), we found that reduction in spindle density was not restricted to the subset of patients with auditory hallucinations. In summary, our present results suggest that the sleep EEG carries non-redundant information on thalamocortical circuits beyond the established ERP paradigms.</p><p>Our study is not without limitations. Although previous studies reported that spindle differences between SCZ and CTR were observed similarly during the first and the second naps/nights of recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mylonas et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mylonas et al., 2020b</xref>), we could not directly test the first-night effect due to the absence of the adaptation night in our sample. We also could not directly assess the likelihood and impact of circadian disruption in SCZ, as our cohort was composed of inpatients whose sleep-wake patterns were constrained by hospital-imposed schedules. In our sample, almost all patients with SCZ were prescribed antipsychotic or adjunctive medication and some used more than one type of antipsychotic. While there is evidence of spindle deficits in unmedicated patients – and we also controlled for medication dosage – we cannot completely exclude medication effects in observed EEG alterations. Another potential caveat relates to difficulties interpreting functional connectivity at a sensor level. Some issues, for example, volume conduction, were partially mitigated by the choice of connectivity metric, but accurate source reconstruction may facilitate interpretations with respect to precise cortical topography.</p><p>In summary, this work reinforces previous findings of a spindle deficit as a highly reproducible trait associated with SCZ pathophysiology across ethnically/racially distinct samples, as well as pointing to notable distinctions between SS and FS in patients. Although the spindle density deficit was the most marked, our analyses point to multiple domains of abnormalities of the NREM sleep and wake EEG that were independently associated with SCZ, potentially indexing different facets of thalamic and cortical dysfunction. Elucidating how these neurophysiological abnormalities co-exist and interact, and which aspects of SCZ pathophysiology they reflect is critical for a better understanding of SCZ etiology and heterogeneity. Analyzing these measures in genetically informative designs may reveal associations with disease risk, and lead to knowledge of the underlying molecular and neural circuits to reveal novel therapeutic targets to mitigate relevant abnormalities. Future research, including longitudinal characterization across the natural history of SCZ, will be needed to dissect which of these EEG features index different behavioral and cognitive manifestations of SCZ, in order to stratify patient populations, and understand their temporal development. Our findings support that sleep-based biomarkers have the potential to provide powerful phenotyping in animal, genetic, and clinical research aimed at developing novel therapeutic and preventive strategies for SCZ.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Participant cohort</title><p>The GRINS (Global Research Initiative of Neurophysiology on Schizophrenia) study is a part of the research collaboration between the Broad Institute/Harvard Medical School (USA) and Wuxi Mental Health Center (China).

datasets</title><p>For the sleep EEG replication analyses, we compiled an independent dataset by pooling data from three previously reported studies: (1) 26 cases and 29 controls from the ‘ESZ’ dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mylonas et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baran et al., 2019</xref>), (2) 20 cases and 17 controls from the ‘Lunesta’ dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wamsley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Demanuele et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wamsley et al., 2013</xref>), and (3) 11 cases and 13 controls from the ‘GCRC’ dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Manoach et al., 2010</xref>). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> for demographic details.</p><p>Only the ESZ dataset contained high-density EEG with 54 channels in common with GRINS; most Lunesta participants had C3, C4, F3, F4, O1, O2, and Pz channels; the GCRC dataset only had C3, C4, O1, and O2. All channels were re-referenced to linked mastoids except the GCRC dataset where only contralateral mastoid referenced data was available.</p><p>Key spectral and spindle replication analyses were based on the limited montage available for all individuals; replication analyses requiring hdEEG (e.g. connectivity and PSC analyses) were necessarily restricted to the ESZ sample. Further, as we identified uncertainties over the EEG signal polarity in GCRC dataset, this dataset was not included in polarity-dependent SO and coupling replication analyses.</p><p>The three datasets have previously reported spindle deficits in patients (see the references above). However, these three datasets have not previously been combined, and the comprehensive set of microarchitecture measures employed here has not been consistently applied across all studies. For example, (1) spectral power analysis was limited to band-specific analyses in GRRC and Lunesta, (2) only FS were measured, (3) spindle chirp was not assessed, and (4) and only one low-density study considered connectivity (measured as coherence). Nonetheless, given the extant literature, we present these replication samples not to address the general hypothesis of whether or not there is altered spindle activity in SCZ – as that would be circular – but rather to provide a methodologically integrated analysis of the specific sleep EEG metrics tested in GRINS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>Behavioral and clinical data collection</title><p>All included participants completed three visits: one visit (1) to determine the eligibility, (2) the clinical assessment and recording demographic and other medical information, and (3) an overnight EEG recording visit, comprising an ERP session in the evening, followed by the sleep EEG.</p><p>Diagnoses of SCZ were confirmed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhou et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Phillips et al., 2009</xref>). Control subjects were not diagnosed with any major mental disorder and screened by a psychiatrist. General medical and clinical information collection were conducted by a full-time researcher, while PANSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">He, 1999</xref>) and SCID were carried out by trained psychiatrists in the Wuxi Mental Health Center within a week from the date of the sleep EEG recording. Intra-class correlation coefficients for PANSS ranged from 0.86 to 0.94, demonstrating excellent inter-rater reliability.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>EEG data acquisition</title><p>Participants were introduced to the EEG recording process and environment in advance, including the sleep ward where recordings occurred, the electrode cap and conductive paste, to acclimate them to the novel setting and procedures. All participants were asked to take a bath the night before the scheduled recording and wash their hair. EEG recordings were performed in a room at the sleep medicine center . EEG was recorded continuously from a customized 64-channel EasyCap using the BrainAmp Standard recorder (Brain Products GmbH, Germany) at the sampling rate of 500 Hz. The left clavicle electrode served as ground and FPz as the recording reference. The vertical electrooculogram recording electrode was placed at the lower orbit of the left eye, and the horizontal electrooculogram recording electrodes were placed 1 cm from the outer corner of both eyes. Electrode impedances were kept below 10 kOhm. Overnight sleep recordings were monitored by a researcher in an adjacent room; recordings were typically stopped after the participant was fully awake the next morning. While all subjects had the same sleep opportunity, in a minority of cases recordings were truncated prior to final wake, for logistical reasons dictated by the hospital schedule for the sleep ward (16 SCZ patients and 20 CTR, p = 0.049 for the group difference in rate of truncated studies). This occurred only in the final portion of the recording, meaning that participants with truncated recordings in fact tended to have slightly longer TSTs (p = 0.002). Truncation status was not associated with the NREM microarchitecture features which were shown to be associated with SCZ in this study (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"><title>Wake ERP paradigms</title><p>Wake EEG recording included three auditory ERP paradigms: dual-click paradigm for the P50 sensory gating, 40 Hz auditory click stimulation for the ASSR, and passive oddball paradigm for the MMN, with a 10 min break after each task.</p><p>The sensory gating paradigm followed established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hall et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hall et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, sensory gating ERP was elicited using the dual-click paradigm (S1 and S2 clicks); 160 paired-identical click stimuli (5 ms duration; 2 ms rise/fall period; 500 ms inter-click interval; 10 s inter-trial interval) were presented in four blocks (40 paired-click stimuli/block). Each block was separated by a 1 min break.</p><p>The ASSR paradigm followed our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, an ASSR of gamma oscillation was elicited by a 40 Hz click stimulation paradigm (150 trains of 1 ms white noise clicks, 500 ms duration, 1100 ms stimulus onset asynchrony, 40 Hz stimulation rate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Spencer et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Third, the MMN paradigm followed our established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Higgins et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, a passive auditory oddball (in response to duration deviants) paradigm was employed. A total of 1200 stimuli consisted of 85% standard tones (1000 Hz, 100 ms) and 15% deviant tones (1000 Hz, 150 ms) with an inter-stimulus interval of 200 ms, and stimulus-onset-asynchrony 300 ms after standards and 350 ms after deviants. Stimuli were presented using the Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems, NBS) and foam insert earphones. During this task, participants were instructed to watch a peaceful silent cartoon video clip.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sleep EEG analysis</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Staging and pre-processing</title><p>All steps of sleep EEG data processing were performed using Luna, v0.25.5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/luna/">http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/luna/</ext-link>), an open-source package developed by us (SMP). EEG channels were re-referenced to linked mastoids, downsampled to 200 Hz and bandpass filtered between 0.3 and 35 Hz. Sleep stages were assigned (30 s epochs) through manual staging performed by a certified polysomnographic technician using standard AASM criteria, based on C4-M1, F4-M1, O2-M1, all EOG, and EMG channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berry, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Separately for each sleep stage, an automatic procedure to detect outlier epochs was employed to remove epochs likely containing artifacts. First, we identified channels with gross and persistent artifact, which were dropped and subsequently interpolated, using spherical spline interpolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Perrin et al., 1989</xref>). Specifically, a channel was flagged as bad if over 30% of its epochs were more than 2 SD from the mean of all channels, for any of the three Hjorth parameters, activity, mobility, and complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hjorth, 1970</xref>), that is, involving comparison within epoch across channels.</p><p>Second, we identified outlier epochs compared to all other epochs for all EEG channels, using the same Hjorth criteria but with a more stringent 4 SD threshold; further, all epochs with maximum amplitudes above 500 μV, or with flat or clipped signals for more than 10% of the epoch, were also marked as outliers and interpolated. Neither percentage of interpolated epochs nor the total number of interpolated channels differed significantly between the groups (p = 0.35 and p = 0.19, respectively).</p><p>Finally, separately for each channel, we flagged outlier epochs using a 4 SD threshold for the same set of Hjorth parameters (i.e. within-channel and within-epoch comparisons). Any epoch flagged at this stage for at least one channel was dropped from analysis for all channels, such that the final analytic dataset comprised the same set of epochs for all channels. This last step was repeated once more to ensure that there were no gross outlier epochs left.</p><p>Overall, this procedure removed an average of 7.4% epochs per individual in SCZ group and 8.5% epochs in CTR group. Although the proportion of removed epochs differed between diagnostic groups (p = 0.01), the total number of N2 epochs used in the final analyses was similar between groups (353±143 [21–758] epochs in SCZ and 374±89 [206–633] epochs in CTR, p-value = 0.16). Cleaned data were visually inspected and four subjects (all SCZ) were excluded due to persistent and severe line noise artifacts across most of channels for most of the night.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Spindle detection</title><p>Given prior evidence for distinct topographies, functional specificity, and SO coupling properties of ‘FS’ and ‘SS’ spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Purcell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cox et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mölle et al., 2011</xref>), spindles were detected via a wavelet method as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Purcell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Djonlagic et al., 2021</xref>) using center frequencies of 11 and 15 Hz corresponding to SS and FS, respectively. These center frequencies were chosen to minimize the overlap between the detected SS and FS and maximize their differences in topography (frontal versus central) and coupling with SOs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Specifically, based on temporally smoothed (window duration = 0.1 s) wavelet coefficients (from a complex Morlet wavelet transform), putative spindles were identified as intervals exceeding (1) 4.5 times the mean for at least 300 ms and also (2) 2 times the mean for at least 500 ms. Intervals over 3 s were rejected; consecutive intervals within 500 ms were merged (unless the resulting spindle was greater than 3 s).</p><p>Finally, putative spindles were discarded if the relative increase in non-spindle bands activity (delta, theta, and beta) was greater than the relative increase in spindle frequency activity (i.e. relative to all N2 sleep), thereby ensuring putative spindles preferentially reflect sigma-band activity, and not general increases in signal amplitude.</p><p>For spindles that passed QC, we computed spindle density (count per minute), amplitude, ISA (sum of the normalized wavelet coefficients), duration, observed frequency, and chirp (intra-spindle frequency change). Chirp was based on the distribution of intervals of zero-crossings, computing the difference in the implied frequency between the first versus the second half of the spindle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>SO detection</title><p>The EEG data were bandpass filtered between 0.3 and 4 Hz and zero-crossings of the resultant time-series were identified. Putative SOs were detected if the following temporal criteria were satisfied: (1) a consecutive zero-crossing leading to negative peak was between 0.3 and 1.5 s long; (2) a zero-crossing leading to positive peak were not longer than 1 s.</p><p>We employed two parallel approaches to amplitude filtering, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Djonlagic et al., 2021</xref>. Using an absolute threshold, only SOs with amplitude of the negative peak larger than –40 µV and amplitude between the positive and negative peak larger than 75 µV were identified as the final set of SOs. Using an adaptive/relative threshold (our default), only SOs with negative peak and peak-to-peak amplitudes greater than twice the mean (for that individual/channel) were selected.</p><p>Density of SO (count per minute) as well as the mean amplitude of the negative peak, peak-to-peak amplitude, duration, and the upward slope of negative peak were computed for each channel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>SO/spindle temporal coupling</title><p>We identified SS and FS that overlapped with a detected SO (in the same channel); the proportion of spindles that overlapped an SO was recorded as one gross metric of SO/spindle coupling (‘overlap’). To more precisely quantify the temporal coupling of spindle, we estimated the instantaneous phase of the SO based on a filter-Hilbert method (bandpass filtering between 0.5 and 4 Hz), and recorded the SO phase at the spindle peak (the point of maximal peak-to-peak amplitude). For each channel, we computed the (circular) mean SO phase at spindle peak; further, to assess the consistency of coupling, we computed the inter-trial phase clustering metric (the ‘magnitude’ metric). As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Djonlagic et al., 2021</xref>), we randomly shuffled (10,000 times) the location of spindle peaks to obtain the null distribution of the overlap and magnitude metrics, in a manner that preserved the overall number of spindles, SO and (for the magnitude metric), also the gross overlap between SO and spindles. In this way, we controlled for the differences in coupling which could arise from group differences in spindle and SO density. The final metrics were the Z-scores for overlap and magnitude coupling metrics, that is, normalizing the observed statistic by the mean and SD observed under the null.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Spindle instantaneous frequency estimation and SO/spindle phase/frequency modulation</title><p>We used a filter-Hilbert method (bandpass filtering ±2 Hz around the mean observed spindle frequency for that individual/channel) to provide an estimate the instantaneous spindle frequency for every sample point. Using this, we summarized the frequencies for each spindle quintile, averaging over all spindles for that individual/channel and target spindle frequency. We additionally averaged spindle frequency with respect to SO phase (in eighteen 20-degree bins). Finally, we averaged frequencies jointly by spindle quintile (‘progression’) and SO phase bin.</p><p>To quantify the extent to which spindle frequency varied as a function of SO phase for a particular individual/channel and spindle target frequency, we estimated the circular-linear correlation between SO phase and average frequency (based on the same 18 SO phase bins).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-6"><title>Spectral power and functional connectivity</title><p>Spectral power was estimated for the frequency range between 0.5 and 20 Hz using Welch’s method. For each 30 s epoch, power spectra were estimated by applying the fast Fourier transform within 4 s segments (0.25 Hz spectral resolution) windowing with a Tukey (50%) taper; segments overlapped by 50%, and then averaging power across all segments per epoch. Subsequently, epoch-wise power was then averaged across all epochs.</p><p>To evaluate connectivity between channels, we used the PSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nolte et al., 2008</xref>), which is based on the imaginary part of coherence to minimize spurious connectivity due to volume conduction. The PSI is based on how the phase delay between two signals changes as a function of frequency, and is a directional metric that can be interpreted as indicating the ‘flow of information’, whereby a positive PSI value for channel pair (A, B) is consistent with A temporally preceding B, whereas a negative value implies that A lags B. We estimated the PSI for all channel pairs for 10 min (20 epochs) of N2 sleep, randomly selected for each subject. For each epoch, the PSI was estimated from 3 to 20 Hz in 1 Hz intervals, using a window of 5 Hz (e.g. slope of phase difference between two signals for 3 Hz will be estimated over a frequency range from 0.5 to 5.5 Hz). The PSI was calculated for 4 s segments, using a 2 s interval with 50% overlap. For each epoch, the PSI values were normalized based on the SD of the PSI as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nolte et al., 2008</xref>. Final PSI values were then obtained by averaging the normalized values over all 30 s epochs.</p><p>As well as pairwise metrics, we also computed the net PSI for each channel, based on the sum of pairwise PSI values involving that channel, to indicate whether a single channel is, on balance, a ‘sender’ versus ‘recipient’ of information from other channels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-7"><title>Dimension reduction (PSC analysis)</title><p>Many sleep EEG metrics are estimated not just for 57 channels but also across a broad range of frequencies: for example, PSD was estimated for 79 bins (0.5–20 Hz in 0.25 Hz bins) yielding a total of 4503 highly inter-correlated metrics. To summarize patterns of individual differences across such sets of metrics, we employed dimension reduction using SVD/principal components analysis (PCA). We have referred to this approach in this context as PSCs analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Djonlagic et al., 2021</xref>). For a feature matrix <bold>A</bold> (rows corresponding to <italic>N</italic> individuals, columns to the <italic>M</italic> features), the SVD is defined as <bold>A</bold> = <bold>U∑V<sup>T</sup></bold>, where <bold>∑</bold> is a diagonal matrix. Here, columns of <bold>U</bold> (<italic>N</italic> × <italic>M</italic>, left singular vectors) contain the set of orthogonal component scores; the diagonal elements of <bold>∑</bold> (<italic>M</italic> singular values) indicate the variance accounted by each component; the <bold>V</bold> matrix (<italic>M</italic> × <italic>M</italic>, right singular vectors) map the components to the individual features (columns of <bold>A</bold>), thereby indicating the topographical and frequency specificity of each component. In practice, select a subset <italic>K</italic> &lt;&lt; <italic>M</italic> components. Specifically, we selected components which explained at least 1% of total variance (11 principal components [PCs] in spectral power and 22 for net PSI analyses): for these components, the corresponding column of <bold>U</bold> constituted the new metric for the <italic>N</italic> individuals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>ERP analysis</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Sensory gating metrics</title><p>Signal processing was performed off-line using BrainVision Analyzer 2.2 (Brain Products, Germany) software and blind to group membership. Continuous EEG from each channel was segmented (−100 to 400 ms), creating 320 sweeps and a 1 Hz high-pass filter (24 dB/oct) was applied. Segments were then baseline-corrected using the pre-stimulus interval. An automatic artifact rejection procedure identified and rejected any sweeps 50 µV between 0 and 75 ms post-stimulus (to capture blinks and other slow-wave activity). Artifact-free sweeps were averaged for each of the five blocks for S1 and S2 separately. Average waveforms were then digitally filtered using a 10 Hz high-pass filter (24 dB/oct) with zero phase shift, and a 7-point moving average was applied twice (smoothing). At each site, the S1 response was identified as the most prominent peak in the 40–85 ms post-stimulus window. The preceding negative trough was used to calculate the S1 amplitude. For the S2 response, the positive peak with latency closest to that of the S1 peak was selected. The S2 amplitude was determined in the same way as the S1 amplitude. P50 suppression was calculated as the ratio (S2/S1) × 100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hall et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hall et al., 2011</xref>). A higher ratio reflects more impairment in sensory gating.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>ASSR metrics</title><p>Signal processing was performed off-line using Brain Vision Analyzer software and blind to group membership. EEG data were downsampled to 256 Hz, re-referenced off-line to the linked mastoids, and filtered between 0.1 and 50 Hz. Single-trial segments were extracted (from –500800 ms), baseline-corrected relative to the 500 ms pre-stimulus interval, eye-blink-corrected using Analyzer’s default setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gratton et al., 1983</xref>) and artifact rejected if activity exceeding &gt;100 μV. Gamma phase locking (γPL) and evoked power (γEP) at each site were calculated on wavelet coefficients obtained from Morlet wavelet transformation of the segmented data (representing the 1–50 Hz frequency range, with a total number of 50 frequency layers using a Morlet parameter of 10). γPL quantifies consistency of oscillatory phase across individual trials, ranging from 0 (purely non-phase-locked activity) to 1 (fully phase-locked activity). Phase locking and evoked power were computed by averaging across the 36 add symbol 46 Hz wavelet frequency layers at 20–520 ms window.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>MMN metrics</title><p>Signal processing was performed off-line using Brain Vision Analyzer software. EEG data were downsampled to 256 Hz, re-referenced off-line to the linked mastoids, filtered with high cutoff at 20 Hz, segmented by stimulus marker from –100 to 400 ms. Segments were baseline-corrected using –100 to 0 ms pre-stimulus period and eye-blink-corrected using established method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gratton et al., 1983</xref>). Artifact rejection for individual channels was performed and a given segment was rejected if the voltage gradient exceeded 50 μV/ms, amplitude was ±100 μV, or the signal was flat (&lt;0.5 μV for &gt;100 ms).

Outlier EEG metric values (&gt;3 SD from the mean) were removed prior to analysis.</p><p>To control for the multiplicity of tests across EEG channels, we employed a permutation-based approach to estimate adjusted, empirical significance values. Specifically, for each metric we generated a null distribution of asymptotic p-values by randomly permuting subjects’ group (age and sex was fixed with an individual) and fitting the above model on the null data. For each of 3000 null replicates generated, we recorded the minimum null p-value (for the EEG metric) across all channels; adjusted empirical p-values were, for channel <italic>C</italic>, calculated as (<italic>R<sub>C</sub></italic> + 1)/(3000 + 1), where <italic>R<sub>C</sub></italic> was the number minimum null p-values that were lower than the original observed p-value for that channel.</p><p>All replication results were based on nominal, uncorrected asymptotic p-value (note that most replication comparisons involved only four EEG channels).

We generated PCs based on three groups of measures: (1) spectral power metrics across channels and frequency bins (based on 4503 metrics in total), (2) net PSI connectivity metrics across channels and frequency bins (based on 1026 metrics), (3) spindle parameters, based on density, amplitude, duration, ISA, and chirp across channels, for both FS and SS (570 metrics in total), and (4) SO parameters including density, duration, and slope (171 metrics in total). We did not include ERP metrics due to the absence of these data in the independent sample. Coupling parameters were not included because they expressed less extensive alterations compared to spindles and SO characteristics.</p><p>PCs were obtained by applying SVD separately to the three matrices of features described above (first mean-centering columns). From each analysis, PCs were selected based on the following criteria: (1) &gt;1% total variance explained, (2) exhibiting a significant group difference (in GRINS) with a nominal p &lt; 0.01. Overall, of the 54 components that accounted for &gt;1% of the variance, 12 were significantly associated with SCZ (when less than one expected by chance). Of the 12 PCs, four were derived from spindle parameters; three from SO parameters; three from spectral power, and two from net PSI/connectivity.</p><p>Prior to fitting the logistic model, we regressed the effects of age and sex from each PC. Based on the logit-scale predicted values from the GRINS model, we derived the posterior probability of being SCZ versus CTR for each individual in GRINS. To quantify model performance in terms of case/control discrimination, we estimated the area under the ROC curve (AUC), using the ‘rms’ R package to correct for overfitting via a bootstrapping approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Efron and Tibshirani, 1994</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether this model was broadly transferable to other populations, we applied the GRINS-derived model to generate posterior probabilities for the ESZ data (26 cases, 29 controls). This analysis could not include Lunesta and GCRC replication samples, as only ESZ had hdEEG comparable to GRINS.</p><p>To ensure the correspondence of PCs in GRINS and ESZ datasets, we used only the subset of 54 EEG channels that were common to both studies for this analysis. Further, we projected the ESZ features (spectral power, spindle and SO parameters, and net PSI metrics) into the twelve GRINS-derived components. Specifically, if the GRINS feature matrix <bold>A</bold> is decomposed by SVD as <bold>A</bold> = <bold>U∑V<sup>T</sup></bold>, where the singular vectors (i.e. components) are the columns of <bold>U</bold>, then for ESZ feature matrix <bold>B</bold>, singular vectors can be calculated using <bold>∑</bold> and <bold>V<sup>T</sup></bold> from the GRINS analysis, namely <bold>U<sub>B</sub></bold> = BV<sup>T</sup><bold>∑<sup>-1</sup></bold>. As above, we regressed out any effects of age and sex in the projected PCs. Finally, using the original GRINS model, we estimated the predicted case probabilities for each ESZ individual, given these 12 projected PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data acquisition, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data acquisition, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data acquisition, Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data acquisition, Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data acquisition, Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data acquisition, Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Data curation, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Data acquisition, Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Study design, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con20"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con21"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con22"><p>Conceptualization, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con23"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Project administration, Study design, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con24"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Project administration, Study design, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con25"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Methodology, Study design, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con26"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Study design, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con27"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Resources, Study design, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: All participants took part voluntarily and gave their informed consent.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Büchel as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) This study replicates previous findings regarding the association between sleep rhythm and schizophrenia in a large cohort of individuals. As the findings are not novel, the study must present solid and rigorous analyses to warrant publication. One critical aspect of the study is that sleep and circadian rhythms are often profoundly disrupted in patients with schizophrenia. The study thus needs to address the contribution of time of day, sleep homeostasis and light, among other external factors. Sleep-wake history and circadian rhythms were not taken into account neither, despite overwhelming evidence that these factors affect spindle dynamics in very profound ways.</p><p>2) Several methodological issues were raised. The range of frequencies that are analyzed should be broadened and not limited to the two ends (slow/fast) of the spectrum. Data should be analyzed in a standard way, especially for the topomaps: the study should show differences between the groups across electrodes for a frequency band, not just a single frequency bin.</p><p>3) The number of patients should be clarified, and the exclusion of subjects in some analyses should be always justified.</p><p>4) The manuscript should be somehow simplified, especially the supplementary information. Many supplementary figures do not add helpful information.</p><p>5) All sleep analyses were performed on N2 epochs. Analyzing N2/N3 combined and/or N2 and N3 separately would likely provide a better characterization of these sleep parameters. Furthermore, because the schizophrenia group had less stage 2 sleep than the control group, the same number of epochs should be used in the analyses of both groups.</p><p>6) Some of the limitations should be clearly stated, for example that no adaption night was included in the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In addition to the concerns raised in the public review (see weaknesses), a couple of additional points:</p><p>The authors should clarify why they did not perform an initial analysis targeting the entire spindle range, but instead decided to focus on slow spindles and fast spindles. Indeed, in their previous sleep study (Purcell et al., 2017, ref. 14) the same wavelet-based algorithm employed was used to initially target the whole spindle activity range and was centered at 13.5 Hz. Also, the choice of centering the analysis for slow spindles at 11 Hz and for fast spindles at 15 Hz is somewhat surprising, given that these frequency bins are usually considered the lowest and highest values respectively of the spindle activity. Furthermore, it appears that all sleep analyses were performed on N2 epochs. However, analyzing N2/N3 combined and/or N2 and N3 separately would likely provide a better characterization of these sleep parameters.</p><p>In previous work, the authors emphasize the role of sleep spindles in relation to cognitive function. It is therefore unclear why in the present study they did not examine the association of sleep metrics with cognitive parameters.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Why were 4 subjects removed for the primary analytic sample (page 7)?</p><p>2) The sample size in the abstract is a bit misleading. Please specific the number of schizophrenia participants and controls instead of writing 130 schizophrenia patients and control.</p><p>3) Figure 1: The authors only show topomaps at 3.25 Hz and 13.25 Hz in the topomaps because these frequencies show the maximal difference between the groups, but a difference at single frequency bin is not biologically meaningful and it is misleading. Please stick to the convention of showing differences between the groups across electrodes (topomap) for a frequency band. Same applies for the scatterplots.</p><p>4) The authors write: With respect to SO phase, both SS and FS tended to occur earlier in SCZ, albeit this effect was only observed at a few parietal channels (P5 and P7 for SS, max e.s.=-1.07 SD and P4, P6 for FS, max e.s.=-0.65 SD).&quot; Only one channel is highlighted in Figure 3 for SS and one for FS. I would not draw conclusions based on the results of one channel.</p><p>5) What does chirp tell us about the neurobiology of the disorder? An additional way to characterize spindles doesn't necessarily tell us much unless the cellular/molecular mechanisms have been clarified.</p><p>6) For the PSI why are data presented frequency by frequency instead of averaging into bands? Again, showing the statistics for the most significant single frequency bin is misleading. I'm unsure how to read Figure 5 since from my understanding PSI is a measure between two channels but here each channel is shown with a single color. Perhaps I missed something here.</p><p>7) There are too many supplementary figures which aren't all helpful. For example suppl Figure 3 is not necessary. I can't find a reference for Supplementary Figure 1. Not sure what Supplementary Figure 2 is showing and how it relates to the two groups. Please consider carefully if all these figures are necessary</p><p>8) In the abstract the authors write &quot;The main sleep findings were replicated in a demographically distinct sample, and a joint model, based on multiple NREM components, predicted disease status in the replication cohort.&quot; Prediction is a strong word given that the AUC is 0.64.</p><p>9) Because the schizophrenia group had less stage 2 sleep than the control group, the same number of epochs should be used in the analyses of both groups. Similarly, significantly more artifacts were removed from the Schizophrenia group which may introduce bias and reflect a problem with the automatic artifact removal. Any ideas why more artifacts were removed from the schizophrenia group?</p><p>10) The differential referencing of the GCRC data set will have a large impact on the data and you should consider excluding this data set if the goal is to directly compare these previously published data sets.</p><p>11) No adaptation night was included. This should be incorporated into the discussion as a limitation of the study.</p><p>12) What was the interval between the PANSS and the sleep EEG?</p><p>13) Was prior sleep controlled? The differences in slow oscillations could be due to differential sleep-wake history of patients versus controls.</p><p>14) The authors write that a minority of recordings ended prior during sleep. How many were these and did they differ between the two groups.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The two fundamental processes relevant for sleep regulation – sleep homeostasis and its circadian control were not considered in this study, which makes some of the central findings difficult to interpret.</p><p>For example, as well known slow wave activity is much greater in the early night as compared to morning hours. Yet, this highly significant dynamics was not taken into account. Conversely, the incidence of sleep spindles normally increases across the night, showing largely an opposite trends to slow-wave activity. These dynamics may meaningfully affect some of the metrics studied here, especially the coupling between slow oscillations and spindles. Some of the data presented in the paper are difficult to understand unless further information is provided on the dynamics of sleep oscillations across the night. At the very least I would recommend analysing separately the first and the last sleep cycle, but the authors may have other ways of addressing this important omission.</p><p>Further, as well known, patients with schizophrenia can manifest major circadian abnormalities in their mood and sleep behaviour. This is especially important given that the distribution of sleep stages and sleep oscillations, and specifically sleep spindles, are under a strong circadian control (as we know from forced desynchrony studies). Therefore, it seems essential to provide further information about circadian characteristics of sleep in the population studied, and the potential role of relevant factors, such as light levels, which are, surprisingly, never mentioned in this study. Please provide data on the levels of light the patients and controls were exposed to during the experiments. As I presume there is no data available on DLMO or body temperature, it is difficult to assess whether and to what extent the potential dysfunction of the circadian clock affects the results presented here. I would recommend providing more data on the time of sleep onset and morning awakening, relative to the light-dark cycle. Furthermore, it would be essential to provide further information on the season (winter, spring, summer, fall) when the data were collected.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76211.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) This study replicates previous findings regarding the association between sleep rhythm and schizophrenia in a large cohort of individuals.

One critical aspect of the study is that sleep and circadian rhythms are often profoundly disrupted in patients with schizophrenia. The study thus needs to address the contribution of time of day, sleep homeostasis and light, among other external factors. Sleep-wake history and circadian rhythms were not taken into account neither, despite overwhelming evidence that these factors affect spindle dynamics in very profound ways.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and hope that this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the NREM sleep EEG in schizophrenia, including less-studied metrics such as intra-spindle frequency change.</p><p>With regard to circadian rhythms, we would like to point out that our SCZ cohort was composed of hospital inpatients, whose circadian rhythms and sleep patterns were strongly influenced (and regularized) by hospital-imposed schedules. As such, this cohort is not ideally suited to address the influence of circadian disruption as observed in community-based settings: this has been noted as a limitation in the Discussion on p. 32.</p><p>On the other hand, this regularization can also be seen as a strength of our study, inasmuch as profiles of NREM micro-architecture in SCZ are less likely to reflect nonspecific effects of generally disrupted sleep or sleep schedules. To confirm this analytically, we conducted additional analyses using data collected prior to the EEG night: i) a sleep habits questionnaire, ii) a two-week sleep journal and iii) bedtime and wake-up time for the night before the EEG. Analyses across all three data types congruently indicated that SCZ patients tended to go to bed earlier than control participants (all p-values &lt; 10<sup>-10</sup>). Estimated total time in bed (TIB) was also longer in SCZ patients compared to CTR (all p-values &lt; 10<sup>-8</sup>). Importantly, these results matched the group differences we originally reported for the EEG night (earlier bedtime, p = 7x10<sup>-18</sup>; longer TIB, p = 1x10<sup>-10</sup>) suggesting that the EEG night was representative of the regular sleep patterns in our SCZ cohort, characterized by earlier bedtimes and longer sleep latencies, but otherwise exhibiting sleep and stage durations broadly comparable with the CTR group. We added this information on p. 5.</p><p>Earlier bedtime and earlier wake-up time (the latter is only significant based on the sleep journal and the night before EEG recording) indicated earlier chronotype in SCZ patients. Similar to our report, Martin et al., 2005 showed earlier bedtime and longer TIB in SCZ. However, a more recent study found high inter-subject variability in SCZ which suggested two subgroups of SCZ patients exist with either earlier or later bedtimes compared to controls (Wulff et al., 2012). As noted, given that our cohort is composed of inpatients whose sleep/wake timing were strongly determined by hospital schedules, this study was not designed to address their natural circadian rhythm.</p><p>Next, we directly investigated whether bedtime or TIB prior or during the EEG night were associated with sleep microarchitecture metrics altered in SCZ in channels with the largest effect size. Except the SO density at O1 which was positively associated with TIB of the night before in both groups (p=0.041 in CTR and p=0.042 in SCZ), none of the tested sleep microarchitecture parameters (i.e. slow and fast spindle density, amplitude, ISA, FS duration, and chirp; SO duration, and slope; slow spindle overlap with SOs, SO coupling angle at slow and fast spindle peaks) displayed significant associations with TIB or bedtime congruently in SCZ and CTR groups. Furthermore, despite the revealed significant association in SO density at O1 , adding TIB of the night before as covariate could not explain the observed SCZ/CTR group differences in SO rate (original p=5.5x10<sup>-5</sup> vs p= 0.004 controlling for TIB of the night before ).</p><p>To address concerns regarding the seasonal/light exposure effects, we used the R package ‘suncalc’ to estimate an exact time of sunrise on the day of the EEG, finding no significant difference between SCZ and CTR groups (p=0.48). Regarding artificial light exposure during the procedures prior to sleep, all participants followed an identical protocol in the same hospital sleeping ward precluding systematic differences that could impact sleep.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Several methodological issues were raised. The range of frequencies that are analyzed should be broadened and not limited to the two ends (slow/fast) of the spectrum. Data should be analyzed in a standard way, especially for the topomaps: the study should show differences between the groups across electrodes for a frequency band, not just a single frequency bin.</p></disp-quote><p>With regard to single frequency bin analyses, we would like to stress that our use of Welch's method significantly reduces the variance of spectral power estimates: power for each 30-second epoch is averaged over 14 overlapping 4-second windows (with a frequency resolution of 0.25 Hz per bin), and for a stage, power is again averaged over dozens or hundreds of epochs. As such, individually testing frequency bins across a full range, and using an approach to multiple testing that allows for highly correlated predictors (i.e. our use of permutation-based empirical significance estimates) is warranted.</p><p>Nonetheless, we agree that summarizing by classical frequency band is also a common approach to present findings in spectral power, and so we have included those analyses. Case/control differences in spectral power for classical frequency bands are now given in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1.</p><p>While bin-based and band-based results are congruent for σ band/range frequencies, our δ/theta (2-6 Hz) results are not well captured by classical band definitions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> clearly illustrates a physiological group difference in NREM power that does not respect the traditional (useful but ultimately arbitrary) convention of a precise and binary delineation of activity at 4 Hz. When effects do fall along classically-defined lines (e.g. σ), our bin-based analysis will also show this; when they do not (e.g. the 2-6 Hz result), a band-based approach runs the risk of false negatives. To avoid such misrepresentation, we kept the original way of reporting the power findings in the main text.</p><p>We would also like to further clarify that our analysis of spectral power was performed across all frequency bins from 0.5 to 25 Hz. We show raw data plots for the most significant metrics only, as it is not feasible to show plots for all metrics and all channels: as we employed rigorous multiple-test correction, this approach does not unduly capitalize on chance.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-76211-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Finally, we note that the principal spectral component (PSC) approach also provides a complementary mode of analysis that does not rely on individual frequency bins. However, unlike band-based approaches, PSC forms linear combinations across all frequency bins (and channels) in a data-driven manner (which also implicitly indexes other parameterizations of EEG power spectra not reflected by band-based analysis, e.g. of spectral intercept and slope, which typically map to the first and second components respectively).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The number of patients should be clarified, and the exclusion of subjects in some analyses should be always justified.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the number of patients and controls in the abstract. We also have stated on p. 5 the reason why four participants were excluded from sleep EEG analysis (due to persistent and severe line noise artifacts), and refer to a more detailed explanation in the Methods section. We have provided extended description of the exclusion criteria for wake ERP analysis on p. 42 in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The manuscript should be somehow simplified, especially the supplementary information. Many supplementary figures do not add helpful information.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed nonessential supplementary figures – original Sup. Figures 3, 6-9. We note that, in response to reviewer requests, other new supplementary figures have been included in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) All sleep analyses were performed on N2 epochs. Analyzing N2/N3 combined and/or N2 and N3 separately would likely provide a better characterization of these sleep parameters. Furthermore, because the schizophrenia group had less stage 2 sleep than the control group, the same number of epochs should be used in the analyses of both groups.</p></disp-quote><p>The duration of N2 stage was in fact not different between the groups. While there were marginally significant differences in N2 proportion in the whole sample (p=0.048), there were no significant group differences in N2 proportion in the analytic sample (i.e. after the exclusion of 4 studies due to noisy data) used for EEG analysis (p=0.14). This information is provided on p. 5 of the manuscript. In addition, the number of epochs used for the analyses of sleep microarchitecture also did not differ between SCZ and CTR (p=0.16). This is stated on p. 38 in the Methods section.</p><p>Our choice of performing all analyses using N2 epochs were motivated by our primary focus on spindle deficit in SCZ extensively reported for the N2 stage and that such effects were attenuated during N3 (Lai et al., 2022). As requested, however, we have now repeated the core analyses using N2 and N3 data combined. The results were broadly similar (except for SO density which was not significant after the inclusion of N3 data). We now mention this in the revised manuscript (p.10)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Some of the limitations should be clearly stated, for example that no adaption night was included in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this as a limitation on p. 32.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In addition to the concerns raised in the public review (see weaknesses), a couple of additional points:</p><p>The authors should clarify why they did not perform an initial analysis targeting the entire spindle range, but instead decided to focus on slow spindles and fast spindles.

However, analyzing N2/N3 combined and/or N2 and N3 separately would likely provide a better characterization of these sleep parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose target frequencies of 11 and 15 Hz to minimize the overlap between the detected spindles and maximize their differences in topography (frontal vs central) and coupling with SOs. We have stated it in the methods section (p.37) and added a supplementary figure that illustrates spindle properties for spindles detected using a range of target frequencies (10-16 Hz).</p><p>To further illustrate, the schematic plot shows amplitudes for the 11 Hz and 15 Hz wavelets, as well as a 13.5 Hz one (all with 7 cycles). As noted above, 11 and 15 Hz were selected to minimize overlap between &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; spindle definitions, but at the same time provide adequate coverage across the entire σ range. Practically, we have observed in this and other samples, that with a sufficiently broad wavelet (frequency domain), results from, e.g. F<sub>C</sub> = 14 Hz will be very similar to those with F<sub>C</sub> = 15 Hz.</p><p>Upon the reviewer’s request, we now also report group differences for spindles detected using a target frequency of 13.5 Hz (see the bottom row in Figure 2 —figure supplement 3). Those are broadly similar to the results we report for SS and FS (e.g. decreased density, amplitude), although (as expected) some alterations specific to SS or FS are diminished or not present when considering this center range (e.g. ISA, duration, chirp). Given the substantial body of evidence that points to heterogeneity in spindle activity that can be indexed by spindle frequency, we elected to present what we still feel are the more informative, two-class analyses as primary.</p><p>We now include a new Supplementary Figure to show the impact of different F<sub>C</sub> choices (from 10 to 16 Hz) on key metrics and results. The frequency-dependent patterns of, e.g. topography and SO coupling support our decision to focus on the two classes, although precise 'boundary' frequencies are likely overlapping.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In previous work, the authors emphasize the role of sleep spindles in relation to cognitive function. It is therefore unclear why in the present study they did not examine the association of sleep metrics with cognitive parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>We strongly agree that investigating links between cognition and sleep neurophysiology in SCZ is a fruitful direction. However, acknowledging other reviewer comments about the complexity and abundance of analyses (often performed in multiple samples) already present in this manuscript, we respectfully note that this is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Why were 4 subjects removed for the primary analytic sample (page 7)?</p></disp-quote><p>We removed 4 subjects due to persistent line noise artifacts. In the revised manuscript it is stated on p. 5 where we first mention it as well as in the Methods section on p. 38.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The sample size in the abstract is a bit misleading. Please specific the number of schizophrenia participants and controls instead of writing 130 schizophrenia patients and control.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed ‘In 130 participants’ to ‘In 72 schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and 58 controls’ in the abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1: The authors only show topomaps at 3.25 Hz and 13.25 Hz in the topomaps because these frequencies show the maximal difference between the groups, but a difference at single frequency bin is not biologically meaningful and it is misleading. Please stick to the convention of showing differences between the groups across electrodes (topomap) for a frequency band. Same applies for the scatterplots.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response (also provided to the similar comment in the Overall Summary).</p><p>With regard to single frequency bin analyses, we would like to stress that our use of Welch's method significantly reduces the variance of spectral power estimates: power for each 30-second epoch is averaged over 14 overlapping 4-second windows (with a frequency resolution of 0.25 Hz per bin), and for a stage, power is again averaged over dozens or hundreds of epochs. As such, individually testing frequency bins across a full range, and using an approach to multiple testing that allows for highly correlated predictors (i.e. our use of permutation-based empirical significance estimates) is warranted.</p><p>Nonetheless, we agree that summarizing by classical frequency band is also a common approach to present findings in spectral power, and so we have included those analyses. Case/control differences in spectral power for classical frequency bands are now given in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1.</p><p>While bin-based and band-based results are congruent for σ band/range frequencies, our δ/theta (2-6 Hz) results are not well captured by classical band definitions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> clearly illustrates a physiological group difference in NREM power that does not respect the traditional (useful but ultimately arbitrary) convention of a precise and binary delineation of activity at 4 Hz. When effects do fall along classically-defined lines (e.g. σ), our bin-based analysis will also show this; when they do not (e.g. the 2-6 Hz result), a band-based approach runs the risk of false negatives. To avoid such misrepresentation, we kept the original way of reporting the power findings in the main text.</p><p>We would also like to further clarify that our analysis of spectral power was performed across all frequency bins from 0.5 to 25 Hz. We show raw data plots for the most significant metrics only, as it is not feasible to show plots for all metrics and all channels: as we employed rigorous multiple-test correction, this approach does not unduly capitalize on chance.</p><p>Finally, we note that the principal spectral component (PSC) approach also provides a complementary mode of analysis that does not rely on individual frequency bins. However, unlike band-based approaches, PSC forms linear combinations across all frequency bins (and channels) in a data-driven manner (which also implicitly indexes other parameterizations of EEG power spectra not reflected by band-based analysis, e.g. of spectral intercept and slope, which typically map to the first and second components respectively).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors write: With respect to SO phase, both SS and FS tended to occur earlier in SCZ, albeit this effect was only observed at a few parietal channels (P5 and P7 for SS, max e.s.=-1.07 SD and P4, P6 for FS, max e.s.=-0.65 SD).&quot; Only one channel is highlighted in Figure 3 for SS and one for FS. I would not draw conclusions based on the results of one channel.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Figure 3 and it follows a similar representation of the data and results to other figures. Consistent with the rest of the manuscript, the &quot;raw data plots&quot; only highlight the exemplar association from a given analysis, to give the reader a concrete view of the underlying distributions within and between groups. All statistical analyses were corrected for multiple testing, and so showing an exemplar plot is no different from reporting the maximal effect sizes, etc, at those channels.</p><p>Although the original manuscript highlighted that (in contrast to most other results) only a few parietal channels were associated, we've made our interpretation clearer by adding the qualifying phrase (p 12):</p><p><bold>“</bold>With respect to SO phase, both SS and FS tended to occur earlier in SCZ, albeit this effect was only observed at a few parietal channels therefore precluding any strong conclusions (P5 and P7 for SS, max e.s.=-1.07 SD and P4, P6 for FS, max e.s.=-0.65 SD).<bold>”</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) What does chirp tell us about the neurobiology of the disorder? An additional way to characterize spindles doesn't necessarily tell us much unless the cellular/molecular mechanisms have been clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>Although spindle chirp is a relatively novel metric, it has been shown that such intra-spindle frequency deceleration is a basic property of both slow and fast spindles (Andrillon et al., 2011; Schönwald et al., 2011). While the neurobiology of chirp is yet to be studied extensively, there are some clues to the function of this spindle property. For example, TRN neurons gradually hyperpolarize and fire with fewer action potentials upon repeated bursting which may underlie the chirp during the “waning” of spindles (Barthó et al., 2014). Therefore, chirp could reflect intrinsic biophysical properties of TRN and thalamocortical neurons during this phase. Our findings of altered chirp in SCZ should motivate future studies to confirm and investigate the precise properties of neural mechanisms behind spindle chirp.</p><p>We have added this in the discussion on p 30.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) For the PSI why are data presented frequency by frequency instead of averaging into bands? Again, showing the statistics for the most significant single frequency bin is misleading. I'm unsure how to read Figure 5 since from my understanding PSI is a measure between two channels but here each channel is shown with a single color. Perhaps I missed something here.</p></disp-quote><p>PSI is based on the change (slope) in phase lag across a range of frequencies: it is necessarily not a 'single frequency bin' metric. We used a 5-Hz frequency window, reporting only the center frequency, e.g. a (net) PSI at 3 Hz will be estimated with respect to a spanning +/- 2.5 Hz window (i.e. 0.5 to 5.5 Hz). This is described in the Method section on p. 40.</p><p>Similar to other connectivity metrics, PSI is indeed a measure between two channels. For the purpose of dimensionality reduction, we computed a channel-wise net PSI as the sum of normalized PSIs over all pairs involving that channel (following the original description in Nolte et al., 2008). Higher absolute net PSI indicates that the channel is functionally connected to other channels, either leading (positive values) or lagging (negative values) other channels, on average. This is explained in the result section on p. 15. Net PSI group differences were effectively mirrored in pair-wise PSI, as shown in Figure 5 bottom row.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) There are too many supplementary figures which aren't all helpful.

However, we agree that it is important not to gloss over the statistical versus clinical implications of a term such as 'prediction'. We have therefore added the phrase &quot;…statistically predicted…&quot; to the abstract, and we include a note in the Discussion on p. 31 that makes clear that these measures do not, in their current form, necessarily have utility for clinical decision making:</p><p>“…a model based on multiple domains better classified disease status in an independent sample, compared to spindle density alone. Although still distant from diagnostic application in clinical settings, such results suggest that alterations in these aspects of sleep electrophysiology convey additional information on the neurobiological underpinnings of SCZ and may be helpful in stratifying patients with SCZ or distinguishing them from other neuropsychiatric conditions…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Because the schizophrenia group had less stage 2 sleep than the control group, the same number of epochs should be used in the analyses of both groups. Similarly, significantly more artifacts were removed from the Schizophrenia group which may introduce bias and reflect a problem with the automatic artifact removal. Any ideas why more artifacts were removed from the schizophrenia group?</p></disp-quote><p>There was no significant group difference (p=0.16) in epoch number for the primary analytic sample. There was a modest difference in the percentage of epochs removed during QC, with more epochs removed in controls compared to SCZ patients (this information is provided on p.36). The significance and the effect size of difference in percentage of removed epochs is much smaller with respect to the reported alterations in EEG microstructure (e.g. p=0.01, e.s.=-0.68 SD for removed epochs vs p=4×10<sup>-6</sup>, e.s.=-1.27 SD for FS density). In addition, when the percentage of removed epochs was added as a covariate to our model, we still observe the same group differences in SS and FS density.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The differential referencing of the GCRC data set will have a large impact on the data and you should consider excluding this data set if the goal is to directly compare these previously published data sets.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to polarity uncertainties, we did not use the GCRC sample for replication of any metrics related to SOs.

In our data, the core spectral and spindle metrics considered in the GCRC did not show substantive differences between these two mastoid-based referencing schemes. As a sensitivity analysis, we computed both sets of metrics for F3, F4, C3 and C4 (i.e. the channels present for GCRC dataset) for the same 20 N2 epochs in the main GRINS sample. For all spindle metrics and for all channels, the correlation coefficient between linked and contralateral mastoid-based estimates was above 0.99. Further, there were no significant mean differences (all p&gt;0.98). Similar results were observed for spectral power, with core results being near indistinguishable: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> shows power spectral for an exemplar control subject, for linked (red) and contralateral (black) mastoid references.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-76211-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Collectively, these sensitivity analyses support the inclusion of the GCRC dataset in the replication set (for spindle and spectral power metrics).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) No adaptation night was included.

To address the potential for confounding, we tested whether these parameters were (conditional on disease status) in fact associated with the SO metrics which varied between groups. We initially focused on the CTR group, who were not under hospital-imposed schedules and so showed greater variability in sleep-wake patterns, presumably reflecting differences in circadian rhythms to some degree. Overall, prior sleep metrics were unrelated to SO parameters, with the one exception of nominally (p&lt;0.01) significant associations at only two parietal channels, between TIB and SO density (positive direction of effect). Critically, SCZ/CTR group differences remained significant for these two channels after adding prior TIB as a covariate, however. Therefore, we did not find broad evidence to suggest that SO alterations were due to different sleep wake-histories.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-76211-sa2-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The authors write that a minority of recordings ended prior during sleep.

Due to the protocol in the sleep clinic, studies were truncated if the participant slept too late. The TST of truncated studies was in fact longer than for non-truncated studies (b=3.1, p=0.002). Whether or not a study was truncated was not a significant predictor of spindle density at any channel (all p &gt; 0.05). In addition, the number of channels with significant case/control differences in SS and FS remained the same when truncation status was added as a covariate. We now have added this information in the manuscript on p. 36.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The two fundamental processes relevant for sleep regulation – sleep homeostasis and its circadian control were not considered in this study, which makes some of the central findings difficult to interpret.</p><p>For example, as well known slow wave activity is much greater in the early night as compared to morning hours. Yet, this highly significant dynamics was not taken into account. Conversely, the incidence of sleep spindles normally increases across the night, showing largely an opposite trends to slow-wave activity. These dynamics may meaningfully affect some of the metrics studied here, especially the coupling between slow oscillations and spindles. Some of the data presented in the paper are difficult to understand unless further information is provided on the dynamics of sleep oscillations across the night. At the very least I would recommend analysing separately the first and the last sleep cycle, but the authors may have other ways of addressing this important omission.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s call for a focus on the dynamics of sleep metrics across the night. We conducted additional analyses to investigate the dynamics of slow/fast spindle density and the rate of SO across sleep cycles. First, we selected all subjects with at least three sleep cycles (60 SCZ and 56 CTR) and estimated slow and fast spindle density and SO density during N2 epochs for each cycle (all subjects had at least 17 epochs of N2 per cycle).</p><p>The first row of Figure 2 —figure supplement 1 illustrates how density (averaged across all channels) changed across three cycles, separately for SCZ and CTR groups. The topoplots below the graphs illustrate whether there was a significant association (p&lt;0.05) between cycle number and spindle or SO density, again separately for SCZ and CTR groups. The strongest cycle related effects were, as expected, observed for SO density, which decreased profoundly in both SCZ and CTR groups from the first cycle to the third. Spindle density showed more variable, but nominally significant, dynamics across NREM cycles. In controls, SS density decreased in frontal channels but increased in a few posterior channels, while in SCZ only temporal channels displayed a significant decrease in density overnight. Density of FS had a non-linear trajectory in both groups – decreasing initially followed by an increase. (Both these results are consistent with the trends we reported in Purcell et al., (2017) in population-based samples, Figure 3a.) SCZ/CTR group differences, when tested separately for each cycle, grew more widespread over time, although qualitatively similar effects were observed for all cycles. We have included this new analysis in the discussion on p. 8 and 10 with the Figure 2 —figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, as well known, patients with schizophrenia can manifest major circadian abnormalities in their mood and sleep behaviour. This is especially important given that the distribution of sleep stages and sleep oscillations, and specifically sleep spindles, are under a strong circadian control (as we know from forced desynchrony studies). Therefore, it seems essential to provide further information about circadian characteristics of sleep in the population studied, and the potential role of relevant factors, such as light levels, which are, surprisingly, never mentioned in this study. Please provide data on the levels of light the patients and controls were exposed to during the experiments. As I presume there is no data available on DLMO or body temperature, it is difficult to assess whether and to what extent the potential dysfunction of the circadian clock affects the results presented here. I would recommend providing more data on the time of sleep onset and morning awakening, relative to the light-dark cycle. Furthermore, it would be essential to provide further information on the season (winter, spring, summer, fall) when the data were collected.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response below (also provided to the similar comment in the Overall Summary).</p><p>With regard to circadian rhythms, we would like to point out that our SCZ cohort was composed of hospital inpatients, whose circadian rhythms and sleep patterns were strongly influenced (and regularized) by hospital-imposed schedules. As such, this cohort is not ideally suited to address the influence of circadian disruption as observed in community-based settings: this has been noted as a limitation in the Discussion on p. 32.</p><p>On the other hand, it can also be seen as one strength of our study, inasmuch as profiles of NREM micro-architecture in SCZ are unlikely to reflect only the nonspecific effects of generally disrupted sleep. To confirm this analytically, we conducted additional analyses using data collected prior to the EEG night: i) a sleep habits questionnaire, ii) a two-week sleep journal and iii) bedtime and wake times the night before the EEG. Analyses across all three data types congruently indicated that SCZ patients tended to go to bed earlier than control participants (all p-values &lt; 10<sup>-10</sup>). Estimated total time in bed (TIB) was also longer in SCZ patients compared to CTR (all p-values &lt; 10<sup>-8</sup>). Importantly, these results matched the group differences we originally reported for the EEG night (earlier bedtime, p = 7x10<sup>-18</sup>; longer TIB, p = 1x10<sup>-10</sup>) suggesting that the EEG night was representative of the regular sleep patterns in our SCZ cohort, characterized by earlier bed times and longer sleep latencies, but otherwise exhibiting sleep and stage durations broadly comparable with the CTR group. We added this information on p. 5.</p><p>Earlier bedtime and earlier wake time (the latter is only significant based on the sleep journal and the night before EEG recording) indicated earlier chronotype in SCZ patients. Similar to our report, Martin et al., 2005 showed earlier bedtime and longer TIB in SCZ. However, a more recent study found high inter-subject variability in SCZ which suggested two subgroups of SCZ patients exist with either earlier or later bedtimes compared to controls (Wulff et al., 2012). As noted, given that our cohort is composed of inpatients whose sleep/wake timing were strongly determined by hospital schedules, this study was not designed to address their natural circadian rhythm.</p><p>Next, we directly investigated whether bedtime or TIB prior or during the EEG night were associated with sleep microarchitecture metrics altered in SCZ in channels with the largest effect size. Except the SO density at O1 which was positively associated with TIB of the night before in both groups (p=0.041 in CTR and p=0.042 in SCZ), none of the tested sleep microarchitecture parameters (i.e. slow and fast spindle density, amplitude, ISA, FS duration, and chirp; SO duration, and slope; slow spindle overlap with SOs, SO coupling angle at slow and fast spindle peaks) displayed significant associations with TIB or bedtime congruently in SCZ and CTR groups. Furthermore, despite the revealed significant association in SO density at O1 , adding TIB of the night before as covariate could not explain the observed SCZ/CTR group differences in SO rate (original p=5.5x10<sup>-5</sup> vs p= 0.004 controlling for TIB of the night before ).</p><p>To address concerns regarding the seasonal/light exposure effects, we used the R package ‘suncalc’ to estimate an exact time of sunrise on the day of the EEG, finding no significant difference between SCZ and CTR groups (p=0.48). Regarding artificial light exposure during the procedures prior to sleep, all participants followed an identical protocol in the same hospital sleeping ward precluding systematic differences that could impact sleep.</p><p>References</p><p>Andrillon, T., Nir, Y., Staba, R.
