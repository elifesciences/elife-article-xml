Hosts cope with these pressures through systemic metabolic reprogramming, with varying effects on infection outcome. Metabolic alterations can be beneficial to hosts. For example, controlling circulating triglycerides and glucose minimizes tissue damage during sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weis et al., 2017</xref>); similarly, the switch from metabolic to immune transcriptional programs driven by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcription factor MEF2 during <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> infection promotes survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clark et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, some metabolic changes are detrimental to hosts, such as reduced insulin signaling in <italic>M. marinum</italic>-infected fruit flies, leading to wasting and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dionne et al., 2006</xref>). Metabolic changes have infection-specific outcomes; for example, infection-induced anorexia promotes survival in some infection contexts, but not others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayres and Schneider, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cumnock et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Metabolic changes can mediate these pathogen-specific outcomes through two distinct host protection strategies: by affecting either pathogen killing, a process called resistance, and/or the degree of collateral damage to the host per microbe, called disease tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayres and Schneider, 2009</xref>). Better understanding of how systemic infection-induced metabolic changes affect infection will inform therapeutics that intentionally alter metabolism to improve outcomes.</p><p>Over 400,000 people die annually from malaria, which is caused by mosquito-transmitted <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">WHO, 2018</xref>). The effect of host metabolism on malaria outcome is poorly understood. Metabolic changes such as lactic acidosis occur during malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miller et al., 2013</xref>) and a number of studies have reported metabolomics on <italic>in vivo Plasmodium</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelrazig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gardinassi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gardinassi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ghosh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ghosh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gupta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, these experiments have important limitations. Field studies often do not capture events in early infection that occur prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. Furthermore, important metabolic alterations may occur on the scale of days, which would require the collection of densely spaced samples often infeasible outside of lab experiments.</p><p>Malaria can lead to pathology including severe anemia and acute kidney injury (AKI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haldar and Mohandas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koopmans et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Trang et al., 1992</xref>). During blood stage infection, parasites infect, proliferate within, and lyse red blood cells (RBCs). This hemolysis releases hemoglobin and then heme into plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miller et al., 2013</xref>). Free heme can catalyze the formation of reactive oxygen species, damaging cells and tissues including the kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiabrando et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tracz et al., 2007</xref>). To mitigate heme toxicity, heme levels are regulated in plasma by heme-binding proteins and intracellularly by the heme degradation enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiabrando et al., 2014</xref>). During malaria, these mechanisms limit AKI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seixas et al., 2009</xref>). Clinically, the development of AKI during malaria correlates with high heme levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elphinstone et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Plewes et al., 2017</xref>). Together, these data suggest that heme toxicity is an important cause of tissue damage during malaria.</p><p>Heme metabolism produces agonists of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a nuclear receptor transcription factor. AHR ligands include the environmental toxin 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-<italic>p</italic>-dioxin (TCDD), the heme metabolites bilirubin and biliverdin, tryptophan metabolites including kynurenine, and indoles produced by the commensal microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rothhammer and Quintana, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stockinger et al., 2014</xref>). AHR functions in a ligand- and cell-specific manner in processes such as the regulation of T cell differentiation, homeostasis in barrier tissues, and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Esser and Rannug, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rothhammer and Quintana, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stockinger et al., 2014</xref>). In the absence of AHR, mice are more susceptible to a variety of infections and inflammatory insults, including <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> ANKA, a rodent malaria parasite that causes lethal cerebral malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bessede et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brant et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Meglio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moura-Alves et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanchez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shi et al., 2007</xref>). As AHR has diverse functions in many cell types, including immune cells, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes, its precise role in a given infection is often undefined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agbor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boule et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Metidji et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sekine et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Walisser et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use metabolomics to systemically characterize metabolism in C57BL/6 mice infected with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> (<italic>Pc</italic>). <italic>Pc</italic> is a rodent malarial parasite that recapitulates several key features of human malaria, including systemic inflammation and nonlethal anemia during acute infection, but does not cause severe complications like AKI in wild-type C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stephens et al., 2012</xref>). We find that AHR ligands are most abundant during acute sickness and demonstrate that AHR signaling is an essential host protection mechanism to regulate plasma heme, limit kidney damage, and promote survival during malaria. Moreover, we determine that these functions are dependent on AHR signaling in <italic>Tek</italic>-expressing radioresistant cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Malaria is characterized by stages with unique immune, metabolic, and tissue damage events</title><p>To identify connections between host metabolism and malaria pathogenesis, we first asked how well-known features of <italic>Pc</italic> malaria temporally relate to one another. We collected blood and plasma from <italic>Pc</italic>-infected C57BL/6 mice daily from 0 to 25 days post-infection (DPI) as well as mock-infected control mice on 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 19, and 25 DPI. We divided this time series into early, acute, and late infection based on parasitemia; while early infection was marked by undetectable parasitemia, parasites infected up to one-third of RBCs during the acute stage, with a small recrudescence in parasitemia occurring during late infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As parasitemia rose during acute infection, mice developed pathology including liver damage, indicated by plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and anemia, which was not ameliorated until late infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We next evaluated the immune response throughout infection by analyzing peripheral blood for pro-inflammatory cells and cytokines with known functions in malaria pathogenesis and pathology (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aitken et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angulo and Fresno, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dunst et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wolf et al., 2017</xref>). We observed that aspects of the immune response were activated prior to the onset of parasitemia and pathology. Interleukin 12 (IL-12p70) and interferon γ (IFNγ) increased in blood during early infection; acute infection was marked by elevated circulating natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and B cells, as well as increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Circulating γδ T cells increased in peripheral blood during late malaria, when they control recrudescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mamedov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This analysis revealed that each day of infection is marked by a unique combination of immune and pathological events, with the immune response both predating and outlasting the parasitemia and pathology of acute infection. Moreover, we established a timeline of many well-understood features of malaria to provide context to our metabolomic analysis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dynamic multi-omic profiling of <italic>Pc</italic>-infected mice reveals broad immune and metabolic changes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Parasitemia, (<bold>B</bold>) liver damage and anemia, and (<bold>C</bold>) selected peripheral blood immune cells and cytokines during 25 days of malaria.

Untargeted metabolomics identified 587 metabolites in plasma. We selected metabolites whose maximum or minimum scaled intensity was (a) at least twofold changed from baseline and (b) significantly different from uninfected samples (p&lt;0.05 by t-test with FDR correction). Of the 370 metabolites we identified as altered according to these stringent criteria, 66% increased in scaled intensity during <italic>Pc</italic> malaria, most during acute infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These metabolites illustrate the significant alterations to host energy metabolism that occur during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cumnock et al., 2018</xref>). For example, broad classes of lipids increased during acute infection, including acylcarnitines, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, and sphingomyelin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Metabolites associated with food, including stachydrine, a glycine betaine analog found in grains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Filipčev et al., 2018</xref>), decreased in scaled intensity during acute infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicative of reduced food intake. Ketone bodies also increased in scaled intensity during acute infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that mice entered ketosis, perhaps linked to decreases in food consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cumnock et al., 2018</xref>). Acute infection was also characterized by increased scaled intensity of inflammation-induced metabolites like arachidonate, followed by antiinflammatory metabolites like α-tocopherol, a form of vitamin E, in acute and late infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Several γ-glutamyl amino acids increased in scaled intensity during acute and late infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting flux through the γ-glutamyl cycle and potentially glutathione biogenesis. A subset of metabolites related to pyrimidine metabolism also increased in scaled intensity during acute and late infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Overall, this analysis showed that metabolic changes occurred primarily during acute infection, with relatively few changing only during early or late infection.</p><p>We were curious about the pathological and metabolic implications of hemolysis during malaria, which decreases circulating RBCs to just 10% of baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Hemolysis releases heme into plasma, where it is bound by heme scavengers, imported into cells in heme-metabolizing organs including liver and kidney, and metabolized into biliverdin by heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), then into bilirubin by biliverdin reductase (BVR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiabrando et al., 2014</xref>). Light exposure converts Z,Z-bilirubin into isomers including E,E-bilirubin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rehak et al., 2008</xref>). The scaled intensity of heme remained constant during most of acute infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) despite significant hemolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating activation of systemic heme metabolism. However, biliverdin, Z,Z-bilirubin, and E,E-bilirubin increased in scaled intensity during acute and late infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This is consistent with increased transcription of <italic>Hmox1</italic> and <italic>Blvra</italic>, the genes encoding HO-1 and BVR, in the liver during acute infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), as well as HO-1 activation during malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seixas et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, acute <italic>Pc</italic> malaria is characterized by stable plasma heme levels combined with an increase in heme breakdown products.</p><p>To determine how the metabolic changes we observed in our mouse malaria model compare to human malaria, we analyzed a metabolomics dataset describing the plasma of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected pediatric patients during acute cerebral malaria (CM) and 30 days post-treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gupta et al., 2017</xref>). While uncomplicated <italic>Pc</italic> malaria in mice and CM caused by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in humans differ substantially in lethality and pathogenesis, the two forms of malaria do share similar features, such as massive RBC destruction and systemic immune activation. We identified 77 metabolites with significantly altered intensity in both acute CM and <italic>Pc</italic> malaria, and observed similar magnitude and directionality of malaria-induced changes (p-value=1.572e-14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). For example, increased scaled intensity of ketone bodies (BHBA) was observed in CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), just as in <italic>Pc</italic> malaria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that both humans and mice enter ketosis during acute infection. Like in <italic>Pc</italic> malaria, acute CM was characterized by increased scaled intensity of inflammation-induced arachidonate, and a trend toward decreased intensity of food-derived stachydrine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). As in <italic>Pc</italic> malaria, the scaled intensity of biliverdin and both measured bilirubin isomers was elevated during acute CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), while heme scaled intensity was not different between the acute and convalescent timepoints in the clinical samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>These data identify distinct malaria stages with unique physiological, immune, and metabolic events.

Kidneys can also sustain injury when exposed to free heme; during malaria and other hemolytic conditions, lysed RBCs release heme into plasma, and mice with impaired heme metabolism can suffer from heme-mediated AKI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seixas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vinchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zarjou et al., 2013</xref>). Plasma heme levels in <italic>Ahr<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Ahr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were equivalent at baseline; however, at 8 DPI, plasma heme in <italic>Ahr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was elevated sevenfold above baseline, compared to 1.8-fold in <italic>Ahr<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

While several studies have dissected the roles of individual metabolic alterations and their effects on infection outcome, the impact of many metabolic changes remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clark et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cumnock et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dionne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ganeshan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we characterized host metabolism during infection by performing metabolomics on mouse plasma during malaria. Like others, we observed extensive reprogramming of host metabolism during infection, with the majority of measured metabolites altered during acute sickness. Mice develop anorexia during acute <italic>Pc</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cumnock et al., 2018</xref>), and we found altered energy metabolism during acute infection, such as decreases in food-derived compounds and increases in lipid subsets including glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Compound identification in metabolomics requires known references; therefore, our dataset is biased toward well-studied compounds such as these lipid classes. Nevertheless, we identified nearly 400 metabolites of diverse functions with altered intensity during <italic>Pc</italic> infection.</p><p>We observed that each day of infection is marked by a unique combination of immune, metabolic, and pathological events. We propose that therapeutic interventions must be matched to the appropriate stage of infection. For example, antimalarials may be less effective than anemia-targeting interventions for a patient in the latter half of acute infection when parasitemia has dropped significantly. By linking metabolism to the pathology and immune responses occurring at each stage of infection, we developed a rich dataset that allows interrogation of links between metabolism, immune responses, and host physiology during infection.</p><p>To this end, we observed that several heme and tryptophan metabolites reached peak intensity in plasma during acute infection. These metabolites can activate AHR, an immunomodulatory transcription factor; in the absence of AHR, mice develop AKI and succumb to infection. While we hypothesized that AHR functions primarily during acute infection, <italic>Ahr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice develop increased parasitemia relative to control mice as early as 4 DPI. Metabolites are likely found at different concentrations in plasma and the functionally relevant microenvironment, which may explain this discrepancy. It is also possible that AHR has distinct roles in early and acute infection, but the effects of increased parasitemia overshadow other AHR-dependent phenotypes. Although the role of kynurenine signaling via AHR is important during certain infection contexts, we observed that survival during malaria under our experimental conditions is kynurenine-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bessede et al., 2014</xref>). Our data suggest that survival requires AHR signaling via one or more of AHR’s other endogenous agonists.</p><p>While global loss of AHR causes aberrant immune responses, we observed that AHR is dispensable in radiosensitive cells during malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brant et al., 2014</xref>); instead, AHR in <italic>Tek-</italic>expressing radioresistant cells is required to control parasites and plasma heme, preventing AKI and death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). This phenotype may be dependent on one or more of the multiple cell types that meet these criteria, such as endothelial cells and yolk sac-derived tissue-resident macrophages. Further experimentation is warranted to more precisely identify the relevant cell type(s).</p><p>The specific mechanism linking AHR, plasma heme, and AKI is unclear. <italic>Ahr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice infected with <italic>Pc</italic> or <italic>P. berghei</italic> ANKA show defects in immune responses and parasite control prior to any kidney pathology or defects in heme regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brant et al., 2014</xref>). Our data suggest a role for AHR in pathogen recognition and/or innate immune responses in non-hematopoietic cells, two possibilities observed in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Meglio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moura-Alves et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, a simple model suggests that the increased parasitemia in <italic>Ahr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice leads to increased hemolysis, in turn causing heme overload and AKI; AHR only functions to control parasite load. This model attributes plasma heme increases in <italic>Ahr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice solely to increased parasitemia and hemolysis, which may overlook other contributing factors. Nevertheless, if AKI is simply a function of parasitemia, hemolysis, and plasma heme, then increased parasitemia, caused by any mechanism, would also lead to AKI. Treating AKI during malaria would promote disease tolerance rather than resistance to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramos et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, we considered a role for AHR in both pathogen control and heme metabolism. This model suggests that <italic>Ahr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice have impaired heme metabolism. In fact, we observed proper expression of heme metabolism proteins in the liver and kidney of <italic>Ahr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>), although failure of infected <italic>Ahr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice to upregulate <italic>Hrg1</italic> and <italic>Slc40a1</italic> in the liver may merit future study. We also did not specifically evaluate radioresistant <italic>Tek</italic>-expressing cells that contribute to heme metabolism, such as endothelial cells or tissue-resident macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balla et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Petrillo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soares and Hamza, 2016</xref>). Further undermining this model, <italic>Ahr<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Ahr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice fare equivalently when treated with phenylhydrazine, a model of sterile heme overload (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). While phenylhydrazine treatment recapitulates the acute hemolysis characteristic of malaria, it does not release PAMPs, which may be an important component of the AKI observed in <italic>Ahr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Overall, our data do not support a role for AHR in heme metabolism.</p><p>A third possibility is that AHR functions in kidney-intrinsic protection as well as pathogen control. In <italic>Pc</italic>-infected <italic>Ahr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, impaired kidney function precedes increased plasma heme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and E</xref>). This suggests that the absence of AHR may initially impair kidney function; elevated plasma heme is a result, not a cause, of kidney injury. A strength of this model is that it links heme metabolism and the production of the AHR ligands biliverdin and bilirubin to AHR activation; it also explains the elevation of plasma heme in <italic>Pc</italic>-infected <italic>Ahr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Contrary to this model, however, <italic>Ahr<sup>flfl</sup>::Tek<sup>cre/+</sup></italic> mice and chimeric mice with <italic>Ahr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> radioresistant cells both develop AKI only after elevation of plasma heme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, data not shown). Further studies will be crucial to understand the causal relationship between plasma heme and AKI during <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection, as well as the role of AHR in tissue protection.</p><p>As our appreciation grows for the contribution of metabolic adaptation to survival of infection, an important priority is to understand the effects of the many metabolic changes that occur during infection. Recent studies have dissected the contribution of specific metabolic alterations to infection outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bambouskova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clark et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cumnock et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dionne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ganeshan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weis et al., 2017</xref>). Our longitudinal study characterized systemic host metabolism during both sickness and recovery. After observing that host-derived AHR ligands increase in concentration during acute infection, we demonstrated that AHR is critical in endothelial cells to limit parasitemia and control tissue damage during malaria, in addition to its better-established roles in immune cells. Overall, these findings suggest that AKI, a common complication of severe malaria, may be caused by heme toxicity, and that therapeutically targeting AHR and/or heme metabolism, rather than parasites, may improve malaria outcomes without driving drug resistance in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. We also expect that other metabolites altered during infection have similarly important biological functions, and these relationships may be a rich area for future study.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

All <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic> AJ strain parasites were obtained from the Malaria Research and Reference Reagent Resource Center (MR4) and were tested for contaminating pathogens prior to use. Female passage mice were given intraperitoneal (IP) injections of frozen stocks of <italic>Pc</italic>-infected RBCs (iRBCs). To measure parasitemia, 2 μl tail blood was collected via tail nicking of restrained mice using sterilized surgical scissors. A thin blood smear was prepared on microscope slides (Globe Scientific 1324), fixed in methanol (Fisher Scientific A454SK-4), and stained with Giemsa (Thermo Fisher Scientific 10092013), and the percentage of iRBCs was counted at 100x magnification. An additional 2 μl blood was diluted in 1 ml of Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (Fisher Scientific 14185052) to count the number of RBCs/μl blood. Absolute counts were obtained on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer using forward and side scatter. Once parasitemia reached 10–20% (7–9 days), 10<sup>5</sup> freshly obtained iRBCs diluted in sterile Krebs saline with glucose (KSG; 0.1 M NaCL, 4.6 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>*7 <sub>H</sub>20, 0.2% glucose (w/v), pH 7.4) were IP injected into experimental animals. Uninfected control animals were injected with KSG alone.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cross-sectional infection</title><p>Age-matched C57BL/6N mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories and infected as one cohort. Five infected mice were sacrificed every day post-infection, five uninfected mice were sacrificed on 0 dpi, and two uninfected mice were sacrificed on days 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 19, and 25 (a total of 19 uninfected samples across infection). Sample collection was performed as follows: After the collection of 4 μl of blood were collected from each animal (2 μl for thin blood smears and 2 μl for RBC counts), animals were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation per Stanford University guidelines. Blood was then collected via cardiac puncture into 100 μl of 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0. Some of this blood was used for flow cytometry analysis (~5–12 μl), and the remainder was spun for 5 min at 1000 x g to collect plasma for ALT quantification, Luminex, and metabolomics analysis. All samples were stored at −80°C for later processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Metabolomics and analysis</title><p>100 μl of plasma were sent to Metabolon (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.metabolon.com">http://www.metabolon.com</ext-link>), which performed a combination of gas and liquid chromatography techniques combined with mass spectrometry (GC/LC-MS). A table of 587 detected metabolites was returned with the raw area count, which were normalized by dilution and rescaled to set the median equal to 1 (‘scaled intensity’). Median fold change (MFC) for each metabolite at each timepoint was calculated relative to the median value of uninfected day 0 samples. Next, the greatest magnitude MFC was identified for each metabolite, and metabolites with absolute value MFC &lt;2 were removed from further analysis. Lastly, 364 significantly changed metabolites were identified by comparing the time point with the greatest magnitude MFC to the day 0 time point (adjusted p-value&lt;0.05 by t-test with FDR correction).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Luminex</title><p>This assay was performed in the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Stanford University. Mouse 38-plex kits were purchased from eBiosciences/Affymetrix and used according to the manufacturer’s recommendations with modifications as described below. Briefly, beads were added to a 96-well plate and washed in a Biotek ELx405 washer. 60 μl of plasma per sample were submitted for processing. Samples were added to the plate containing the mixed antibody-linked beads and incubated at room temperature for one hour followed by overnight incubation at 4°C with shaking. Cold and room temperature incubation steps were performed on an orbital shaker at 500–600 rpm. Following the overnight incubation, plates were washed as above and then a biotinylated detection antibody was added for 75 min at room temperature with shaking. Plates were washed as above and streptavidin-PE was added. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature a wash was performed as above and reading buffer was added to the wells. Each sample was measured as singletons. Plates were read using a Luminex 200 instrument with a lower bound of 50 beads per sample per cytokine. Custom assay control beads by Radix Biosolutions were added to each well. Each cytokine was normalized to its median value on each plate. Significance was calculated by comparing each infected timepoint to values from uninfected mice across infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>In experiments assessing general immune cell classes in the blood, approximately 10 million cells were plated in FACS buffer (PBS, 0.2% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 5 mM EDTA). Prior to staining, the cells were incubated in TruStain FcX amntibody (Biolegend) for at least 5 min at 4°C. A cocktail containing the Live/Dead Fixable Blue stain (Fisher L34962) and antibodies against the following antigens was added to the blocked cells: CD71 PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone RI7217), TER-119 PE-Cy7 (TER-119), TCRγδ PE (UC7-13D5), CD19 Brilliant Violet (BV) 785 (6D5), CD3 BV650 (17A2), CD8 BV510 (53–6.7), Ly6G BV421 (1A8), CD4 Alexa Fluor 700 (GK1.5), Ly6C Alexa Fluor 647 (HK1.4), CD335 FITC (29A1.4) (all from Biolegend); CD11b Alexa 780 (M1/70, eBioscience); CD41 BUV395 (MWReg30, BD Biosciences). All stains were performed for 12–15 min at 4°C. 5 μl of CountBright counting beads (Invitrogen) were added to each samples such that absolute counts per μl of blood could be back calculated. Data were acquired on an LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo 10.0.8r1 (Tree Star). Significance was calculated by comparing each infected timepoint to values from uninfected mice across infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p>The analytes were tryptophan (TRP), kynurenine (KYN), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK), kynurenic acid (KA), and quinolinic acid (QA) and the internal standards were tryptophan-d5 (TRP-d5), kynurenine-d4 (KYN-d4), 3-hydroxykynurenine-d3 (3HK-d3), kynurenic acid-d5 (KA-d5), quinolinic acid-d3 (QA-d3).</p><p>Individual analyte primary stock solutions (10 mM) were prepared in DMSO (KYN, KA); 0.1% formic acid in water (TRP, QA); or 0.45 N HCl in 0.1% formic acid water (3HK). Intermediate stock solution consisting of five analytes: TRP; KYN; KA; 3HK; QA, was prepared from individual primary stock solutions. This intermediate stock solution was serially diluted with 0.1% formic acid/0.02% L-ascorbic acid in water to obtain a series of standard working solutions which were used to generate the calibration curve. Standard working solutions were prepared freshly for sample analysis. Calibration curves were prepared by spiking 10 µl of each of the standard working solutions into 50 µl of PBS/0.02% ascorbic acid followed by addition of 10 µl internal standard solution consisting of five analytes (25 µM TRP-d5; 5 µM KYN-d4, 3HK-d3, KA-d5; 7.5 µM QA-d3). Because of interference due to endogenous tryptophan and metabolites, calibration curves were not prepared in the same matrix (plasma) as the study samples. Blank charcoal stripped plasma still contained quantifiable amounts of tryptophan and metabolites. A calibration curve was prepared fresh with each set of samples. Calibration curve ranges: for KYN and KA, 1 nM to 10 µM; for 3HK, 2.5 nM to 10 µM; for QA, 5 nM to 10 µM; for TRP, 10 nM to 200 µM.</p><p>Fifty µl aliquots of plasma were used for analysis. 10 µl internal standard solution was added to 50 µl plasma aliquot followed by vortexing. 200 µl ice cold solution of methanol/1% acetic acid/0.02% L-ascorbic acid was added to the sample, followed by vortexing, then centrifugation. Supernatant was transferred to a new vial, evaporated to dryness under nitrogen, reconstituted in 50 µl 0.1% formic acid/0.02% ascorbic acid in water and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. L-ascorbic acid and evaporation under nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) gas were used to prevent oxidation. For QA determination, standard samples and plasma samples were diluted 10-fold with 0.1% formic acid/0.02% ascorbic acid in water and 10 µl injected to LC-MS/MS.</p><p>All analyses were carried out by positive electrospray LC-MS/MS using an LC-20AD<sub>XR</sub> Prominence liquid chromatograph and 8030 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Shimadzu). HPLC conditions: Atlantis T3 2.1 × 100 mm, 3 µm particle size column was operated at 45°C at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. Mobile phases consisted of A: 0.2% formic in water and B: 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile. Elution profile: initial hold at 0% B for 1 min, followed by a gradient of 0–30% in 6 min, then 30–95% in 2 min, equilibrating back to 0% B; total run time was 13 min. Injection volume was 10 μl.</p><p>Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) was used for quantification. Analyte mass transitions were as follows: TRP: m/z 205.0 → m/z 146.0 (quantifier) and m/z 205.0 → m/z 118.0 (qualifier); KYN: m/z 209.0 → m/z 94.1 (quantifier) and m/z 209.1 → m/z 146.0 (qualifier); 3HK: m/z 225.0 → m/z 208.1 (quantifier) and m/z 225.0 → m/z 110.1 (qualifier); KA: m/z 189.9 → m/z 89.1 (quantifier) and m/z 189.9 → m/z 116.1 (qualifier); QA: m/z 167.9 → m/z 78.1 (quantifier) and m/z 167.9 → m/z 105.9 (qualifier).

Temperature was measured by rectal probe (Physitemp Instruments Inc BAT-12 and World Precision Instruments RET-3) and was recorded daily with weight. Mice were restrained and approximately 16 μl of tail blood was collected as described above. Thin blood smears were generated using 2 μl blood, and parasitemia and RBCs/μl blood were measured as described above. Parasite density was calculated by multiplying the percent parasitemia from the blood smears by the daily RBC counts. An additional 12 μl blood was collected for other purposes. Tails were bled gently to prevent hemolysis from pressure. Age-matched mice were sampled as described except that only 4 μl blood was collected (2 μl for parasitemia, 2 μl for measuring anemia).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Histology</title><p>Mice were euthanized and portions of liver, kidney, lung, and spleen were harvested for histology, fixed in 10% formalin (VWR 50-420-850), routinely processed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Perls Prussian blue as indicated. Blinded slides were evaluated by a veterinary pathologist using an Olympus BX43 upright brightfield microscope. Photomicrographs were captured using an Olympus DP27 camera and the Olympus cellSens software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>RNA isolation and qRT-PCR</title><p>Mice were euthanized at the indicated timepoints. When indicated, perfusion was performed by cutting the vena cava and slowly introducing 10 ml of cold PBS into circulation via the heart.

snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and transferred to −80°C. Approximately 100 mg of tissue was homogenized in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS (w/v), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), 1% Triton X-100 (v/v)) with 1X protease inhibitors (Millipore Sigma 11836170001). Total protein content was measured by Bradford (Fisher Scientific PI23200) and 25 μg protein was diluted in 1X Laemmli Sample Buffer (Bio-Rad 1610747) containing β-mercaptoethanol.

In the cross-sectional infection experiment, ALT was measured on a Dimension Xpand analyzer (Siemens). A medical technologist performed all testing and reviewed all data. For all other experiments, bilirubin, ALT, and BUN were measured using kits (bilirubin by Millipore Sigma MAK126-1KT, ALT by Millipore Sigma MAK052-1KT, and BUN by Fisher Scientific 50-107-8333). Plasma samples for bilirubin were collected in the dark and measured within 5 hr to minimize UV degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rehak et al., 2008</xref>). Heme in plasma and urine were measured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramos et al., 2019</xref>). Plasma and urine were diluted between 1:1000 and 1:25 in water. 150 μl formic acid (Millipore Sigma F0507-100ML) was added and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Urine samples were also measured at 355 nm and background absorbance was corrected using the formula λ<sub>405</sub>nm = λ<sub>405</sub>nmx (λ<sub>405</sub>nm/λ<sub>355</sub>nm). Absorbance was compared to a standard curve of hemin (Millipore Sigma H9039-1G) at 0,. 5, 1, 5, 10, and 20 uM. Day 0 samples were excluded from heme analyses if visual inspection revealed hemolysis caused by the bleeding process; this did not occur on subsequent bleeding. Values from cardiac puncture blood were corrected for the percentage of EDTA in the total volume of the cardiac puncture.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Bone marrow chimeras</title><p>CD45.1 <italic>Ahr<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (B6.SJL-<italic>Ptprc<sup>a</sup></italic>/BoyAiTac; 4007 F), CD45.2 <italic>Ahr<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (C57BL/6NTac; B6-F), and CD45.2 <italic>Ahr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were lethally irradiated (2 × 6 Gy, 6 hr apart) at 5–7 weeks of age.

Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a thorough time-resolved metabolomics study of mouse plasma over a 25-day course of <italic>Plasmodiumchabaudi</italic> AJ (<italic>Pc</italic>) infection. The authors observe that the vast majority of metabolic alterations occur around the peak of parasitemia (acute phase), between days 5 to 10 post-infection, which coincides with the peak of hemolysis. They establish some solid parallels to human pediatric malaria as far as changes in metabolism are concerned, thereby lending credence to the use of <italic>Pc</italic> infection in mice as an experimental model of malaria with relevance to the human disease. They report how the Ahr is necessary for mediating protection against acute kidney injury in a mouse model of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. Using untargeted metabolomics, they revealed that Ahr agonists including bilirubin, biliverdin and tryptophan metabolites are increased during infection in both mice and human patients. Using an <italic>Ahr<sup>/-</sup></italic> mouse, they show that Ahr is necessary for protection from <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection and that this protection is associated with acute kidney injury.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Some of the conclusions drawn are not yet fully supported by the data, and important questions remain to be addressed, which would increase the overall value of this interesting study.</p><p>1) Related to Figure 3: In the third paragraph of the subsection “Malaria is characterized by stages with unique immune, metabolic, and tissue damage events”, please explain why the plasma heme level is decreased in acute infection phase. The authors show, using metabolomics, that heme levels in the plasma of <italic>Pc</italic> infected mice during the acute phase are lower than in uninfected controls (which should have virtually 0 heme in the plasma) (Figure 1H). Later, using a formic acid method, milimolar levels of heme were detected in the plasma of <italic>Pc</italic> infected mice in the acute phase (Figures 4E, 5C, 6C). This is contradictory to data in Figure 1H, and there is a wealth of data showing that heme concentration is elevated in the plasma during peak of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection, presumably due to intravascular hemolysis. Were the samples used for metabolomics treated/sampled in any way that could preclude heme mass detection? Were the mass spectrometers configured/setup in a way where heme mass could be detected? Please address.</p><p>2) The causal relationship between plasma heme and RBC counts warrants further investigation, and if this is not possible under the current circumstances, a more detailed Discussion could be provided.</p><p>3) Related to Figure 4—figure supplement 3: Although the hemolysis model used showed no apparent difference in lethality between <italic>AhR<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>AhR<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, at the PHZ dose used all the <italic>AhR<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice succumbed and this might have masked a possible pathogenic effect of AhR deletion in this experimental model. The authors could use a sub-lethal dose of PHZ to allow the <italic>AhR<sup>+/+</sup></italic> or <italic>AhR<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice to recover from the hemolysis and anemia (usually within day 12 post injection), monitor plasma heme, iron, RBCs count and kidney injury. If the <italic>AhR<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice have a heme/iron recycling defect there should be an increase in heme accumulation in plasma, presumably explaining a similar observation during <italic>Pc</italic> infection.</p><p>4) Related to Figure 6: The authors conclude that AhR expression in the endothelium is responsible for the protective effect of AhR in <italic>Pc</italic> infection, based on bone marrow chimera and conditional AhR KO experiments, used to rule out hematopoietic (radiosensitive) cells, and to identify Tie2-expressing cells as responsible for the protection effect. Nevertheless, Tie2 also drives the expression of the Cre recombinase in subsets of yolk-derived tissue-resident macrophages (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2938310/), which are likely radioresistant and therefore cannot be ruled out entirely. The authors should address this point. Better characterisation of the cells expressing AhR, for example in the kidney, would be useful to address where the expression of this receptor may be operational to prevent the onset of AKI.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In previous work by other groups, it's been suggested that heme increases in plasma and urine during <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection in mice and that this increase in heme causes AKI. In the work presented by Schneider and colleagues, they show that heme plasma levels decrease and the metabolites increase. In their Ahr model, they do see an increase in plasma (but not urine) heme at day 8 post infection, but given the kinetics of this in relation to the AKI in their model, I suggest that the heme accumulation occurs secondary to AKI and possibly as a result of the AKI, and not that heme accumulation drives AKI. The authors did a very detailed analysis on characterizing heme. They do not see increased heme in urine, they do not see increased iron containing deposits in kidneys, they see basically no differences in Hmox or Fth in the kidney and no difference in plasma heme until after the AKI appears. The authors conclude that Ahr protects from AKI by detoxifying heme, but I do not think their data support this model. What this indicates is that the authors have potentially revealed a novel relationship between heme metabolism, Ahr and AKI in the context of a <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection. This is important because most of the work in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> field forces the model that heme detoxification is the answer for every <italic>Plasmodium</italic> phenotype relating to heme. This work suggests something different and exciting.</p><p>One possibility that the authors do not seem to consider is that Ahr is necessary for a tissue protective response that protects from AKI. For example, bilirubin, biliverdin and Ahr all exhibit antioxidant properties. One possibility is that the heme metabolites are necessary to signal through Ahr to promote these antioxidant responses that protect from AKI. Similarly, this signaling pathway may be mediating anti-inflammatory responses that protect from AKI. There are likely clues to possible tissue protective responses in their RNAseq data. Is there anything in their data set to suggest such a model?</p><p>In summary, I think the data are very interesting and robust, but I would like to see the authors consider the presentation of their work and whether there is a model that better fits with the data they presented. I think there is.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript by Lissner et al., authors share the results of an extensive well-executed analysis on the role of AHR receptors in progression of malaria. The project has a large scale and a broad scope encompassing genetic, metabolic, clinical, histopathologic and cellular studies. While this generates massive amounts of data that will be useful for researchers in this field, often times authors lose focus moving from one set of experiments to another and the continuity of story gets disrupted. Authors' claim about the kidney protective role of AhR is very convincing with carefully carried out knock out, heterozygous and WT experiments. On the other hand, majority of metabolomic analyses only point out the consequences of the known fact that malaria generates hemolysis and heme is released as a by-product. Furthermore, comparisons of CM and <italic>Pc</italic> is misleading and should be avoided as I mentioned in detail in relevant section of my comments. Endothelial cell based AHR expression being critical in AHR mediated protection is the most interesting section of the paper as it finally points out the attention to a single focus so it would have been nice if authors went deeper following that lead. This paper would benefit from a rewrite connecting the loose ends into a continuous story.</p><p>Introduction, second paragraph: I recommend using WHO data to refer to the up to date global disease burden of malaria rather than a manuscript published in 2012. WHO annually releases malaria reports (world malaria report) and these may provide more up to data and more widely accepted numerical values.</p><p>Introduction, second paragraph: I recommend removing the vague statement: &quot;much is known about how immune responses affect malaria outcome&quot;.</p><p>Introduction, fourth paragraph: Referring <italic>Plasmodiumberghei</italic> as rodent malaria parasite that causes lethal cerebral malaria, while not incorrect, might be misleading. The only reference that mentions <italic>P. berghei</italic> among cited after this sentence is Brant et al. and there, it is used as <italic>P. berghei</italic> ANKA which is the sub-strain that causes Experimental Cerebral Malaria (ECM) in susceptible mice. <italic>P. berghei</italic> NK65, another sub-strain that is very closely related <italic>P. berghei</italic> ANKA never results in ECM. Please use the full strain name <italic>P. berghei</italic> ANKA.</p><p>Figure 1A: While no revision is required, hemoglobin measurements instead of RBC counts is a better way to monitor anemia.</p><p>Subsection “Malaria is characterized by stages with unique immune, metabolic, and tissue damage events”, fourth paragraph and Figure 1I-J: Comparison of <italic>Pc</italic> with human CM patients is not substantiated. First of all, <italic>Pc</italic> is an uncomplicated malaria causing rodent parasite. CM on the other hands is the most lethal complication for both human and mouse (ECM) malaria. I recommend removing this data set since a more reasonable comparison would have been non-complicated human <italic>Pf</italic> vs. mouse <italic>Pc</italic> or Human CM vs. mouse Pb ANKA. Unless authors wish to offer these comparisons instead, there is no value of <italic>Pc</italic> vs. CM comparison other than that they both cause hemolysis simply because of being intra RBC microorganisms that are destroying RBCs in order to spread. <italic>Pc</italic> is never used to recapitulate human CM. This parasite only recapitulates the immunity development angle of human malaria with antibodies and such. This entire paragraph and relevant figures need to be reworded. Rest of Figure 1 is informative and well carried out experiments.</p><p>Subsection “AhR ligands are more abundant during acute infection”, first paragraph: Please change to Pb ANKA (refer to my comment above).</p><p>Subsection “AhR signaling is protective during <italic>Pc</italic> infection”, first paragraph: This is an interesting finding. Gender bias has always been mentioned in mouse malaria experiments but has not been properly documented. This is a useful information.</p><p>Figure 4: Authors should discuss why they only focused kidney but not the other organs. Spleen, lung and liver may show damages related to sequestration, intravascular hemolysis, side products, cytokines and anemia. This needs to be discussed.</p><p>Figures 5 and 6: Figure 5 does not add much to the story since it only says that radiosensitive cells do not contribute to the AhR mediated protection. Yet it still sets the stage for Figure 6. I would shorten that part and put more emphasis on Figure 6. I found Figure 6 to be very informative focusing the attention onto endothelial cells. The endothelial cell specific knock out really has potential to generate high quality original data, however authors cut that story short by only limiting the analyses to 4 major parameters. Extending that section with more sophisticated analyses would make the manuscript more complete.</p><p>Materials and methods section: age of a mouse has a significant impact on disease progression. Therefore, age matching is critical. Authors should include a statement regarding to age matching practice between control and experimental groups, otherwise 8-12 weeks is a relatively broad range for this particular experimental model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60165.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Some of the conclusions drawn are not yet fully supported by the data, and important questions remain to be addressed, which would increase the overall value of this interesting study.</p><p>1) Related to Figure 3: In the third paragraph of the subsection “Malaria is characterized by stages with unique immune, metabolic, and tissue damage events”, please explain why the plasma heme level is decreased in acute infection phase.

Please address.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for a typo in the manuscript – the line should read “…acute <italic>Pc</italic> malaria is characterized by stable plasma heme levels…” and has been fixed. Figure 1H demonstrates that heme levels don’t decrease until late infection. Apart from our error, the reviewer also notes discrepancies in heme concentrations between figures. In Figure 1H, we report plasma heme from uninfected and infected wild-type C57BL/6 mice; levels in infected mice are statistically comparable to uninfected mice during acute infection. Figures 4E, 5C, and 6C quantify plasma heme in control and <italic>AhR<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. In control mice, plasma heme remains similar to baseline levels (Figures 4E, 6C). Only in susceptible <italic>AhR<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, <italic>AhR<sup>Tie2Δ/Δ</sup></italic> mice, or chimeric mice with <italic>AhR<sup>-/-</sup></italic> radioresistant cells does plasma heme reach the millimolar levels pointed out by the reviewer. The appropriate comparison is infected mice from Figure 1H with infected control mice from the later figures (<italic>AhR<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, <italic>AhR<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, and chimeric mice with <italic>AhR<sup>+/-</sup></italic> radioresistant cells). This comparison reveals that control or wild-type mice from Figures 1H, 4E, 5C, and 6C all have heme levels similar to uninfected mice during acute infection. We do not see a contradiction in these data.</p><p>The reviewer also mentions that heme concentration is elevated in plasma during the peak of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection. While plasma heme concentration surely varies by model, our data indicates that increased plasma heme is not a universal feature of malaria—indeed, acute <italic>Pc</italic> infection in C57BL/6 mice does not lead to significantly increased plasma heme. We speculate that uncomplicated malaria may not lead to increased plasma heme; rather, plasma heme increases may be a cause and/or symptom of complicated malaria. Our study demonstrates that increased plasma heme during malaria can lead to pathology and we believe that the factors underlying this increase merit further study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The causal relationship between plasma heme and RBC counts warrants further investigation, and if this is not possible under the current circumstances, a more detailed Discussion could be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the relationship between RBC density and plasma heme is ripe for exploration. RBC counts and plasma heme are certainly related, as hemolysis releases heme into plasma. The relationship is not linear, however, since plasma heme levels are affected by both heme release into plasma and the multiple processes that remove heme from plasma, such as intracellular heme metabolism by HO-1. These pathways minimize plasma heme in control <italic>AhR<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice during <italic>Pc</italic> infection (Figure 4E), despite substantial decreases in RBC density relative to baseline (Figure 3C). We believe the reviewer is interested in why this relationship breaks down in <italic>AhR<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, an interest that we share.</p><p>We did not observe a large defect in heme metabolism in <italic>AhR<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, through gene expression, protein analyses, and Phz-induced heme overload (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C, D, Figure 4—figure supplement 3). As the reviewer points out later, <italic>Pc</italic>-infected <italic>AhR<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice fail to upregulate <italic>Hrg1</italic> and <italic>Slc40a1</italic> in the liver, two heme transporters which may affect plasma heme levels (Figure 4—figure supplement 2D). On the other hand, if AhR-dependent regulation of these genes affected heme overload, Phz treatment should cause different plasma heme levels or sensitivity in <italic>AhR<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and <italic>AhR<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, which we did not observe (Figure 4—figure supplement 3). We did find that <italic>AhR<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice have slightly decreased RBC density than controls (Figure 3C); however, we suspect that this relatively minor difference is unlikely to cause the substantially increased plasma heme (Figure 4E).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the relationship between plasma heme and hemolysis during malaria is critical for the field to sort out. We have added clarifying sentences to the Discussion, where we propose several models that discuss hemolysis, plasma heme, and AKI (Discussion, fifth paragraph). We have also proposed an additional model, as mentioned by reviewer #2, that our data may also support (Discussion, sixth paragraph). We agree with the reviewers that further experimentation will be required differentiate between these possibilities, but believe that these studies are outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to Figure 4—figure supplement 3: Although the hemolysis model used showed no apparent difference in lethality between AhR<sup>+/+</sup> and AhR<sup>-/-</sup> mice, at the PHZ dose used all the AhR<sup>+/+</sup> mice succumbed and this might have masked a possible pathogenic effect of AhR deletion in this experimental model. The authors could use a sub-lethal dose of PHZ to allow the AhR<sup>+/+</sup> or AhR<sup>+/-</sup> mice to recover from the hemolysis and anemia (usually within day 12 post injection), monitor plasma heme, iron, RBCs count and kidney injury. If the AhR<sup>+/-</sup> mice have a heme/iron recycling defect there should be an increase in heme accumulation in plasma, presumably explaining a similar observation during Pc infection.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right that the lethal dose we chose may obscure the effect of AhR loss on Phz sensitivity. However, we selected this dose because it results in plasma heme levels that are comparable to what we observe in <italic>AhR<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice infected with <italic>Pc</italic>, and at a similar time scale (plasma heme increases to above 1000 μm within one day). These features, we reasoned, faithfully recapitulate the hemolysis caused by malaria. While a lower dose would cause less lethality, it would also not model this aspect of malaria. Furthermore, we monitored several factors in response to Phz treatment in addition to survival, including plasma heme and kidney function, and did not see a difference in susceptibility in any metric. Due to these reasons, and experimental challenges imposed by the pandemic, we did not perform the experiment the reviewer suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Related to Figure 6: The authors conclude that AhR expression in the endothelium is responsible for the protective effect of AhR in Pc infection, based on bone marrow chimera and conditional AhR KO experiments, used to rule out hematopoietic (radiosensitive) cells, and to identify Tie2-expressing cells as responsible for the protection effect. Nevertheless, Tie2 also drives the expression of the Cre recombinase in subsets of yolk-derived tissue-resident macrophages (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2938310/), which are likely radioresistant and therefore cannot be ruled out entirely. The authors should address this point. Better characterisation of the cells expressing AhR, for example in the kidney, would be useful to address where the expression of this receptor may be operational to prevent the onset of AKI.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this point and originally alluded to the fact that tissue-resident macrophages also fit the criteria of radioresistant <italic>Tie2</italic>-expressing cells. While future experiments to identify the <italic>Tie2</italic>-expressing radioresistant cells at play in this phenotype, we believe that such work is outside of the scope of this manuscript and should be addressed in future studies. However, we agree with the reviewer that clarification around this issue is necessary in the manuscript. We have provided more detail in the subsection “AHR is necessary in <italic>Tek</italic>-expressing cells to control parasitemia, plasma heme, and AKI during <italic>Pc</italic> infection” and throughout the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] One possibility that the authors do not seem to consider is that Ahr is necessary for a tissue protective response that protects from AKI. For example, bilirubin, biliverdin and Ahr all exhibit antioxidant properties. One possibility is that the heme metabolites are necessary to signal through Ahr to promote these antioxidant responses that protect from AKI. Similarly, this signaling pathway may be mediating anti-inflammatory responses that protect from AKI. There are likely clues to possible tissue protective responses in their RNAseq data. Is there anything in their data set to suggest such a model?</p><p>In summary, I think the data are very interesting and robust, but I would like to see the authors consider the presentation of their work and whether there is a model that better fits with the data they presented. I think there is.</p></disp-quote><p>We think the reviewer has raised a very insightful point. In the first model we proposed, AhR functions exclusively in pathogen control, and we have added sentences to clarify this point (Discussion, fifth paragraph). This model suggests that, in the absence of AhR, parasitemia is increased as early as 4 DPI (Figure 3A), leading to more hemolysis in <italic>AhR<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (Figure 3C). Despite equivalent plasma heme concentrations, intracellular heme concentrations could nevertheless be elevated in renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, which import and metabolize heme during malaria and are sensitive to heme toxicity (Ramos, 2019). This could explain impaired kidney function at 7 DPI (Figure 4B) despite equivalent plasma heme (Figure 4E).</p><p>In the second model we considered, AhR functions in both pathogen control and heme metabolism. We believe that our data do not support this model, as we did not detect any major deficits in heme metabolism in <italic>AhR<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Nevertheless, we remained unable to pinpoint the source of such extremely elevated plasma heme (Discussion, sixth paragraph).</p><p>The reviewer suggests a third possibility in which AhR is required for both pathogen control and tissue protection in the kidney. This model orients elevated plasma heme as a consequence, rather than the initial cause, of impaired kidney function. Particularly tantalizing is the role of the heme metabolites bilirubin and biliverdin in activating AhR, suggesting a possible feedback loop in which AhR is activated by heme metabolism to protect from heme toxicity. As an important caveat to this model, impaired kidney function is observed prior to elevated plasma heme in <italic>AhR<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (Figure 4B, E), but not in <italic>AhR<sup>Tie2Δ/Δ</sup></italic> mice (Figure 6C, D) or chimeric mice with <italic>AhR<sup>/-</sup></italic> radioresistant cells (Figure 5, longitudinal data not shown). Whether this is biologically relevant or simply an artifact of different mouse models will have important implications, since the relative timing of heme elevation and kidney impairment is critical. While we do not believe that our RNA-seq data, a time-course analysis of wild-type livers during <italic>Pc</italic> infection, provide insight into this pathway, we agree that the role of kidney-intrinsic AhR signaling during <italic>Pc</italic> infection merits further investigation. We are grateful to the reviewer for this insight and have included further discussion of each model in the Discussion. Additionally, when we previously referred to “heme-mediated AKI” in the manuscript, we now refer to the development of high plasma heme and AKI without any causal implications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript by Lissner et al., authors share the results of an extensive well-executed analysis on the role of AHR receptors in progression of malaria. The project has a large scale and a broad scope encompassing genetic, metabolic, clinical, histopathologic and cellular studies. While this generates massive amounts of data that will be useful for researchers in this field, often times authors lose focus moving from one set of experiments to another and the continuity of story gets disrupted. Authors' claim about the kidney protective role of AhR is very convincing with carefully carried out knock out, heterozygous and WT experiments. On the other hand, majority of metabolomic analyses only point out the consequences of the known fact that malaria generates hemolysis and heme is released as a by-product. Furthermore, comparisons of CM and Pc is misleading and should be avoided as I mentioned in detail in relevant section of my comments. Endothelial cell based AHR expression being critical in AHR mediated protection is the most interesting section of the paper as it finally points out the attention to a single focus so it would have been nice if authors went deeper following that lead. This paper would benefit from a rewrite connecting the loose ends into a continuous story.</p><p>Introduction, second paragraph: I recommend using WHO data to refer to the up to date global disease burden of malaria rather than a manuscript published in 2012. WHO annually releases malaria reports (world malaria report) and these may provide more up to data and more widely accepted numerical values.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insight and have made the change suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction, second paragraph: I recommend removing the vague statement: &quot;much is known about how immune responses affect malaria outcome&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made the suggested change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction, fourth paragraph: Referring Plasmodium berghei as rodent malaria parasite that causes lethal cerebral malaria, while not incorrect, might be misleading.

P. berghei NK65, another sub-strain that is very closely related P. berghei ANKA never results in ECM. Please use the full strain name P. berghei ANKA.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a very good point and we have made this change throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1A: While no revision is required, hemoglobin measurements instead of RBC counts is a better way to monitor anemia.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s point and agree that hemoglobin measurements offer complementary information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Malaria is characterized by stages with unique immune, metabolic, and tissue damage events”, fourth paragraph and Figure 1I-J: Comparison of Pc with human CM patients is not substantiated. First of all, Pc is an uncomplicated malaria causing rodent parasite. CM on the other hands is the most lethal complication for both human and mouse (ECM) malaria. I recommend removing this data set since a more reasonable comparison would have been non-complicated human Pf vs. mouse Pc or Human CM vs. mouse Pb ANKA. Unless authors wish to offer these comparisons instead, there is no value of Pc vs CM comparison other than that they both cause hemolysis simply because of being intra RBC microorganisms that are destroying RBCs in order to spread. Pc is never used to recapitulate human CM. This parasite only recapitulates the immunity development angle of human malaria with antibodies and such. This entire paragraph and relevant figures need to be reworded. Rest of Figure 1 is informative and well carried out experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. We agree that uncomplicated malaria caused by <italic>Pc</italic> and CM caused by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> are considerably different types of malaria and cannot be substituted for each other. In this sense, it is surprising that the plasma metabolomes are so similar (Figure 1I)! On the other hand, <italic>Pc</italic> and <italic>Pf</italic> are closely-related species that cause infections with many similar features, such as massive RBC destruction and systemic immune activation, as the reviewer points out.</p><p>Our mouse model of <italic>Pc-</italic>infected wild-type mice is most similar to uncomplicated <italic>Pf</italic> malaria, and the reviewer correctly suggests that an uncomplicated malaria dataset would be best for our comparative analysis. However, analysis is challenged by the fact that large untargeted metabolomics datasets are relatively rare, compared to targeted analysis; and when untargeted metabolomics analysis has been employed in the past, technical limitations at the time resulted in the identification of relatively few metabolites. For example, the most detailed dataset meeting the reviewer’s specifications that we have examined focused on uncomplicated <italic>Pf-</italic> or <italic>P. Vivax</italic> infected patients (found under MTBLS664). That study identified less than a third of the molecules found in our study (190 vs. 587 metabolites), and none of the heme-related metabolites that we discuss.</p><p>Metabolomics datasets that capture the ideal type of malaria in adequate detail remain elusive. For this reason, we performed our comparative analysis using metabolomics data from CM patients, which identified 432 metabolites. The reviewer is correct that a more ideal comparison would be preferable. However, given the limited data availability and the general similarities of malaria caused by all <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, we disagree that the comparison is inappropriate. We have added a sentence to clarify the limitations of our analysis in the subsection “Malaria is characterized by stages with unique immune, metabolic, and tissue damage event”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “AhR ligands are more abundant during acute infection”, first paragraph: Please change to Pb ANKA (refer to my comment above).</p></disp-quote><p>We have made this change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “AhR signaling is protective during Pc infection”, first paragraph: This is an interesting finding.

Spleen, lung and liver may show damages related to sequestration, intravascular hemolysis, side products, cytokines and anemia. This needs to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s point that other organs may also be relevant to this phenotype. For that reason, we originally analyzed all tissues mentioned by the reviewer—spleen, lung, and liver. We do mention that our histological analysis of liver tissue revealed less severe damage in <italic>AhR<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (subsection “AHR signaling is protective during <italic>Pc</italic> infection”). We have now added a sentence to indicate that spleen and lung tissue showed no significant differences between genotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 5 and 6: Figure 5 does not add much to the story since it only says that radiosensitive cells do not contribute to the AhR mediated protection. Yet it still sets the stage for Figure 6. I would shorten that part and put more emphasis on Figure 6. I found Figure 6 to be very informative focusing the attention onto endothelial cells. The endothelial cell specific knock out really has potential to generate high quality original data, however authors cut that story short by only limiting the analyses to 4 major parameters. Extending that section with more sophisticated analyses would make the manuscript more complete.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the role of AhR in <italic>Tie2</italic>-expressing cells merits further study.

For this reason, we have always carefully matched ages. By using littermates that fall within the 8-12 week old range, we ensure that our experiments have age-matched control and experimental mice. That said, we have not seen a difference in disease severity between mice that are 8 weeks versus 12 weeks old. To clarify this point in the manuscript, we have moved all discussion of mouse age to the subsection “Cross-sectional infection”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
