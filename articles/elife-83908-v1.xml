antigen-specific humoral response. However, whether Tfr can directly repress germinal center (GC) B cells that acquire autoantigens is unclear. Moreover, TCR specificity of Tfr to self-antigens is not known. Our study suggests that nuclear proteins contain antigens specific to Tfr. Targeting of these proteins to antigen-specific B cells in mice triggers rapid accumulation of Tfr with immunosuppressive characteristics. Tfr then exert negative regulation of GC B cells with predominant inhibition of the nuclear protein-acquiring GC B cells, suggesting an important role of direct cognate Tfr-GC B cells interactions for the control of effector B cell response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>follicular regulatory T cells</kwd><kwd>germinal center b cells</kwd><kwd>immunologic tolerance</kwd><kwd>nuclear proteins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI142032</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grigorova</surname><given-names>Irina L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 AI142032</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grigorova</surname><given-names>Irina L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI132771</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dent</surname><given-names>Alexander L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AR071384</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kahlenberg</surname><given-names>Joanne Michelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K24-AR076975</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kahlenberg</surname><given-names>Joanne Michelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-AR075043</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kahlenberg</surname><given-names>Joanne Michelle</given-names></name><name><surname>Maz</surname><given-names>Mitra P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Targeting nuclear self-antigens to germinal center B cells induces rapid accumulation of follicular regulatory T cells with immunosuppressive phenotype and leads to inhibition of germinal center response with predominant suppression of the nuclear protein-acquiring germinal center B cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Follicular regulatory T cells (Tfr) are a subset of regulatory T cells, predominantly CXCR5<sup>high</sup>PD1<sup>high</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup>, that are present in B cell follicles of secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Linterman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wollenberg et al., 2011</xref>). Tfr play multiple roles in the regulation of B cell responses. On one side, Tfr prevent development of auto-Abs and autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Botta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clement et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gonzalez-Figueroa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2016</xref>) and in some studies appear to have a modest negative effect on the GC and Ab response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clement et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sage et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wollenberg et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to that, Tfr affect B cell recruitment and selection in germinal centers (GCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cavazzoni et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clement et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laidlaw et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Linterman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sage et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wollenberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xie et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>GC B cell responses critically depend on the provision of help by Tfh cells. Tfh cells differentiate from foreign Ag-specific Th cells following immunization or infection. Importantly, differentiation of both Tfh cells and Tfr depends on the molecular interactions with antigen-presenting cells, involving SAP and ICOS molecules and the master transcription factor BCL6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Linterman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nurieva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pedros et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sage et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, accumulation of Tfr in SLOs occurs at the same time or slightly after the Tfh cells. However, in contrast to Tfh cells, the Tfr TCR repertoire predominantly overlaps with natural FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and is more diverse than the Tfh TCR repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maceiras et al., 2017</xref>). While some studies suggest that TCR signaling must be important for Tfr development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maceiras et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shrestha et al., 2015</xref>), which self-antigens are cognate to Treg-derived Tfr is largely unknown. Such analysis is further complicated by very limited knowledge of the natural immunodominant self-antigens cognate to thymus derived Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leonard et al., 2017</xref>). The deficiency in the identification of Tfr-specific self-antigens makes it difficult to assess whether Tfr may form direct cognate interactions with MHCII/self-peptides on the GC B cells.</p><p>Some experimental in vivo evidence supports the role of direct Tfr interactions with GC B cells for the negative regulation of immune responses. Tfr-produced membrane-attached neuritin has been recently shown to be acquired by B cells leading to their reduced ability to form plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gonzalez-Figueroa et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, our previous study suggested that GC B cell-intrinsic production of CCL3 promotes direct contacts with Tfr and modest inhibition of the foreign Ag-specific B cells at the peak of GC response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benet et al., 2018</xref>). However, the contribution of direct Tfr-GC B cell encounters to the suppression of self-antigen-acquiring and potentially autoreactive GC B cells is not known. The alternative hypothesis is that Tfr may restrict autoreactive B cell responses nonspecifically by reducing B cell activation/selection threshold through general inhibitory actions on B and/or Tfh cells.</p><p>In this study we show that nuclear proteins (NucPrs), often targeted by auto-Abs in autoimmune diseases, contain ligands that could trigger significant accumulation of Tfr. Targeting these NucPrs to antigen-specific B cells by booster immunization induces rapid accumulation of Tfr with elevated expression of immunosuppressive genes. Activated Tfr then promote modest inhibition of the total GC responses with predominant suppression of the NucPr-acquiring GC B cells, memory B cells, and plasma cells. These findings suggest an important role of direct interactions between GC B and Tfrs that specifically recognize self-antigen acquired and presented by GC B cells in the immunoregulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Acquisition of NucPrs by GC B cells promotes rapid accumulation of Tfr</title><p>Tfr deficiency leads to accumulation of anti-nuclear and tissue-specific antibodies (Abs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gonzalez-Figueroa et al., 2021</xref>), leading to development of auto-Ab-mediated autoimmunity in older mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fu et al., 2018</xref>). NucPrs that are often targeted in autoimmune diseases by auto-Abs include nucleosomal histones, SS-A/Ro, RNP-Sm (small nuclear ribonucleoproteins), Scl70, and Jo-1 (aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, both nuclear and cytoplasmic) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mahler and Fritzler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tan, 1983</xref>). In this study we hypothesized that these NucPrs may contain peptides cognate to Tfr. Because the rise in Tfr is usually observed at the same time or slightly after the increase in Tfh/GC B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aloulou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Turner et al., 2017a</xref>), we first examined whether acquisition of NucPrs by GC B cells promotes accumulation of Tfr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Bovine nucleosomes, SSA-Ro, RNP-Sm, Scl70, and Jo1 (that have over 92% homology to murine NucPrs), were biotinylated and conjugated to streptavidin (SA) to generate SA-NucPrs. Alternatively, SA was conjugated to foreign antigens (Ags): ovalbumin-biotin or duck egg lysozyme (DEL)-biotin to generate SA-OVA or SA-DEL Ags respectively. C57BL/6 (B6) mice were subcutaneously immunized with SA-DEL to recruit both SA and DEL-specific B cells into the GC response. After formation of GCs (8 days later) mice were boosted with SA-NucPrs, SA, or SA-OVA to promote acquisition of these Ags by the SA-specific GC B cells. The Ag-draining inguinal lymph nodes (dLNs) were collected 3 days later for flow cytometry analysis. We found that Tfr in the dLNs of SA-NucPrs-boosted mice were significantly increased as compared to mice boosted with SA or SA-OVA Ags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). In contrast, the numbers and percentage of Tfh cells in the SA-NucPrs-boosted mice slightly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). The observed accumulation of CXCR5<sup>high</sup> PD1<sup>high</sup> FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Tfr was not accompanied by increase in the frequencies of CXCR5<sup>int</sup> PD1<sup>int</sup> FOXP3<sup>+</sup> or CXCR5<sup>low</sup> PD1<sup>low</sup> FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and F–H</xref>).

While robust increase in Tfr was detected in mice boosted with combined SA-NucPrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), boosting with separate SA-NucPr Ags did not promote significant increase in Tfr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Based on this data we suggest that the observed increase in Tfr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>) occurs due to additive accumulation of Tfr specific to various NucPrs Ags.</p><p>Despite the non-significant increase in Tfr after targeting separate NucPrs to SA-specific B cells, we detected decreased frequency of the SA-specific GCs B cells in mice boosted with all selected Ags except SA-Jo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In addition, we have tested the frequency of the nucleosome-specific B cells in mice boosted with SA-nucleosomes conjugates. In accord with previous study, we found (based on the staining with fluorescent nucleosome tetramers) that about ~1% of GC B cells in SA-DEL-immunized mice boosted with SA were specific to nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gonzalez-Figueroa et al., 2021</xref>). However, boosting of mice with SA-nucleosomes led to significant drop in the frequency and numbers of the nucleosome-specific GC and memory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>). Overall, this data suggests that nucleosomes and other NucPr Ags contain peptides cognate to Tfr and if acquired by GC B cells may promote their suppression by Tfr.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Formation of conjugates between human B cells acquiring NucPrs and Tfr</title><p>While antigen-specific targeting of NucPrs to GC B cells promotes rapid accumulation of Tfr in mice, whether this finding maybe relevant to the regulation in humans is unclear. We therefore assessed whether human Tfr may have a subset of cells cognate to the NucPrs. Based on the previous studies, cognate interactions between B and T cells cocultured ex vivo lead to increased formation of B-T cell conjugates detectable by flow cytometry analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choudhuri et al., 2005</xref>). We therefore utilized a similar approach with Tfr (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and B cells (CD19<sup>+</sup> CD3<sup>-</sup> CD27<sup>-</sup>) sorted from the blood of healthy human subjects. To promote antigen uptake by human B cells we first coupled anti-human IgM-biotin Abs to SA, SA-DEL or SA-NucPrs to generate protein complexes αIgM (αIgM-SA or αIgM-SA-DEL) and αIgM-NucPrs (αIgM-SA-NucPr). Sorted B cells were then cultured in the presence of αIgM or αIgM-NucPrs to promote crosslinking of B cell receptors and internalization of the linked to αIgM protein complexes for degradation and HLA class II /peptide presentation. Tfr from the same patient were then cocultured with activated or control B cells for 36 hr and formation of Tfr-B cell conjugates was assessed by flow cytometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In three independent experiments we detected an increase in the frequency of Tfr-B cell conjugates when Tfr were cocultured with activated B cells that have internalized NucPrs as compared to control Ags or B cells that did not acquire Ags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). Based on that, we suggest that a significant fraction of the circulating human Tfr may be specific to the peptides from the NucPrs selected in this study.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Formation of conjugates between human B cells acquiring nuclear proteins (NucPrs) and follicular regulatory T cells (Tfr).</title><p>B cells and Tfr were sorted from human blood.

While there is no detectable Tfr increase in mice directly immunized with NucPrs (conjugated to SA and administered in Ribi adjuvant), a rapid Tfr response is detected when SA-NucPrs are administered to mice with an ongoing SA-specific GC response. In these mice, SA-specific GC (and possibly memory) B cells are expected to acquire SA-NucPrs via their B cell receptors, internalize the Ags, and present both antigenic and NucPrs peptides in complex with MHCII for recognition by follicular T cells. While our study does not rule out the potential for dendritic cells and/or other Ag-presenting cells to promote Tfr responses at longer time scale, it suggests that direct targeting of selected NucPrs to abundant antigen-specific B cells via BCR could be utilized to trigger very rapid and robust increase in Tfr. Interestingly, a previous study suggested pausing of Tfr in proximity of the tingible body macrophages that acquire dying B cells within GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jacobsen et al., 2021</xref>). It is plausible to suggest that these macrophages may be another cell type in GCs that presents NucPr peptides for cognate stimulation of Tfr, possibly under all immunization conditions.</p><p>Based on the 10× Genomics gene expression analysis, the majority of the NucPrs-induced Tfr have distinct gene expression characteristics that suggest enhanced immunosuppressive functions. Based on the TCR immunorepertoire analysis, Tfr subset enriched in the SA-NucPrs-boosted mice (cluster 10) have significant clonal overlap with other Tfr subsets. In contrast to this ‘immunosuppressive’ subset, Tfr-like cell clusters 11 and 12 are predominantly overlapping with Tfh-like cell clones and may be related to the recently identified subset of Tfh cells in GCs that upregulate FOXP3 and play a role in the shutoff of GC response over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jacobsen et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, in mice boosted with SA-NucPrs we detected no increase in the Tfh-related clones in the ‘immunosuppressive’, as well as all other Tfr-like subsets. Therefore, we suggest that the majority of NucPrs-induced Tfr are not derived from Tfh cells. Based on this, on the previously established overlap of Tfr and Treg TCR repertoire, as well as the important role of Ag-specific B cells in the very rapid induction (3 days) of the immunosuppressive Tfr, we speculate that majority of NucPrs-induced Tfr accumulate due to proliferation of preexisting Tfr clones in the follicles or their precursors at the T/B border following their cognate interactions with NucPr-acquiring and -presenting B cells.</p><p>Identification of the dominant self-Ags cognate to Tregs remains an important task for both fundamental analysis of thymus-derived Tregs and development of Tregs-dependent translational therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leonard et al., 2017</xref>). Previous studies suggested that histones may contain Tregs epitopes. Vaccine therapy with peptides from nucleosomal histones H4 and H1 promoted Treg response, diminished auto-Ab levels, and delayed the onset of nephritis in lupus-prone mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kang et al., 2005</xref>). However, availability of Tregs epitopes in the other NucPr Ags has not been suggested before. Because we detected the strongest Tfr response after administration of the combination of NucPrs, we suggest that selected self-Ags contain multiple protein epitopes cognate to Tfr. Importantly, our initial analysis of Tfr isolated from human blood suggests that a fraction of these cells may be specific to the peptides from the NucPrs that we utilized in the study. Future studies should carefully delineate the peptide epitopes within NucPrs that induce Tfr responses in mice and humans and assess their potential for future vaccine therapies.</p><p>Our data suggest that Tfr induced by SA-NucPrs boosting promote partial suppression of the overall GC response. Importantly, they more strongly impede expansion of the SA-NucPrs-acquiring GC B cells and reduce their memory and Ab-secreting cell responses. Based on that, we conclude that cognate interactions with Tfr promote superior suppression of GC B cells. The critical role of Tfr in the observed regulation (rather than indirect effects from SA-NucPrs administration) is supported by complete reversal of the observed immunosuppression in the Tfr-deficient mice. To summarize, while our study does not rule out non-specific inhibitory effect of Tfr on non-cognate GC B cells, it suggests that GC B cells that acquire selected NucPrs will be subjected to specific repression by cognate Tfr.</p><p>Multiple molecular mechanisms could potentially contribute to the negative control of GC B cells by cognate and non-cognate Tfr. NucPrs-induced Tfr upregulate expression of multiple genes that may potentially contribute to the negative regulation of B cells and Tfh cells, including <italic>Ctla4</italic>, <italic>Icos</italic>, <italic>Cd39</italic>, <italic>granzyme B,</italic> and <italic>Il10</italic>. Of note, expression of <italic>neuritine</italic> that was recently shown to be produced by Tfr and to limit B cell differentiation into plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gonzalez-Figueroa et al., 2021</xref>) was not limited to the accumulating Tfr cluster with immunosuppressive phenotype. We speculate that multiple molecular mechanism may work in parallel to promote suppression of GC B cells. Cognate recognition by Tfr of the GC-presented MHCII/peptides likely leads to more prolonged interactions between the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jacobsen et al., 2021</xref>), increasing the duration of inhibitory signals received by GC B cells from cognate Tfr. Future studies should dissect the contribution of distinct molecular pathways to the negative signals provided to GC B cells by Tfr.</p><p>Future studies should also examine potential engagement of the NucPrs-specific Tfr for translational applications. To this end, our study suggests that SA-NucPrs boosting promotes a significant suppression of the NucPrs-acquiring GC B cells not only in the wild-type (WT), but also in the lupus-prone NZM2328 mice that have dysregulated GC responses and over time develop anti-nuclear Abs. We therefore suggest that targeting NucPrs (and/or their specific peptides) to GC B cells should be further explored for analysis of their therapeutic potential for control of pathogenic B cells specific to autoantigens or/and allergens or promoting autoepitopes spreading for activation of pathogenic autoreactive T cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The beads were then transferred into Buchner funnel covered with seven layers of kimwipes, washed with 1 l of buffer A and eluted with 200–300 ml of buffer B (0.4 M ammonium carbonate buffer, pH = 9.2). The eluent was lyophilized, resuspended in 15 ml buffer A, and dialyzed two times in buffer A at 4°C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 rcf, and the supernatant was concentrated using a Centriprep filter (Millipore, MWCO 10,000 kDa) to 3 ml for loading onto a 1×66 cm gel filtration column comprised of 4 g of degassed Sephadex G-50 beads (GE Healthcare) preequilibrated in buffer A O/N. The column was washed with 200 ml of degassed buffer A and the concentrated eluent was then separated on the column using degassed buffer A to collect ten 5 ml fractions. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. DEL-containing (band at ~14 kDa) fractions were combined.

NP-specific B cells or SA-specific B cells were detected with BCR-specific binding with NP-PE (Biosearch Technologies) or SA-PE (BioLegend). For intracellular staining, the FoxP3 intracellular staining kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were then incubated with anti-FoxP3, CTLA4, granzyme B, or Ig (H+L). All samples were acquired on a BD FACSCanto flow cytometer. For cell sorting, enriched B cells and T cells were incubated with Abs in Sorting buffer (0.5% FBS and 2 mM EDTA in PBS) and were performed on a BD FACSAria III cell sorter.

Follicular T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>PD1<sup>hi</sup>CXCR5<sup>hi</sup>) were sorted from mice at day 11 after immunization into PBS + 2% FBS. Single-cell suspensions were subjected to counting and viability checks on the LUNA Fx7 Automated Cell Counter (Logos Biosystems) and diluted to a concentration of 700–1000 cells/µl. Single-cell libraries were generated using the 10× Genomics Chromium Controller with Immune Profiling reagents following the manufacturer’s protocol (10× Genomics). Final library quality was assessed using the LabChip GX (PerkinElmer). Libraries were subjected to paired-end sequencing according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina NovaSeq 6000). Bcl2fastq2 Conversion Software (Illumina) was used to generate de-multiplexed Fastq files and the CellRanger Pipeline (10× Genomics) was used to align reads and generate count matrices. Barcodes with mitochondrial reads &gt;5% were removed. Preprocessing, clustering, and dimensionality reduction were performed using Loupe Browser and Loupe V(D)J browser (10× Genomics, Cell Ranger).

Seurat v4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hao et al., 2021</xref>) was used for downstream analysis based on Seurat vignettes. Cells which had less than 200 or more than 8000 transcripts and mitochondrial genes representing greater than 15% of total transcripts were removed. All remaining cells were then clustered and projected into UMAP plots. The optimal number of PCs used for UMAP dimensionality reduction was determined using Jackstraw permutations which resulted in the first 15 PCAs being used. Identification of follicular T cells was accomplished by adding a module score in Seurat. Clusters in which the module score was significant enriched for were identified as being follicular. Follicular cells were then reclustered and differentially gene expression analysis between each cluster and all other cells was performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of the human B cells and Tfr conjugate formation</title><p>Human blood was collected with informed consent from healthy donors in accordance with a University of Michigan IRB approved protocol (HUM0007150).

autoimmune antibody responses, but it is not known why such specificity is generated. This important study provides new information as to how self-reactive antibody responses are regulated and has significant implications for the fields of autoimmunity and vaccine design. The authors added careful controls which are convincing enough.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83908.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Kurosaki</surname><given-names>Tomohiro</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/035t8zc32</institution-id><institution>Osaka University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Wing</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/035t8zc32</institution-id><institution>Osaka University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.10.25.513707">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.25.513707v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

It is indeed very important that boosting immunizations contain an equivalent amount of SA. This is exactly how the experiments were planed and performed.

Quantification of the GC area was performed in ImageJ and is consistent with decreased size of GC in mice boosted with SA-NucPrs compared to SA (see updated Figure 3- supplement 1A).

Therefore we have asked whether SANucPr immunization in the absence or presence of SA-specific Abs may be sufficient to promote Tfr response in 3 days. In this set of experiments analysis of GCs is secondary to the analysis of Tfr cells.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that at 3 days post immunization foreign antigen-specific GC response would not be significant if any. However, small GCs are present in ILN in mice (under non-germ free conditions) even in the absence of immunization with foreign antigens. Therefore, if SA-NucPr promoted Tfr response, then some effects on the pre-existing GCs could have been expected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7B: The gating definition of doublets and singlets should be shown.
