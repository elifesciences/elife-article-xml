Maintaining the correct ratio of cell types in time and space allows tissues to form patterned compartments and perform complex functions. Patterning is especially evident in the human colon, where tissue homeostasis is maintained by stem cells in crypt structures that balance proliferation and differentiation. Here, we developed a human 2D patient derived organoid screening platform to study tissue patterning and kinase pathway dynamics in single cells. Using this system, we discovered that waves of ERK signaling induced by apoptotic cells play a critical role in maintaining tissue patterning and homeostasis. If ERK is activated acutely across all cells instead of in wave-like patterns, then tissue patterning and stem cells are lost. Conversely, if ERK activity is inhibited, then stem cells become unrestricted and expand dramatically. This work demonstrates that the colonic epithelium requires coordinated ERK signaling dynamics to maintain patterning and tissue homeostasis. Our work reveals how ERK can antagonize stem cells while supporting cell replacement and the function of the gut.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>colon</kwd><kwd>crypt</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>epithelium</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM130864</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paek</surname><given-names>Andrew L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM147128</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thorne</surname><given-names>Curtis A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA242914</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ellis</surname><given-names>Nathan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK118563</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merchant</surname><given-names>Juanita L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT223952/Z/21/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thorne</surname><given-names>Curtis A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TA32CA09213</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thorne</surname><given-names>Curtis A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA23074</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thorne</surname><given-names>Curtis A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Roughly 10 million evenly spaced crypts inhabit the colon and are renewed every 3â5 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao and Michor, 2013</xref>). Each colonic crypt is ~2000 single cell monolayer invagination, roughly 82 cells in height and 41 cells in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Potten et al., 1992</xref>). Cell extrusion and death are largely confined to the non-crypt compartments of the colon, while cell division, which is required to replace differentiated cell types, is restricted to the crypt base. The distance separating the stem cell and differentiated cell compartments is ~300 microns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sugimoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). Chemical destruction of these millions of repeated structures can be repaired in the normal gut within weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2020</xref>); thereby, re-establishing spatial separation between stem and differentiated cell compartments with remarkable accuracy. Across these cell compartments, the Wnt and MAPK pathways oppose one another to maintain homeostasis by balancing differentiation and stemness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tripurani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kabiri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warzych et al., 2020</xref>). ERK activity is low in colonic crypts and increases as cells become more differentiated. Wnt inhibition leads to hyperactive ERK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kabiri et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that Wnt is suppressing ERK signaling in order to maintain stemness. Conversely, loss of ERK1/2 triggers the expansion of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wei et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting ERK activity limits the stem cell pool. While much is known about the pathways required for maintaining the different cell types of the colon, how these compartments communicate with each other and maintain regular spacing is unknown.</p><p>MAPK/ERK signaling dynamics in wound healing have recently been described. Elegant work in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells found that cells at the wound barrier initiate ERK signaling cascades which propagate in wave-like patterns across the cell monolayer away from the site of damage. These ERK waves drive collective movement in the direction of the wound to efficiently seal barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matsubayashi et al., 2004</xref>). ERK waves during wound healing have been observed in vitro and in vivo in a diverse set of animal models, suggesting a highly conserved function in the wound healing process. ERK waves are induced in response to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gagliardi et al., 2020</xref>) and promote hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Simone et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, ERK dynamics can instruct fate decisions. In neuronal cells and <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, ERK signaling promotes differentiation if the signal is prolonged or total strength is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Santos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johnson and Toettcher, 2019</xref>). A recent study using organoid monolayers derived from murine small intestine showed that differentiated villus cells have higher ERK signaling over time compared to crypt cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pokrass et al., 2020</xref>). In summary, ERK signaling can propagate across the epithelium in wave-like patterns in response to cues including apoptosis, regenerative need, and oncogenic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gagliardi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Simone et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hiratsuka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aikin et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, it is unclear whether ERK waves play a role in maintaining the proper ratios of cell types in the human colonic epithelium.</p><p>Herein, using self-organizing primary human colon organoid monolayers, we show that epithelial cells can reorganize from single cells into a complex monolayer resembling the tissue of origin. Regularly spaced crypt-like structures (hereafter referred to as ânodesâ) form 3â4 days after cell dissociation and seeding. These nodes are maintained for weeks in spatially distinct compartments. In non-node compartments, cell extrusion and apoptosis are increased. As a cell is extruded and undergoes apoptosis, an ERK wave is initiated that propagates radially from the dying cell. Locally, cells in the path of the wave are prompted to migrate toward the dying cell, presumably to maintain epithelial integrity as reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gagliardi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Valon et al., 2020</xref>). The spacing of nodes is similar to the diameter of ERK waves, which suggests that the length scale observed between nodes is dependent on ERK waves. Consistent with this, we found that if ERK activity is globally increased, nodes disappear and cease to express the Wnt signaling and stem cell markers <italic>LGR5</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic>. Alternatively, if ERK is inhibited globally, nodes increase in size and express high levels of <italic>LGR5</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic>. If Wnt3a is removed from culture media, nodes also disappear and ERK activity is increased. These data show that Wnt and ERK mutually oppose one another to maintain gut homeostasis and Wnt-suppressing ERK waves originating from apoptotic cells help to shape the architecture of the human colonic epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patient-derived colonic organoid monolayers</title><p>To study single-cell dynamics in the human colon, we adapted our previous method of culturing murine intestinal organoids as monolayers. These monolayers maintain patterning and cell fate characteristics observed in 3D organoid systems and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thorne et al., 2018</xref>). In conjunction with the University of Arizona Cancer Center organoid resource (BioDROid), we collected colonic normal, adenomatous polyp, and carcinoma samples. We cultured them as 3D patient-derived organoids, expanded them in 3D and transferred them onto a thin layer of extracellular matrix after dissociation into single cells. After 4 days, confluent monolayers harbored phenotypically distinct clusters and were considered fully established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). Strikingly, even starting as a random dispersion of single cells, normal colonic organoids developed localized compartments of densely packed cells (nodes) that were surrounded by less dense cells. These nodes resembled those we observed using the murine model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thorne et al., 2018</xref>), with LGR5 +stem cells located specifically within densely compacted cell compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Murine small intestinal organoid monolayers and normal human colon monolayers rarely reached confluence and instead reached a homeostatic state and maintain nodes at subconfluency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A-C</xref>). A polyp-derived 2D organoid line (referred here as GiLA1 for Gastro<underline>i</underline>ntestinal Line, Arizona 1) formed regularly spaced nodes, quickly reached confluence within 72 hr, and could maintain node structures for 45 days or more. When GiLA1 single cells were seeded onto an ultra-thin layer of Matrigel, organoids formed monolayers by 3 days and began to spontaneously form regularly spaced compact compartments reminiscent of colonic crypts within 3â4 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). A tumor organoid derived from a micro satellite stable (MSS) invasive colon adenocarcinoma (p21T) was grown in 2D and displayed different morphologies compared to normal, polyp, and the murine small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). p21T proliferated but failed to form nodes and instead formed uniform, disorganized monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). To date, across multiple patient-derived organoid lines, we have observed the formation of nodes in normal and polyp-derived organoids; however, we fail to observe nodes in multiple adenocarcinoma organoids. Across five colorectal patient lines obtained from the PDMR, no patterning was observed, and all lines formed confluent monolayers. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Because of its unique ability to form both complete monolayers and distinct cellular compartments, the GiLA1 organoid line was used for the remainder of the described experiments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Development and self-organization of colonic patient-derived colonic organoid monolayers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model depicting the workflow for the development of organoid monolayers.

To capture the establishment of these structures over time, we used time-lapse microscopy of GiLA1 organoid monolayers expressing H2B-iRFP670 to observe the formation of distinct cellular compartments over 5 days. Cells initially exhibited high levels of motility after attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM) to form 5â10 cell clusters. After this, cells became hyperproliferative from 48 to 72 hr after seeding to form a complete monolayer. Finally, morphologically distinct cellular compartments were formed by 96 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1âvideo 1</xref>). These 2D monolayers can be readily grown in 384-well imaging plates making this model particularly amenable to high-content imaging and quantitative-image analysis.

During the apoptotic event, the cells immediately adjacent to the apoptotic cell moved away from the apoptotic cell slightly. The apoptotic event was followed by a wave of ERK activity that traveled approximately 450 ÂµM over a period of 95 min for an average speed of ~4.7 ÂµM/min. In addition to the ERK signaling wave, we noticed motility of the cells surrounding the apoptotic cell towards the site of apoptosis. Tracking single cells revealed a striking correlation between intensity/duration of ERK activity and movement of cells surrounding the apoptotic cell in the direction of the apoptotic cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, two right panels and 3E). As the ERK wave propagated outward from apoptotic cells, it dissipated in both duration and intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Particle image velocimetry (PIV), a method used to quantify the flow of image pixels over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrian, 1991</xref>), confirmed collective cell migration towards the apoptotic cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), suggesting that ERK waves instruct migration of surrounding cells as shown in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gagliardi et al., 2020</xref>). Cells treated with the EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib did not induce ERK waves or display tropism towards dying cells, suggesting that EGFR-mediated ERK signaling is required for cell movement in this context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3âvideo 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">Figure 3âvideo 3</xref>). Tracking of single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and cross correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>) revealed that ERK activity preceded cell movement, suggesting that ERK waves instruct cell movement. We previously described distinct apoptotic and proliferative compartments in organoid monolayers derived from murine small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thorne et al., 2018</xref>). To confirm this in human organoid monolayers and investigate if cell death was restricted to a compartment distinct from proliferative nodes, we imaged mature living organoid monolayers in the presence of cleaved caspase 3 dye, a marker for apoptosis. We found that the emergence of an apoptotic cell was more likely in differentiated cells in non-node compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

We used a well-established activator of the ERK pathway<bold>,</bold> phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to acutely activate ERK signaling across the monolayer. Following treatment with 100 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/sigma/p8139">nM</ext-link> PMA, we observed immediate hyperactivated ERK in all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/sigma/p8139">, Figure 4âvideo 3</ext-link>).

One future step is to define the mechanism by which organoid monolayers can establish these compartments from dissociated single cells. Recent work has highlighted mechanically mediated transcription factors and substrate stiffness as critical mediators of pattern formation in murine small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Serra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gjorevski et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">PÃ©rez-GonzÃ¡lez et al., 2021</xref>).

However, the expression of localized Wnt target genes <italic>LGR5</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) suggests that a fetal-like state has been repressed as the organoid monolayers mature and form patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nusse et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Apoptosis-induced survival</title><p>Previous work highlighted that apoptosis-induced ERK waves limit cell death to maintain epithelial integrity in a process termed apoptosis-induced survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gagliardi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Valon et al., 2020</xref>).

The cochlear duct, which relies on its curved tissue architecture to function, is shaped by ERK waves during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishii et al., 2021</xref>). ERK waves are also essential for proper regeneration of zebrafish scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Simone et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, here we show that the spacing of stem cells in colonic organoid monolayers is correlated with the size of differentiation-promoting ERK waves. As extruded cells induce these ERK waves, they carve out a differentiated compartment, which drives cells towards apoptosis, resulting in positive feedback. These signals also limit stem cells, providing an elegant mechanism for separating regions of cell death from the stem cell compartment. However, we cannot say definitively that apoptosis instructs tissue patterning as caspase inhibition does not prevent ERK waves (presumably due to MMP-driven shedding of EGFR ligands being upstream of caspase activation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gagliardi et al., 2020</xref>). Optogenetic tools would need to be used to determine if tissue architecture can be controlled directly by ERK wave size, pattern, and duration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Mechanotransduction and ERK waves</title><p>Upstream of ERK waves, activation of rho-associated kinase (ROCK), and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) are essential for apoptosis-driven membrane blebbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coleman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mills et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marchiando et al., 2011</xref>) and extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Le et al., 2021</xref>).

We did not investigate the role of mechanical signaling in the maintenance of stem cell compartments using our system, but we think this is an exciting area. It would be interesting to know if inhibition of ROCK or MLCK would induce or prevent waves, as both kinases play a role in activation and deactivation of paracrine signaling in this context.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Maintaining a balance between stemness and differentiation</title><p>Here we see that acutely inducing ERK signaling across all cells destroys the stem cell niche, suggesting this mechanical feedback is essential to maintain stem cell homeostasis. Conversely, inhibition of the ERK pathway unleashes stem cells, resulting in aberrant expansion of the stem cell compartment. This suggests that the dynamics and location of ERK signals help to maintain the balance between stemness and differentiation. Recent studies in animal models support a mutually inhibitory relationship between the Wnt and ERK pathways in the normal gut. In the murine small intestine, the ERK activity is low in the crypts of LieberkÃ¼hn and higher as cells move out of the crypt. Inhibition of paracrine Wnt signaling results in ERK hyperactivation in the crypt and loss of LGR5<sup>+</sup> stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kabiri et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that Wnt is suppressing ERK signaling as it maintains stemness. Inversely, if ERK1/2 is knocked out at embryonic stages in mice, stem cells within the crypt proliferate and expand dramatically, displaying a ~twofold increase in LGR5 and OLFM4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wei et al., 2020</xref>). This phenotype is strikingly similar to what we have observed after chemical inhibition of the ERK pathway in our organoid monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In murine systems, oncogenic activation of ERK driver genes leads to decreases in the stem cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Riemer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leach et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reischmann et al., 2020</xref>), which is similar to what we observed using an inducible KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). During hair follicle development, a well-established patterning model system, EGFR is essential and serves to limit cell proliferation and stem cell numbers through attenuation of Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tripurani et al., 2018</xref>). Î²-catenin is also essential for follicle formation, and hyperactivation of the Wnt pathway results in de novo follicle expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">NÃ¤rhi et al., 2008</xref>). Together, these studies support our hypothesis that these two pathways balance one another to maintain tissue homeostasis. ERK was activated via four separate methods in GiLA1 monolayers to assess its role in patterning maintenance: (1) PMA treatment (2) Expression of oncogenic KRAS (3) Removal of Wnt 3 a (4) Inhibition of Wnt via pyrvinium. Although activation of ERK occurred within hours in all four conditions, only PMA triggered rapid node loss, whereas other methods took days to induce patterning defects. We suspect this is due to the role of PKC (activated by PMA) in cell migration. PMA treatment most likely induced ERK activity and migration, leading to a previously described positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hino et al., 2020</xref>). Our organoid monolayers lack stromal and immune cells, suggesting that the maintenance of patterning is most likely driven by signaling between epithelial cells rather than stromal or immune cell interactions with the colonic epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Implications in human disease</title><p>The Wnt and ERK pathways are commonly hyperactivated during the development of colon cancer. This work unveils a relationship between these two pathways that maintains homeostasis in precancerous tissue.

Our work highlights the ERK and Wnt pathways as maintainers of patterning and therefore restrictors of dysplasia. One hypothesis is that Wnt pathway activation results in the suppression of ERK during early colon tumor development. Hyperactivating mutations such as oncogenic KRAS could be a selective response to Wnt activation. The result would be both the Wnt and KRAS pathways, which normally oppose one another, becoming hyperactivated together. This mutational combination, also requiring p53 suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Serrano et al., 1997</xref>), is seen in ~30% of colon tumors and results in highly mobile, proliferative, and adaptive clones.</p><p>The mutation frequency in the normal epithelium is far too high for DNA repair alone to explain how humans prevent the expansion of cancerous cells over a lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rozhok and DeGregori, 2015</xref>). How does normal tissue prevent the takeover of hyperproliferative clones throughout life? Pathways highlighted as tumor-driving can also play a vital role in tumor prevention within normal tissue. In human cell lines, oncogenic mutations that trigger sustained ERK signaling result in extrusion carried out by normal neighbors in cell mixing experiments. This surveillance, mediated by normal cells, is driven by the ERK waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aikin et al., 2020</xref>) and is an example of normal cells using a pathway described regularly as oncogenic to prevent the establishment of transformed clones. Similarly, epithelial cells rely on Wnt signaling to extrude precancerous cells that have acquired Wnt pathway activating mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2017</xref>). Our work highlights how Wnt and ERK can regulate the size and spacing of cellular compartments in pre-cancerous tissue and shows how delicately these pathways are balanced. Future work monitoring ERK and other central signaling pathways across many tumor PDOs with defined genetic backgrounds will unveil how patterning and signaling between single cells are dysregulated during tumor progression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of 3D organoids from patient biopsies</title><p>The normal or tumor tissues from endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsies (EUS FNAs), or core needle biopsies were collected from consented patients by the (Tissue Acquisition and Repository for Gastrointestinal and HEpaTic Systems [TARGHETS], IRB 1909985869) facility located in the Arizona Health Science Center.

the organoids initially self-organize. The authors then follow maintenance of organization into densely clustered nodes that have increased cells in cell cycle and the remaining more sparsely populated regions with fewer cycling cells. This study builds on a literature demonstrating roles for signaling pathways like ERK in epithelial patterning that have been examined in the cell competition field and, more specifically, in mouse intestinal organoids. This manuscript should be relevant to a broad readership interested in how epithelial organoids can self-organize and the role of specific signaling pathways in the process. In addition, the technical aspects of the work with live human monolayer cultures observed over timelapse with extensive quantification of cell behavior represent a useful advance in the field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78837.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Klein</surname><given-names>Ophir D</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.02.23.481374">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.23.481374v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions to make the paper suitable for <italic>eLife</italic> will include a response to the reviewer critiques and further examination of additional signaling pathways, in particular the Wnt pathway.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>â The methods say &quot;Cytoplasmic regions were defined by a donut-shaped ring _two pixels wide..&quot; Is this supposed to read &quot;at least 2 pixels wide&quot;? Otherwise, it isn't clear how this is done, as cytoplasms would be greater than 2 pixels.</p><p>â Perhaps this should be in the public comments, but it seems to me in some of the sequences (most notably Video 3a) that the initial event (prior to caspase 3 positivity) is an expansion of the soon-to-be-apoptotic cell with actual outward movement of surrounding cells and then (pertinent to point 1 in the public comment) the expected actomyosin contraction that appears to bring the neighboring cells in tight as much of the apoptosing cell body rises up above the monolayer (as can be seen in brightfield). Yet, there is essentially no blue in the movement heatmap in Figure 3D. How can cells always move towards an apoptotic cell and never away (even randomly)?</p><p>â The PIV map in Figure S5 might be moved into main figures, as without some aid, readers may struggle to understand how cell motility is turned into the graphic representation. Indeed, Figure 3 is confusing until the supplemental videos are watched and all the supplemental data viewed. It would be great, if some sort of cartoon or guide to how movement and wave work could be provided here, or at least, say an explanation of what a node and what movements are measured can be shown in Fig, 3C. I spent a long time looking at individual cell clusters to see their relative positions over time to begin to understand the data.</p><p>â What is Figure 4H relative to? Is this in inhibitor experiments or just control?</p><p>â It is unclear what Figure 5F represents? What is &quot;Sum/Cell&quot;? Again, as above, differences in PMA-treated cultures may be due to cell death.</p><p>â There seemed to be scale bars in some of the videos, but I didn't see where their magnitude was given.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It's hard to find information on the number of independent biological organoid lines used in this study. It's important that this information be included. A cell shouldn't be considered a replicate.</p><p>Figure S4, can the concentrations be included? Was a dose-response curve used to determine the concentrations?</p><p>The link between apoptosis and tissue patterning proposed in the second paragraph of the &quot;Erk waves instruct pattern&quot; isn't supported by data. A disruption of apoptosis would need to be performed in order to make such a claim.</p><p>In the discussion, the &quot;Organoid Monolayer System&quot; section suggests that there may be a role for Erk signaling in tissue origin memory. This is not well supported by literature and ignores a lot of work on developmental patterning and epigenetic control of tissue identity including experiments by Nicole Le Dourain and other experimental embryologists that go back decades and would argue against a role for kinase signaling as a key to maintain tissue patterning.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors should provide a better characterization of the different cell types present in their organoid monolayers, such as Goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells, enterocytes, Tuft cells etc.</p><p>2) Is the intensity and duration of the Erk waves dependent on the amount of apoptosis?</p><p>3) It would be worth confirming these findings using the authors' tumor line in addition to their GiLA1 line. They could then ask whether the lack of node formation in their tumor line could be reversed, such as via the addition of ERK inhibitors, if those cells have a high Erk activation, as was suggested in the previous literature.</p><p>4) Since the authors argue that the Erk and Wnt pathway are mutually antagonistic, it would be informative to quantify Wnt activity during the Erk waves. This quantification could be performed with regard to space and time relative to the Erk waves. This experiment, while not essential for the current findings to have merit, would significantly help our understanding how those two pathways interact.</p><p>5) The -Wnt3a phenotype should be confirmed by using a Wnt3a inhibitor.</p><p>6) Figure 4B: please add a control image.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78837.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>â The methods say &quot;Cytoplasmic regions were defined by a donut-shaped ring _two pixels wide..&quot; Is this supposed to read &quot;at least 2 pixels wide&quot;?

Yet, automated cytoplasmic segmentation often incorporates errors, especially in dense, confluent cultures. We found that a two pixel annulus adjacent to the nucleus was the most accurate cytoplasmic measurement. Since the reporter is diffuse in the nucleus the mean of this region is a good proxy for the concentration of the reporter in the cytoplasm. This approach is standard for KTR reporters and is used by other groups, in particular the developer of the ERK-KTR.

How can cells always move towards an apoptotic cell and never away (even randomly)?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewerâs description of the movement following the apoptotic event and have addressed their concerns by describing it more clearly in the Results section, (page 7 top) and adding a description of the different analyses in the methods section with formulas for our calculations (page 4). We apologize for not including this in the original submission.</p><p>To clarify, during the apoptotic event there is a slight movement away from the apoptotic cell, predominantly in the cells that are very close to the apoptotic cell. This slight movement away from the apoptotic cell is followed by movement towards the apoptotic cell, with the cells closest to the apoptotic cell moving before the cells that are further away. Importantly, since the movement away from the apoptotic cell is much smaller in magnitude than the subsequent movement towards the apoptotic cell it is hard to visualize in the heat maps. Therefore, we used two heat maps to depict cell movement following the apoptotic event.</p><p>In the middle heat map of Figure 3D, we measured the net movement of each cell toward the location of the apoptotic cell when it died. Since this measurement describes total distance traversed, a cell can be closer to the apoptotic cell in a given frame even if it migrated slightly further away in the current frame as compared to the previous frame. An example calculation would be as follows: if a nucleus was 20 Î¼m away from the apoptotic nucleus at the time of death, and 10 Î¼m away from the apoptotic cell at frame 11, this value would be 10 Î¼m (20 Î¼m â 10 um) for frame 11. If in the next frame, the nucleus was now 15 Î¼m away the value would be 5 Î¼m (20 Î¼m â 15 um), even though it moved slightly further from the apoptotic nucleus. Thus, this calculation measures overall movement towards the apoptotic nucleus and does not capture the frame-to-frame movement.</p><p>To capture the frame-to-frame movement, we took the values described in the previous paragraph and subtracted frame t-1 from frame t. So, in the example described above, when the cell moved 5 Î¼m away from the location of the apoptotic cell, this value would be -5uM, even if overall the cell has moved closer to the apoptotic cell since the time of the death event. This analysis is depicted in the heat map on the right in Figure 3D. You can see the movement away from the apoptotic cell in the cells closest to the apoptotic cell (top of the heat map). Also, before the apoptotic event the movements of each cell can be both away from the apoptotic cell and towards it, more or less at random as the reviewer suggested would occur.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The PIV map in Figure S5 might be moved into main figures, as without some aid, readers may struggle to understand how cell motility is turned into the graphic representation. Indeed, Figure 3 is confusing until the supplemental videos are watched and all the supplemental data viewed. It would be great, if some sort of cartoon or guide to how movement and wave work could be provided here, or at least, say an explanation of what a node and what movements are measured can be shown in Fig, 3C. I spent a long time looking at individual cell clusters to see their relative positions over time to begin to understand the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We have moved the PIV analysis to the main figures and have added a more detailed description of what is measured in the PIV analysis in the methods section and included a reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â What is Figure 4H relative to? Is this in inhibitor experiments or just control?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this was not the best data representation. Figure 4H was showing the heterogeneity of wave size across all controls, no drug treatment was used. This figure was removed from the main figure and a more detailed analysis was performed and included in figure S5 in order to compare these distances directly to spacing of node regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â It is unclear what Figure 5F represents? What is &quot;Sum/Cell&quot;? Again, as above, differences in PMA-treated cultures may be due to cell death.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have relabeled it LGR5 intensity/Cell. This measurement is made by first segmenting individual cells and quantifying the LGR5 mRNA FISH intensity in the individual cell ROIs. For this reason, effects on cell death would not confound this data. The histogram is a minimum of 5000 single cell measurements showing the distribution of the RNA levels under the different treatments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â There seemed to be scale bars in some of the videos, but I didn't see where their magnitude was given.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this. The magnitude of the scale bars is 100 microns. This has been added to each of the video legends. Figure 5 was re-made and a 100-micron scale bar was added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It's hard to find information on the number of independent biological organoid lines used in this study. It's important that this information be included. A cell shouldn't be considered a replicate.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We used a single patient derived organoid line for the majority of this study, yet we did compare to other patient derived lines that are normal and tumor in origin. We have added this information in the first paragraph of the Results section. We have also added a supplemental figure (Supplemental figure 1) comparing five different tumor lines to the Gila1 line to show patterning differences. We added an additional representative image of a normal patient derived monolayer to figure S1. In all experiments, technical replicates (multiple wells) and biological replicates (separate experiments) were performed. In some cases, the data is shown as each data point representing a single cell in order to show the distribution of response across single cells. The details for this can be found in the excel sheet provided with the exact number of replicates for each experiment. We also have added greater detail to the figure legends for number of replicates performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S4, can the concentrations be included? Was a dose-response curve used to determine the concentrations?</p></disp-quote><p>A concentration of 1uM was used for each of the drugs. This was to show as was shown previously, that the KTR will shut off in response to well-established small molecule inhibitors. Minimal cell death was observed in the first 24 hours and cells showed clear inhibition of the KTR activity, so dose responses were not performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The link between apoptosis and tissue patterning proposed in the second paragraph of the &quot;Erk waves instruct pattern&quot; isn't supported by data. A disruption of apoptosis would need to be performed in order to make such a claim.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point and indeed it was previously shown that caspase inhibitors do not suppress Erk waves (shown in Gagliardi 2021, presumably due to MMP-driven shedding of EGFR ligands being upstream of caspase activation). Though we do believe that apoptotic events will influence patterning more detailed experiments potentially using optogenetic tools are needed to address this question directly. We have toned down the wording of this portion of the discussion to address this concern. Instead, we focus on the role of Erk waves in controlling patterning by replacing âapoptosisâ with Erk waves in several places.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion, the &quot;Organoid Monolayer System&quot; section suggests that there may be a role for Erk signaling in tissue origin memory. This is not well supported by literature and ignores a lot of work on developmental patterning and epigenetic control of tissue identity including experiments by Nicole Le Dourain and other experimental embryologists that go back decades and would argue against a role for kinase signaling as a key to maintain tissue patterning.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. Our intention was not to ignore well-established fate regulation mechanisms such as histone modifications at promoters and enhancers or the beautiful early lineage experiments of LeDourain and colleagues. Our work here simply suggests that Erk waves may help regulate cell plasticity and the architecture of the colon <italic>during</italic> homeostasis. It would be very interesting to see if epigenetic modifications were maintained after cells stopped producing Lgr5 for example in response to Erk activation and to detail their ability to reprogram back into stem cells, this is an area we are actively exploring. To address this concern, we have toned this section down and highlighted epigenetic modifications as the current major driver of tissue origin memory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The authors should provide a better characterization of the different cell types present in their organoid monolayers, such as Goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells, enterocytes, Tuft cells etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We have added the percentages of different cell types in the Gila1 monolayers (Figure S1 E and F). We quantified stem cells, proliferative cells, colonocytes, tuft cells, and goblet cells. The GiLA1 line showed relatively low levels of goblet cells and slightly higher levels of stem cells, presumably due to its origin from an adenoma.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is the intensity and duration of the Erk waves dependent on the amount of apoptosis?</p></disp-quote><p>Single waves were analyzed, all of which originated from a single death event. We found that if multiple cells died or a tear was formed in the monolayer, waves still occurred. We did not observe enough multiple cell deaths to quantify, presumably due to the anti-apoptotic nature of the Erk waves (Gagliardi 2021, Valon 2021). We did observe waves colliding with one another, but this did not change the size or duration of the Erk activity in each cell. This could be due to a maximal signal threshold being reached, or a limitation of the KTR reporterâs dynamic range.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be worth confirming these findings using the authors' tumor line in addition to their GiLA1 line. They could then ask whether the lack of node formation in their tumor line could be reversed, such as via the addition of ERK inhibitors, if those cells have a high Erk activation, as was suggested in the previous literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this would be a fascinating area to study. We addressed this issue by testing the effect of inducible KRAS on the patterning of the monolayers (new Figure 5). We attempted to rescue patterning in the KRAS mutant organoids with a Mek inhibitor, but found that the KRAS-induced organoid monolayers became hypersensitive to Mek inhibitor and saw an increase in cell death. We feel to fully address this observation, which is reminiscent of âoncogene addictionâ requires a careful secondary study that would be beyond the scope of our work here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Since the authors argue that the Erk and Wnt pathway are mutually antagonistic, it would be informative to quantify Wnt activity during the Erk waves. This quantification could be performed with regard to space and time relative to the Erk waves. This experiment, while not essential for the current findings to have merit, would significantly help our understanding how those two pathways interact.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree. We are working to build a GSK-3Î² KTR reporter to address this as there are no currently available Wnt reporters that can address cell dynamics. Unfortunately to date, we do not have conclusive experiments that our GSK-3 KTR is faithfully reporting on endogenous GSK-3 activity. We have used a GFP reporter driven by TCF/LEF and found this to respond to Wnt inhibition over multiple days, however the long half-life of GFP prevents accurate dynamics data from being collected within the short time scales of stochastic Erk waves. Adding a degradation sequence to GFP also does not work as the basal fluorescence intensity of GFP is too low for accurate measurements. Therefore, we cannot include the crosstalk between Erk and Wnt dynamics directly at this time. Regardless, we have strengthened the effects of Wnt on Erk signal with our response to question 5 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The -Wnt3a phenotype should be confirmed by using a Wnt3a inhibitor.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We have added data from experiments using the Wnt inhibitor Pyrvinium. We show that inhibition of Wnt results in activation of Erk and loss of nodes in a dose dependent manner (Figure 5E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 4B: please add a control image.</p></disp-quote><p>Control images were added to this figure.</p></body></sub-article></article>
