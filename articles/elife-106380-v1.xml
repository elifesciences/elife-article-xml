exposure remain poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we characterized the lung immune landscape following acute nose-only exposure to flavored e-cig aerosols in vivo using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) in mice. Metal analysis of daily generated aerosols revealed flavor-dependent, day-to-day variation in metal (Ni, Cu, K, and Zn) leaching. scRNA seq profiling of 71,725 lung cells from control and exposed mice revealed pronounced dysregulation of myeloid cell function in menthol (324 differentially expressed genes, DEGs) and tobacco (553 DEGs) flavors, and lymphoid cell dysregulation in fruit-flavor (112 DEGs) e-cig aerosol exposed mouse lung, compared to air controls. Flow cytometry corroborated these findings, showing increased neutrophil frequencies and reduced eosinophil counts in menthol- and tobacco-exposed lungs. Flavored e-cig exposure also increased CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell proportions, upregulated inflammatory gene expression (<italic>Stat4</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic>, <italic>Il1bos</italic>, <italic>Il1ra</italic>, and <italic>Cxcl3</italic>), and enriched terms like ‘Th1 cytokine signaling’ and ‘NK cell degranulation’. Notably, tobacco-flavored e-cig aerosol exposure increased immature (Ly6G⁻) neutrophils and reduced S100A8 expression, suggesting altered neutrophil activation in vivo. Overall, this study identifies flavor-dependent immune alterations in the lung following acute e-cig aerosol exposure and provides a foundation for future mechanistic studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>e-cigarettes</kwd><kwd>scRNA</kwd><kwd>lung</kwd><kwd>vaping</kwd><kwd>flavors</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54CA228110</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rahman</surname><given-names>Irfan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Toxicology Training Program T32ES007026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lamb</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Profiling cell-specific immune responses reveals altered neutrophil function and enhanced T-cell mediated cell death following acute in vivo exposure to tobacco-flavored e-cigarette aerosol using single-cell technology.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) or electronic nicotine delivery systems are a relatively novel set of tobacco/nicotine and flavored products that have gained immense popularity among adolescents and young adults in many countries including the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), and China. Flavors are one of the key features that make these products alluring to the younger diaspora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ma et al., 2022</xref>). Reports indicate that in 2020 about 22.5% of high school students and 9.4% of middle school students in the US were daily vapers or e-cig users with fruit (66%), mint (57.5%), and menthol (44.5%) being the most commonly used flavors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>). However, not much is known about the flavor-specific effects of e-cig vaping on the health and immunity of an individual, especially focusing on cell types and gene expressions.</p><p>E-cig products and aerosols are known to contain harmful constituents including formaldehyde, benzaldehyde, acrolein, <italic>n</italic>-nitrosamines, volatile organic compounds, ketenes, and metal ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wu and O’Shea, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goniewicz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Studies have indicated that exposure to e-cigs may enhance inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and genomic instability in exposed cells or animal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Muthumalage et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2018b</xref>). Risk assessment (systemic) of inhaled diacetyl, a potential component of e-liquids, has estimated the non-carcinogenic hazard quotient to be greater than 1 among teens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">White et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, clinical and in vivo studies have suggested that exposure to e-cig aerosols could impair innate immune responses in the host, thus making them more susceptible to bacterial/viral infections. The bacterial clearance, mucous production, and phagocytic responses in these individuals are shown to be affected upon use of e-cigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Martin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sussan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Masso-Silva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Madison et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>However, cell-specific changes within the lung upon vaping are not fully understood, making it hard to determine the health impacts of the use of these novel products. In this respect, single-cell technology is a powerful tool to analyze gene expression changes within cell populations to study cellular heterogeneity and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jovic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Inayatullah et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ke et al., 2022</xref>). Such an investigation is important to deduce the health effects of acute and chronic use of e-cigs in young adults. In this study, we aim to determine the effects of acute exposure to e-cig aerosols on mouse lungs at single-cell level. To do so, we exposed C57BL/6J mice to 5-day nose-only exposure to air, propylene glycol:vegetable glycerin (PG:VG), fruit-, menthol-, and tobacco-flavored e-cig aerosols. The nose-only exposure has more translational relevance over the whole-body exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kogel et al., 2021</xref>), owing to which, we chose nose-only exposure profile for this work. To limit the stress to the animals, a 1-hr exposure was chosen per day. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) on the lung digests from exposed and control animals and identified neutrophils and T cells, among others, as the major cell populations in the lung that were affected upon acute exposure. We were able to identify 29 gene targets that were commonly dysregulated among all our treatment groups upon aggregating results from the major lung cell types. These gene targets are the markers of early immune dysfunction upon e-cig aerosol exposure in vivo and could be studied in detail to understand temporal changes in their expression and function that may govern allergic responses and adverse pulmonary health outcomes upon acute and sub-acute exposures to e-cigarette aerosols.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exposure to e-cig aerosols results in flavor-dependent exposure to different metals and mild histological changes in vivo</title><p>This study was designed to characterize the effects of exposure to flavored e-cig aerosols at single-cell level to understand the immunological changes in the lung microenvironment.

Since all the commercially available e-liquids used in this study contained tobacco-derived nicotine (TDN), we first determined the levels of serum cotinine (a metabolite of nicotine) to prove successful exposure of the mice in each treatment group. As expected, we did not see any traces of cotinine in the serum of air and PG:VG exposed mice. Significant levels of cotinine were detected in the serum of mice exposed to fruit-, menthol-, and tobacco-flavored e-cig aerosols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), validating successful exposure of our test animals to TDN containing flavored e-cigs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flavor-dependent changes in the levels of quantified metals, but no major histological damage on acute exposure to flavored e-cig aerosol in C57BL/6J mice.</title><p>Schematics showing the exposure profile and experimental design to understand the effects of exposure to differently flavored (fruit, menthol, and tobacco) e-cig aerosols in the lungs of C57BL/6J mice using scRNA seq (<bold>A</bold>).

This acted as an indirect measure for characterizing the chemical properties of the aerosols used for exposure in this study. To monitor the release of metals into the mouse lungs, the aerosol condensate from each day of exposure was collected and the levels of select elements were detected using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). A detailed account of the concentrations of identified elements/metals is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. Interestingly, we identified flavor-dependent changes in the levels of metals like Ni, Zn, Na, K, and Cu on a day-to-day basis. Note, despite the use of the same wattage and temperature (max of 230°C) for generation of e-cig aerosols, the leaching of each metal varied per day of exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This is a crucial result as it highlights the importance of studying the impact of atomizer, coil composition, and design on the chemical composition of the generated aerosols. These variations might affect the risk and toxicity associated with each of these products, an area that has been recently explored by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Effah et al.,

the lung tissue sections to study the morphometric changes in the mouse lungs upon exposure to differently flavored e-cig aerosols. We did not find much evidence of tissue damage or airspace enlargement upon acute exposures in our model, as expected. However, we found evidence of increased alveolar septa thickening in the lungs of both male and female mice exposed to fruit-flavored e-cig aerosols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This could be a result of lower agarose inflation observed for the mouse lungs in this group. We had challenges/difficulties with inflating these mouse lungs. Owing to the lack of proper inflation, the lungs were in a collapsed state, which could be a probable explanation for our histological observation. Since this was not the prime focus of our study, we did not conduct further experiments to confirm our speculations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Detailed map of cellular composition during acute exposure to e-cig aerosols reveals distinct changes in immune cell phenotypes</title><p>As the principal focus of this study was to identify the flavor-dependent and independent effects upon exposure to commercially available e-cig aerosols at the single-cell level, we performed the scRNA seq on the mouse lungs from exposed and control mice.

However, the number of cells for the PG:VG group was very low (8102 cells) as compared to other treatments (~15,710 cells on average). We would like to report that this is an outcome of the low viability of this sample prior to scRNA seq, and not necessarily the effect of the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Differential gene expression analyses showed dysregulation of genes in all cell populations, but maximum effect was observed on the cells from immune cell clusters. This is not surprising, as the immune system, especially the myeloid cells, forms the frontline of the host’s defenses against external stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Del Fresno and Sancho, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Marshall et al., 2018</xref>). Compared to air, we observed a dysregulation of 553 genes (338 upregulated; 215 downregulated) in the myeloid cell cluster of mouse lungs exposed to tobacco-flavored e-cig aerosol. We identified 324 and 24 DEGs in the myeloid lung cluster from mouse lungs exposed to menthol- and fruit-flavored e-cig aerosols, respectively, as compared to air control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e–j</xref>).

Thus, we compared the effect of PG:VG alone in our study to make further comparisons between individual flavoring products with that of PG:VG only. DESeq2 analyses showed dysregulation of 276 genes in mouse lungs exposed to PG:VG alone in the myeloid cell cluster as compared to air controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>).

Furthermore, when compared to PG:VG, exposure to fruit, menthol, and tobacco-flavored e-cig aerosol dysregulated 262, 873, and 960 genes in the myeloid cluster and 37, 64, and 112 genes in the lymphoid cluster, respectively.

In addition to the groups mentioned in this manuscript, we also had two additional groups of TDN and tobacco-free nicotine. Though further objectives and experimentations performed in both these studies were varied, common air and PG:VG samples were used for analyses of cytokine/chemokine and cell count data as described in our previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lamb et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>E-cigs and associated products have constantly been under scrutiny by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) due to public health concerns. In February 2020, the FDA placed a regulation on all cartridge-based flavored e-cigs except for menthol and tobacco to reduce the use of e-cigs among adolescents and young adults. But it left a loophole for the sale of flavored (including menthol) disposable and open system e-cigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sindelar, 2020</xref>). Importantly, most e-cig-related bans in the US happened at the state level, thus allowing differential levels of restrictions imposed on the premarket tobacco applications and sales, which defeats the purpose of limiting their accessibility to the general public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhalerao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azagba et al., 2023</xref>). In fact, the use of nicotine-containing e-cigs among youth and associated policy restrictions has recently been found to be linked to unintended increase in traditional cigarette use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 2025</xref>). Each year, new products are introduced in the market with newer device designs and properties to lure the users (adults between the ages of 18–24 years), which makes it crucial to continue with the assessments of toxicity and health effects of e-cigs in an unbiased manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kramarow and Elgaddal, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Numerous studies indicate increased oxidative stress, DNA damage, and loss of neutrophil function due to exposure to e-cig aerosols in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Muthumalage et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lamb et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lamb et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Corriden et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jasper et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ren et al., 2022</xref>). However, we do not have much knowledge about the cell populations and biological signaling mechanisms that are most affected upon exposure to differently flavored e-cig aerosols at a single-cell level. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we studied the transcriptional changes in the inflammatory responses due to acute (1 hr nose-only exposure including 120 puffs for 5 consecutive days) exposure to fruit-, menthol-, and tobacco-flavored e-cig aerosols using single-cell technology. Short-term (2 hr/day for 3 or 5 consecutive days) e-cigarette exposure studies conducted by others and our group have shown an increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers in both pulmonary and vascular tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kuntic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2020c</xref>). Since nose-only exposures are more direct than whole-body, we reduced the daily exposures of mice to 1 hr for 5 consecutive days. This dose and duration were found to show sex-dependent changes in MMP-2 and -9 activity and expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lamb et al., 2023</xref>). Prior literature formed the basis of the current study to assess the effect of acute exposure to differently flavored e-cig aerosols on the lung cell population using a nose-only exposure system.</p><p>Reports indicate that the release of metal ions due to the burning of metal coil is a major source of variation during e-cig exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alcantara et al., 2023</xref>). A 2021 study reported the presence of 21 elements in the pod atomizers from different manufacturers identifying a high abundance of 11 elements including nickel, iron, zinc, and sodium among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Omaiye et al., 2021</xref>). Previous studies have also shown the presence of similar elements in the e-cig aerosols which could have a possible adverse health effect on the vapers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Olmedo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rastian et al., 2022</xref>). More importantly, our study points toward a very important issue, which pertains to the product design of the e-cig vapes. We believe that the aerosol composition varies based on the type of atomizer, coil resistance, coil composition, and chemical reactivity of the e-liquid being used. While much work is done on the chemical composition of the flavors and e-liquids, the other aspects of device design remain understudied and must be an area of research in the future. In fact, a recent publication by our group emphasizes this aspect of product design by studying the exposure profile from low- and high-resistance coil in an e-cig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Effah et al., 2025</xref>). Another factor that may limit the interpretation of our results pertains to the correlation between the leached metal and the observed transcriptional changes. Since our study provides proof of day-to-day variation in the leaching of metal ions from the same liquid using the same atomizer in the emitted aerosols, it could be possible to develop a statistical model correlating the differential metal exposure to the gene expression changes to get a good assessment of the dose of each toxicant deposited on the lung surface, which has not been done in this study. This raises a pertinent question about what parameters should be controlled to design a comparative study between different flavors of e-cigs in the market per the standards of particle distribution and characteristics. Flavor-dependent variations in daily leaching of metals from an e-cig coil may result in variable deposition of toxicants onto the epithelial lining of both mouth and lungs in frequent vapers. Thus, future studies need to consider conditions like flavor, wattage, coil resistance, coil composition, and atomizer life when designing in vitro and in vivo studies to deduce the acute and chronic toxicities of vaping in humans.</p><p>E-cig vaping has been known to affect the innate and adaptive immune responses among vapers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jasper et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kalininskiy et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rebuli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reidel et al., 2018</xref>), but flavor-specific effects on immune function are not fully explored. While we expected to see flavor-dependent changes in our experiment, we did not anticipate observing interesting sex-dependent variation in the lung tissues using flow cytometry. In this respect, recent studies show concurring evidence suggesting sex-specific changes in lung inflammation, mitochondrial damage, gene expression, and even DNA methylation in mice exposed to e-cig aerosols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Song et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chirumamilla et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>It is important to highlight here that while the changes in macrophage and neutrophil frequencies ascertained by scRNA seq corroborate with that observed using flow cytometry, similar correlation was not observed for the CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell data. The possible explanation for such a discrepancy could be high gene dropout rates in scRNA seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Qiu, 2020</xref>), different analytical resolution for the two techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Palit et al., 2019</xref>), and pooling of samples in our single-cell workflow. Also, while we were able to identify some interesting changes in the eosinophil population within the lungs upon exposure to e-cigs using our flow cytometry data, we could not identify a cluster for eosinophils in our scRNA seq dataset. This could be due to the loss of this cell type during the sample preparation during scRNA seq capture or filtering out as empty droplets during data analyses. Theoretically, eosinophils are known to have lower RNA content and express fewer numbers of genes, which may result in them being identified as empty droplets and removed when running Cell Ranger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goss et al., 2025</xref>). Despite the lack of data from scRNA seq, our findings are of relevance as an increased neutrophilic, but a decreased eosinophilic response is characteristic of severe inflammation, infection, and asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jukema et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Flinkman et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lourda et al., 2021</xref>). Further probing into the role of these two cell types in shaping the immune landscape within the lung upon e-cig aerosol exposure is paramount in understanding the specific toxicities and impact of each e-cig flavor on human health and well-being.</p><p>One of the most interesting discoveries from our single-cell analyses was the identification of a cluster of immature neutrophils without Ly6G surface marker. While we observed an increase in the cell percentages of these cells in our treatment groups, little to no change in the gene expression was noted (data not shown), which could be indicative of impaired function of mature neutrophil population, a fate being reported by various previous studies pertaining to e-cig exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Madison et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kalininskiy et al., 2021</xref>). In fact, our study identified (a) a moderate increase in the neutrophil count in menthol- and tobacco-flavored e-cig aerosol treated mouse lungs through scRNA seq analyses, (b) corroboration of the findings from scRNA seq using flow cytometry with more pronounced increase in Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils for male menthol-flavored e-cig aerosol exposed mice, and (c) identification of decreased co-localization for Ly6G and S100A8 in the lungs of tobacco-flavored e-cig aerosols as compared to air control through co-immunostaining. Ly6G is an important marker of neutrophil recruitment and maturation in mammalian cells and has been reported in relation to various bacterial and parasitic infections in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deniset et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kleinholz et al., 2021</xref>). Of note, this cluster did not express <italic>SiglecF</italic> and had high expression of other neutrophil markers including <italic>S100A8/9</italic>, <italic>Lcn2</italic>, and <italic>Il1b</italic>, thus negating the possibility of eosinophils being misrepresented as ‘Ly6G<sup>−</sup> neutrophils’ in our analyses.</p><p>S100A8 acts as damage-associated molecular patterns and is responsible for neutrophil activation and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sprenkeler et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo et al., 2021</xref>). While scRNA seq results in our study identified expression of S100A8/A9 genes in both neutrophil clusters – Ly6G<sup>+</sup> and Ly6G<sup>−</sup>, the expression of <italic>Ly6G</italic> was totally absent for clusters identified as Ly6G<sup>−</sup>. Co-immunoprecipitation results also showed expression of both S100A8 and Ly6G markers within the lungs of treated and control lungs, but the co-localization of the two markers was more prominent in the control lungs, thus pointing toward a possible shift in the neutrophil function and activity upon exposure to e-cig aerosols. We are not the first to report the Ly6G deficiency among neutrophils. Previous work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deniset et al., 2017</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kleinholz et al., 2021</xref> has highlighted the importance of Ly6G deficiency in relation to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deniset et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kleinholz et al., 2021</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deniset et al., 2017</xref> study reported the presence of two populations of neutrophils in the splenic tissue of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> infected mice, based on the Ly6G expression – Ly6G<sup>high</sup> and Ly6G<sup>intermediate</sup>. They found that while the former corresponds to mature neutrophils with ability of tissue migration and bacterial clearance, the latter constitutes the immature, immobile pool of neutrophils responsible for proliferation and replenishment of the mature pool of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deniset et al., 2017</xref>). The later study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kleinholz et al., 2021</xref> demonstrated decreased uptake of <italic>Leishmania major</italic> in Ly6G-deficient mice, thus leading to delayed recruitment to and pathogen capture by neutrophils at the site of infection. Taken together, these studies provide evidence for a protective/compensatory role of the loss of Ly6G in the neutrophil population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kleinholz et al., 2021</xref>). This, in addition to the recent findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jasper et al., 2024</xref> where neutrophils from healthy volunteers demonstrated a reduction in neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytic function, and NET formation upon exposure to e-cig aerosols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jasper et al., 2024</xref>), points toward a probable shift in the neutrophil dynamics upon exposure to e-cig aerosols. It is important to mention here that though our results from co-immunostaining using Ly6G and S100A8 pointed toward a shift in innate immune responses upon exposure to e-cig aerosols, it must not be confused with them being only expressed by neutrophil population. S100A8 is expressed in myeloid population including neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Averill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), and a subgroup of eosinophils is also known to express Ly6G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mair et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, an in-depth characterization of these identified populations is important to understand the cellular and molecular responses toward e-cig aerosol exposure in vivo.</p><p>The myeloid and lymphoid limbs of immunity are interconnected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shanker and Marincola, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carroll and Prodeus, 1998</xref>). In our study, we find an incidental shift in the neutrophil dynamics in menthol- and tobacco-flavored e-cig exposed mouse lungs. In contrast, we report an increase in the T-cell responses in the form of increased CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from both scRNA seq and flow cytometric analyses in male mice. In fact, increased expression of genes including <italic>Malt1</italic>, <italic>Serpinb9b</italic>, and <italic>Sema4c</italic> is indicative of enhanced T-cell-mediated immune response in the lungs of mice exposed to fruit (mango) flavored e-cig aerosols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2020d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bird et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beland et al., 2014</xref>). Contrary to this, exposure to menthol-flavored e-cig aerosols had a much milder effect on the lymphoid population within the lungs of C57BL/6J mice. We found evidence for increased lymphoid cell proliferation due to activation of cyclin-dependent protein kinase signaling mediated via expression of genes including <italic>Cdk8</italic> and <italic>Camk1d</italic> in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Szilagyi and Gustafsson, 2013</xref>). Exposure to tobacco-flavored e-cig aerosol provided evidence for decreased chaperone-mediated protein folding, due to the downregulation of Chaperonin Containing TCP-1 (CCT) family of proteins. Chaperonin Containing TCP-1 proteins are important to regulate the production of native actin, tubulin, and other proteins crucial for cell cycle progression and cytoskeletal organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brackley and Grantham, 2009</xref>). This is in conjunction with the upregulation of <italic>Klra4</italic> and <italic>Klra8</italic> that is indicative of increased protein misfolding and cytotoxic responses in the lymphoid cells of tobacco-exposed e-cig aerosols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bolanos and Tripathy, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Overall, we provide evidence of altered innate immune responses due to variable neutrophilic–eosinophilic function and increased T-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity in a flavor-dependent manner upon exposure to e-cig aerosols in this study. An increase in the levels of CCL17, CCL20, CCL22, IL2, and Eotaxin in the lung digests from tobacco-exposed mouse lungs further supports this deduction as these cytokines/chemokines are associated with T-cell-mediated immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Israr et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ross and Cantrell, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rapp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jinquan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chia et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Böttcher et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, CXCL16 attracts T cells and natural killer cells to activate cell death. It is involved in LPS-mediated acute lung injury, an outcome which has also been linked with e-cig exposures in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Christiani, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Further, we compiled a list of commonly dysregulated genes in a flavor-independent manner and identified 29 gene targets. Signal-transducing adaptor protein-2 (<italic>Stap1</italic>), which is commonly upregulated upon exposure to e-cig aerosols, is known to regulate T-cell activation and airway inflammation, which is in agreement with the overall outcome of our findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kagohashi et al., 2024</xref>). Another gene that was found to be consistently dysregulated in many cell types was cold-inducible RNA binding protein (<italic>Cirbp</italic>). <italic>Cirbp</italic> is a stress response protein linked with stressors like hypoxia. Its upregulation upon e-cig exposure supports that vaping induces oxidative stress and can have adverse implications on the exposed cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhu et al., 2024</xref>). Importantly, this gene is involved in DNA repair mechanisms, thus making it crucial for cell survival pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Firsanov et al., 2025</xref>). 5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C (<italic>Htr2c</italic>) and <italic>Klra8</italic> are other genes in this category of commonly dysregulated genes that are associated with enhancing inflammation and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bolanos and Tripathy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mikulski et al., 2010</xref>). Overall, we provide a cell-specific resource of immune responses upon exposure to differently flavored e-cig aerosols.</p><p>Considering that scRNA technology has not been commonly used for e-cig research, ours is one of the first studies employing this technique to identify possible changes in the cellular composition and gene expressions. Importantly, we use the nose-only exposure system for our experiment to avoid exposure through other routes. However, despite the novel approach and state-of-the-art exposure system, we had a few limitations. First, we used a small sample size to identify the changes in the mouse lungs upon exposure to e-cig aerosols at a single-cell level. Due to the expensive nature of single-cell sequencing technology and limited information in the literature, we chose to design this experiment with small sizes of experimental and validation cohorts. But, based on the encouraging findings from this study, future studies could be designed with a larger sample size, longer durations of exposure, and more targeted approach to identify the acute and chronic effects of vaping in vivo. Second, we could not expand upon the sex-dependent changes observed through our work upon exposure. This was because such an effect was not anticipated when we conceived the idea of a short-term exposure in mice. However, considering the evidence from the current study, future experimental designs in our lab are considering sex as a crucial confounder for studying the effects of e-cig exposure in translational contexts. Third, the inclusion of PG:VG + Nic group was streamlined in this study, but in future work, the inclusion of this group for scRNA seq analyses to delineate the effects of nicotine alone on gene transcription is necessary. Fourth, we did not anticipate changes in the metal release on consecutive days of exposure at the start of our study. Later, our data pointed toward the importance of device design in e-cig exposures. Future studies need to identify the factors that may affect the daily composition of e-cig aerosols and devise a method of better monitoring these possible confounders. However, in this regard, our experiment does mimic the real-life scenario, as such variations due to prolonged storage of e-liquid and differences arising due to vape design must be common among human vapers.</p><p>In conclusion, this study identified cell-specific changes in the gene expressions characterized by altered neutrophil dynamics and accentuated T-cell cytotoxicity upon exposure to tobacco-flavored e-cig aerosols using single-cell technology. Furthermore, a set of top 29 dysregulated genes was identified that could be studied as markers of toxicity/immune dysfunction in e-cig research. Future work with larger sample sizes and sex distribution is warranted to understand the health impacts of long-term use of these novel products in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Rigor and reproducibility statement</title><p>All experiments were designed to ensure rigor and reproducibility through inclusion of appropriate controls, randomization, blinding, and replication.

Thereafter, the animals were moved to the mouse Inhalation Facility at URMC for training and exposures.</p><p>One week prior to the start of the exposures, mice underwent a 5-day nose-only training to adapt themselves to the mesh restraints of the exposure tower. The mouse restraint durations were increased gradually to minimize the animal’s stress and discomfort. Of note, the mouse sacrifice was performed within 8–12 weeks’ age for each mouse group to ensure that the mouse age corresponds to the age of adolescents (12–17 years) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dutta and Sengupta, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jackson et al., 2017</xref>).

Both air and PG:VG exposed mice groups were considered as controls for this experiment. We used commercially available propylene glycol (PG; EC Blend) and vegetable glycerin (VG; EC Blend) in equal volumes to prepare a 50:50 solution of PG:VG. For flavored product exposures, mice were exposed to three different e-liquids – a menthol flavor ‘Menthol-Mint’, a fruit flavor ‘Mango’ and a tobacco flavor ‘Cuban Blend’. Of note, all the e-liquids were commercially manufactured with 50 mg/ml of TDN. So, all treatments have nicotine in addition to the flavoring mentioned, respectively. Additionally, we used a mixture of PG:VG with 50 mg/ml of TDN as a control for limited experiments to study the effect of nicotine alone in our treatment. This group is labeled PG:VG + Nic for the rest of the manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>E-cigarette exposure</title><p>Scireq Flexiware software with the InExpose Inhalation system was used for controlling the Joyetech eVic-VTC mini device to perform nose-only mouse exposures. For this exposure, we utilized a puffing profile that mimicked the puffing topography of e-cig users in two puffs per minute with a puff volume of 51 ml, puff duration of 3 s, and an inter-puff interval of 27 s with a 2-l/min bias flow between puffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee et al., 2018a</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> depicts the experimental design and exposure system employed for this study.</p><p>Age-matched male and female (<italic>n</italic> = 5 per sex) mice were used for each group, namely, air, PG:VG, fruit, menthol, and tobacco. To ensure rigor and reproducibility in our work, we have used age- and sex-matched control and treated mice in this study. Confounders like environment and stress were minimized by housing all the cages in environmentally controlled conditions and training all the mice (both control and treated) in nose-only chambers. Each group of mice was exposed to the above-mentioned puffing profile for 1 hr each day (120 puffs) for a total of five consecutive days. Additionally, a group of mice (<italic>n</italic> = 3/sex) was exposed to PG:VG + Nic for the same duration using similar exposure profile to serve as control to assess the effect of nicotine on the observed changes using selected experiments. Air-exposed mice were exposed to the same puffing profile for a total of five consecutive days to ambient air. We recorded the temperature, humidity, and CO levels of the aerosols generated at the start, mid, and end of the exposure on each day using the Q-Trak Indoor Air Quality Monitor 7575 (TSI, Shoreview, MN). Total particulate matter (TPM) sampling was done from the exhaust tubing of the setup at the 30 min mark of the exposure and at the inlet connected to the nose-only tower (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) immediately after the culmination of the exposure.

Vascular lung perfusion was performed using 3 ml of saline before harvesting the lung lobes for preparation of single-cell suspension. It is important to mention here that of the 5 lung samples/sex/group; 2/ sex/group were used for histological assessments and scRNA analyses. Here, the left lung lobe was inflated using low-melting agarose and used for histology, while the rest of the uninflated lung lobes were used for preparing the single-cell suspension. We pooled the lung lobes for each sex per group for preparation of the single-cell suspension as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. The lung lobes were weighed and digested using the Liberase method as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaur, 2024</xref>). Briefly, lung lobes were weighed and digested using Liberase (Cat# 5401127001; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) enzymatic cocktail with 1% DNase. The tubes were then transferred to the gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi, Gaithersburg, MD) and the manufacturer’s protocol for mouse lung digestion was run.

Air was used as control and several flavors (fruit, menthol, tobacco) were tested. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified for each group and compared against the air control.

Overall, our purpose to present this data is to provide the scRNA seq results as a resource to a wider community. We have used techniques like flow cytometry, multianalyte cytokine array and immunofluorescence to validate some of the results. We agree with the reviewer that we were unable to rightly point out the significance of our findings with the immunofluorescent stain in the previous edit. We have revised the manuscript and included the quantification for both Ly6G+ and S100A8+ cells in e-cig aerosol exposed and control lung tissues. Briefly, we identified a marked decrease in the staining for S100A8 (marker for neutrophil activation) in tobacco-flavored e-cig exposed mouse lungs as compared to controls. Upon considering the corroborating evidence from scRNA seq and flow cytometry with regards to increased neutrophil percentages in experimental group and lowered staining for active neutrophils using immunofluorescence, we speculate that exposure to e-cig (tobacco) aerosols may alter the neutrophil dynamics within the lungs. Also, co-immunofluorescence identified a more prominent co-localization of the two markers in control samples as compared to the treatment group which points towards some changes in the innate immune milieu within the lungs upon exposures. Future work is required to validate these speculations.</p><p>We have now discussed all the above-mentioned points in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript and toned down our conclusions regarding sex-dependent changes from scRNA seq data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear what the meaning of Fig. 3A and B is, since these numbers only reflect the number of cells captured in the scRNAseq experiment and are not biologically meaningful. Flow cytometry quantification is presented as cell counts, but the percentage of cells from the CD45+ gate should be shown. No statistical analysis is shown, and flow cytometry results do not support the conclusions of scRNAseq data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. However, we would like to highlight that scRNA seq and flow cytometry may show similar trends but cannot be identical as one relies on cell surface markers (protein) for identification of cell types, while other is dependent on the transcriptomic signatures to identify the cell types. In our data, for the myeloid cells (alveolar macrophages and neutrophils), the scRNA and flow cytometry data match in trend. However, the trends do not match with respect to the lymphoid cells being studied (CD4 and CD8 T cells). The possible explanation for such a finding could be possible high gene dropout rates in scRNA seq, different analytical resolution for the two techniques and pooling of samples in our single cell workflow. We realize these shortcomings in our analyses and mention it clearly in the discussion as limitation of our work. It is important to note also that cell frequencies identified in scRNA seq just provide wide and indistinct indications which need to be further validated, which we tried to accomplish in our work to some degree. Our flow-based results clearly highlight the sex-specific variations in the immune cell percentages (something we could not have anticipated earlier). In future studies, we will include more replicates to tease out sex-based variations upon acute and chronic exposure to e-cig aerosols.</p><p>We have now replotted the graphs in Fig 3A and B and plotted the flow quantification as the percentage of total CD45+ cells. The gating strategy for the flow plots is also included as Figure S6 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>This study provides some interesting observations on how different flavour e-cigarettes can affect lung immunology; however, there are numerous flaws, including a low replicate number and a lack of effective validation methods, meaning findings may not be repeated. This is a revised article but several weaknesses remain related to the analysis and interpretation of the data.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strength of the study is the successful scRNA-seq experiment which gives some preliminary data that can be used to create new hypotheses in this area.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although some text weaknesses have been addressed since resubmission, other specific weaknesses remain: The major weakness is the n-number and analysis methods. Two biological n per group is not acceptable to base any solid conclusions. Any validatory data was too little (only cell % data) and not always supporting the findings (e.g. figure 3D does not match 3B/4A). Other examples include:</p><p>There aren't enough cells to justify analysis - only 300-1500 myeloid cells per group with not many of these being neutrophils or the apparent 'Ly6G- neutrophils'.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment, but we disagree with the reviewer in terms of the justification of analyses. All the flavored e-cig aerosol groups were compared with air controls to deduce the outcomes in the current study. We already acknowledge low sample quality for PGVG group and have only included the comparisons with PGVG upon reviewer’s request which is open to interpretation by the reader.</p><p>By that measure, each treatment group (except PGVG group) has over 1000 cells with 24777 genes being analyzed for each cell type, which by the standards of single cell is sufficient. We understand that this strategy should not be used for detection of rare cell populations, which was neither the purpose of this manuscript nor was attempted. We conduct comparisons of broader cell types and mention more samples need to be added in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>As for the Ly6G neutrophil category, we don’t only base our results on scRNA analyses but also perform co-immunofluorescence and multi-analyte analyses and use evidence from previous literature to back our outcome. To avoid over-stating our results we have revamped the whole manuscript and ensured to tone down our results with relation to the presence of Ly6G- neutrophils. We do understand that more work is required in the future, but our work clearly shows the shift in neutrophil dynamics upon exposure which should be reported, in our opinion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The dynamic range of RNA measurement using scRNAseq is known to be limited - how do we know whether genes are not expressed or just didn't hit detection? This links into the Ly6G negative neutrophil comments, but in general the lack of gene expression in this kind of data should be viewed with caution, especially with a low n number and few cells. The data in the entire paper is not strong enough to base any solid conclusion - it is not just the RNA-sequencing data.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge this to be a valid point and have revamped the manuscript and toned down our conclusions. However, such limitations exist with any scRNA seq dataset and so must be interpreted accordingly by the readers. We do understand that due to the low cell counts and the limitations with scRNA seq we should not perform DESeq2 analyses for Ly6G+ versus Ly6G- neutrophil categories, which was never attempted at the first place. However, our results with co-immunofluorescence, multianalyte assay and scRNA expression analyses in myeloid cluster do point towards a shift in neutrophil activation which needs to be further investigated. Furthermore, Ly6G deficiency has been linked to immature neutrophils in many previous studies and is not an unlikely outcome that needs to be treated with immense skepticism.</p><p>We wish to make this dataset available as a resource to influence future research. We are aware of its limitations and have been transparent with regards to our experimental design, capture strategy, the quality of obtained results, and possible caveats to make it is open for discussion by the readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is no data supporting the presence of Ly6G negative neutrophils. In the flow cytometry only Ly6G+ cells are shown with no evidence of Ly6G negative neutrophils (assuming equal CD11b expression). There is no new data to support this claim since resubmission and the New figures 4C and D actually show there are no Ly6G negative cells - the cells that the authors deem Ly6G negative are actually positive - but the red overlay of S100A8 is so strong it blocks out the green signal - looking to the Ly6G single stains (green only) you can see that the reported S100A8+Ly6G- cells all have Ly6G (with different staining intensities).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this query and do understand the skepticism. We have now quantified the data to provide more clarity for interpretation. As we were using paraffin embedded tissues, some autofluorescence is expected which could explain some of reviewer’s concerns. However we expect that the inclusion of better quality images and quantification must address some of the concerns raised by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Eosinophils are heavily involved in lung macrophage biology, but are missing from the analysis - it is highly likely the RNA-sequence picked out eosinophils as Ly6G- neutrophils rather than 'digestion issues' the authors claim</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising a valid concern. However, the Ly6G- cluster cannot be eosinophils in our case. Literature suggests SiglecF as an important biomarker of eosinophils which was absent in the Ly6G- cluster our in scRNA seq analyses as shown in File S18 and Figure 6B of the revised manuscript. We have now provided a detailed explanation (Lines 476-488; 503-506) of the observed results pertaining to eosinophil population in the revised manuscript to further address some of the concerns raised by this reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>After author comments, it appears the schematic in Figure 1A is misleading and there are not n=2/group/sex but actually only n=1/group/sex (as shown in Figure 6A). Meaning the n number is even lower than the previous assumption.</p></disp-quote><p>We concur with reviewers’ valid concern and so are willing to provide this data as a resource for a wider audience to assist future work. Pooling of samples have been practiced by many groups previously to save resources and expense. We did it for the very same reason. It may not be the preferred approach, but it still has its merit considering the vast amount of cell-specific data generated using this strategy. To avoid overstating our results we have ensured to maintain transparency in our reporting and acknowledge all the limitations of this study.</p><p>We do not believe that the strength of scRNA seq lies in drawing conclusive results, but to tease our possible targets and direction that need to be validated with more work. In that respect, our study does identify the target cell types and biological processes which could be of importance for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>This work aims to establish cell-type specific changes in gene expression upon exposure to different flavors of commercial e-cigarette aerosols compared to control or vehicle.

However, we would like to emphasize that chronic exposure was never the intention of this study. We wished to design a study for acute nose-only exposure owing to which the study duration was left shorter. Shorter durations limit the stress and discomfort to the animal. The in vivo study using nose-only exposure regimen is still developing with multiple exposure regimen being used by different groups. To our knowledge there is no gold standard of e-cig aerosol exposure which is widely accepted other than the CORESTA recommendations, which we followed. Also, we show in our study how the daily exposure to leached metals vary in a flavor-dependent manner thus validating that exposure regime does need more attention in terms of equal dosing, particle distribution and composition- something we have started doing in our future studies. We have included all the explanations in the revised manuscript (Lines 82-85, 425-435, 648-654).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several claims lack supporting evidence or use data that is not statistically significant.

We have now revamped the whole manuscript and toned down most of the sex-based conclusions stated in this work. Having said that, it is important to note that most of the work relying solely on scRNA seq, as is the case for this study, is observational in nature and needs to be assessed bearing this in mind.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the paper and its discussion are relatively surface-level and do not delve into the significance of the findings or how they fit into the bigger picture of the field.

We have now addressed this query briefly in Lines 82-85, 425-435, 648-654 of the revised manuscript. We would like to add, however, that we intend to design a study for acute nose-only exposure for this project. Shorter durations limit the stress and discomfort to the animal, owing to which a duration of 1hour per day was chosen. The in vivo study using nose-only exposure regimen is still developing with multiple exposure regimen being used by different groups. Ours is one such study in that direction just intended to identify cell-specific changes upon exposure. Considering our results in Figure 1B showing variations in the level of metals leached in each flavor per day, the appropriate exposure regimen to design a controlled, reproducible experiment needs to be discussed. There could be room for improvement in our strategy, but this was the best regimen that we found to be appropriate per the literature and our prior knowledge in the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The presentation of cell counts should be represented by a percentage/proportion rather than a raw number of cells. Without normalization to the total number of cells, comparisons cannot be made across groups/conditions. This comment applies to several figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editor for this comment and have now made the requested change in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We appreciate that the authors have taken the reviewers' advice to validate their findings. However, we have concerns regarding the immunofluorescent staining shown in Figure 4. If the red channel is showing a pan-neutrophil marker (S100A8) and the green channel is showing only a subset of neutrophils (LY6G+), then the green channel should have far less signal than the red channel. This expected pattern is not what is shown in the figure, with the Ly6G marker apparently showing more expression than S100A8. Additionally, the FACS data states that only 4-5% of cells are neutrophils, but the red channel co-localizes with far more than 4-5% of the DAPI stain, meaning this population is overrepresented, potentially due to background fluorescence (noise). In addition, some of the shapes in the staining pattern do not look like true neutrophils, although it is difficult to tell because there remains a lot of background staining. The authors need to verify that their S100A8 and Ly6G antibodies work and are specific to the populations they intend to target. It is possible that only the brightest spots are truly S100A8+ or Ly6G+.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editor for this comment and acknowledge that we may have made broad generalizations in our interpretation of our data previously. We have now revisited the data and quantified the two fluorescence for better interpretation of our results. We have also reassessed our conclusions from this data and reworded the manuscript accordingly. Briefly we believe that Ly6G deficiency could be an indication of the presence of immature neutrophils in the lungs. This is a common process of neutrophil maturation. An active neutrophil population has Ly6G and should also express S100A8 indicating a normal neutrophilic response against stressors. However, our results, despite some autofluorescence which is common with lung tissues, shows a marked decline in the S100A8+ cells in the lung of tobacco-flavored e-cig aerosol exposed mice as compared to air controls. We also do not see prominent co-localization of the two markers in exposed group thus proving a shift in neutrophil dynamics which requires further investigation. We would also like to mention here that S100A8 is predominantly expressed in neutrophils, but is also expressed by monocytes and macrophages, so that could explain the over-representation of these cells in our immunofluorescence results. We have now included this in the Discussion section (Lines 489- 538) of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Paraffin sections do not always yield the best immunostaining results and the images themselves are low magnification and low resolution.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the editor that paraffin sections may not yield best results, we have worked on the final figure to improve the quality of the displayed results and zoomed-in some parts of the merged image to show the differences in the co-localization patterns for the two markers in our treated and control groups for easier interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please change the scale bars to white so they are more visible in each channel.</p></disp-quote><p>The merged image in Figure 6C now has a white scale bar.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We appreciate that this is a preliminary test used as a resource for the community, but there is interesting biology regarding immune cells that warrants DEG analysis by the authors.
