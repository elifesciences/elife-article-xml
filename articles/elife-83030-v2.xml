Inherited and acquired T cell deficiencies are associated with PML. The incidence of PML is increasing with the introduction of new immunomodulatory agents, several of which target T cells or B cells. PML patients often carry mutations in the JCPyV VP1 capsid protein, which confer resistance to neutralizing VP1 antibodies (Ab). Polyomaviruses (PyV) are tightly species-specific; the absence of tractable animal models has handicapped understanding PyV pathogenesis. Using mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), we found that T cell deficiency during persistent infection, in the setting of monospecific VP1 Ab, was required for outgrowth of VP1 Ab-escape viral variants. CD4 T cells were primarily responsible for limiting polyomavirus infection in the kidney, a major reservoir of persistent infection by both JCPyV and MuPyV, and checking emergence of these mutant viruses. T cells also provided a second line of defense by controlling the outgrowth of VP1 mutant viruses that evaded Ab neutralization. A virus with two capsid mutations, one conferring Ab-escape yet impaired infectivity and a second compensatory mutation, yielded a highly neurovirulent variant. These findings link T cell deficiency and evolution of Ab-escape polyomavirus VP1 variants with neuropathogenicity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>polyomavirus</kwd><kwd>antibody escape</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>neurovirulence</kwd><kwd>T cell deficiency</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01NS088367</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lukacher</surname><given-names>Aron E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01NS092662</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lukacher</surname><given-names>Aron E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35NS127217</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lukacher</surname><given-names>Aron E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Loss of T cell control during persistent polyomavirus infection, in the setting of a limited antiviral antibody response, facilitates emergence of antibody-escape viruses carrying the potential for neurovirulence.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antibodies (Ab) are critical components of immune defense against viral pathogens and key mediators of immune control during persistent infections. Evasion of antibodies, particularly in settings of limited antibody diversity, is a potent selective pressure for viral mutations. Notably, outgrowth of escape variants is an Achillesâ heel for monoclonal antibody (mAb) antiviral intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caskey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Caskey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mehandru et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Toma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Trkola et al., 2005</xref>). Viral evolution within a host gives rise to variants that become subject to selection for resistance to antiviral antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Inuzuka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kinchen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lynch et al., 2015</xref>). For viruses that establish persistent infection, viral variants can accumulate over time and increase the likelihood for emergence of viruses carrying mutations that escape recognition by neutralizing Ab. Polyomaviruses (PyV) persist lifelong in their hosts in a âsmolderingâ infectious state, a lifestyle conducive for viral evolution even by a DNA virus that commandeers the high-fidelity host cell DNA polymerase. Indeed, the human BK and JC polyomaviruses have been shown to exist as quasispecies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Van Loy et al., 2015</xref>). Whether PyV variants are sculpted by antiviral Abs to escape humoral immunity is an open question.</p><p>JCPyV causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a frequently fatal demyelinating brain disease associated with T cell immunosuppression resulting from HIV/AIDS, organ transplant immunosuppressants, and certain chemotherapeutic and immunomodulatory therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cortese et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pavlovic et al., 2018</xref>). Typically identified by MRI following the onset of neurologic symptoms, PML is diagnosed at a point when limited treatment options exist and patients suffer permanent CNS damage. Defining the early stages of disease involved in the transition of JCPyV from a kidney to brain pathogen would facilitate earlier detection and therapeutic intervention before the development of neurologic disease. Prolonged immune suppression is a necessary antecedent for PML. For instance, high risk for natalizumab-associated PML involves infusion therapy for &gt;24 months and a history of immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berger and Fox, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bloomgren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fox and Rudick, 2012</xref>). This long period of immune suppression before clinical disease manifests raises the possibility that variants of JCPyV, including those with neurovirulent potential, may emerge over time. Iatrogenic T cell and B cell ablation therapies have independently been associated with PML. Lacking is a conceptual connection between T cell deficiency, B cell deficiency, and prolonged immune suppression in JCPyV evolution that could lead to outgrowth of neurovirulent JCPyV variants.</p><p>PML is characterized by emergence of mutations in the major capsid protein, VP1, of JCPyV, which are not found in the circulating (i.e., archetype) strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gorelik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zheng et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al., 2005a</xref>). The nonenveloped icosahedral viral capsid is comprised of the VP1 protein assembled into 72 pentamers. VP1 mediates attachment to cellular receptors via its four solvent-exposed loops; these loops are also the dominant targets of the hostâs neutralizing Ab response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lindner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Neu et al., 2010</xref>). JCPyV-PML VP1 mutations, which are situated in these loops, mediate resistance to neutralizing antibodies, but also alter receptor binding and viral tropism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Geoghegan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gorelik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jelcic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lauver et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maginnis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ray et al., 2015</xref>). Sera from PML patients, as well as some healthy individuals, fail to neutralize particular JCPyV-PML VP1 mutations, despite these individuals having high antibody titers against WT JCPyV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ray et al., 2015</xref>). The conditions that lead to the outgrowth of these variants in PML patients remain poorly understood, in part due to the lack of animal models for studying the early stages of JCPyV pathogenesis.</p><p>Because PyVs only replicate in their host species, we developed mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV) as a model for JCPyV pathogenesis and immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayers et al., 2021</xref>). MuPyV shares several features with JCPyV, including asymptomatic disease in immunocompetent hosts, the kidney as a dominant reservoir of virus persistence, and control by virus-specific T cells. Although both viruses bind to cell surface sialylated glycan receptors, the attachment receptor for JCPyV is the oligosaccharide lactoseries tetrasaccharide c, whereas MuPyV binds the gangliosides GD1a and GT1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Neu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsai et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>We previously identified a neutralizing mAb against MuPyV VP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Swimm et al., 2010</xref>). The epitope for this mAb is the dominant target of the endogenous VP1 Ab response in mice. Importantly, this mAb failed to recognize several VP1 mutations introduced into WT MuPyV that mapped to mutations seen in JCPyV isolates from PML patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lauver et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we utilized passive immunization with this MuPyV VP1 mAb in mice lacking endogenous Abs to model the emergence of VP1 variant viruses under conditions of a limited antiviral Ab response. We found that T cell loss during persistent infection in these mice led to outgrowth of MuPyV variants carrying mutations in similar regions of the external VP1 loops to those seen in PML patients. Although an array of VP1 mutations arose in the kidneys in T-cell-depleted mice, the primary driver selecting replication-competent mutant viruses, including rare neuropathogenic variants, was evasion of Ab neutralization. With the MuPyV infection model, we provide evidence that T cell deficiency, coupled with limited Ab coverage of VP1 epitopes, are both required for outgrowth of Ab-escape viral variants, including those with a potential for neurovirulence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>T cell deficiency during persistent infection leads to outgrowth of antibody-resistant virus variants</title><p>We demonstrated that Ab-escape VP1 mutations emerge after serial passage of wild type (WT) MuPyV (strain A2) in host cells in the presence of a VP1-specific neutralizing mAb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lauver et al., 2020</xref>). To ask whether VP1 antibody-escape mutations similarly arise in vivo, we passively immunized B-cell-deficient Î¼MT mice with this VP1-specific mAb (clone 8A7H5) to model an inability to neutralize a frequent VP1 mutation seen among the JCPyV VP1 mutations in PML patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ray et al., 2015</xref>). Î¼MT mice infected subcutaneously (s.c.) via the hind footpad developed high-titer chronic viremia, which was efficiently controlled by injection of VP1 mAb starting at 4 days post-infection (dpi) and continuing weekly thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1AâB</xref>). At 20 days post-infection (dpi), sera of VP1 mAb-treated Î¼MT mice displayed similar neutralizing titers as B6 mice against WT MuPyV, but an inability to neutralize a published VP1 mutant virus with a deletion of aspartic acid at position 295, A2.Î295. A virus carrying this mutation was previously isolated following passage of WT virus in the presence of the VP1 mAb and identified as being resistant to neutralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lauver et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1CâE</xref>).

In mice receiving CD4 or CD8Î² T-cell-depleting antibodies individually, kidney virus levels were increased in CD4, but not CD8Î², T-cell-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In dual CD4 and CD8 T-cell-depleted mice, anti-VP1 immunofluorescence staining was localized to disrupted tubules expressing Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP), identifying the distal convoluted tubules as a major site of MuPyV replication in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tokonami et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Increased MuPyV replication in the kidney following T cell depletion in VP1 mAb-treated Î¼MT mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental approach for VP1 mAb treatment and T cell depletion.

In a third mouse, two mutant viruses were isolated with a deletion of aspartic acid 295 and one of two mutations in the BC loop (I79S or N80K). This finding mirrors evidence that a PML patient typically harbors a single VP1 mutant JCPyV in their CSF, brain, and blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gorelik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al., 2005a</xref>). Several of these non-synonymous single nucleotide substitutions and codon deletions were previously isolated from serially passaged MuPyV refractory to VP1 mAb-mediated neutralization, including Î295, the most frequently detected mutation, as well as V296F, previously identified as the MuPyV equivalent of the common JCPyV PML mutation S268F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lauver et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sunyaev et al., 2009</xref>).

We also identified several new mutations, including combined single amino acid deletions and substitutions. Each of the VP1 mutant viruses contained a mutation in the HI loop, where the heavy chain of the VP1 mAb contacts multiple residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lauver et al., 2020</xref>).

We found that these mutations blocked neutralization by the VP1 mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To examine the effects of the mutations on tropism, we infected mice with the mutant viruses intravenously (i.v.). The viruses were injected i.v. to examine tropism when virus is spreading in the blood, which was the condition under which these mutations were identified, and to avoid the possibility of the viruses having impaired spread from the site of s.c. inoculation. Despite the shared resistance to neutralization, the mutations had varying effects on the efficiency of viral infection in the kidney and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3CâD</xref>).

We generated viruses individually carrying the D295N or Î297 mutations in the WT A2 genome (A2.D295N or A2.Î297, respectively) to define the contributions of each mutation to recognition by the VP1 mAb and potential effects on tropism. Neutralization assays with VP1 mAb showed that A2.D295N remained sensitive, but A2.Î297 was fully resistant, to neutralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Similar to parental A2, A2.D295N was readily bound by the VP1 mAb; in contrast, the mAb did not bind A2.Î297 or A2.D295N/Î297 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). A2.D295N also showed a similar avidity profile to parental A2 with the VP1 mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

This reduction in spread was not due to reduced virus production; cells transfected with equal amounts of viral DNA showed similar levels of virus output at 72 hr by A2.D295N and A2.Î297, but significantly more virus by A2.D295N/Î297 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

Parental A2 and A2.D295N/Î297 showed preferential hemagglutination (HA) activity at acidic pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). A2.D295N and A2.Î297 exhibited poor HA activity, with A2.Î297 showing no HA activity across the pH spectrum. As HA activity is dependent on sialic acid binding, we next examined the effect of neuraminidase pretreatment on virus binding and infection. Binding by A2, A2.Î297, and A2.D295N/Î297 was dependent on sialylated host cell receptors, but binding by A2.D295N was refractory to neuraminidase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Despite these differences in binding, neuraminidase pretreatment caused a significant reduction 24 hpi in LT mRNA levels with low MOI infection and T ag<sup>+</sup> cells with high MOI infection, indicating that infection by all viruses relied predominantly on a sialic-acid-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1EâF</xref>). The dependence on sialic acid for infection, but not for binding, by A2.D295N indicates that by itself the D295N mutation mediated binding to a non-sialylated, non-productive receptor. In contrast, the A2.Î297 single mutant showed a drastic sensitivity to neuraminidase pretreatment, with 10,000-fold reduction in mRNA production, consistent with poor receptor binding and the lack of HA activity.</p><p>We next assessed how these mutations affected receptor binding and infection in the kidney. We incubated kidney sections from uninfected mice with virus and then stained for VP1 and kidney markers for proximal (CD13<sup>+</sup>) and distal (THP<sup>+</sup>) tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tokonami et al., 2018</xref>). Parental A2 bound to the lumen of the distal convoluted tubules (DCT) and binding was abrogated by neuraminidase pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Similar to A2, the A2.D295N/Î297 showed specific, neuraminidase-sensitive binding to the DCT. A2.Î297, however, showed no detectable binding in the kidney, whereas A2.D295N showed substantial binding to the abluminal side of the tubules but little-to no-binding to the luminal side. A2.D295N binding in the kidney was insensitive to neuraminidase treatment. We then assessed virus levels in the kidneys of mice infected i.v. with the mutant viruses. Based on LT mRNA levels in the kidney at 4 dpi, both single mutant viruses were attenuated compared to A2, whereas A2.D295N/Î297 showed similar levels of infection to A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that the Î297 mutation conferred resistance to VP1 mAb neutralization, but impaired viral spread and infection within the kidney. The D295N mutation alone caused aberrant receptor binding and impaired infection in vivo, but when combined with Î297 restored proper receptor binding in the kidney during early infection.</p><p>Based on the effects of the D295N and Î297 mutations, we hypothesized that Ab escape by the Î297 mutation was the initial driver of mutant virus emergence in vivo, with the emergence of the mutation at D295 occurring secondary to compensate for the defect in virulence. To test this, we cloned and sequenced VP1 from the kidneys of three T cell-depleted (two CD4 and CD8Î² T cell depleted; one CD4 depleted) mice that developed the D295N/Î297 and D295A/Î297 double mutant viruses. Each of these mice rapidly became morbid after the detection of viremia necessitating their euthanasia within 30 days of the emergence of viremia. In 50 clones sequenced from the kidneys of each of the three mice, we identified sequences containing WT VP1, Î297, and D295N/Î297 or D295A/Î297, but not sequences containing the D295N/A mutations alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). The presence of the individual Î297 mutation and absence of single D295 mutations suggests that the initial mutation was Î297 followed by D295N/A. Although more sensitive sequencing methods may detect VP1 sequences with D295N/A mutations without Î297, the high frequency of the Î297 mutation strongly suggests this was the initial mutation. The rapid morbidity associated with the emergence of the mutation at D295 and subsequent viremia likely limited the accumulation of these double mutant viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Heightened neurovirulence by a VP1 double mutation virus</title><p>Given the increased replication of A2.D295N/Î297 in vitro, we next investigated whether this virus showed altered kidney pathology in an immunocompromised host.

In marked contrast, kidneys A2.D295N/Î297-infected mice had only small, scattered collections of mononuclear cells. Consistent with these histopathologic differences, A2-infected kidneys also exhibited numerous, large VP1<sup>+</sup> foci, but those in A2.D295N/Î297-infected kidneys were far fewer and smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6CâD</xref>). To determine if A2.D295N/Î297 was neurovirulent, we infected WT mice intracranially (i.c.), a route of inoculation which mediates efficient MuPyV infection of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lauver et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mockus et al., 2020</xref>). Four dpi, A2-infected brains showed only sparse VP1<sup>+</sup> ependymal cells lining the ventricles. In contrast, brains of A2.D295N/Î297-infected mice had extensive VP1<sup>+</sup> ependymal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Consistent with this dramatic difference in extent of ependymal infection, A2-infected brains at 30 dpi had only small ependymal lymphocytic aggregates, whereas A2.D295N/Î297-infected brains contained more extensive ependymitis as well as periventricular edema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Additionally, of the sections examined only brains from mice persistently infected with A2.D295N/Î297 had VP1<sup>+</sup> cells in the periventricular region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Hydrocephalus is consistently seen in mice i.c. inoculated with A2 MuPyV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lauver et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mockus et al., 2020</xref>). A2.D295N/Î297-infected mice developed hydrocephalus to a significantly higher degree than A2-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). These data show that the endogenously derived A2.D295N/Î297 VP1 mutant virus had lower tropism for the kidney, but dramatically higher capacity to infect the cerebral ventricular system than the parental A2 virus. Similarly, impaired kidney pathogenesis but retained neurovirulence is a hallmark feature of A2 virus carrying the VP1 V296F mutation, sequence-equivalent to the frequent S268F VP1 mutation in JCPyV-PML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lauver et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, VP1 neutralizing Ab in T-cell-deficient hosts can select rare Ab-escape virus variants possessing high neuropathogenicity.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Reduced kidney tropism and heightened neurovirulence by a VP1 double mutant virus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Viremia in Î¼MT mice 30 dpi with A2 or A2.D295N/Î297 i.v.

To connect T cell deficiency and Ab-escape JCPyV variants, we investigated T cell insufficiency in mice infected with MuPyV in the setting of a restricted VP1 antibody response. Our findings allowed us to develop a model integrating T cell and humoral deficiencies with emergence of neurovirulent PyV, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. First, impaired T cell control results in increase PyV replication in the kidney, the central reservoir for persistent PyV infection. Elevated viral replication is accompanied by low-level, stochastic mutagenesis of the viral genome, where particular mutations in VP1 abrogate binding by VP1-specific Ab. By extension, the host must have an inherited or acquired VP1 Ab response that targets few VP1 epitopes. A subset of viruses carrying Ab-escape VP1 mutations acquire the capacity to replicate in the CNS. T cell deficiency further handicaps a second line of defense by antiviral T cells to control Ab-escape VP1 variant viruses. In summary, T cell deficiency acts at two levels to set the stage for emergence of antibody-escape VP1 mutations endowed with neurotropic potential.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>T cell deficiency and a narrow antiviral Ab response enable emergence of Ab-escape, neurovirulent PyV variants.</title><p>Model for the evolution of Ab escape, neurovirulent PyV VP1 variants in the setting of T cell deficiency and a neutralizing Ab response with limited coverage of VP1 epitopes on the virus capsid.

We observed preferential binding of MuPyV to the DCT, mirroring what has been reported for JCPyV, and virus replication in the DCT following T cell loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haley et al., 2015</xref>). This localization of virus binding to the DCT, despite differences in the sialylated glycans bound by each virus, suggests a conserved site of persistence within the kidney for these viruses. Virus binding and replication within the DCT may provide a level of local protection from neutralizing antibodies, necessitating T cell control to limit virus replication within the local kidney environment. Conditions of immune suppression deprive the kidney of this cellular immune control over PyV infection, leading to elevated virus replication there. Consistent with this are reports of depressed JCPyV-specific T cell responses in individuals treated with natalizumab and increased JCPyV shedding in the urine of immunosuppressed individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behzad-Behbahani et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Delbue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perkins et al., 2012</xref>). T cells are the predominant cell type responsible for the production of interferon gamma (IFN-Î³), which limits BKPyV replication in kidney cells and is necessary for effective control of MuPyV kidney infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abend et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Byers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>). T cell loss during PyV infection thus eliminates the major source of IFN-Î³ and virus control.</p><p>PML is associated with conditions of CD4 T cell impairment, including HIV/AIDS and idiopathic CD4 T cell lymphopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berger et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pavlovic et al., 2018</xref>). Decreases in CD4, but not CD8, T cells are seen in the CSF of natalizumab-treated MS patients and CD4 T cell epitope-escape JCPyVs have been found in PML patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jelcic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schneider-Hohendorf et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">StÃ¼ve et al., 2006</xref>). We observed higher kidney virus levels at 10 days post depletion and a higher frequency of viremia in CD4 T cell-depleted mice than in CD8 T cell-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). CD4 T cells can exert direct antiviral effector activities as well as provide help to maintain optimal virus-specific CD8 T cell responses in nonlymphoid organs, including the brain and lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Son et al., 2021</xref>). Tissue-resident CD4 T cells have also been shown to promote development of protective B cell responses in the lungs of influenza virus-infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Son et al., 2021</xref>). It will be important to elucidate how CD4 T cells restrict PyV replication in the kidneys and viremia by Ab-escape variant viruses.</p><p>Utilizing the host DNA replication machinery, PyVs are regarded as having highly stable genomes with a low incidence of mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">SanjuÃ¡n and Domingo-Calap, 2016</xref>). Clinical and experimental data, however, indicate that mutations arise during the course of PyV infection. JCPyV and BKPyV isolates from PML and polyomavirus-associated nephropathy patients, respectively, are characterized by mutations in both the VP1 capsid protein and the non-coding control region (NCCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boldorini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gorelik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">KrautkrÃ¤mer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peretti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tremolada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vaz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zheng et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al., 2005a</xref>). Likewise, rearrangements in the NCCR of BKPyV emerge after extended passage in vitro, and VP1 mutations arise in BKPyV and MuPyV after serial passage in the presence of neutralizing mAb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lauver et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lindner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhao and Imperiale, 2021</xref>). These data suggest that conditions favoring certain mutations (e.g., mutations enhancing replication or enabling antibody evasion) can promote the emergence and outgrowth of viruses with particular genomic alterations.</p><p>Several mechanisms provide avenues for VP1 mutations. Missense mutations may represent failed attempts by the host cell to restrict viral replication. The APOBEC3 family of proteins are cytosine deaminases that induce mutagenic damage in the genomes of DNA viruses as a mechanism of antiviral defense. APOBEC3B is upregulated during BKPyV nephritis and has been implicated in the emergence of BKPyV VP1 mutations in kidney transplant recipients and mutations in the Merkel cell PyV genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peretti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Que et al., 2021</xref>). The presence of deletion mutations could represent the remnants of double-stranded breaks repaired by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). DNA double strand breaks occur during PyV infection, and aspects of the DNA damage response pathway are required for efficient PyV replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Erickson and Garcea, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heiser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Justice et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sowd et al., 2013</xref>). The NCCR of BKPyV undergoes significant recombination events resulting from NHEJ during replication in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhao and Imperiale, 2021</xref>). It is possible that NHEJ repair of breaks in VP1 during replication results in a variety of recombinations and small deletions. Those that are tolerated by the virus and confer a selective advantage, in this case in-frame deletions conferring Ab escape, are thus able to emerge and be detected.</p><p>JCPyV VP1 mutations identified in PML patients are associated with impaired receptor binding and infectivity. Only archetype JCPyV is found in the urine of PML patients, despite the presence of VP1 mutant virus in the blood and CSF of these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Geoghegan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gorelik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maginnis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al., 2005a</xref>). Here, we find that the selective pressure of antibody escape drove outgrowth of VP1 mutants with varying kidney infectivity, implicating immune evasion, rather than tropism, as the primary driver of VP1 mutations under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâD</xref>). The initial emergence of the Î297 mutation, despite imparting severe defects in kidney tropism, indicates that Ab escape can promote the outgrowth of otherwise crippled PyV variants, a feature seen in several other chronic viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kalinina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kinchen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lynch et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The defect in spread and infectivity in vivo by the Î297 mutation readily selected for a variety of secondary point mutations that restored or even enhanced virulence, generating viruses able to efficiently spread in vitro. The point mutations found together with the Î297 mutation all involved a positive net change in charge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These mutations are all located near the receptor binding pocket, and most of the mutated side chains face toward the location of receptor binding. With the exception of E91, however, these residues have not been reported to be involved in receptor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stehle and Harrison, 1997</xref>). Mutation of E91 to glycine causes impaired infection by promoting binding to decoy pseudoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Qian and Tsai, 2010</xref>). Similarly, the D295N mutation alone caused pseudoreceptor binding that impaired infectivity in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5DâH</xref>). In the context of the Î297 mutation, however, these normally deleterious mutations synergized to restore proper receptor binding and even enhance virulence. The D295N/Î297 double mutant displayed increased infectivity and virus production in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5DâF</xref>). In vivo, the double mutant virus showed similar acute kidney infection to WT virus but decreased kidney infection/pathology during chronic infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6AâD</xref>). This impairment of kidney pathology during chronic infection suggests a defect in persistence within the kidney by the D295N/Î297 mutant virus. Within the brain, D295N/Î297 caused increased acute infection of the ependyma and heightened chronic infection in the periventricular region, as well as increased CNS pathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6EâG</xref>). Retention of neurotropism and a loss of kidney tropism was previously seen with the V296F MuPyV VP1 mutant and may be a common feature of PML-associated JCPyV mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lauver et al., 2020</xref>). This increased CNS virulence could stem from more efficient receptor binding and release, leading to increased viral dissemination throughout the ventricular system and elevated infection of the ependyma during persistence. Increased spread and pathogenesis resulting from altered receptor binding has been seen with a separate MuPyV HI loop mutation, V296A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buch et al., 2015</xref>). As both the D295 and H297 residues face into the pore at the center of each VP1 pentamer, these mutations may facilitate more efficient interactions with the VP2/3 minor capsid proteins, whose C-termini extend into the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The mutant viruses we identified all carried at least one mutation in the HI loop, which is also the most common site of JCPyV VP1 mutations in PML patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gorelik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reid et al., 2011</xref>). The epitope of the VP1 mAb has significant contribution from the HI loop and competes with a large portion of the endogenous antibody response generated by MuPyV-infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lauver et al., 2020</xref>). The dominant targets of antibodies in JCPyV-infected individuals have not been determined, but given the frequency of JCPyV mutations seen in the HI loop this region may be a common target of neutralizing Ab across species. PML patients typically carry a mutant JCPyV with a single VP1 mutation, rather than the double mutants we saw emerge in several mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gorelik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reid et al., 2011</xref>). This difference may stem from the nature of Ab escape mutation, with substitution to a bulkier side chain in JCPyV (e.g., L55F, S266F/Y, and S268F/Y) rather than the deletion of H297 seen in MuPyV. Although both types of mutations alter/impair infectivity, bulky substitutions in JCPyV may do so by occluding a portion of the receptor binding pocket, where there may be reduced opportunity for compensation by a secondary mutation. Already the smallest external loop in VP1, the HI loop of JCPyV (M261 to S268: 8 residues) is one residue shorter than the HI loop of MuPyV (W288 to V296: 9 residues) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liddington et al., 1991</xref>). Thus, the HI loop of JCPyV may be too short to tolerate even a single amino acid deletion and still allow proper positioning of the H and I Î² strands.</p><p>Insufficient humoral control of PyV mutants opens numerous pathways for viral invasion of the CNS. The lack of neutralization could promote infection of hematopoietic cells that then traffick to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dubois et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wollebo et al., 2015</xref>). Alternatively, the absence of neutralizing antibody could enable virus within the vasculature of the brain to infect the cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB). Brain microvascular endothelial cells are susceptible to JCPyV infection, and could provide viral access into the CNS parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chapagain et al., 2007</xref>). The BCSFB, formed by the choroid plexus in the brain ventricles, is another possible route of entry by the virus into the brain. JCPyV infects choroid plexus epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Corbridge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">OâHara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">OâHara et al., 2020</xref>). Infection of choroid plexus epithelium would enable virus spread into the CSF, dissemination throughout the ventricular system, and access to the brain parenchyma via infection of the ependymal cells lining the ventricles. In line with this possibility is the permissivity of ependymal cells for productive MuPyV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lauver et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mockus et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our findings demonstrate a â2-hitâ requirement for development of VP1 mutant PyVs: (1) a narrow VP1 antibody response; and (2) T cell insufficiency, which acts both to limit virus replication in the kidney and eliminate VP1 variants that evade antiviral antibodies. T cell loss leads to elevated virus replication that in the context of a narrow VP1 antibody response results in viremia by Ab-escape mutant viruses. Among these Ab-escape variants will be those carrying the potential for neurovirulence. The stochastic evolution of VP1 mutations, together with depressed anti-PyV T and B cell immunity, may account for the long timeframe between PML and iatrogenic immunosuppression, the array of PML-associated agents with unrelated mechanisms of action, and the rarity of PML in susceptible hosts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

The latter can spread to the brain in immunocompromised individuals, where replication leads to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). This replication is often accompanied by mutations in the major viral capsid protein, VP1, that make it resistant to certain neutralizing antibodies. The selection for such resistance can be recapitulated in the mouse model. The authors examine the contributions of the T cell response to the appearance of these resistant viruses and examine the biology of an interesting mutant that they discovered. Thus, this study addresses an important question, especially given a resurgence in PML in recent years due to the increasing use of immunomodulatory monoclonal antibodies to treat various diseases. JC polyomavirus causes Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) in T-cell immunosuppressed patients. The host-pathogen interaction behind this condition is not fully understood. Using a complicated murine infection model, the authors address the particular role of T cells in this evolution. The model includes commercially available B-cell depleted mice, first infected with MuPyV, then treated with an anti-VP1mAb, and 16 days later with IgG control or anti-CD4 and/or anti-CD8 antibodies to induce T-cell depletion. Viral replication is monitored in the kidney and blood at different times post-infection in T-cell-depleted versus control mice and the emergence of resistant variants is characterized. Finally, the fitness of a resistant variant presenting two mutations is compared in cells, tissues, and mice. The authors show that CD4 T-cells play a critical role in limiting or delaying the emergence of resistant variants. In addition, they highlight that variants that can emerge in absence of T-cell control show fitness loss in kidney but increased neurovirulence. These observations shed some light on JC virus pathogenesis in T-cell suppressed patients. The conclusions are overall supported by the data and confirm the expected critical role of T-cells in controlling viral replication. However, concerns about the presentation will require additional editing and experimental work.</p><p>Comments concerning the presentation</p><p>1. An overall concern I have is that the first part of the introduction and the entire abstract sound as though JCPyV itself is under investigation. These possibly misleading sections need to be rewritten. There is no need to be concerned that the relevance of their model is going to be questioned.</p><p>2. The relevance of these mutations relative to existing JC mutants is not made clear. In fact, two out of three reviewers missed the point that the mouse model involved a different virus from the human one. Clarified prose is needed.</p><p>3. It would be good to give some background on JCPyV receptor usage and also if the receptor(s) is (are) conserved between mouse and human and in the different tissues.</p><p>4. The last paragraph of the introduction somewhat exaggerates the findings, particularly the sentence beginning &quot;In this studyâ¦.&quot; It is not clear that Ab-deficient mice are really the equivalent of PML patients since the patients DO produce antibodies against the virus. The model is not being questioned but it should not be oversold.</p><p>Comments concerning the figures</p><p>Figure 1: Shows that treatment with anti CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell antibody, but not anti-CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell antibody or IgG control antibody, reduces control of the virus in a mouse model that contains B cells.</p><p>1. The tissue should be clearly indicated in the legend and ideally on the panel.</p><p>2. The word 'resurgence' is not appropriate because the data in Figure 2B do not show early viremia.</p><p>3. The original comment from all three reviewers was that fluorescent cytometry is needed to confirm T-cell depletion, especially in the case of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, it is stated somewhere that these are commercially obtained preparations. If this is the case and there is a validation of the depletions, that needs to be clearly stated. These controls are important, however they are obtained.</p><p>Supplemental Figure 1: Throughout the manuscript, the term 'blind spot' is used. This colloquial language implies a structural mechanism of neutralization that is often the case but not always.</p><p>1. Instead, more precise evolutionary language (especially for a general audience such as that of <italic>eLife</italic>) such as &quot;anti-VP1 treatment allows the selection of VP1-antibody resistant viruses.</p><p>2. The data themselves show convincingly that the anti-VP1 antibody specifically neutralizes wild-type virus but not the A2Î295 virus. At this point in the manuscript, the A2D295 virus has not been mentioned so it is not clear why it is S.Figure 1.</p><p>3. In (E), the y-axis of 'neutralizing titer' is not clear. Is it 'extent depletion'? Is it the</p><p>required serum dilution?</p><p>Figure 2 shows convincingly that the combination of anti-CD4<sup>+</sup> and anti-CD8<sup>+</sup> antibodies greatly reduce viral control in kidney, spleen, and brain.</p><p>1. Fluorescent cell quantitation is not provided to ensure the depletion of the relevant T cell populations,</p><p>2. The data in (B) cannot be clearly deciphered and the x-axis should be expanded.</p><p>However, the remaining panels in B, dissect the data in the time course. As in Figure 1, these data show that there is little control of the virus in the mice treated with anti-CD8<sup>+</sup> antibodies.</p><p>Figure 3 is the strongest figure in the paper, showing that the sequences of viruses that grow upon anti-VP1 monoclonal antibody treatment of B-cell-deficient mice show a variety of sequence changes. Interestingly, a Î295 and other amino acid 295 mutations are selected under all conditions and thus, as the authors conclude, confer resistance to the anti-VP1 antibody under all conditions. However, more mutations seem to be required in the absence of T cell depletion, and different spectra of mutations are found under each condition. Panel B shows the location in the VP1-antibody complex of several of the amino acids involved. Panel C shows a similar lack of neutralization for all selected viruses in cultured cells, and Panel D shows that there is different tropism and fitness for the various viruses in the kidney and spleen of infected B-cell-deficient mice in the presence of the anti-VP1 antibody.</p><p>1. It is not clear whether the mutations of interest have been installed in the otherwise wild-type virus free of other mutations that might have been selected; if it is not, this should be clearly stated.</p><p>Figure 4 shows explicit challenges with the 295 virus.</p><p>1. This virus is, presumably, reconstructed so that only this mutation is present. If it is not, it should be, and several points brought up by one of the reviewers is then relevant. Specifically, &quot;The extensive analysis of the A2.D295N, A2.Î297, and double mutant viruses is impressive. Given that the double mutant has enhanced replication properties, was the entire genome sequenced to confirm nothing has happened in the non-coding control region or the early region. It is not clear from the methods. Another sequencing-related question relates to the paragraph on lines 214-221: how many clones did they analyze, in order to rule out the presence of the D295N/A mutations alone? Could there have been a low-frequency present that was missed (and that might only be detected by NGS)?&quot;</p><p>2. The legend does not describe this but the text (line 152) states that the mice used were B-cell deficient. If that is the case, this experiment with the B-cell escape variant is the same experiment done with wild-type virus previously and thus does not enhance the findings of the paper at this point, unless this reviewer is missing the point. Perhaps it was performed in the B-cell-deficient mouse supplemented with the specific antibody?</p><p>3. Why are infections done in the hind footpad in the initial protocol and then by IV for the challenge or to test the fitness of the different mutants? The infection route should be clearly described and justified in the result section.</p><p>Figure 5 switches up the viruses under study. It shows a very good experiment in which the viruses have now clearly been reconstructed in isolation. However, several inconsistencies in the data likely make it necessary to repeat several aspects of these experiments.</p><p>1. 297, D295N, and double mutant viruses were measured by somewhat indirect means such as fold increase over input and fixed time points at two different MOIs, rather than growth curves at a fixed MOI so that any differences in total yield can be clearly assessed.</p><p>2. In Panel I, the frequencies of the D295N/Î297 double mutation in the original mice in which they were isolated, as well as a different combination of D295A/297 from another mouse, are shown. These data do not contribute mechanistically to Figure 5 and should be moved to Panel 3 where the mutations are first discussed. They do, however, provide a basis for discussion of the potential order of mutational events, which should be in the discussion.</p><p>3. The double mutant virus seems fitter than the wt. However, the abundance of this variant is very low in Fig5I, how do the authors explain that?</p><p>4. Figure 5 D to F and Figure 5 sup 1 are showing very close assays. In addition, the results are not always consistent depending on the readout: in Figure 5 D to F D295N is consistently less fit than A2 while in the supplementary figure, in panel A it looks fitter. Is it a transfected virus in the sup panel A? Why is A2 del 297 not shown in figure 5 panel A? Again, in panel E of Figure 5, this variant is as fit as wt but not in the other assay.</p><p>5. Sensitivity to neuraminidase: based on Figure 5 G and 5 sup D, del295 seems insensitive to sialidase pre-treatment, then why in panels E and F of Figure 5 sup it is sensitive?</p><p>6. With the way results are presented, it is not clear that panel H represents kidney viral loads after mice infection.</p><p>7. In figure 5H, the double mutant is as fit as the wt in the kidney. This is not reproduced in Figure 6.</p><p>Figure 6.</p><p>1. Why did the authors perform IC inoculation rather than IV or inoculation in the hind footpad as before? There are likely reasons for this, but they need to be explained.</p><p>2. The authors show in several figures that the double mutant has an advantage in cells, and this is shown here in the mouse brain. If such variants present increased neurovirulence, the authors should try to understand by what mechanism. Is binding to the receptor changed in the brain? Binding assay in brain tissues should be done in the same way as with kidney tissues.</p><p>Supplement to Figure 6 presents further exploration into the comparative phenotypes of the four viruses presented in Figure 5.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>â In the introduction, it would be good to give some background on JCPyV receptor usage and also if the receptor(s) is(are) conserved between mouse and human and in the different tissues.</p><p>â Figures 1 and 2 should be grouped in a single and simplified figure. The experimental setup is the same and only the site of genome replication and the time of analysis differ.

One overall concern I have is that in the first part of the introduction and the entire abstract, they make it sound as if they are studying JCPyV. These sections need to be rewritten because I think they are misleading. I don't think they need to be concerned that the relevance of their model is going to be questioned, at least not by this reviewer.</p><p>2. I found the middle of the last paragraph of the introduction to be another example of &quot;exaggeration,&quot; particularly the sentence beginning &quot;In this studyâ¦.&quot; I'm not sure Ab-deficient mice are really the equivalent of PML patients since the patients do produce antibodies against the virus. Again, I am not questioning their model but they should not oversell it.</p><p>3. What does &quot;un-neutralized virus&quot; on line 121 mean?</p><p>4. Do the authors have any sense of when during the persistent phase of the infection the mutations are arising? Is it before or after reactivation of all-out replication, for example?</p><p>5. The extensive analysis of the A2.D295N, A2.Î297, and double mutant viruses is impressive. Given that the double mutant has enhanced replication properties, I am wondering whether they sequenced the entire genome to confirm nothing has happened in the non-coding control region or the early region. It is not clear from the methods. Another sequencing-related question relates to the paragraph on lines 214-221: how many clones did they analyze, in order to rule out the presence of the D295N/A mutations alone? Could there have been a low-frequency present that was missed (and that might only be detected by NGS)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The narrative of this manuscript is difficult to follow although it contains much interesting biology. It begins by showing that T-cell control of JC polyomavirus in mice is important in the presence and absence of a B-cell response. Then, the authors show that the relevant T cells for viral control are CD4<sup>+</sup>, although controls for specific cell depletion are not provided. These data are presented in Figures 1, S.Figures 1, Figure 2, and one panel of Figure 3. The antibody-escape mutations in VP1 described in Figure 3 are very interesting and form the heart of this paper.</p><p>In Figure 5, four viruses are defined genetically and their properties compared in antibody-binding studies, antibody-neutralization studies, and in B-cell depleted mice. The viruses are A2 wild-type, Î297, D295N, and double mutant. The authors show that the D295N virus (as does the Î295 virus they have been studying up until this point) confers resistance to a particular neutralizing antibody. However, the Î297 mutation is required to increase its fitness. Thus, Figure 5 is where all the pieces are together to ask about the properties of these viruses in the presence and absence of the neutralizing antibody and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>By stopping where they do in the narrative, the message of the manuscript is that compensatory mutations are often needed to increase the fitness of antibody- or drug-resistant mutations. This has been shown many times, but, as such, remains of interest to a specialized audience. ,</p><p>The writing is so confusing that suggestions, below, are to highlight the findings and make suggestions to increase their clarity and persuasiveness.</p><p>Figure 1: Shows that treatment with anti- depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell antibody, but not anti-CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell antibody or IgG control antibody, reduces control of the virus in mouse model that contains B cells.</p><p>1. The word 'resurgence' is not appropriate because data in Figure 2B do not show early viremia.</p><p>2.

At this point in the manuscript, the A2D295 virus has not been mentioned so it is not clear why it is S.Figure 1.</p><p>3. In (E), the y-axis of 'neutralizing titer' is not clear. Is it 'extent depletion'? Is it the</p><p>required serum dilution?</p><p>Figure 2: (A) Shows a time course of viremia in B cell-deficient mice after treatment with IgG, anti-CD4<sup>+</sup> , anti-CD8<sup>+</sup>, and a combination of anti-CD4<sup>+</sup> and anti-CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell antibodies. The finding that CD4<sup>+</sup> , but not CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can control viremia in the absence of B cells is interesting but not pursued mechanistically.</p><p>1. Fluorescent cell quantitation is provided to ensure the depletion of the relevant T cell populations,</p><p>2. The data in (B) cannot be clearly deciphered and the x-axis should be expanded.</p><p>However, the remaining panels in B, dissect the data in the time course.

Therefore this experiment with the B-cell escape variant is the same experiment done with wild-type virus previously and thus does not enhance the findings of the paper at this point.</p><p>Figure 5 switches up the viruses under study. It shows a very good experiment in which the viruses have now clearly been reconstructed in isolation. A substitution at residue 295 (D295N), rather than the deletion that has been previously investigated, is reconstructed individually and together with a different single-amino acid deletion, Î297, which was found in one of the natural isolates presented in Figure 3. They find (A) that only the Î297 mutation confers neutralizing antibody resistance. This can be explained by the observed failure of either the Î297 mutant virus or the double mutant virus to bind to the neutralizing antibody. In the other figures, the relative fitness of the wild-type A2, Î297, D295N, and double mutant viruses were measured by somewhat indirect means such as fold increase over input and fixed time points at two different MOIs, rather than growth curves at a fixed MOI. However, the case is made convincingly that the double mutant virus grows better under all conditions in cultured cells. The authors show that these data can clearly be modified in animals, because, in the mouse kidney (H), a double mutant is present at equivalent abundance to wild-type.</p><p>1. In Panel I, the frequencies of the D295N/Î297 double mutation in the original mice in which they were isolated, as well as a different combination of D295A/Î297 from another mouse, are shown These data do not contribute mechanistically to Figure 5 and should be moved to Panel 3 where the mutations are first discussed. They do, however, provide a basis for discussion of the potential order of mutational events, which should be in the discussion.</p><p>Supplement to Figure 6 presents further exploration into the comparative phenotypes of the four viruses presented in Figure 5.</p><p>1. Could the authors discuss why the double-mutant virus generates the most virus but shows considerably less CPE than the D295N mutation?</p><p>Figure 6 shows pathogenesis experiments that compare wild-type and the D295N/Î297 double mutant in B cell-deficient mice in the absence of T cell depletion. The double mutant shows similar viremia but increased growth in brain tissues. It is part of the interesting biology of this paper, that the mutations were isolated for their antibody-escape properties, but show differences in mice with no B cells. Thus, this provides the perfect jumping-off point to compare the properties of the viruses in the presence and absence of neutralizaing antiboy and T cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83030.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authorsâ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments concerning the presentation</p><p>1. An overall concern I have is that the first part of the introduction and the entire abstract sound as though JCPyV itself is under investigation. These possibly misleading sections need to be rewritten. There is no need to be concerned that the relevance of their model is going to be questioned.</p></disp-quote><p>The abstract has been modified and the introduction has been reworked to clarify that MuPyV is used for this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The relevance of these mutations relative to existing JC mutants is not made clear. In fact, two out of three reviewers missed the point that the mouse model involved a different virus from the human one. Clarified prose is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extensively revised the abstract and added sections to the Introduction to clarify that this study exclusively uses MuPyV, an experimental setup necessitated by the fact the JCPyV only replicates in humans. Further discussion of the nature of the mutations found in this study in comparison to those found in PML patients has been added in the Discussion (Lines 401-407), which includes the following text âThe mutant viruses we identified all carried at least one mutation in the HI loop, which is also the most common site of JCPyV VP1 mutations in PML patients (Gorelik et al., 2011; Reid et al., 2011). The epitope of the VP1 mAb has significant contribution from the HI loop and competes with a large portion of the endogenous antibody response generated by MuPyV-infected mice (Lauver et al., 2020). The dominant targets of antibodies in JCPyV-infected individuals have not been determined, but given the frequency of JCPyV mutations seen in the HI loop this region may be a common target of neutralizing Ab across species.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It would be good to give some background on JCPyV receptor usage and also if the receptor(s) is (are) conserved between mouse and human and in the different tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>A paragraph on receptor usage by JCPyV and MuPyV has been added to the Introduction (Lines 78-84). We also included a discussion of the localization of JCPyV and MuPyV binding to the distal tubules in the kidney (Lines 308-312).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The last paragraph of the introduction somewhat exaggerates the findings, particularly the sentence beginning &quot;In this studyâ¦.&quot; It is not clear that Ab-deficient mice are really the equivalent of PML patients since the patients DO produce antibodies against the virus. The model is not being questioned but it should not be oversold.</p></disp-quote><p>In retrospect, we can appreciate how this paragraph could lead to this misperception. There is evidence (Ray et al., 2015; discussed in Lines 72-74) that PML patients have select deficiencies in their JCPyV VP1 Ab repertoire for VP1 mutations, a situation implying that a narrow VP1 repertoire sets the stage for selecting outgrowth of such variant viruses. The last paragraph of the introduction has been rewritten to clarify the experimental setup â B cell-deficient mice given an MuPyV-specific monoclonal VP1 antibody â as a model to investigate if a monospecific VP1 response will drive selection of VP1 variants (Line 88-93).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments concerning the figures</p><p>Figure 1: Shows that treatment with anti CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell antibody, but not anti-CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell antibody or IgG control antibody, reduces control of the virus in a mouse model that contains B cells.</p><p>1. The tissue should be clearly indicated in the legend and ideally on the panel.</p></disp-quote><p>The tissue is now identified as kidney in both the legend and the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The word 'resurgence' is not appropriate because the data in Figure 2B do not show early viremia.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this term throughout the manuscript and replaced it with âincreased or elevated replication.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The original comment from all three reviewers was that fluorescent cytometry is needed to confirm T-cell depletion, especially in the case of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, it is stated somewhere that these are commercially obtained preparations. If this is the case and there is a validation of the depletions, that needs to be clearly stated. These controls are important, however they are obtained.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not including this data in the original submission. Flow cytometry data confirming the depletions of CD4 and CD8 T cells in Figures 1, 2, and 4 have been added as Figure 1âfigure supplement 3, Figure 2âfigure supplement 1, and Figure 4âfigure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplemental Figure 1: Throughout the manuscript, the term 'blind spot' is used. This colloquial language implies a structural mechanism of neutralization that is often the case but not always.</p><p>1. Instead, more precise evolutionary language (especially for a general audience such as that of eLife) such as &quot;anti-VP1 treatment allows the selection of VP1-antibody resistant viruses.</p></disp-quote><p>The term âblind spotâ was used repeatedly to describe the inability of sera IgG from PML patients to neutralize JCPyV VP1 mutant viruses (Ray et al., 2015). We can see the reviewerâs concern with this colloquialism, and have replaced with âan inability to neutralize.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The data themselves show convincingly that the anti-VP1 antibody specifically neutralizes wild-type virus but not the A2Î295 virus. At this point in the manuscript, the A2D295 virus has not been mentioned so it is not clear why it is S.Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Further clarification has been added to the text (Lines 110-114) regarding the use of the A2.Î295 virus, which we previously published (Lauver et al., 2020) as a mutant virus that is resistant to neutralization by the VP1 mAb used in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In (E), the y-axis of 'neutralizing titer' is not clear. Is it 'extent depletion'? Is it the</p><p>required serum dilution?</p></disp-quote><p>The y-axis and legend for supplemental-figure 1E have been updated to indicate the neutralization titer is the Log<sub>10</sub> IC50 of the neutralization curves in C and D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 shows convincingly that the combination of anti-CD4<sup>+</sup> and anti-CD8<sup>+</sup> antibodies greatly reduce viral control in kidney, spleen, and brain.</p><p>1. Fluorescent cell quantitation is not provided to ensure the depletion of the relevant T cell populations,</p></disp-quote><p>Flow cytometry data confirming T cell depletion has been added as Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 (see response to comment #3 concerning the figures above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The data in (B) cannot be clearly deciphered and the x-axis should be expanded.</p><p>However, the remaining panels in B, dissect the data in the time course. As in Figure 1, these data show that there is little control of the virus in the mice treated with anti-CD8<sup>+</sup> antibodies.</p></disp-quote><p>The x-axis has been expanded for Figure 2B as requested to more clearly show the time course for detection of viremia in individual mice for each of the conditions depicted in the key to the far right of this panel. This is the raw data used to generate the middle panel showing virus levels at the peak of viremia in each mouse and the right panel collating the time course of viremia per treatment group. The interpretation of this data, as the reviewer correctly points out, is that CD4 T cells rather than CD8 T cells are primarily responsible for controlling MuPyV viremia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 is the strongest figure in the paper, showing that the sequences of viruses that grow upon anti-VP1 monoclonal antibody treatment of B-cell-deficient mice show a variety of sequence changes. Interestingly, a Î295 and other amino acid 295 mutations are selected under all conditions and thus, as the authors conclude, confer resistance to the anti-VP1 antibody under all conditions. However, more mutations seem to be required in the absence of T cell depletion, and different spectra of mutations are found under each condition. Panel B shows the location in the VP1-antibody complex of several of the amino acids involved. Panel C shows a similar lack of neutralization for all selected viruses in cultured cells, and Panel D shows that there is different tropism and fitness for the various viruses in the kidney and spleen of infected B-cell-deficient mice in the presence of the anti-VP1 antibody.</p><p>1. It is not clear whether the mutations of interest have been installed in the otherwise wild-type virus free of other mutations that might have been selected; if it is not, this should be clearly stated.</p></disp-quote><p>Clarification has been added to the Results to indicate that all the mutant viruses used in this study were generated de novo by inserting the mutations identified in viremic mice into the WT MuPyV genome. In particular, the lines âTo exclude possible effects of other mutations in the viral genome, we introduced several of these single and dual VP1 mutations into WT MuPyV using site-directed mutagenesisâ and âWe generated viruses individually carrying the D295N or Î297 mutations in the WT A2 genomeâ have been added to the Results (Lines 156-158 and 189-190).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 shows explicit challenges with the 295 virus.</p><p>1. This virus is, presumably, reconstructed so that only this mutation is present. If it is not, it should be, and several points brought up by one of the reviewers is then relevant. Specifically, &quot;The extensive analysis of the A2.D295N, A2.Î297, and double mutant viruses is impressive. Given that the double mutant has enhanced replication properties, was the entire genome sequenced to confirm nothing has happened in the non-coding control region or the early region. It is not clear from the methods. Another sequencing-related question relates to the paragraph on lines 214-221: how many clones did they analyze, in order to rule out the presence of the D295N/A mutations alone? Could there have been a low-frequency present that was missed (and that might only be detected by NGS)?&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>All VP1 mutant viruses used in the study were constructed by inserting mutations in the VP1 gene found in viremic mice into a WT genome. As noted by this reviewer, this approach was essential to exclude the possibility that changes in the readout assays could be influenced by potential mutations in other parts of the genome, such as the non-coding control region. This has been clarified in the Results as âTo exclude possible effects of other mutations in the viral genome, we introduced several of these single and dual VP1 mutations into WT MuPyV using site-directed mutagenesisâ (Lines 156-158).</p><p>The text and legend for Figure 5I have been updated to include that 50 VP1 clones from each mouse were sequenced (Line 254). We added the sentence âAlthough more sensitive sequencing methods may detect VP1 sequences with D295N/A mutations without Î297, the high frequency of the Î297 mutation strongly suggests this was the initial mutationâ (Lines 258-260) to acknowledge the possibility that single mutations at D295 could be detected with a more sensitive sequencing technique. However, we feel that the abundance of single Î297 mutations in the absence of clones containing an isolated D295N/A mutation strongly supports the likelihood that this was the initial mutation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The legend does not describe this but the text (line 152) states that the mice used were B-cell deficient. If that is the case, this experiment with the B-cell escape variant is the same experiment done with wild-type virus previously and thus does not enhance the findings of the paper at this point, unless this reviewer is missing the point. Perhaps it was performed in the B-cell-deficient mouse supplemented with the specific antibody?</p></disp-quote><p>We expanded the text to state that these are B cell-deficient mice given the VP1 mAb. Further justification for the experiment has been added to the Results, in particular the text âMice were challenged i.v. with a lower titer inoculum of the A2.Î295 mutant virus to mimic the development of viremia with an Ab escape mutant virus. This experimental setup allowed us to separate the function of T cells in preventing the generation of VP1 mutations from the ability of T cells to control the outgrowth of a VP1 mutant virusâ (Lines 175-178).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Why are infections done in the hind footpad in the initial protocol and then by IV for the challenge or to test the fitness of the different mutants? The infection route should be clearly described and justified in the result section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an explanation to the Results why IV infection was used for the subsequent infections comparing the mutant viruses and for the challenge experiments. In the section detailing the comparison of mutant viruses, the text âThe viruses were injected i.v. to examine tropism when virus is spreading in the blood, which is the condition under which these mutations were identified, and to avoid the possibility of the viruses having impaired spread from the site of s.c. inoculationâ has been added (Lines 160-163). In the section containing the challenge experiment, the sentence âMice were challenged i.v. with a lower titer inoculum of the A2.Î295 mutant virus to mimic the development of viremia with an Ab escape mutant virusâ has been added (Lines 175-176).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5 switches up the viruses under study. It shows a very good experiment in which the viruses have now clearly been reconstructed in isolation. However, several inconsistencies in the data likely make it necessary to repeat several aspects of these experiments.</p><p>1. 297, D295N, and double mutant viruses were measured by somewhat indirect means such as fold increase over input and fixed time points at two different MOIs, rather than growth curves at a fixed MOI so that any differences in total yield can be clearly assessed.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we expanded the time points in Figure 5F to show virus spread over time following a low MOI infection, where the double mutant virus was first detected two days before either single mutant virus and even the WT virus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Panel I, the frequencies of the D295N/Î297 double mutation in the original mice in which they were isolated, as well as a different combination of D295A/297 from another mouse, are shown. These data do not contribute mechanistically to Figure 5 and should be moved to Panel 3 where the mutations are first discussed. They do, however, provide a basis for discussion of the potential order of mutational events, which should be in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs comment, however we feel that the results in Figure 5I are thematically distinct from the results in Figure 3. Figure 5I shows the order of the emergence of the double mutations, which logically follows once data showing differences in the functions of each of these mutations have been described in the preceding panels of Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The double mutant virus seems fitter than the wt. However, the abundance of this variant is very low in Fig5I, how do the authors explain that?</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize that the low frequency of double mutant sequences in the samples seems to be at odds with the increased spread and replication observed in vivo. We have added further clarification to this section to address this in Lines 252-253 âEach of these mice rapidly became morbid after the detection of viremia necessitating their euthanasia within 30 days of the emergence of viremiaâ and Lines 251-252 âThe rapid morbidity associated with the emergence of the mutation at D295 and subsequent viremia likely limited the accumulation of these double mutant viruses.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 5 D to F and Figure 5 sup 1 are showing very close assays. In addition, the results are not always consistent depending on the readout: in Figure 5 D to F D295N is consistently less fit than A2 while in the supplementary figure, in panel A it looks fitter. Is it a transfected virus in the sup panel A? Why is A2 del 297 not shown in figure 5 panel A? Again, in panel E of Figure 5, this variant is as fit as wt but not in the other assay.</p></disp-quote><p>We can now appreciate how the data in these figures would appear to be discrepant. This apparent difference is due to the timing of the assays. The assays in Figure 5D to F are short-term experiments, which demonstrate significant delays in virus production, infection, and spread by the D295N virus compared to WT virus. Figure 5-supplement 1 shows an image of a single plaque at 6 days post infection, at which point the D295N virus has been able to spread sufficiently to form plaques. The new time course data in Figure 5F shows that the D295N virus has significantly delayed ability to spread than WT virus, but does eventually spread.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Sensitivity to neuraminidase: based on Figure 5 G and 5 sup D, del295 seems insensitive to sialidase pre-treatment, then why in panels E and F of Figure 5 sup it is sensitive?</p></disp-quote><p>We now recognize that this was not fully explained in the text, and appreciate the reviewer pointing this out. Figure 5G and 5 Sup 1D show neuraminidase-insensitive binding by the D295N mutant. However, Figure 5 Sup 1E-F show that infection by the D295N mutant remains dependent on sialic acid, which indicates that the neuraminidase-insensitive binding is non-productive. Further discussion of the difference in neuraminidase sensitivity for binding vs infection by A2.D295N has been added, including âThe dependence on sialic acid for infection, but not for binding, by A2.D295N indicates that by itself the D295N mutation mediates binding to a non-sialyated, non-productive receptorâ (Lines 226-228).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. With the way results are presented, it is not clear that panel H represents kidney viral loads after mice infection.</p></disp-quote><p>To further clarify that 5H is kidney viral loads, we added the sentence âWe then assessed virus levels in the kidneys of mice infected i.v. with the mutant virusesâ (Lines 239-240) to this part of the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In figure 5H, the double mutant is as fit as the wt in the kidney. This is not reproduced in Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 5H shows similar levels of mRNA during acute (4 dpi) infection of the kidney, whereas Figure 6A-D shows pathology induced by chronic kidney infection. The similar levels of infection early but reduced infection/pathology during chronic infection by the double mutant suggest a defect in viral persistence within the kidney. The differences seen between acute and chronic kidney infection with the double mutant is now addressed in the Discussion, with âin vivo, the double mutant virus showed similar acute kidney infection to WT virus but decreased kidney infection/pathology during chronic infection (Figures 5H and 6A-D). This impairment of kidney pathology during chronic infection suggests a defect in persistence within the kidney by the D295N/Î297 mutant virusâ (Lines 385-389).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6.</p><p>1. Why did the authors perform IC inoculation rather than IV or inoculation in the hind footpad as before? There are likely reasons for this, but they need to be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>IC inoculation is the conventional injection route for inducing MuPyV brain infection, which is not seen with s.c. or i.v. routes of inoculation. The use of IC inoculation to investigate MuPyV brain infection is now explained in the Results. âwe infected WT mice intracranially (i.c.), a route of inoculation which mediates efficient MuPyV infection of the brain (Lauver et al., 2020; Mockus et al., 2020)â (Lines 272274).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors show in several figures that the double mutant has an advantage in cells, and this is shown here in the mouse brain. If such variants present increased neurovirulence, the authors should try to understand by what mechanism. Is binding to the receptor changed in the brain? Binding assay in brain tissues should be done in the same way as with kidney tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>Understanding the mechanism responsible for the neurovirulence of the double mutant virus is of keen interest to us as well. To this end, we found that transfection of mutant viral DNA yielded increased virus production compared to WT DNA (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B). Although this does not rule out superior/altered virus binding by the mutant, it does show that the mutant virus more efficiently completes its replication cycle at a post entry step. We speculated in the Discussion about the mechanism by which these mutations may facilitate viral assembly; however, demonstrating this would require extensive structural analysis best done in a separate study. We have invested considerable effort to carry out virus binding assays on brain sections. However, this has turned out to be a technically difficult. While MuPyV stains kidney sections well, staining of brain tissue sections is weak and nonspecific. We have attempted to improve virus binding in brain section by antigen retrieval methods, but these have proven unsuccessful. We hope the reviewer understands our inability to compare binding by the viruses in the brain due to this technical impasse.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplement to Figure 6 presents further exploration into the comparative phenotypes of the four viruses presented in Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct to point out that the plaque size for the double mutant is smaller. We have added a new panel to this figure supplement quantifying plaque area. Given the data indicating the double mutant produces more virus, the difference in plaque area is most likely explained by the double mutant having an increased affinity for binding host cell receptors, limiting its spread. This phenotype has previously been observed with other MuPyV mutants possessing altered receptor binding (Bauer et al. 1999). This is now noted in the Results (Lines 199-201).</p></body></sub-article></article>
