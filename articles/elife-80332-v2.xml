pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation. In mammals, the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) constitutes the core of the 3′ end processing machinery onto which the remaining factors, including cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) and poly(A) polymerase (PAP), assemble. These interactions are mediated by Fip1, a CPSF subunit characterized by high degree of intrinsic disorder. Here, we report two crystal structures revealing the interactions of human Fip1 (hFip1) with CPSF30 and CstF77. We demonstrate that CPSF contains two copies of hFip1, each binding to the zinc finger (ZF) domains 4 and 5 of CPSF30. Using polyadenylation assays we show that the two hFip1 copies are functionally redundant in recruiting one copy of PAP, thereby increasing the processivity of RNA polyadenylation. We further show that the interaction between hFip1 and CstF77 is mediated via a short motif in the N-terminal ‘acidic’ region of hFip1. In turn, CstF77 competitively inhibits CPSF-dependent PAP recruitment and 3′ polyadenylation. Taken together, these results provide a structural basis for the multivalent scaffolding and regulatory functions of hFip1 in 3′ end processing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mRNA processing</kwd><kwd>polyadenylation</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCCR RNA and Disease</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jinek</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muckenfuss</surname><given-names>Lena Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>55008735</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jinek</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Molecular details of the interactions of human Fip1 with CPSF30 and CstF77 unravel key aspects of mRNA polyadenylation and its regulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>3′ end polyadenylation is a fundamental process in eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) biogenesis, essential for the maturation of non-histone precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) prior to their export into the cytoplasm. Poly(A) tails possess key functions in mRNA metabolism, governing mRNA export, translational efficiency, and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nicholson and Pasquinelli, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Passmore and Coller, 2022</xref>). Furthermore, alternative mRNA polyadenylation (APA) constitutes a key mechanism of gene expression control through dynamic regulation of polyadenylation site selection in pre-mRNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Giammartino et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tian and Manley, 2016</xref>). Accordingly, defects in polyadenylation are linked to human diseases such as cancer, β-thalessemia, diabetes, or systemic lupus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hollerer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gruber and Zavolan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dharmalingam et al., 2022</xref>). mRNA 3′ end biogenesis occurs by a two-step mechanism comprising endonucleolytic cleavage of the pre-mRNA transcript by the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex and subsequent polyadenylation of the free 3′ end by the poly(A) polymerase (PAP). In human cells, the process is dependent on the controlled assembly of several protein factors on the pre-mRNA, including CPSF, RBBP6, cleavage stimulation factor (CstF), as well as mammalian cleavage factors I and II (CF Im and CFIIm, respectively), and PAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boreikaite et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmidt et al., 2022</xref>). Most of these protein factors are highly conserved between mammals and yeast, underlining the fundamental nature of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xiang et al., 2014</xref>). The cleavage site, typically downstream of a CA dinucleotide, is defined by the polyadenylation signal (PAS), a conserved hexanucleotide motif (predominantly AAUAAA) located approximately 10–30 nucleotides upstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Proudfoot and Brownlee, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Proudfoot, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The PAS is specifically recognized by CPSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schönemann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clerici et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2018</xref>), which consists of two functional modules: the mammalian polyadenylation specificity factor (mPSF) comprising subunits CPSF160, WDR33, CPSF30, and hFip1 (for <underline>h</underline>uman <underline>f</underline>actor <underline>i</underline>nteracting with <underline>p</underline>oly(A) polymerase 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bienroth et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murthy and Manley, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaufmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2009</xref>), and the mammalian cleavage factor (mCF) containing the endonuclease CPSF73 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mandel et al., 2006</xref>), CPSF100 as well as Symplekin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>).

Within mPSF, the CPSF160–WDR33 subcomplex forms a rigid scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clerici et al., 2017</xref>) that interacts with CPSF30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clerici et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>) and the CPSF100 subunit of mCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). CPSF30 contains five C3H1-type zinc finger (ZF) domains and a C-terminal zinc knuckle domain which is absent in yeast homolog Yth1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barabino et al., 1997</xref>) and not required for mPSF complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clerici et al., 2017</xref>). The ZF1 domain is necessary and sufficient for binding to the CPSF160–WDR33 heterodimer, while ZF2 and ZF3 together with WDR33 mediate recognition of the AAUAAA PAS hexamer motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clerici et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). ZF4 and ZF5 domains interact with hFip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barabino et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamilton and Tong, 2020</xref>). hFip1 is an important regulator of APA that contributes to cleavage site selection through its interaction with CFIm via its C-terminal arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>) and additionally by binding to U-rich regions in the pre-mRNA via an arginine-rich C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaufmann et al., 2004</xref>), thereby specifically promoting polyadenylation of mRNA substrates with U-rich sequences preceding the AAUAAA hexanucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lackford et al., 2014</xref>). Both the RS domain and the arginine-rich region are absent in yeast Fip1 and the alternatively spliced isoform 4 of hFip1.</p><p>In previously determined cryo-EM structures of the yeast CPF and human mPSF complexes, ZF4 and ZF5 remained unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casañal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clerici et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2018</xref>), indicating conformational flexibility with respect to the rigid mPSF core. Recently, a crystal structure of human CPSF30 ZF4–5 domains in complex with hFip1 has been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamilton and Tong, 2020</xref>) and complementary NMR studies of the yeast Fip1 homolog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2021</xref> have shed light on the molecular details of the CPSF30–Fip1 interaction and revealed considerable structural dynamics of Fip1 in the context of the 3′ processing machinery.</p><p>Mammalian CstF is a dimer of trimers comprising CstF77, CstF64, and CstF50 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takagaki et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). It is recruited to the pre-mRNA by U- and G/U-rich sequences located downstream of the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takagaki and Manley, 1997</xref>) that are recognized by CstF64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Takagaki et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">MacDonald et al., 1994</xref>). Through stabilization of CPSF on the pre-mRNA, CstF plays an important role in PAS recognition and is essential for pre-mRNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takagaki et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boreikaite et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmidt et al., 2022</xref>). Dimerization of CstF is mediated by the CstF77 HAT (half-a-tetratricopeptide repeat) domain homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2007</xref>), and further stabilized by CstF50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). The CstF77 homodimer has an arch-like shape and interacts asymmetrically with CPSF, contacting the CPSF160–WDR33 mPSF scaffold via only one side of the arch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Fip1 interacts with PAP and tethers it to CPSF bound near the nascent 3′ end of the cleaved pre-mRNA, which is required for its processive polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Preker et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Helmling et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaufmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meinke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezeokonkwo et al., 2011</xref>). Besides CPSF30 and PAP, biochemical and cellular studies have implicated Fip1 in interactions with other proteins including CPSF160, CstF77 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Preker et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaufmann et al., 2004</xref>), WDR33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ohnacker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clerici et al., 2017</xref>), Symplekin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghazy et al., 2009</xref>), and CF Im (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Venkataraman et al., 2005</xref>). However, the molecular details of these interactions have not yet been revealed.</p><p>Here, we report structural and biochemical analysis of the interactions of hFip1 with CPSF30, PAP, and CstF77 within the human 3′ polyadenylation machinery. While confirming previous structural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamilton and Tong, 2020</xref>), we notably show that mPSF contains two hFip1 copies, yet recruits only one PAP molecule at a time. The presence of two PAP-binding sites in mPSF contributes to the processivity of 3′ polyadenylation. Furthermore, we show that hFip1 interacts with CstF77 through a conserved helix in its N-terminal ‘acidic’ region and reveal that CstF77 competes with PAP for hFip1 binding, which attenuates polyadenylation efficiency. These results deepen our understanding of hFip1 as a key interaction partner for 3′ end processing factors, facilitating or regulating their spatiotemporal assembly on the pre-mRNA, and establish a framework for further mechanistic studies of hFip1 interactions and CstF-mediated regulation of mRNA 3′ end biogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structural basis for the human hFip1–CPSF30 interaction</title><p>The ZF4 and ZF5 domains of CPSF30 are necessary and sufficient for the interaction with the conserved central domain of hFip1 (hereafter referred to as hFip1<sup>CD</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clerici et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamilton and Tong, 2020</xref>). Yet these domains could not be resolved in previously determined cryo-EM reconstructions of the human mPSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clerici et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2018</xref>), indicating that they are likely flexibly tethered to the mPSF core. To gain insights into the CPSF30–hFip1 interaction, we determined a crystal structure of a CPSF30 fragment spanning ZF4 and ZF5 domains (CPSF30<sup>ZF4–ZF5</sup>, residues 118–178) in complex with hFip1<sup>CD</sup> (residues 138–180 of hFip1 isoform 4) at a resolution of 2.2 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The structure reveals that hFip1<sup>CD</sup> binds CPSF30 in a 2:1 stoichiometry, with one hFip1<sup>CD</sup> molecule (hFip1<sup>CD</sup>a) binding predominantly to ZF4 and the other (hFip1<sup>CD</sup>b) to ZF5. While the overall conformation of the hFip1–CPSF30 complex is highly similar to that of a recent crystal structure of human hFip1–CPSF30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamilton and Tong, 2020</xref>), with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.82 Å over the whole complex, in this study, 21 additional residues of hFip1 could be resolved in hFip1<sup>CD</sup>b due to extended crystallization construct boundaries, with 16 additional residues at the N-terminus (residues 130–145, isoform 4) and 5 additional residues at the C-terminus (residues 177–181, isoform 4). Structural superpositions reveal that hFip1<sup>CD</sup>a and hFip1<sup>CD</sup>b bind to the same surfaces of ZF4 and ZF5 domains with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.87 Å over 54 aligned residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, superpositions with CPSF30 ZF2 and ZF3 domains reveal that the interaction surfaces on ZF4 and ZF5 are located on the opposite side of the ZF fold relative to the PAS RNA-binding surfaces of ZF2 and ZF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). ZF2 and ZF3 interactions with the RNA are mainly mediated by π–π stacking of aromatic side chains with nucleobases and supplemented by protein mainchain hydrogen bond interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clerici et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). Although the aromatic residues are conserved in ZF4 and ZF5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), RNA binding is likely precluded by the presence of proline residues at key mainchain hydrogen-binding positions. The hFip1<sup>CD</sup>a–CPSF30 interaction surface (803 Å<sup>2</sup>) is almost twice as large as the hFip1<sup>CD</sup>b–CPSF30 interface (478 Å<sup>2</sup>) because hFip1<sup>CD</sup>a binds at the ZF4–ZF5 junction and has additional contacts with ZF5. hFip1<sup>CD</sup>a and hFip1<sup>CD</sup>b also contact each other directly (215 Å<sup>2</sup>). ZF4 interaction with hFip1<sup>CD</sup>a is mediated by a hydrophobic interface centered on Lys127<sup>CPSF30</sup> and Phe131<sup>CPSF30</sup> and supported by additional salt-bridge contact involving Arg144<sup>CPSF30</sup> and Asn159<sup>hFip1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In turn, the interaction of ZF5 with hFip1<sup>CD</sup>b is mainly mediated by Tyr151<sup>CPSF30</sup> and Phe155<sup>CPSF30</sup> and supported by a salt-bridge contact between Arg168<sup>CPSF30</sup> and Asp159<sup>hFip1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). As Fip1 is conformationally dynamic in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meinke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezeokonkwo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>), CPSF30-binding results in structural ordering of the CD region. Interactions with both ZF4 and ZF5 are mediated by a hydrophobic patch in hFip1<sup>CD</sup> comprising the aromatic side chains of Trp150<sup>hFip1</sup>, Phe161<sup>hFip1</sup>, and Trp170<sup>hFip1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>hFip1 interacts with CPSF30 with 2:1 stoichiometry.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the domain architecture of CPSF30 and hFip1.

Together, these results indicate that either hFip1-binding site in CPSF30 can contribute to the integrity of mPSF in vivo and both sites are capable of recruiting hFip1 and consequently PAP. Notably, the expression levels of mPSF mutant complexes incapable of binding hFip1 (Y127E/Y151<sup>CPSF30</sup>) were substantially reduced, consistent with the role of hFip1 in stabilizing the CPSF30 ZF fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We next assessed the requirement of the hFip1–CPSF30 interactions for RNA 3′ polyadenylation using an in vitro polyadenylation assay.

To this end, we tested the interaction of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PAP with purified mPSF complexes containing truncated hFip1 fragments in an in vitro pull-down experiment. PAP was detectably, albeit weakly, coprecipitated by mPSF containing a hFip1 fragment spanning both the N-terminal and CD regions (residues 1–195) as well as by mPSF containing an N-terminally truncated hFip1 (residues 36–195) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, further N-terminal truncation of hFip1 resulted in the loss of PAP binding, indicating that a region spanning residues 36–80 in human hFip1 is required for PAP interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Together, these results indicate that hFip1 residues 36–80 are required for the recruitment of PAP to effect mPSF-dependent 3′ polyadenylation. Interestingly, we also observed that polyadenylation levels were reduced with mPSF containing full-length hFip1 (residues 1–378, isoform 4), as compared to mPSF containing C-terminally truncated hFip1 (residues 1–195), suggesting that the C-terminal region of hFip1, which is proline-rich and predicted to be intrinsically disordered, negatively modulates the processivity of mPSF-dependent 3′ polyadenylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CPSF recruits only one copy of PAP</title><p>Prior studies have indicated that the polymerase module of endogenous yeast CPF comprises up to two copies of Pap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casañal et al., 2017</xref>).

To determine whether this also occurs in the context of human mPSF, we analyzed the mPSF–PAP interaction by SEC-MALS.

Analysis of this complex using SEC-MALS revealed an apparent molecular mass of 347 kDa, closely matching the predicted molecular mass of a complex containing two hFip1 molecules and one PAP (337 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Addition of excess PAP to the prepurified mPSF–PAP sample did not cause peak broadening; furthermore, no change in the detected apparent molecular mass could be observed.

Comparable amounts of holo-CstF and MBP-CstF77 were precipitated by GST-hFip1<sup>1–35</sup> indicating that the Fip1 interaction interface in CstF77 remains exposed upon CstF complex assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that direct interactions between hFip1 and CstF77 contribute to the assembly of the CPSF–CstF complex during mRNA 3′ end biogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>CstF inhibits polyadenylation</title><p>As CstF77 and PAP bind to nonoverlapping, yet adjacent, sites in hFip1, CstF77 binding could nevertheless preclude PAP recruitment due to steric crowding. To probe this, we carried out a pull-down experiment with GST-tagged hFip1 and mixtures of MBP-tagged CstF77 and GFP-tagged PAP at varying molar ratios. In the presence of excess CstF77, PAP binding was considerably reduced, indicating that CstF77 competes with PAP for binding to hFip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistent with this, CPSF-dependent RNA 3′ polyadenylation was substantially reduced in the presence CstF77, suggesting that CstF77 inhibits 3′ polyadenylation via interaction with hFip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The inhibitory effect of CstF77 was reduced either when mPSF lacked the N-terminal CstF77 interaction site in hFip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) or when CstF77 (CstF<sup>mut</sup>) was incapable of interaction with the N-terminal region of hFip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that the inhibitory effect of CstF77 is in part dependent on its interaction with hFip1. In both cases, addition of excess CstF77 led to a reduction of RNA 3′ polyadenylation rate, although not to the same extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of 3′ polyadenylation was also observed upon addition of a holo-CstF complex, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of CstF77 is maintained when it is assembled within CStF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the observed CstF77-dependent reduction of RNA 3′ polyadenylation rate might be due to the close proximity of the PAS and the 3′ terminal CA dinucleotide in the SV40 mRNA-based substrate (11 nt), we tested an alternative RNA substrate (adenoviral L3 PAS-containing mRNA) in which the PAS and the cleavage site are separated by 20 nt and observed a similar degree of inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that the inhibition is likely not a consequence of steric crowding due to the proximity of the PAS and the 3′ end. Altogether, these results suggest that CstF inhibits RNA 3′ polyadenylation via CstF77, and that CstF77-mediated inhibition is in part dependent on its interaction with hFip1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>CstF77 competitively inhibits 3′ polyadenylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pull-down analysis of immobilized GST-hFip1<sup>1–195</sup> with varying molar ratios of GFP-PAP and MBP-CstF77<sup>21–549</sup>.

Although hFip1 is an integral component of the CSPF complex, specifically its mPSF module, it has not been structurally visualized in this context owing to its intrinsically disordered nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meinke et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In our study, we reveal the molecular basis for the interactions of human hFip1 with both CPSF30, PAP, and CstF77. While confirming the 2:1 binding stoichiometry of the hFip1:CPSF30 interaction in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamilton and Tong, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>), we expand this finding to the CPSF complex, confirming that its mPSF module assembles with two hFip1 copies in cells and demonstrating that both the ZF4 and ZF5 domains in CPSF30 are capable of binding hFip1 independently. Using polyadenylation assays we show that the two hFip1 copies are functionally redundant in recruiting PAP to the mPSF, which increases the processivity of RNA 3′ polyadenylation. As the recruitment of PAP to the 3′ end of the cleaved pre-mRNA is prerequisite for its processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezeokonkwo et al., 2011</xref>), while PAP only weakly associates with the mPSF, the presence of two hFip1 copies thus likely increases the 3′ polyadenylation efficiency polyadenylation by increasing the local PAP concentration. While recent studies of human CPSF30 and its yeast homolog Yth1 reported higher binding affinity for the Fip1:ZF4 interaction as compared to Fip1:ZF5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamilton and Tong, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>), we show that polyadenylation efficiency is reduced equally independent of which hFip1 interaction site (ZF4 or ZF5) is impaired. This indicates that PAP recruitment by mPSF is the limiting factor in 3′ polyadenylation.</p><p>Although the yeast Fip1–Pap1 interaction has been extensively characterized, the Pap1 interaction motif in Fip1, as observed in the crystal structure of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meinke et al., 2008</xref>), is poorly conserved in human Fip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), only partially mapping to hFip1 residues 80–86 (hFip1 isoform 4). Recent analysis of the yeast Fip1–Pap1 interaction using nuclear magnetic resonance, however, showed that additional residues located N-terminally of the Pap1-binding motif are involved in Pap1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>). This aspartate-rich acidic region is well conserved in hFip1, corresponding to residues 58–79 (hFip1 isoform 4). In agreement with this, we show that an additional N-terminal segment in hFip1 spanning residues 36–80 and including the aspartate-rich acidic motif is required but not sufficient for PAP binding. This suggests that the hFip1–PAP interaction mode closely resembles that of yeast Fip1–Pap1, despite low sequence conservation of the respective interaction motifs in yeast Fip1 and hFip1.</p><p>Notably, our biophysical analysis of the human mPSF–PAP interaction reveals that despite the presence of two hFip1 copies, only one copy of PAP is stably recruited by mPSF. This finding is unexpected and in contrast to the previous observation that two copies of the PAP catalytic domain are stably bound by the CPSF30–hFip1 subcomplex in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamilton and Tong, 2020</xref>). Moreover, up to two Pap1 copies have been detected in the polymerase module of yeast CPF by native mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casañal et al., 2017</xref>). It is important to note that although our experimental data indicate that only one PAP associates with mPSF, this does not exclude the possibility that mPSF binds a second copy of PAP with a low affinity. Nevertheless, we speculate that the observed 1:1 mPSF–PAP complex likely reflects the predominant state under physiological conditions. As the efficiency of the 3′ polyadenylation reaction depends on PAP recruitment, the presence of two PAP-binding sites in mPSF thus might not serve to simultaneously populate both sites with one PAP molecule each but to increase the probability of PAP recruitment to enhance polyadenylation efficiency. Furthermore, the presence of two hFip1 copies might instead be required for mPSF integrity and its interactions with CstF. In this context, it is conceivable that the binding of two PAP molecules to mPSF bound to a substrate RNA is precluded due to molecular crowding or steric hindrance, particularly considering that the two Fip1 molecules make nonidentical interactions with mPSF, and the two Fip1-binding sites in the CstF77 homodimer are not equivalent when CstF is bound to mPSF.</p><p>The interaction between CPSF and CstF has previously been shown to involve direct contacts between the CstF77 homodimer and an extensive interface provided by the CPSF160 and WDR33 subunits of CPSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), yet CstF also interacts with CPSF via hFip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaufmann et al., 2004</xref>). Our crystal structure of the hFip1–CstF77 subcomplex reveals that a hFip1 binds via conserved motif within the N-terminal ‘acidic’ region to the convex arch of the CstF77 HAT domain on both protomers in the CstF77 homodimer, resulting in a 2:2 stoichiometry. By reanalysis of previously reported cryo-EM data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), we reveal that this interaction mode is preserved in the context of the mPSF–CstF complex. Strikingly, both CstF77 and holo-CstF inhibit 3′ polyadenylation in vitro. Moreover, CstF77-mediated inhibition is partially dependent of its interaction with hFip1, which likely reflects the dual interaction mode of CStF with mPSF. Accordingly, the hFip1–PAP and hFip1–CstF77 interactions appear to be competitive, possibly as a result of the proximity of the PAP and CstF77 interaction sites within the hFip1 N-terminus. As CStF is strictly required for CPSF73-dependent pre-mRNA cleavage while PAP might not be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boreikaite et al., 2022</xref>), these results imply that the CPSF–CstF interaction is disrupted or undergoes a remodeling after cleavage to enable PAP recruitment to the cleaved pre-mRNA and subsequent 3′ polyadenylation.</p><p>To perform the coupled reaction steps of cleavage and polyadenylation, the 3′ end processing machinery likely undergoes a sequence of conformational and compositional rearrangements as polyadenylation site recognition by the mPSF module of CPSF and activation by RBBP6 triggers CstF-dependent cleavage by the mCF, after which the nascent 3′ end needs to be made accessible to PAP for subsequent poly(A) synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boreikaite et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmidt et al., 2022</xref>). Based on our structural and biochemical findings, we propose a model in which hFip1 helps coordinate the two steps of 3′ end processing. Initially, the two hFip1 molecules present in mPSF facilitate the assembly of CPSF and CstF on the pre-mRNA via the interactions of their N-terminal motifs with CstF77 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In part, these interactions also preclude PAP recruitment until the pre-mRNA has been cleaved and a free 3′ end has been generated. Upon endonucleolytic cleavage of the pre-mRNA by CPSF73, remodeling of the 3′ end processing machinery, possibly enabled by the dissociation of the downstream pre-RNA cleavage product and concomitant release of CstF, reduces steric constraints around the nascent 3′ end and exposes PAP interaction sites in hFip1, enabling PAP recruitment to initiate processive 3′ polyadenylation of the cleaved pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The conformational and compositional transitions required for accessing the nascent 3′ end are orchestrated by hFip1 and facilitated by its flexible attachment to mPSF via CPSF30, as well as by its intrinsic conformational dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meinke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezeokonkwo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>). The presence of two hFip1 molecules in the 3′ end processing complex promotes efficient PAP recruitment and contributes to the processivity of 3′ end polyadenylation. Our model implies that PAP might be recruited to the pre-mRNA only after the cleavage step, which is supported by recent findings reported by Boreikaite et al., demonstrating that the presence of PAP is not required for endonucleolytic cleavage by mCF, but is contradicted by the study of Schmidt et al., which reported that PAP is required for pre-mRNA cleavage. The functional role of PAP in pre-mRNA cleavage thus remains unclear, necessitating further studies. Finally, the functional role of hFip1 as a major interaction platform for 3′ end processing factors is also important in the context of the its well-documented role in regulating alternative polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lackford et al., 2014</xref>) as it suggests that the interactions with processing factors might be further modulated by direct interactions of Fip1 with U-rich sequences in the pre-mRNA.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Model of CPSF-mediated pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation and CstF77-dependent inhibition of polyadenylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Prior to pre-mRNA cleavage, PAP recruitment is inhibited by CStF, in part due to competitive interactions of CstF77 and hFip1 (left).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: William Marzluff (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. We note that no further experimentation is requested. Rather, textual changes are suggested to further strengthen the manuscript. The two critical components of these suggested changes are highlighted in the 'essential revisions' but we encourage the authors to consider response/changes in accordance with other points raised by the Reviewers as described below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Through thoughtful discussion, please address differences in approaches used to support the idea that a single copy of PAP exists in the complex in contrast to a previous publication. There are caveats to both studies and distinct experimental differences that should be highlighted to temper their overall narrative.</p><p>2) Reviewers were particularly interested in the CstF77 data, specifically the interpretation. This is potentially important data to the field and should be discussed more in this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the study by Muckenfuss et al., the authors provide two independent crystal structures of Fip1 in complex with CPSF30 or CstF77 as a basis for biochemical experiments exploring the function of Fip1 in polyadenylation. The structure of CPSF30/Fip1 is validated using polyadenylation assays and the authors conclude that while two molecules of Fip1 interact with a single molecule of CPSF30 there is likely only one copy of PAP brought to this subcomplex. Secondary to this, the authors present the first structure of Fip1 associating with CstF77 and provide biochemical validation of this model. Interestingly, the authors show that excess CstF77 leads to inhibition of in vitro polyadenylation of mPSF through the likely mutually exclusive association of Fip1 with 77 and PAP. Overall, the strengths of the study lie in high-resolution structural biology coupled with careful biochemical assays. My main concerns lie in the reduced novelty of the first half of this paper with the Hamilton and Tong study previously published. The main additional detail is whether one or two PAP molecules can associate with CPSF30/Fip1 and this seems somewhat incremental. There is a novelty to the observations that CstF77 can inhibit polyadenylation but this portion of the study is not as developed as it could be. If this portion of the paper were modestly expanded, I could be more convinced that it is worthy of publication. Several specific comments and suggestions are listed below.</p><p>1. The authors contend that their data support a model whereby a single copy of PAP is recruited to Fip1/CPSF30 in contrast to what was observed by Hamilton and Tong. It is important to note the experimental differences between the two systems: in this study, a GFP-PAP was used for in vitro binding, whereas Hamilton and Tong used only the catalytic module (1-524) of PAP; in this study, the authors use mPSF-PAP factors whereas in Hamilton and Tong full-length CPSF30 was used and Fip1 (79-200) was used. While I appreciate that experiments presented here appear to be done in a more 'complete' biochemical context, I am equally concerned that the use of GFP-PAP can somehow inhibit the ability of PAP to associate with Fip1/mPSF.</p><p>2. Does the inhibitory effect of CstF77 apply to other mRNA substrates beyond the one tested in this study?</p><p>3. Would supplementing the polyadenylation assays with the CstF complex (50/64/77) also cause inhibition, or is it unique to supplementation with isolated CstF77? If this were to be the case, how would this be interpreted?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors need to mention the role of FIP1 in alternative polyadenylation, and that it specifically promotes polyadenylation of mRNAs with U-rich stretches preceding the polyadenylation signal. The experiments of Shi et al. (Lackford et al., 2014), show that knockdown of Fip1 has a dramatic effect on alternative polyadenylation, resulting in skipping upstream polyA sites that have U-rich regions before the AAUAAA that bind Fip1. One potential interpretation of these experiments is that if FIp1 is limiting you can form an active polyadenylation complex that lacks Fip1, and complexes that lack Fip1 fail to cleave and polyadenylate at a subset of sites that require the U-rich elements for cleavage.</p><p>2. In interpreting the overall data, the authors should discuss possibilities of what actually happens in the cell when the cleavage complex forms on the nascent pre-mRNA. Their (and others) in vitro data on the properties of complexes not bound to substrate RNA describe the properties of complexes that may not be relevant to the functional complex that is bound to the pre-mRNA just prior to cleavage.</p><p>For example, they show CstF77 inhibits polyadenylation by interfering with the binding to Fip1. Since CstF and CPSF must interact during cleavage, this suggests that before cleavage (when all factors are bound to the substrate and RPPP6 is being recruited), PAP is likely not bound to the complex. After cleavage, either CstF may dissociate from the complex (since the 3' fragment of the RNA is bound to CstF) or alter its conformation to allow PAP to bind for polyadenylation. The authors might want to discuss these possibilities. This may be part of the reason there is a discrepancy in the literature on whether or not PAP is required for cleavage. If their model is correct PAP is likely not in the active cleavage complex (which contains CstF77), but might on the mPSF (or CPSF) that binds initially to the polyadenylation signal, but is lost when the active cleavage complex, which includes CstF forms.</p><p>3. They need to explicitly mention on page 5 (description of Figure 1) whether there are any differences between their structure and the structure of Tong and Hamilton of what seems to be the same complex.</p><p>4. They say (l. 138-139) &quot;both Fip1 binding sites contribute to the integrity of stability of mPSF. Might be better to say that &quot;either FIP1 binding site can contribute to the integrity of mPSF.&quot; The complexes with one FIp11 binding site look similar to those with 2 sites (wt) in Figure 1G.</p><p>5. In Figure 2A, it looks as if in mutant ZF4 or ZF5 polyadenylation is no longer processive. In the wild-type how long are the A-tails that accumulate? They should mention that. In the mutant AGUACA (I presume that is a mutant of the AAUAAA?) there is an addition of 3-6 A tails. It looks like the Y127E mutant is a little more active than the Y151E mutant (based on the length of the A tails). If that is reproducible that they could mention that.</p><p>6. The evidence that only one PAP is present in mPSF is convincing, and either FIP1 binding site seems by itself to be able to recruit PAP.</p><p>7. They describe and characterize the structure of a complex of the N-terminal 35 aa of Fip 1 with CstF77, adding a third interaction to the previously described interactions of CstF77 with Wdr33 and CPSF160. Since there are two copies of CstF77 in CstF, CstF can bind two molecules of Fip1, and they provide evidence that happens in mCSF, and is likely part of the mechanism by which mPSF and CstF interact during cleavage.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80332.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Through thoughtful discussion, please address differences in approaches used to support the idea that a single copy of PAP exists in the complex in contrast to a previous publication.

While we indeed used GFP-PAP for our in vitro pull-down assays (Figure 1G, 2B, 4A), it is important to note that an untagged catalytic domain of human PAP (1-504) was used for copurification of a mPSF-PAP complex and its subsequent SEC-MALS analysis in isolation and in the presence of excess untagged PAP (Figure 2D). In fact, both mPSF and PAP are untagged in this analysis which ensures that any interference from affinity/epitope tags is eliminated.</p><p>Initially, we used untagged PAP for our in vitro pull-down analysis. However, due to the transient interaction of PAP with mPSF/hFip1 and the resulting weak bands on SDS-PAGE, we decided to use GFP-PAP for improved detection by in-gel fluorescence of the N-terminally fused GFP tag. For reference, a comparative pull-down analysis using untagged and tagged PAP with mPSF complexes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. Equal amounts of PAP are precipitated by Strep-tagged mPSF complexes, independent whether it is fused to a GFP tag or not.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80332-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Furthermore, analysis of the three-dimensional structure of PAP reveals that the hFip1-binding site on PAP is located on the opposite face of the molecule relative to its N-terminus. Together with the fact that PAP is about twice the size (58 kDa) of the N-terminally fused GFP tag (28 kDa), it is unlikely that the tag would negatively affect its interaction with hFip1.Therefore, we believe that the different results observed in the two studies stem from the different compositions of the complexes (mPSF in our study vs. CPSF30-hFip1 in Hamilton and Tong) used to test for their interaction with PAP. Interestingly, Hamilton and Tong observe dimerization of CPSF30-hFip1 (70-200) complexes, which we do not observe with our mPSF complexes, an additional indication that isolated CPSF30-hFip1 complexes are able to establish additional interactions that are obstructed once the complex is integrated into the mPSF.</p><p>At present, we cannot exclude the possibility that mPSF complexes assemble with two PAP molecules in vitro at higher PAP concentration; however, we believe that this does not represent the predominant physiological assembly.</p><p>We made additional revisions to the manuscript, including the Discussion section, to elaborate on the observation of only one stably bound PAP molecule.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Does the inhibitory effect of CstF77 apply to other mRNA substrates beyond the one tested in this study?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for raising this point. It is important to note that CstF64, rather than CstF77, is the principal RNA-binding component of the CstF complex that mediates interactions with G/U-rich downstream sequences through its RNA recognition motif (RRM) (Takagaki et al., 1997). CstF64, however, was not included in our analysis of CstF77-mediated inhibition of polyadenylation (and neither was CstF50) (Figure 4B, Figure 4 —figure supplement 1); furthermore, our use of pre-cleaved RNA substrates precludes the inclusion of downstream elements. As CstF77 does not possess an RRM and is not known to directly bind RNA (Bai et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2018), competition between CstF77 and PAP is expected to be mediated by protein-protein interactions rather than via the RNA substrate.</p><p>Following the suggestion of the Reviewer, we probed the inhibitory effect of CstF77 on polyadenylation with an alternative adenoviral L3 PAS-containing mRNA substrate (38 nt), that was previously shown to be processed in vitro by a recombinant human 3’ end processing complex (Boreikaite et al., 2022; Schmidt et al., 2022). Compared to SV40 mRNA, in which the PAS and cleavage site are separated by only 11 nt, these sites are separated by 20 nt in the L3 mRNA, which is within the normal range (15-21 nt) observed for mammalian pre-RNAs (Beaudoing et al., 2000; Gruber et al., 2016). We observe a similar degree of inhibition by CstF77 using the alternative adenoviral L3 mRNA substrate (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1B), suggesting that the inhibition is independent of the RNA substrate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Would supplementing the polyadenylation assays with the CstF complex (50/64/77) also cause inhibition, or is it unique to supplementation with isolated CstF77? If this were to be the case, how would this be interpreted?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this intriguing question. hFip1 interacts with both CstF77 and CstF in our pull-down analysis (now: Figure 3 —figure supplement 3), indicating that the hFip1 binding site on CstF77 is not obstructed upon assembly of CstF77 into the CstF complex. As suggested by the Reviewer, we carried out polyadenylation assay using a recombinant holoCstF complex comprising CstF77, CstF64<sup>1-198</sup>, and CstF50 (now: Figure 4C) to demonstrate that holo-CstF causes inhibition of the polyadenylation reaction to a similar extent as isolated CstF77, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of CstF77 persists when it is assembled within CStF. As indicated, we added two additional figures to the manuscript (Figure 3 —figure supplement 3; Figure 4C) that further strengthen our findings on CstF-mediated inhibition of polyadenylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Densitometric quantitation of the GFP fluorescence using ImageLab 6.1 software (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref>) reveals a marked reduction of both GFP-hFip1 and GFP-PAP band intensities upon mutation of either of the two hFip1 binding sites in CPSF30 (single hFip1 complexes) that consequently results in reduced recruitment of PAP. Nevertheless, so as not to over-interpret this data, we distinguish only between the presence or absence of interaction.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Quantitation of co-precipitated GFP-hFip1 and GFP-PAP protein levels (GFP fluorescence detected at 473 nm), normalized against WT mPSF.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom">wt</th><th valign="bottom">ZF4</th><th valign="bottom">ZF5</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">GFP-hFip</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.29</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.42</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">GFP-PAP</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.28</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.43</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 2A, it looks as if in mutant ZF4 or ZF5 polyadenylation is no longer processive. In the wild-type how long are the A-tails that accumulate? They should mention that. In the mutant AGUACA (I presume that is a mutant of the AAUAAA?) there is an addition of 3-6 A tails. It looks like the Y127E mutant is a little more active than the Y151E mutant (based on the length of the A tails). If that is reproducible that they could mention that.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for bringing up these points. We now added molecular weight markers to the gels showing polyadenylation assays. Furthermore, we specified more clearly that AGUACA is a mutant of the AAUAAA polyadenylation signal. As mPSF retains residual low affinity RNA binding activity in the absence of the canonical AAUAAA hexanucleotide (Clerici et al., 2017), residual polyadenylation activity can be observed for this RNA substrate. Although the slight difference in polyadenylation efficiencies of the Y127E and Y151E mutant is reproducible, we cannot exclude that this is due to the Y127E CPSF30 mutant (ZF4) still retaining some affinity for hFip1 (Figure 1E) as it has higher affinity for hFip1 than ZF5 does (Hamilton et al., 2020). Therefore, we refrained from further discussion of the results so as not to overinterpret the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The evidence that only one PAP is present in mPSF is convincing, and either FIP1 binding site seems by itself to be able to recruit PAP.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the positive feedback.</p></body></sub-article></article>
