the effectiveness of treatments from different fields, such as neurostimulation, neurofeedback, brain training, and pharmacotherapy. This debate has been fuelled by contradictory and nuanced experimental findings. Notably, the effectiveness of a given treatment is commonly evaluated by comparing the effect of the active treatment versus the placebo on human health and/or behaviour. However, this approach neglects the individual’s subjective experience of the type of treatment she or he received in establishing treatment efficacy. Here, we show that individual differences in <italic>subjective treatment -</italic> the thought of receiving the active or placebo condition during an experiment - can explain variability in outcomes better than the actual treatment. We analysed four independent datasets (N = 387 participants), including clinical patients and healthy adults from different age groups who were exposed to different neurostimulation treatments (transcranial magnetic stimulation: Studies 1 and 2; transcranial direct current stimulation: Studies 3 and 4). Our findings show that the inclusion of <italic>subjective treatment</italic> can provide a better model fit either alone or in interaction with <italic>objective treatment</italic> (defined as the condition to which participants are assigned in the experiment). These results demonstrate the significant contribution of subjective experience in explaining the variability of clinical, cognitive, and behavioural outcomes. We advocate for existing and future studies in clinical and non-clinical research to start accounting for participants’ subjective beliefs and their interplay with objective treatment when assessing the efficacy of treatments. This approach will be crucial in providing a more accurate estimation of the treatment effect and its source, allowing the development of effective and reproducible interventions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neuromodulation is a type of intervention that relies on various non-invasive techniques to temporarily stimulate the brain and nervous system. It can be used for the treatment of depression or other medical conditions, as well as the improvement of cognitive abilities such as attention. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding whether this approach has beneficial effects.</p><p>Most studies aiming to assess the efficiency of a treatment rely on examining the outcomes of people who received the intervention in comparison to participants who undergo a similar procedure with no therapeutic effect (or placebo). However, the influence of other, ‘subjective’ factors on these results – such as the type of intervention participants think they have received – remains poorly investigated.</p><p>To bridge this gap, Fassi and Hochman et al. used statistical modeling to assess how patients’ beliefs about their treatment affected the results of four neuromodulation studies on mind wandering, depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms. In two studies, participants' perceptions of their treatment status were more strongly linked to changes in depression scores and mind-wandering than the actual treatment. Results were more nuanced in the other two studies. In one of them, participants who received the real neuromodulation but believed they received the placebo showed the most improvement in depressive symptoms; in the other study, subjective beliefs and objective treatment both explained changes in inattention symptoms.</p><p>Taken together, the results by Fassi and Hochman et al. suggest that factoring in patients’ subjective beliefs about their treatment may be necessary in studies of neuromodulation and other interventions like virtual reality or neurofeedback, where participants are immersed in cutting-edge research settings and might therefore be more susceptible to develop beliefs about treatment efficacy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurostimulation</kwd><kwd>subjective beliefs</kwd><kwd>interventions</kwd><kwd>NIBS</kwd><kwd>TMS</kwd><kwd>tDCS</kwd><kwd>blinding</kwd><kwd>non-invasive brain stimulation</kwd><kwd>transcranial magnetic stimulation</kwd><kwd>transcranial direct current stimulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG86932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fassi</surname><given-names>Luisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000913</institution-id><institution>James S.

However, the research findings from these fields tend to be heterogeneous. As a result, there has been increased scepticism among researchers about the efficacy of these treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lampit et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">López-Alonso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sitaram et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, neuromodulation has been studied as one of the most promising treatment methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Ridder et al., 2021</xref>). Further, one particular form of neuromodulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), has been approved by regulatory bodies in multiple countries, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and is used as an evidence-based treatment for patients with migraine, major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and smoking addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hallett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walsh and Cowey, 2000</xref>). Moreover, TMS and other neuromodulatory devices, such as transcranial-focused ultrasound and electrical stimulation (tES), have been highlighted as a potential treatment for psychiatric, neurological, and neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grover et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khedr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McGough et al., 2019</xref>), and they have also been used to enhance various mental processes, including attention, memory, language, mathematics, and intelligence in healthy populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Santarnecchi et al., 2015</xref>). These encouraging findings have raised hope for the potential application of these techniques within and outside the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dubljević et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite some encouraging results on the beneficial effects of both TMS and tES, contradictory findings have emerged across different studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horvath et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Medina and Cason, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parkin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Westwood et al., 2017</xref>). Several factors have been pointed at as plausible reasons for the heterogeneity in research results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Filmer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guerra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Bueren et al., 2021</xref>). However, a crucial factor that researchers have largely overlooked is the extent to which subjective beliefs can explain variability in treatment efficacy. Here, we address this gap by examining whether modelling participants’ beliefs about receiving the placebo or active treatment can account for changes in clinical, cognitive and behavioural outcomes.</p><p>Participants who take part in TMS and tES studies consistently report various perceptual sensations, such as audible clicks, visual disturbances, and cutaneous sensations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis et al., 2013</xref>). Consequently, they can discern when they have received the active treatment, making subjective beliefs and demand characteristics potentially influencing performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Polanía et al., 2018</xref>). To account for such non-specific effects, sham (placebo) protocols have been employed. For transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), the most common form of tES, various sham protocols exist. A review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fonteneau et al., 2019</xref> shows that 84% of 173 studies used similar sham approaches to an early method by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gandiga et al., 2006</xref>. This initial protocol had a 10 s ramp-up followed by 30 s of active stimulation at 1 mA before cessation, differently from active stimulation that typically lasts up to 20 min. However, this has been adapted in terms of intensity and duration of current, ramp-in/-out phases, and the number of ramps during stimulation. Similarly, in sham TMS, the TMS coil may be tilted or replaced with purpose-built sham coils equipped with magnetic shields, which produce auditory effects but ensure no brain stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duecker and Sack, 2015</xref>). By using surface electrodes, the somatosensory effects of actual TMS can also be mimicked. Overall, these types of sham stimulation aim to simulate the perceptual sensations associated with active stimulation without substantially affecting cortical excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fritsch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nitsche and Paulus, 2000</xref>). As a result, sham treatments should allow controlling for participants’ specific beliefs about the type of stimulation received.</p><p>Previous studies have addressed whether manipulating participants’ expectations about the effects of either active or sham stimulation can moderate treatment efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haikalis et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rabipour et al., 2018</xref>). However, to our knowledge, these studies have not examined whether individual differences in participants’ subjective experience of receiving the active or sham treatment provide a better model fit than the condition to which participants are assigned in the study. We term the former <italic>subjective treatment</italic> and the latter <italic>objective treatment</italic>.</p><p>The above consideration becomes particularly crucial when considering that the experimental design of most randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involves recording whether participants believed they received the active or placebo treatment. While it is common practice to assess experimental blinding using this data, the explanatory power of individual differences in <italic>subjective treatment</italic> is rarely, if at all, considered. This is based on the assumption that if no differences emerged at the group level in participants’ guess for receiving the active vs the placebo treatment (i.e. if experimental blinding was successful), placebo effects could not explain the obtained results.</p><p>Here, we hypothesise that such an assumption can be erroneous and aim to explore how accounting for differences in subjective beliefs can shed light on the conclusions of previous treatment studies. Moreover, we introduce a simple and straightforward approach that could be used to analyse existing data and guide future clinical and fundamental research to examine whether <italic>subjective treatment</italic> explains variability in experimental outcomes over and beyond <italic>objective treatment</italic>. Below, we demonstrate this approach by reanalysing four independently published neurostimulation studies (including TMS and tES) that test clinical and non-clinical samples from different age groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blumberger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filmer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leffa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaster et al., 2018</xref>). The data and the codebook of the analyses are available on the OSF (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/rztxu/">https://osf.io/rztxu/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study 1</title><p>Repetitive TMS (rTMS) is a method for treating depression that has been approved by the FDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Connolly et al., 2012</xref>). In study 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blumberger et al., 2016</xref>), patients aged 18–85 with treatment-resistant depression (N = 121) were randomised to receive either bilateral rTMS, unilateral left-rTMS, or sham rTMS for 3 or 6 weeks (<italic>objective treatment</italic>). We examined whether participants’ beliefs about receiving active or sham stimulation (<italic>subjective treatment</italic>) explained changes in depression over time. In this study, <italic>subjective treatment</italic> was based on participants’ reports of whether they thought they received active or sham rTMS, inquired at the end of treatment (i.e., week 6). Further details on participant groupings based on the <italic>objective treatment</italic> and <italic>subjective treatment</italic> can be found in the codebook, separately for each study, and figure supplements (e.g. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>A linear mixed model with depression scores, measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAMD-17), was fitted to the data for weeks 1–6. The baseline model included <italic>time</italic> (week 1/week 3/week 6) as a main effect, as well as the interaction of <italic>time</italic> and <italic>objective treatment</italic>. We first added to this model <italic>subjective treatment</italic> as a main effect. Next, we extended the model to include the two-way interaction of <italic>time</italic> and <italic>subjective treatment</italic>. Lastly, we considered a model with the three-way interaction of <italic>time</italic>, <italic>subjective treatment,</italic> and <italic>objective treatment</italic>. Our results showed that the two-way interaction between <italic>subjective treatment</italic> and <italic>time</italic> led to a significantly higher model fit (Bayesian Information Criterion (<italic>BIC</italic>) = 2027.48, Akaike Information Criterion (<italic>AIC</italic>) = 1985.62, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Hence, our analysis suggests that participants’ subjective experience about the treatment accounted for variability in depression scores over time, while the actual treatment condition to which participants were assigned did not. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, participants who thought they received active stimulation showed a steeper decrease in depression over time than participants who thought they received sham. The interaction of subjective treatment and time was significant in weeks 3 and 6.

Compared to standard rTMS, deep rTMS with the H1 coil has been designed to stimulate deeper and larger areas of the cortex (primarily the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - DLPFC - and portions of the right DLPFC). We examined whether, also in this case, <italic>subjective treatment</italic> accounted for changes in participants’ depression scores, despite the use of a different sample and TMS technique. Notably, in contrast to the other studies, participants were asked to report whether they thought they received the active or sham treatment after the first week of treatment rather than at the end (i.e., fourth week). This avoids that <italic>subjective treatment</italic> - as inquired at the end of the study - would inherently be biased due to the clinical change the patient experienced as a result of the intervention. The breakdown of participants in respect to <italic>objective treatment</italic> and <italic>subjective treatment</italic> is reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>.</p><p>A linear mixed model with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-24) score as the outcome was fitted to the data for weeks 1–4.

The latter model was then compared to a three-way interaction model with <italic>subjective treatment</italic> by <italic>objective treatment</italic> by <italic>time</italic>. Our results showed that the three-way interaction model led to a significantly better fit (<italic>AIC</italic> = 1601.91, <italic>BIC</italic> = 1668.75, <italic>p</italic> = 0.011; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2 fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 2 and 3</xref>). Hence, participants’ beliefs explained variability in depression scores over time in relation to the experimental allocation. To examine contrasts of the three-way interaction, we analysed the differences between the objective and subjective treatment each week compared to the baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We found a steeper decrease in depression from baseline to week 3 <italic>(b</italic> = 8.79, <italic>t</italic>(102.57) = 2.01<italic>, SE =</italic> 4.37<italic>, p</italic> = 0.047) and from baseline to week 4 <italic>(b</italic> = 9.19, <italic>t</italic>(103.80) = 2.10, <italic>SE</italic> = 4.39, <italic>p</italic> = 0.039). In both cases, the scores for active <italic>objective treatment</italic> and active <italic>subjective treatment</italic> were higher than the sham treatment. Another way to explore the three-way interaction is by investigating the polynomial contrasts of the time variable between the objective and subjective treatment conditions. The analysis showed that the objective and subjective treatment differed in the linear contrast of time (<italic>b</italic> = 28.03, <italic>t</italic>(182.30) = 3.13, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002).

These findings highlight that participants’ beliefs regarding the type of treatment received and their subjective experience of the treatment dosage can explain variability in cognitive performance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we used a novel approach to examine whether and to what extent participants’ subjective beliefs may account for variability in research outcomes. To this aim, we analysed four independent datasets from the field of neurostimulation; specifically, two rTMS RCTs in patients with depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blumberger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaster et al., 2018</xref>), one tDCS study in adults with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leffa et al., 2022</xref>), and another tDCS study in a healthy adult sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filmer et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrate that participants’ subjective beliefs about receiving the active vs control (sham) treatment are an important factor that can explain variability in the primary outcome and, in some cases, fit the observed data better than the actual treatment participants received during the experiment. Specifically, in studies 1 and 4, the fact that participants thought to be in the active or control condition explained variability in clinical and cognitive scores to a more considerable extent than the <italic>objective treatment</italic> alone. Notably, the same pattern of results emerged when we replaced <italic>subjective treatment</italic> with <italic>subjective dosage</italic> in the fourth experiment, showing that subjective beliefs about treatment intensity also explained variability in research results better than objective treatment. In contrast to studies 1 and 4, studies 2 and 3 showed a more complex pattern of results. Specifically, in study 2 we observed an interaction effect, whereby the greatest improvement in depressive symptoms was observed in the group that received the active objective treatment but believed they received sham. Differently, in study 3, the inclusion of both subjective and objective treatment as main effects explained variability in symptoms of inattention. Overall, these findings suggest the complex interplay of objective and subjective treatment. The variability in the observed results could be explained by factors such as participants’ personality, disorder type and severity, prior treatments, knowledge base, experimental procedures, and beliefs of the research team, all of which could be interesting avenues for future studies to explore.</p><p>An important question arising from our findings relates to the causal role of subjective beliefs. This question is a complex one to answer and falls outside the scope of this study. Based on the goal of testing blinding efficacy, it is a standard practice for current treatment studies to record data on subjective beliefs only at the end of the experiment rather than before and throughout. This was the case in studies 1, 3, and 4. While in study 3, both <italic>objective</italic> and <italic>subjective treatment</italic> explained unique variance in the clinical outcomes, in studies 1 and 4 it was impossible to conclude whether participants’ beliefs, which were captured by the <italic>subjective treatment</italic>, affected experimental outcomes or, on the contrary, whether participants’ changes in performance or symptoms throughout the studies influenced beliefs regarding treatment allocation. Therefore, it is important to consider that <italic>subjective treatment</italic> could also capture the changes faced by participants in placebo-controlled trials, whereby, if they feel better, it would be hard psychologically to report that they believe it was due to the placebo. Notably, study 2 used a less common approach, in which subjective beliefs about treatment allocation were queried after the first week of the study. In this case, significant results emerged only 2 weeks after this inquiry (i.e., weeks 3 and 4). Given that subjective beliefs about treatment allocation were documented before the emergence of changes in any clinical outcome, it is more plausible that participants’ beliefs would have affected experimental outcomes rather than vice versa.</p><p>Based on the above considerations, future studies should strive to record data on subjective beliefs at different time points: before, during, and after the experiment. This will allow mapping the way subjective beliefs might be differentially associated with experimental results depending on the considered study and treatment type. However, we acknowledge two caveats of this suggestion. Firstly, participants may be more prone to pay attention to their treatment allocation and, consequently, figure out their assigned condition. Secondly, recording subjective beliefs at multiple time points might interfere with the effects of the treatment. For instance, patients might suppress their response for the fear that the treatment received is a placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonawalla and Rosenbaum, 2002</xref>). An alternative approach could entail deception, whereby all participants are told they received the active treatment. While this raises an ethical concern, such an approach would: (1) allow minimising the effect of subjective beliefs on research outcomes, and (2) hold more ecological validity, as it would mimic the way approved treatments are delivered in the clinic, where all patients know to be receiving the active treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fonteneau et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While this study focuses only on neuromodulation techniques, we want to highlight that the proposed approach can be applied to other forms of treatment (e.g. pharmacological studies, cognitive training) tested as part of standard experiments or RCTs. It is worth noting that the contribution of subjective beliefs to experimental results might be even more enhanced when considering interventions carried out in seemly cutting-edge research settings, such as experiments involving virtual reality, neurofeedback paradigms, and other types of brain–computer interfaces. In such cases, participants might be more susceptible to forming specific expectations about treatment effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fonteneau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thibault et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mikellides et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, the explanatory power of subjective beliefs could be intensified compared to more traditional forms of treatment, such as pharmacology.</p><p>One question emerging from this study is whether these results, observed with self-report measures, would apply to more objective behavioural outcomes (e.g. sensorimotor recovery in stroke patients, improvements in fluid intelligence in participants with learning difficulties) and neural functions (e.g. functional connectivity). We argue that the answer to this question is likely to be positive since placebo effects have been shown to impact not only behaviour but also brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fonteneau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hashmi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oken et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>). However, independent of this possibility, the contribution of <italic>subjective treatment</italic> to explaining variability in self-reported outcomes should not be underestimated. Noteworthy, in most RCTs investigating the effect of different treatments on clinical and subclinical groups (e.g. depression, chronic pain, eating disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder), some of which have also been approved by the FDA, the measurement of symptomatology is mostly based on self-reported outcomes, such as questionnaires. This consideration makes the case of <italic>subjective treatment</italic> even stronger, hinting at the potential role of this factor in explaining experimental results across a variety of experimental outcomes and treatment types.</p><p>While our study examined the explanatory power of subjective beliefs about receiving treatment, neither of the four studies (similar to most studies in the field) collected data on participants’ expectations. Indeed, as recently shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parong et al., 2022</xref>, expectations regarding the effectiveness of cognitive training (i.e. whether it will increase or decrease performance) can significantly modulate its effect. Thus, investigating the interplay between expectations and <italic>subjective treatment</italic> could allow examining the directionality and strength of the effect of <italic>subjective treatment</italic> on the outcome of interest. For instance, some participants may expect a treatment to improve their capabilities or symptoms. In contrast, others could expect even the opposite, and the level of these expectations can vary during the intervention. These factors could, in turn, impact individual variability in <italic>subjective treatment</italic>. Arguably, when questioned early, <italic>subjective treatment</italic> could be more related to expectations rather than an actual reflection of the treatment benefits. This variation may explain the findings in study 2 (decrements in depression for subjective sham treatment) compared to study 1 (decrements in depression for subjective active treatment), where only in the former were subjects questioned during the procedure (week 1) and not at its end. This possibility is a post hoc explanation, and future experiments collecting data on participants’ behavioural, cognitive and clinical outcomes should also record subjective expectations thoroughly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boot et al., 2013</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braga et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We want to highlight that, while we present <italic>subjective treatment</italic> as an important variable with explanatory power in addition to <italic>objective treatment</italic>, these results do not imply that participants’ subjective beliefs can explain all of the variability in research outcomes (see also in Hochman et al., in preparation; commenting to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gordon et al., 2022</xref>). This is demonstrated in study 3, where the <italic>objective treatment</italic> significantly explained inattention symptoms even when <italic>subjective treatment</italic> was accounted for. Additionally, we present in Appendix 1 an example of a neuromodulation study in which <italic>objective treatment</italic> explained variability in treatment effects that could not be attributed to <italic>subjective treatment</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murphy et al., 2020</xref>). Based on this consideration, where researchers have data, examining variability in participants’ <italic>subjective treatment</italic> may add further insight into prior results. However, unsurprisingly, when researchers were contacted about providing data on <italic>subjective treatment</italic>, many reported that the assessment of subjective beliefs, aside from side effects, was not recorded. Indeed, even our group’s procedure in the past lacked the recording of <italic>subjective treatment</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Looi and Cohen Kadosh, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen Kadosh et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our findings hold twofold importance. Firstly, we introduce two new concepts in the academic literature: <italic>subjective treatment</italic> and <italic>subjective dosage</italic>. Secondly, we cast light on the role of participants’ subjective experience in explaining the variability of results from RCTs and experiments that test the effectiveness of neuromodulation on mental health and behaviour. Altogether, we call for future studies to systematically collect data on participants’ subjective beliefs and expectations. Studies that have collected data on subjective beliefs at the start and end of the intervention may consider examining the potential contribution of such beliefs to their results. Aside from estimating subjective beliefs about belonging to the active or control condition, we suggest that future research may consider collecting and analysing data on : (1) participants’ beliefs before and at some midpoint during the experiment rather than only at the end, and (2) participants’ expectations about the directionality and strength of the effect of <italic>subjective treatment</italic> on expected outcomes. This approach would be enhanced with designs that include deception, whereby all participants are told that they received the active treatment. However, such designs require careful ethical review, particularly in clinical populations. Overall, such data will allow a thorough examination of subjective beliefs, yielding more valid and replicable results to progress scientific and clinical studies to benefit human health and behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants and design</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Study 1</title><p>One hundred and twenty-one patients (77 females, age range 18–85) with treatment-resistant depression took part in this study based on the data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blumberger et al., 2016</xref>.

Those who achieved remission completed the study at week 3, while those classified as non-remitters entered a second phase, during which they received an additional 3 weeks of the same treatment under double-blind conditions. During the study, rTMS was administered using a Magventure RX-100 repetitive magnetic stimulator (Tonika/Magventure) and a cool B-65 figure-8 coil. To derive stimulation intensity, the motor threshold was obtained before treatment. In order to localise the stimulation site (left DLPFC), a structural MRI was coregistered to participants’ heads using a magnetic tracking device (miniBIRD, Ascension Technology Group) for coil-to-cortex coregistration. Sham stimulation was administered in randomised fashion either as sham HFL-rTMS or sham bilateral rTMS with the coil angled 90° away from the skull in a single-wing tilt position, leading to some scalp sensations and sound intensity similar to that of active stimulation.

All participants included in the analysis received rTMS with the H1 coil targeting the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally and performed at 120% of the RMT. The active rTMS group received the following standardised dose of rTMS: 18 Hz, at 120% RMT, 2 s pulse train, 20 s inter-train interval, 167 trains, for a total of 6012 pulses per session over 61 min. The sham group received treatment with the same parameters, device, and helmet. However, the active H1 coil was disabled when initiating the sham mode. A second coil (sham H1 coil) was located within the treatment helmet but activated far above the participant’s scalp. This sham H1 coil delivered a tactile and auditory sensation similar to the active H1 coil, but the electric field was insufficient to induce neuronal activation.

The at-home tDCS device has been used in previous studies and included a user-friendly interface sensitive to impedance, such that sessions with too high impedance were automatically blocked. Furthermore, the number of the sessions, the dosage of the sessions and the stimulations were pre-programmed with a minimum interval between two consecutive sessions of 16 hr along with an option to abort a session (if necessary). Additionally, the capacity to save the number of sessions and time of stimulation performed by each participant was also controlled and pre-programmed. The current was delivered using 35 cm<sup>2</sup> electrodes (7 cm × 5 cm) coated with a vegetable sponge moistened with saline solution before the stimulation by two silicone cannulas coupled to the electrode. The electrodes were fixed on one of three sizes of neoprene caps that were given to each patient based on their head circumference.</p><p>Instructions on using the device were given at the baseline assessment when they received the first stimulation session, assisted by trained staff. Participants were instructed to remain seated during sessions, but no other behavioural restriction was imposed. Participants underwent 30 min daily sessions of tDCS, 2-mA direct constant current, for 4 weeks for a total of 28 sessions (including weekends). The anodal and cathodal electrodes were positioned over F4 and F3, corresponding to the right and left DLPFC according to the international 10–20 electroencephalography system. Devices programmed for sham treatment delivered a 30 s ramp-up (0–2 mA) stimulation followed by a 30 s ramp-down (2–0 mA) at the application’s beginning, middle, and end. This procedure was performed to mimic the tactile sensations commonly reported with tDCS. Also, each participant received a daily reminder in the form of a text message on their cell phones to improve adherence. The participants were encouraged to perform the stimulation sessions at the same time of the day. At the end of the study, participants reported whether they thought they received active or sham stimulation (presented as a binary choice).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Study 4</title><p>The experiment was conducted on a single day and consisted of three parts. Firstly, participants were familiarised with the experimental paradigm. Secondly, participants were instructed to sit quietly with their eyes open and stimulation was applied offline to the left prefrontal cortex for 20 min. Lastly, participants performed a sustained attention task for 40 min, during which mind wandering, the main outcome of this study, was measured. Overall, each participant completed a single session, lasting approximately 1.5 hr.</p><p>Stimulation was delivered with a NeuroConn stimulator (neuroConn GmbH, Ilmenau, Germany). The target was placed over F3 (EEG 10–20 system), and the reference was over the right orbitofrontal region. For the four groups who received active stimulation, tDCS lasted 20 min (including 30 s ramping up and down). During stimulation, participants were asked to sit quietly and keep their eyes open. The group that received sham stimulation had the same instructions but only received 15 s of constant current. The current was ramped up for 30 s up to 1.5 mA, then ramped down for 30 s. Stimulation was single-blinded, meaning that while the participants were blind to the stimulation they received, the experimenters were aware of the participant’s stimulation group.</p><p>During the experiment, participants completed a sustained attention task (SART) in which they were asked to respond via a keypress (space bar) to non-target stimuli (single digits excluding the number 3) and withholding responses to target stimuli (the number 3) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Half of the trials ended in a target stimulus; the other half ended in a task-unrelated thought (TUT) probe. The TUT probe asked: “To what extent have you experienced task-unrelated thoughts prior to the thought probe? 1 (minimal) – 4 (maximal)”. Participants’ average response to the probe across trials was taken as a measure of mind wandering performance, with higher scores indicating higher mind wandering. At the end of the experiment, participants were asked whether they thought they received active or sham stimulation (presented as a binary choice) via a short questionnaire.

(2) Does the inclusion of <italic>objective treatment</italic> lead to a model with a significantly better fit than the baseline model including <italic>subjective treatment</italic> (and <italic>time</italic>, when applicable)?</p><p>In order to address the first question, we defined a baseline model including <italic>time</italic>, and <italic>time</italic> by <italic>objective treatment</italic> interaction as fixed effects. Time was defined as a categorical variable, with each level reflecting the weekly assessments from baseline to the end of the study. Participants were entered into the model as random effects. Notably, the reference levels for all of the models (the intercepts) were the baseline; therefore, each effect was imposed as a difference compared to the baseline performance. Thus, the effect of time grasps the overall time difference compared to the baseline. In the same vein, the interaction terms of time and treatments (either subjective or objective) could be conceptualised as a covariate capturing the effect of the treatment over time when compared to the baseline performance. Given our interest in the contribution of <italic>subjective treatment</italic> over time, we compared the baseline model to an updated model that also included <italic>subjective treatment</italic> in a two-way interaction with <italic>time</italic>. Model comparison was run using the <italic>anova</italic> function in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">R Development Core Team, 2022</xref>). Our focus was on whether the comparison was significant at <italic>α</italic> &lt; 0.05, indicating that the inclusion of <italic>subjective treatment</italic> led to a considerably better model fit, explaining variability in the dependent variable in addition to the explanatory power of <italic>objective treatment</italic> over time.</p><p>Lastly, we compared the updated model to a more complex model, including the three-way interaction of time, <italic>subjective treatment,</italic> and <italic>objective treatment</italic>. In this case, our focus was whether the model comparison was significant, indicating that <italic>subjective treatment</italic> interacted with time and <italic>objective treatment</italic> to explain variability. As for the second question, we switched the order of the baseline models from the previous investigation. The baseline model included time and the interaction of <italic>subjective treatment</italic> with time, and then the compared model included <italic>objective treatment</italic>. Henceforth, the additional comparison of the three-way interaction was identical to the one in the first question. That allows for establishing if the <italic>objective treatment</italic> explained variability over <italic>subjective treatment</italic>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All four studies analysed complied with ethics standards and received approval from the ethics board of their respective institutions.

In this case, we show that the inclusion of <italic>subjective treatment</italic> did not explained variability in experimental outcomes.</p><p>This study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murphy et al., 2020</xref>) compared the effects of different NIBS techniques, namely anodal tDCS, tRNS + DC-offset, or sham stimulation over the left DLPFC on working memory (WM) performance and task-related EEG oscillatory activity in 49 healthy adults. Participants were allocated to receive either anodal tDCS (N = 16), high-frequency tRNS + DC-offset (N = 16), or sham stimulation (N = 17) to the left DLPFC using a between-subjects design. The Sternberg WM task was used to measure changes in WM performance before, 5 min and 25 min post-stimulation. Moreover, event-related synchronisation/desynchronisation (ERS/ERD) of oscillatory activity was analysed from EEG recorded during WM encoding and maintenance. At the end of the experiment, participants were asked whether they thought they received active or sham stimulation (presented as a binary choice) via a short questionnaire.</p><p>We employed the same analytical approach as for experiments 1–4, looking at the contribution of <italic>subjective treatment</italic> to model fit over and beyond <italic>objective treatment</italic> and examining whether <italic>objective treatment</italic> explained variability in experimental outcomes (WM accuracy and reaction times) over and beyond <italic>subjective treatment</italic>. A linear mixed model with WM reaction time was fitted to the data for time 0–2 (before NIBS, 5 min after, and 25 min after). The baseline model included <italic>objective treatment</italic> (sham/tRNS/tDCS) as the main effect, as well as the interaction of <italic>time</italic> and <italic>objective treatment</italic>. We first added to this model <italic>subjective treatment</italic> (active or placebo) as a main effect. Next, we extended the model to include the two-way interaction of <italic>time</italic> and <italic>subjective treatment</italic>. Lastly, we considered a model with the three-way interaction of <italic>time</italic>, <italic>subjective treatment,</italic> and <italic>objective treatment</italic>. Our results showed that the inclusion of <italic>subjective treatment</italic> did not lead to a better model fit neither as a main effect (<italic>df</italic> = 13, <italic>BIC</italic> = 1824.16, <italic>AIC</italic> = 1785.28<italic>, p</italic> = 0.670) nor as a two-way interaction with <italic>time</italic> (<italic>df</italic> = 15, <italic>BIC</italic> = 1833.25, <italic>AIC</italic> = 1788.40, <italic>p</italic> = 0.642) and a three-way interaction with <italic>time</italic> and <italic>objective treatment</italic> (<italic>df</italic> = 21, <italic>BIC</italic> = 1856.48, <italic>AIC</italic> = 1793.70, <italic>p</italic> = 0.348). Hence, participants’ subjective experience about the treatment did not explain variability in reaction times beyond the actual treatment condition to which participants were assigned.</p><p>We next examined whether the changes in reaction time were explained by <italic>objective treatment</italic>. We, therefore, added <italic>objective treatment</italic> first and, following, <italic>objective treatment * time</italic> after <italic>subjective treatment * time</italic> was already included in the baseline model. Our results showed that the inclusion of neither <italic>objective treatment</italic> (<italic>df</italic> = 11, <italic>BIC</italic> = 1820.58, <italic>AIC</italic> = 1787.69, <italic>p</italic> = 0.139) nor <italic>objective treatment * time</italic> (<italic>df</italic> = 15, <italic>BIC</italic> = 1833.25, <italic>AIC</italic> = 1788.40, <italic>p</italic> = 0.121) led to a better model fit. Therefore, when accounting for participants’ subjective experience of receiving the real or placebo treatment, the actual treatment to which participants were assigned during the experiment did not contribute to explaining changes in WM reaction time.</p><p>Following, we run the same analysis with WM accuracy as the outcome of interest. Model comparison showed that <italic>subjective treatment</italic> did not lead to a better model fit neither as a main effect (<italic>df</italic> = 13, <italic>BIC</italic> = 1084.64, <italic>AIC</italic> = 1045.77, <italic>p</italic> = 0.069) nor as a two-way interaction with <italic>time</italic> (<italic>d f</italic> = 15, <italic>BIC</italic> = 1094.60, <italic>AIC</italic> = 1049.74, <italic>p</italic> = 0.990) and a three-way interaction with <italic>time</italic> and <italic>objective treatment</italic> (<italic>df</italic> = 21, <italic>BIC</italic> = 1122.48, <italic>AIC</italic> = 1059.68, <italic>p</italic> = 0.914). On the contrary, we next examined whether the changes in WM accuracy were explained by <italic>objective treatment</italic>.

Specifically, the authors conclude that (e.g., in the abstract) &quot;individual differences in subjective treatment can explain variability in outcomes better than the actual treatment&quot;, which I believe is not a consistent conclusion across all four studies as it does not appropriately consider important interactions with objective treatment observed in study 2 and 3. In study 2, the greatest improvement was observed in the group that received TMS but believed they received sham. While subjective treatment was associated with improvement regardless of objective active or sham treatment, improvement in the objective active TMS group who believed they received sham suggests the importance of objective treatment regardless of subjective treatment. In Study 3, including objective treatment in the model predicted more treatment variance, further suggesting the predictive value of objective treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and agree that the interpretation of findings requires a more nuanced and balanced description. We, therefore, implemented changes in both the abstract and discussion of the manuscript, as reported below (additions are highlighted in grey and deletions are shown in strikethrough):</p><p>Abstract</p><p>“Our findings consistently show that the inclusion of subjective treatment can provide a better model fit when accounted for alone or in an interaction term with objective treatment (defined as the condition to which participants are assigned in the experiment). These results demonstrate the significant contribution of subjective experience in explaining the variability of clinical, cognitive and behavioural outcomes. Based on these findings, We advocate for existing and future studies in clinical and non-clinical research to start accounting for participants’ subjective beliefs and their interplay with objective treatment when assessing the efficacy of treatments. This approach will be crucial in providing a more accurate estimation of the treatment effect and its source, allowing the development of effective and reproducible interventions.” (p. 3)</p><p>Discussion</p><p>“We demonstrate that participants’ subjective beliefs about receiving the active vs control (sham) treatment are an important factor that can explain variability in the primary outcome and, in some cases, fits the observed data better than the actual treatment participants received during the experiment.” (p. 21)</p><p>“We demonstrate that participants’ subjective beliefs about receiving the active vs control (sham) treatment are an important factor that can explain variability in the primary outcome and, in some cases, fits the observed data better than the actual treatment participants received during the experiment. Specifically, in Studies 1, 2 and 4, the fact that participants thought to be in the active or control condition explained variability in clinical and cognitive scores to a more considerable extent than the objective treatment alone. Notably, the same pattern of results emerged when we replaced subjective treatment with subjective dosage in the fourth experiment, showing that subjective beliefs about treatment intensity also explained variability in research results better than objective treatment. In contrast to Studies 1 and 4, Studies 2 and 3 showed a more complex pattern of results. Specifically, in Study 2 we observed an interaction effect, whereby the greatest improvement in depressive symptoms was observed in the group that received the active objective treatment but believed they received sham. Differently, in Study 3, the inclusion of both subjective and objective treatment as main effects explained variability in symptoms of inattention. Overall, these findings suggest the complex interplay of objective and subjective treatment. The variability in the observed results could be explained by factors such as participants’ personality, type and severity of the disorder, prior treatments, knowledge base, experimental procedures, and views of the research team, all of which could be interesting avenues for future studies to explore.” (p. 22)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(R1.3) In addition to updating the conclusions to better reflect this interaction, I suggest authors include the proportion of participants in each subjective treatment group that actually received active or sham treatment to better understand how much of the subjective treatment is explained by objective treatment. I think it is particularly important to better integrate and more precisely communicate this finding, because the conclusions may otherwise be erroneously interpreted as improvements after treatment only being an effect of subjective treatment or sham.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment.

Subjective experience or treatment refers to the patient level thought of receiving active or sham treatments. The analyses suggest that subjective treatment effects are an important and under appreciated factor in randomized controlled trials. The authors present compelling evidence that has significance in the context of other modalities of treatment, treatment for other diseases, and plans for future randomized controlled trials. Other strengths included a rigorous approach and analyses. Some aspects of the manuscript are underdeveloped and the findings are over interpreted. Thank you for your efforts and the opportunity to review your work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their overall appreciation of this work.

This is a complicated area of study with many variables that are not understood or captured. For example, subjective experience effects likely varies with personality dimensions, disease, prior treatments, knowledge base, view of the research team, and disease severity. Framing subjective experience with a more balanced tone, as an important consideration for future trial design and study execution would enhance the impact of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We reframed our interpretation of results in both the manuscript abstract and discussion, as highlighted in response to reviewer 1 (see R1.2) above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(R2.3) The discussion of sham approaches for transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation is underdeveloped. There are approaches that are not discussed. The tilt method is seldom used for modern studies for example.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and we now rewrote a paragraph elaborating more on different practices to apply sham procedures in the introduction section:</p><p>“Participants that take part in TMS and tES studies consistently report various perceptual sensations, such as audible clicks, visual disturbances, and cutaneous sensations (Davis et al., 2013) Consequently, they can discern when they have received the active treatment, making subjective beliefs and demand characteristics potentially influencing performance (Polanía et al., 2018). To account for such non-specific effects, sham (placebo) protocols have been employed. For transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), the most common form of tES, various sham protocols exist. A review by Fonteneau et al., 2019 shows 84% of 173 studies used similar sham approaches to an early method by Gandiga et al., 2005. This initial protocol had a 10s ramp-up followed by 30s of active stimulation at 1mA before cessation, differently from active stimulation that typically lasts up to 20 minutes.. However, this has been adapted in terms of intensity and duration of current, ramp-in/out phases, and the number of ramps during stimulation. Similarly, in sham TMS, the TMS coil may be tilted or replaced with purpose-built sham coils equipped with magnetic shields, which produce auditory effects but ensure no brain stimulation (Duecker &amp; Sack, 2015). By using surface electrodes, the somatosensory effects of actual TMS are also mimicked. Overall, these types of sham stimulation aim to mimic the perceptual sensations associated with active stimulation without substantially affecting cortical excitability (Fritsch et al., 2010; Nitsche &amp; Paulus, 2000). As a result, sham treatments should allow controlling for participants’ specificbeliefs about the type of stimulation received.” (p.6)</p><p>References</p><p>Fonteneau, C., Mondino, M., Arns, M., Baeken, C., Bikson, M., Brunoni, A.
