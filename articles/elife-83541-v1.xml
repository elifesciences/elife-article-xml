We examined the mammography screening participation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study population comprised all women aged 50-69 years old invited to participate in mammography screening from 2016-2021 in Denmark based on data from the Danish Quality Database for Mammography Screening in combination with population-based registries. Using a generalised linear model, we estimated prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of mammography screening participation within 90, 180 and 365 days since invitation during the pandemic in comparison with the previous years adjusting for age, year and month of invitation.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The study comprised 1,828,791 invitations among 847,766 women. Before the pandemic, 80.2% of invitations resulted in participation in mammography screening within 90 days, 82.7% within 180 days and 83.1% within 365 days. At the start of the pandemic, the participation in screening within 90 days was reduced to 69.9% for those invited in pre-lockdown and to 76.5% for those invited in 1<sup>st</sup> lockdown. Extending the length of follow-up time to 365 days only a minor overall reduction was observed (PR=0.94; 95% CI: 0.93-0.95 in pre-lockdown and PR=0.97; 95% CI: 0.96-0.97 in 1<sup>st</sup> lockdown). A lower participation was; however, seen among immigrants and among women with a low income.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The short-term participation in mammography screening was reduced at the start of the pandemic, whilst only a minor reduction in the overall participation was observed with longer follow-up time indicating that women postponed screening. Some groups of women; nonetheless, had a lower participation indicating that the social inequity in screening participation was exacerbated during the pandemic.</p><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The study was funded by the Danish Cancer Society Scientific Committee (grant number R321-A17417) and the Danish regions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Danish Cancer Society Scientific Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R321-A17417</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olesen</surname><given-names>Tina Bech</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Danish regions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olesen</surname><given-names>Tina Bech</given-names></name><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>Henry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Ethical considerationsThe study is registered at the Central Denmark Region's register of research projects (journal number 1-16-02-381-20).

Furthermore, patient consent is not required by Danish law for register-based studies.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional Files</title><sec id="s3" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data availability statementIn order to comply with the Danish regulations on data privacy, the datasets generated and analysed during this project are not publicly available as the data are stored and maintained electronically at Statistics Denmark, where it only can be accessed by pre-approved researchers using a secure VPN remote access. Furthermore, no data at a personal level nor data not exclusively necessary for publication are allowed to be extracted from the secure data environment at Statistics Denmark. Access to the data can; however, be granted by the authors of the present study upon a reasonable scientific proposal within the boundaries of the present project and for scientific purposes only. Scientific proposals should be forwarded to data analyst, PhD Henry Jensen at HERJEN@rkkp.dk.
