However, the molecular mechanisms driving these paternal effects and the developmental processes involved remain poorly understood. One underexplored possibility is the role of paternally induced effects on placenta development and function. To address this, we investigated paternal high-fat diet-induced obesity in relation to sperm histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation signatures, the placenta transcriptome, and cellular composition. C57BL6/J male mice were fed either a control or high-fat diet for 10 weeks beginning at 6 weeks of age. Males were timed-mated with control-fed C57BL6/J females to generate pregnancies, followed by collection of sperm, and placentas at embryonic day (E)14.5. Chromatin immunoprecipitation targeting histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed on sperm to define obesity-associated changes in enrichment. Paternal obesity corresponded with altered sperm H3K4me3 at promoters of genes involved in metabolism and development. Notably, altered sperm H3K4me3 was also localized at placental enhancers. Bulk RNA-sequencing on placentas revealed paternal obesity-associated sex-specific changes in expression of genes involved in hypoxic processes such as angiogenesis, nutrient transport, and imprinted genes, with a subset of de-regulated genes showing changes in H3K4me3 in sperm at corresponding promoters. Paternal obesity was also linked to impaired placenta development; specifically, a deconvolution analysis revealed altered trophoblast cell lineage specification. These findings implicate paternal obesity effects on placenta development and function as one potential developmental route to offspring metabolic disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>placenta</kwd><kwd>sperm chromatin</kwd><kwd>histone methylation</kwd><kwd>paternal epigenetic inheritance</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>358654</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kimmins</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>350129</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kimmins</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>146333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sloboda</surname><given-names>Deborah M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>175293</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sloboda</surname><given-names>Deborah M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Epigenomic and transcriptomic analysis reveals that paternal obesity influences sperm histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation enrichment and placenta gene expression, which in turn negatively impact its development and function in a manner that may contribute to metabolic disease in offspring.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The placenta is an extraembryonic organ that regulates fetal growth and development, and contributes to long-term adult health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Regnault et al., 2002</xref>). This complex tissue arises from the differentiation of distinct cell subtypes important for its functions. In the mouse, the cells that give rise to the placenta, the trophectoderm (TE) cell lineage, first appear in the preimplantation blastocyst at embryonic day 3.5 (E3.5). Blastocyst implantation begins at E4.5, triggering a cascade of paracrine, endocrine, and immune-related events that participate in endometrial decidualization. Cells of the TE overlying the embryonic inner cell mass serve as a source of multipotent trophoblast stem cells that diversify as a result of spatially and epigenetically regulated transcriptional cascades, giving rise to specialized trophoblast subtypes. The first placental fate segregation is between the extraembryonic ectoderm and ectoplacental cone (EPC). Cells of the EPC in direct contact with the decidua give rise to the cells with invasive and endocrine capacity, including trophoblast giants (TGCs), glycocen trophoblast, and spongiotrophoblast (SPT). Cells of the chorion will produce two layers of fused, multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast (SynT-I and SynT-II) and sinusoidal TGCs. From E8.5, the embryonic allantois becomes fused with the chorion, permitting invagination of mesoderm-derived angiogenic progenitors that form the basis of the placental vascular bed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hemberger et al., 2020</xref>). Together, these cells form a transportive interface, the placental labyrinth zone, which is functionally critical for sustaining fetal growth throughout gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Rossant and Cross, 2001</xref>). Interhemal transfer between maternal and fetal circulation begins at E10.5, and by E12.5, all terminally differentiated cell types of the mature placenta are present.</p><p>Genetic studies of placental development using mouse mutants have identified key genes for development, differentiation, maintenance, and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Perez-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Rossant and Cross, 2001</xref>). For example, homeobox transcription factors are required for trophoblast lineage development (e.g. genes <italic>Cdx2, Eomes</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chawengsaksophak et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ciruna and Rossant, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Kunath et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Russ et al., 2000</xref>), and maintenance of SPT requires the genes <italic>Ascl2</italic> and <italic>Egfr</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Guillemot et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Guillemot et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Sibilia and Wagner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Tanaka et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Threadgill et al., 1995</xref>). Another family of genes that have been shown to play critical roles in proper placenta development are imprinted genes. There exists 228 imprinted genes identified in humans and 260 in mice; many are strongly expressed in the placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Coan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Morison et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Tucci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Genomic imprinting refers to monoallelic gene expression that is dependent on whether the gene was inherited maternally or paternally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ferguson-Smith et al., 1991</xref>). The expression of imprinted genes is regulated by DNA methylation, acting in concert with chromatin modifications, such as histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) and histone H3 lysine 9 di-methylation (H3K9me2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Dindot et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">McEwen and Ferguson-Smith, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Wen et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, disruption of placental imprinting is associated with placentation defects and aberrant fetal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">McMinn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Monk, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">Zadora et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Placental defects can result in obstetrical complications such as pre-eclampsia, stillbirth, preterm birth, and fetal growth restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brosens et al., 2011</xref>). Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) in turn is associated with a heightened risk for adult-onset cardiometabolic diseases, coronary heart disease, and stroke, supporting a placental role in long-term health of offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brodszki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Crispi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Cruz-Lemini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Eriksson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Menendez-Castro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Mierzynski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Morsing et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Sarvari et al., 2017</xref>). Despite the many adverse pregnancy outcomes involving placental defects, the molecular and cellular factors that impact placental development are poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Naismith and Cox, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Perez-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>). Until recently, most studies on the origins of placental pathology have focused on maternal factors. For example, placental insufficiency occurs in 10â15% of pregnancies, and underlying causes include advanced maternal age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ales et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Torous and Roberts, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Krielessi et al., 2012</xref>), obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Delhaes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Lutsiv et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">MacInnis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Mission et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Sohlberg et al., 2012</xref>), cigarette smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Pintican et al., 2019</xref>), drug and alcohol use, and medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Sebastiani et al., 2018</xref>). However, emerging studies indicate that the paternal pre-conception environment including diet and obesity also play a critical role in placental development and offspring health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Binder et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Binder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jazwiec et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lambrot et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, genetic manipulation studies have determined that the paternal genome has greater potential for extraembryonic and trophoblast development compared to the maternal genome, and paternally expressed genes dominate placenta gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barton et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barton et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Mcgrath and Solter, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">McGrath and Solter, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Surani et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, we recently showed that sperm chromatin profiles highly resemble that of TE and placenta tissue, and H3K4me3-enriched regions in sperm are expressed in these tissues, highlighting a molecular connection from the male germline to the developing placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Pepin et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The connection between paternal gene expression and placenta development has led to a growing interest in the role of paternal factors in placental development and function and offspring health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). In mice, we demonstrated that paternal folate deficiency was associated with an altered sperm epigenome, differential gene expression in the placenta, and abnormal fetal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lambrot et al., 2013</xref>). In other mouse models, advanced paternal age and toxicant exposure have been linked to altered placental imprinting and reduced placental weight, and paternal obesity was linked to alterations in placental DNA methylation, aberrant allocation of cell lineage to TE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Binder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Binder et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Denomme et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ding et al., 2018</xref>).

As we described in our paternal obesity model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Pepin et al., 2022</xref>), sperm from obese males had aberrant H3K4me3 enrichment at genes implicated in metabolism and placenta development, and sired offspring with metabolic disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Pepin et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we used sperm and placenta from a similar paternal obesity model described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jazwiec et al., 2022</xref>, where we demonstrated paternal offspring born to obese fathers have impaired whole body energetics and are glucose intolerant. In addition, we showed that pregnancies sired by obese males were associated with placenta showing characteristics of hypoxia, accompanied by histo-morphological changes in blood vessel integrity. Specifically, histological and immunohistology analyses of placentas collected at E14.5 and E18.5 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jazwiec et al., 2022</xref>, revealed that paternal obesity resulted in significant changes in transcription factors that regulate blood vessel development, blood vessel integrity, and signaling pathways governed by hypoxia (HIF1A, VEGF, and VEGFR-2).</p><p>In the current study, we aimed to explore the relationship between the sperm epigenome and placenta gene expression.

Of note, this model does not compare diets that are experimentally controlled for macro- or micronutrients, but instead is used to assess the effects of obesity on the sperm epigenome and its impacts on placental development. First, we determined whether sperm H3K4me3 was similarly affected in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jazwiec et al., 2022</xref>, model in comparison to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Pepin et al., 2022</xref>.

Analysis of sequencing data revealed 35,184 regions enriched for H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>; Materials and methods) that were highly concordant across samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) on counts at sperm H3K4me3-enriched regions revealed separation of samples along principal component 1 (PC1) according to dietary treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). For downstream analyses, we focused on the top 5% regions (n=1760; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and the top 10% regions (n=3519) contributing to PC1, as we considered these to be most sensitive to obesity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Of the top 5% and top 10% differentially enriched H3K4me3 (deH3K4me3) regions, some were common to those previously identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Pepin et al., 2022</xref> (128 and 423 overlapping deH3K4me3 regions, Fisherâs exact test p=2.2e-16 and p=2.2e-16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1Di and ii</xref>, respectively). This was despite substantial differences in animal models (timing of diet exposure [3 versus 6 weeks of age], control diet [chow versus low-fat diet], and mouse substrain [C57BL/6J versus C57BL/6NCrl]). Focusing on the top 5% regions most impacted by obesity, the majority of regions showed an increase in enrichment for H3K4me3, consistent with our previous study (71.4%, n=1257 versus n=503, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Regions losing H3K4me3 showed moderate H3K4me3 enrichment in CON sperm, with predominantly low CpG density, whereas regions gaining H3K4me3 showed low-to-moderate enrichment, with mainly high CpG density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Regions not impacted by diet showed high H3K4me3 enrichment in CON sperm, with low and high CpG density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

To explore how altered H3K4me3 in sperm may lead to differential TF interactions, we searched for TF binding motifs enriched in deH3K4me3 regions (Materials and methods).

The reduction in the number of detected DEGs before versus after accounting for cellular composition suggests that changes in cell-type proportions at least partly drive tissue-level differential expression. This is consistent with the recent finding that pre-eclampsia-associated cellular heterogeneity in human placentas mediates previously detected bulk gene expression differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Campbell et al., 2023</xref>).

Hypoxia is also a hallmark of placental insufficiency, reflecting poor oxygen and nutrient supply to the fetus, resulting in fetal growth restriction, low birth weight, and consequently heightened risk for cardiometabolic disease. Placentas derived from obese sires, like hypoxic placentas, exhibit changes in gene expression and altered angiogenesis, vasculature, and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Binder et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Binder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jazwiec et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">McPherson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Mitchell et al., 2017</xref>, this study). To determine whether transcriptomic and pathological phenotypes in paternal obese-sired placentas relate to that of hypoxic placentas, we compared our HFD placenta RNA-seq data to a hypoxia-induced IUGR mouse model RNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chu et al., 2019</xref>). In this model, hypoxia was induced during late gestation, which resulted in pregnancies with aberrant placental transcriptome, IUGR, decreased birth weights, and offspring exhibiting adult-onset cardiometabolic disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chu et al., 2019</xref>). We conducted differential gene expression analysis of the RNA-seq data from the IUGR mouse model using the same approach as used for the obese-sired placenta analysis. Because this dataset did not include a sufficient number of female placenta samples, we focused the analysis on male samples only (n=5 control, n=5 hypoxic placentas). This differential analysis identified 1935 DEGs in hypoxic placentas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>). Likewise, we applied our deconvolution analysis described above to this bulk RNA-seq data from hypoxic placentas and detected the same principal cell types as those detected in our samples; a total of 17 different cell types were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Remarkably, the proportion values for each individual cell types were highly comparable across placentas from the HFD-sire and the hypoxia mouse models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Similarly to placentas derived from obese sires, hypoxic placentas showed a significant decrease in invasive SPT cell abundance (p=0.003, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

PCA on placental cellular proportion values revealed a separation of samples between the control and hypoxic placentas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Similarly to the analysis on HFD placentas, we used the top principal components (n=4 explaining 98.8% of the sample cell proportion variance) to adjust the differential expression analysis for cellular composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). Consistent with our data on placentas derived from HFD-fed sires, the cell types contributing the most to sample variance included the invasive SPT cells, endodermal cells (<italic>Afp</italic>-high), and decidual stromal cells. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1G</xref>). Additionally, erythroblast cells (<italic>Hbb-y</italic>-high) and spiral artery TGCs also strongly contributed to sample variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1G</xref>).

These data suggest that like paternal obesity-induced placental de-regulated genes, differential gene expression in hypoxic placentas is partly driven by changes in cellular composition.</p><p>Importantly, after adjusting for cell-type proportions, 207 of the paternal-obesity-induced dysregulated genes in male placentas were also found to be differentially expressed in hypoxic placentas (Fisherâs exact test p=5.1e-16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). A key gene supporting this similarity in the molecular pathology of hypoxic placenta and obese sired placenta was the dysregulation of the imprinted gene <italic>Igf2</italic>. These data are concordant with our previous characterization of paternal obese-sired placentas, whereby placentas showed vascular integrity defects and elevated hypoxia markers that are suggestive of placental insufficiency. Furthermore, both models resulted in metabolic disturbances in offspring, supporting the role of the placenta at the origin of paternally induced metabolic maladaptation. Collectively, our comparative analyses of placental transcriptomic data from both models indicate that paternal obesity, like gestational hypoxia, induces pathological and molecular characteristics that are hallmarks of placental insufficiency. The placental defects may elicit serious pregnancy complications like pre-eclampsia, and contribute to maladaptive metabolic programming of the fetus, resulting in adult-onset heightened risk to cardiometabolic diseases. Overall, these findings have implications for both maternal and offspring health and underscore the contribution of the placenta in the paternal origins of health and disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Paternal health and environmental exposures impact the establishment of the sperm epigenome and are associated with altered development of the placenta, embryo, and offspring health. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying paternal obesity effects on offspring are still unclear. Our findings build on prior knowledge to show that paternal obesity is associated with altered sperm chromatin, specifically H3K4me3, and changes in the placental transcriptome. We show that paternal obesity influences the placenta transcriptome and this is one mechanism that could underlie paternally induced placental pathogenesis, growth impeded embryo development, and adult-onset metabolic phenotypes.</p><p>We further observed that paternal HFD-induced obesity alters the placental transcriptome in a sex-specific manner. There is strong evidence demonstrating sex disparity in metabolic phenotypes and cardiometabolic disease risks (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Tramunt et al., 2020</xref>). These sex-specific effects are thought to be driven by sex chromosomes, hormonal factors, the gut microbiome, as well as differential fetal programming across sex in response to pre-conception and in utero exposures (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Sandovici et al., 2022</xref>). Here, our findings suggest some of the postnatal metabolic disturbances observed in paternally induced offspring sexually dimorphic phenotypes are established in the placenta. Interestingly, some of the de-regulated genes included imprinted genes. These genes are epigenetically controlled and inherited in a parent-of-origin manner, and the placenta is a key organ for imprinted gene function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Wood and Oakey, 2006</xref>). According to the conflict hypothesis, maternally imprinted genes (paternally expressed) support fetal growth, whereas paternally imprinted genes (maternally expressed) restrict fetal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bressan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Haig and Graham, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Moore and Haig, 1991</xref>). Some of the dysregulated imprinted genes we identified have been implicated in placental defects and pregnancy complications. For example, deletion of the gene <italic>Htra3</italic> (identified here as a DEG in female placentas) in mice has been implicated in IUGR owing to the disorganization of placental labyrinthine capillaries and thereby affecting offspring growth trajectories postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The maternally expressed gene <italic>Copg2</italic> (identified here as a DEG in female placentas) has been associated with pregnancies with small for gestational age infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kappil et al., 2015</xref>). Loss of the paternally expressed gene <italic>Snx14</italic> in mice (identified here as a DEG in female placentas) causes severe placental pathology involving aberrant SynT differentiation, leading to mid-gestation embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bryant et al., 2020</xref>). The paternally expressed gene <italic>Zdbf2</italic> (DEG in male placentas) has been implicated in reduced fetal growth in mice, associated with altered appetite signals in the hypothalamic circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Glaser et al., 2022</xref>). Placental deficiency of the paternally expressed gene <italic>Slc38a2</italic> (identified here as a DEG in male placentas) leads to fetal growth restriction in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Vaughan et al., 2021</xref>). Lastly, mice deficient for the paternally expressed transcriptional co-repressor <italic>Tle3</italic> (identified here as a DEG in male placentas) show abnormal placental development including TGC differentiation failure, resulting in fetal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gasperowicz et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, disrupting the expression of a single imprinted gene can result in placental defect and consequently compromise fetal health or survival. It is therefore likely that the differential expression of imprinted genes detected in female and male placentas as a result of paternal obesity could at least partly explain metabolic phenotypes observed in this mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jazwiec et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Pepin et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We identified changes in sperm H3K4me3 associated with paternal obesity, some of which were enriched for transcription factor binding sites. Interestingly, changes in sperm DNA methylation upon HFD feeding has been previously reported, and ETS motifs (enriched in obesity-associated deH3K4me3 in sperm) have been found to be DNA methylation sensitive, including in spermatogonial stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Domcke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Dura et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Lea et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Yin et al., 2017</xref>). Given the interplay between H3K4 and DNA methylation, it is conceivable that HFD-induced epimutations at either of these marks could influence one another (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Janssen and Lorincz, 2022</xref>), and these could in turn alter TF functions. This phenomenon has been described in a mouse model of paternal low-protein diet, where oxidative stress-induced phosphorylation of the ATF7 TF was suggested to impede its DNA-binding affinity in germ cells, leading to a decrease in H3K9me2 at target regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Yoshida et al., 2020</xref>). As in the low-protein diet model, oxidative stress is a hallmark of obesity and increased levels of reactive oxygen species have been observed in testes of diet-induced obesity mouse models and linked to impaired embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Fullston et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Lane et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Mitchell et al., 2011</xref>). These findings provide avenues for further investigation such as whether epigenetic changes on paternal alleles may impact TF binding during early embryogenesis.</p><p>We previously reported in the same model from which our placenta samples are derived that paternal obesity leads to functional and histopathological abnormalities in placenta and dysfunctional offspring metabolism. The epigenomic link between sperm enrichment differences in H3K4me3 and DEGs in placenta are minor. While not statistically significant we would argue that this does not rule out the likely biological significance of deH3K4me3 in sperm. For example, in a recent epigenome editing model from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Takahashi et al., 2023</xref>, using embryonic stem cells, CpG islands in promoters for either the <italic>Ankrd26</italic> or <italic>Ldlr</italic> genes were targeted to alter DNA methylation then injected into 8-cell embryos. These embryos gave rise to mice with metabolic phenotypes. This is a key example showing that a single epigenetic change at one gene can give rise to a phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">McNamara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Nativio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Takahashi et al., 2023</xref>). In addition, the limited overlap between sperm deH3K4me3 and placenta DEGs may also reflect the terminally differentiated state and heterogenous nature of the placenta at E14.5. Perhaps a greater correspondence between sperm deH3K4me3 may have been observed at earlier developmental time points such as at first lineage segregation corresponding to trophoblast formation. In future studies, it will be worthwhile to examine the trophoblast gene expression in comparison to deH3K4me3 in sperm. Indeed, we previously showed by in silico analysis that most regions bearing H3K4me3 in sperm are enriched for this mark in TE, correlate with TE H3K4me3 signal, and correspond to genes expressed in TE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Pepin et al., 2022</xref>). Another limitation of this study is that placenta profiles are from bulk RNA-seq and measures average gene expression across a heterogenous cell population and identification of DEGs can therefore be confounded by cell composition. To address this, we used a deconvolution approach in our analysis using a single-cell RNA-seq dataset.</p><p>The identification of alterations of cell-type proportion must be considered within the limitations of a deconvolution analysis. This analysis only provides estimates of cell type relative within a heterogeneous tissue. While this allowed us to adjust for the effect of differences in cell-type composition, the exact cell-type composition and their specific gene expression changes need to be validated by single-cell approaches such as single-cell RNA-seq or spatial transcriptomics. Furthermore, even though we used a reference dataset which included cells representative of placental tissues, the detection capacity of this approach is limited for low-abundant cell types, such as blood cells, immune cells, and inflammatory cells, which would be informative of placental pathological states. For example, aberrant abundance of decidual inflammatory cells, such as natural killer cells, has been linked to the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aneman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bachmayer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Du et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Milosevic-Stevanovic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Williams et al., 2009</xref>). Incidentally, it was previously shown that paternal diet-induced obesity is associated with placental inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Claycombe-Larson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jazwiec et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, many GO terms related to inflammatory processes were enriched in the obesity-induced deH3K4me3 in sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Pepin et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting sperm deH3K4me3 might be partly influencing placental inflammation. However, due to the low representation of immune cells in the dataset this could not be assessed.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Speculation and perspectives</title><p>Many of the DEGs in the paternal obese-sired placentas were involved in the regulation of the heart and brain.

The brain-placenta and heart-placenta axes refer to their developmental linkage to the trophoblast which produces various hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors that are central to brain and heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Parrettini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Rosenfeld, 2021</xref>).

For example, in a study of the relationship between placental pathology and neurodevelopment of infants, possible hypoxic conditions were a significant predictor of lower Mullen Scales of Early Learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Ueda et al., 2022</xref>). A connecting factor between the neural and cardiovascular phenotypes is the neural crest cells which make a critical contribution to the developing heart and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hemberger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Perez-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, neural crest cells are of ectodermal origin which arises from the TE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Prasad et al., 2019</xref>), which is in turn governed by paternally driven gene expression. It is worth considering the routes by which TE dysfunction may be implicated in the paternal origins of metabolic and cardiovascular disease. First, altered placenta gene expression beginning in the TE could influence the specification of neural crest cells which are a developmental adjacent cell lineage in the early embryo. TE signaling to neural crest cells could alter their downstream function. Second, altered trophoblast endocrine function will influence cardiac and neurodevelopment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hemberger et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In line with these possible routes to developmental origins of obesity and metabolic disease, paternal obesity was associated with altered trophoblast lineage specification. During placentation, invasive SPT have the ability to migrate and invade the maternal-fetal interface and replace maternal vascular endothelial cells, a critical step for maternal arterial remodeling to facilitate low resistance and high volume blood flow to the fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Silva and Serakides, 2016</xref>). Consequently, improper trophoblastic invasion has been linked to various obstetrical complications, including premature birth, fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, and placenta creta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barrientos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Duzyj et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">OâTierney-Ginn and Lash, 2014</xref>). Paternal obesity also induced changes in trophoblasts expressing the glucocorticoid metabolizing enzyme HSD11B2. In the placenta, HSD11B2 is responsible for the conversion of cortisol into its inactive form, cortisone, which limits fetal exposure to maternal glucocorticoid levels. Interestingly, de-regulation of the gene <italic>Hsd11b2</italic> has been observed in rodent fetal growth restriction models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cuffe et al., 2014</xref>). These aberrant cellular composition profiles suggest that paternal factors, such as diet, can induce functional changes in the placenta that mirror placental defects associated with adult-onset cardiometabolic phenotypes.</p><p>Next, it will be important to assess earlier developmental time points to determine when and how these paternally induced effects originate. Indeed, studies have shown that paternal obesity alters preimplantation development, such as cellular allocation to TE versus ICM lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Binder et al., 2012</xref>). Investigating multiple and earlier time points would help reveal the dynamic trajectory of paternally induced de-regulated transcriptomic and epigenetic signatures which might be at the origin of adult-onset disease. Translating these findings to humans will be beneficial to further understand and emphasize the paternal preconception contribution to pregnancy outcomes, placental integrity, and offspring

and dietary treatment</title><p>Animal experiments were conducted at the McMaster University Central Animal Facility, approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board, and in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines, under the Animal Utilization Protocol #16-09-35. Six-week-old C57BL/6J male mice were co-housed (2 per cage) and randomly allocated to either the control (n=8; CON; standard chow diet, Harlan 8640, Teklad 22/5 Rodent Diet; 17% kcal fat, 54% kcal carbohydrates, 29% kcal protein, 3 kcal/g) or HFD (n=16; HFD; Research Diets Inc, D12492; 20% kcal protein, 20% kcal carbohydrates, 60% kcal fat, 5.21 kcal/g) group, for 10â12 weeks. All animals had free access to water and food ad libitum, housed in the same room which was maintained at 25Â°C on a controlled 12 hr/12 hr light/dark cycle. Two weeks prior mating and throughout the mating period, male mice were housed individually to prevent fighting and aggression, and to facilitate timed mating. We have previously reported and characterized this model of HFD-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jazwiec et al., 2022</xref>). As reported in our previous work, male mice fed a HFD became significantly heavier weighing approximately 40 g (20 g in weight gain); had elevated body adiposity; elevated fasting blood glucose; were glucose intolerant; had significantly increased serum insulin concentrations, and were insulin resistant as assessed by HOMA-IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jazwiec et al., 2022</xref>). Food consumption data was not collected. High-fat male mice had impaired mating efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jazwiec et al., 2022</xref>), and therefore more males were needed in the high fat-fed group compared to controls to generate a sufficient number of pregnancies and placental tissue for RNA-seq experiments.</p><p>After the diet intervention, male mice were housed with one or two virgin C57BL/6J females overnight. To confirm mating, females were examined the following morning, and the presence of a copulatory plug was referred to as E0.5. Females confirmed as pregnant were individually housed throughout gestation and fed a standard chow diet (Harlan 8640, Teklad 22/5 Rodent Diet). Pregnant females (n=4 CON; n=5 HFD) were sacrificed at E14.5 by cervical dislocation to collect placenta samples for RNA-seq. One male and one female placenta samples per dam were collected. Placenta were cut in half, with one half snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at â80Â°C until RNA extraction. CON- and HFD-fed male mice were sacrificed at 4â5 months of age via cervical dislocation, and sperm was collected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Methods details</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Sperm isolation</title><p>Sperm was collected at necropsy from paired caudal epididymides as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Hisano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Lismer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Pepin et al., 2022</xref>). Caudal epididymides were cut in 5 mL of Donners medium (25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20 mg/mL Bovine Serum Albumin [BSA], 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.53% vol/vol sodium DL-lactate in Donners stock), and spermatozoa were allowed to swim out by agitating the solution for 1 hr at 37Â°C. Sperm cells were collected by passing the solution through a 40 Âµm strainer (Fisher Scientific, #22363547) followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The sperm pellet was cryopreserved at â80Â°C in freezing medium (Irvine Scientific, cat#:90128) until used for the chromatin immunoprecipitation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation, library preparation, and sequencing</title><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Hisano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Lismer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Pepin et al., 2022</xref>). In brief, samples were thawed on ice and washed with PBS. Spermatozoa were counted under a microscope using a hemocytometer and 12 million cells were used per experiment. Pools of sperm from 2 to 7 male mice per sample were used for ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Each pool was equalized in cell number and comprised of sperm from n=8 control males, or n=16 HFD males. This pooling was required to create replicates with an equal amount of total sperm. We used 1 M dithiothreitol (DTT, Bio Shop, cat#:3483-12-3) to decondense the chromatin and <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide was used to quench the reaction. Cell lysis was performed with a lysis buffer (0.3 M sucrose, 60 mM KCl, 15 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1% deoxycholate, and 0.5% NP40). DNA digestion was performed in aliquots containing 2 million spermatozoa (6 aliquots per sample), with micrococcal nuclease (MNase, 15 units per tube; Roche, #10107921001) in an MNase buffer (0.3 M sucrose, 85 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) for 5 min at 37Â°C. The reaction was stopped with 5 mM EDTA. Supernatants of the 6 aliquots were pooled back together for each sample after a 10 min centrifugation at maximum speed. A 1Ã solution of protease inhibitor (complete Tablets EASYpack, Roche, #04693116001) was added to each tube. Magnetic beads (DynaBeads, Protein A, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #10002D) used in subsequent steps were pre-blocked in 0.5% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, #BP1600-100) solution for 4 hr at 4Â°C. Pre-clearing of the chromatin was done with the pre-blocked beads for 1 hr at 4Â°C. Magnetic beads were allowed to bind with 5 Âµg of antibody (Histone H3 Lysine 4 tri-methylation; H3K4me3; Cell Signaling Technology, cat#:9751) by incubating for 8 hr at 4Â°C. The pre-cleared chromatin was pulled down with the beads-antibody suspension overnight at 4Â°C. Beads-chromatin complexes were subjected to three rounds of washes; one wash with a low-salt buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 75 mM NaCl) and two washes with a high-salt buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 125 mM NaCl). Elution of the chromatin was done in two steps with 250 ÂµL (2Ã125 ÂµL) of elution buffer (0.1 M HaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.2% SDS, 5 mM DTT) by shaking the solution at 400 rpm for 10 min at 65Â°C, vortexing vigorously, and transferring the eluate in a clean tube. The eluate was subjected to an RNase A (5 ÂµL, Sigma-Aldrich, #10109169001) treatment shaking at 400 rpm for 1 hr at 37Â°C, followed by an overnight Proteinase K (5 ÂµL, Sigma-Aldrich, #P2308) treatment at 55Â°C. The <italic>ChIP DNA Clean and Concentrator</italic> (Zymo Research, #D5201) kit was used following the manufacturerâs protocol to purify the eluted DNA with 25 ÂµL of the provided elution buffer.

Lysates were centrifuged, supernatants transferred into a clean tube, and 70% ethanol was added to lysates. An additional DNase digestion step was performed to avoid DNA contamination. Spin columns were washed twice, and total RNA was eluted with 30 ÂµL of RNase-free water.

Using <italic>csaw</italic> (version 1.22.1), sequencing reads were counted into 150 base-pair windows along the genome, and those with a fold-change enrichment of 4 over the number of reads in 2000 base-pair bins were considered as genomic regions enriched with H3K4me3 in sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Lun and Smyth, 2016</xref>). Enriched windows less than 100 base-pair apart were merged allowing a maximum width of 5000 base-pair (n=35,186 merged enriched regions in total). Reads were counted in those defined regions, and those with a mean count below 10 across samples were filtered out (conferring a total of n=35,184 regions).

The deconvolution analysis was performed following the AutoGeneS packageâs available code (version 1.0.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aliee and Theis, 2021</xref>). In brief, single-cell counts were log normalized and the 4000 most highly variable genes were selected. A principal component analysis was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) and the cell types previously annotated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Han et al., 2018</xref>, were visualized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). The means of each centroids for each cell type cluster was used for optimization and feature selection. AutoGeneS uses a multi-objective optimization approach to select marker genes. In this process, a search algorithm explores a set of optimal solutions (commonly called Pareto-optimal solutions) and evaluates the objective functions (in this case, correlation and distance between the cell-type-specific clusters; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C and D</xref>). This optimization technique allows to select the 400 marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Lastly, the Nu-support vector machine regression model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Pedregosa et al., 2011</xref>) was used to estimate the cell-type proportions for the bulk RNA-seq data from this study and from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chu et al., 2019</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This important study presents data suggesting that HFD-induced epimutations in sperm may impact the transcriptome of the placenta, thereby contributing to the paternal transmission of metabolic disorders to offspring. The strength of this work includes the interesting idea and the initial data generated. However, the entire study remains purely correlative without any validation experiment to support the correlation. The conclusion needs to be further supported by a bigger sample size and more functional analyses demonstrating the causal relationship among histone epimutations detected, dysregulated mRNA expression in the placenta, and phenotypes in offspring.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) Proper statistical analyses for correlating the H3K4me3 changes with DEGs of RNA-seq data, for evaluating effect size vs. intra-sample variations, and for analyzing other sequencing data.</p><p>2) More functional validation to support that the altered placental gene expression causes phenotypes in both placental functions and offspring development and health.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study reports H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data on sperm from HDF male mice and the placental tissue of their offspring. By comparing the altered H3K4me3 marks in sperm with the same mark and gene expression levels in the placenta, the authors identified numerous histone epimutation-dysregulated mRNA pairs of a potential causal relationship. The finding is interesting, but the conclusion is premature due to a lack of functionally supportive data. Therefore, the authors need to either tone down their claim or provide more functional data to support their notion. In addition, this reviewer has the following specific comments:</p><p>1) The ideal control for HFD is the ingredient control diet manufactured to specifically match the composition of HFD except for in fat and sugar contents. The so-called control chow may contain many components that do not match the HFD, thus contributing to the epimutations detected.</p><p>2) The sample size appears to be very small, and intra-samples/mice variations in the histone marks might be greater than the effect size. Unless proper statistical analyses are employed to prove otherwise, the differences detected may not represent true signals.</p><p>3) The notion that sperm tend to regulate placental gene expression needs to be supported experimentally.</p><p>4) It is essential to phenotype the offspring to determine whether the changes in placental transcriptome indeed have an impact on offspring metabolic states.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>General comments:</p><p>The text is well written and the figures are generally well presented and clear. The general flow of the manuscript could be improved, as it is not always entirely clear to the reader what the authors were thinking when carrying out a set of experiments. More specific suggestions and comments are provided below.</p><p>1. Specifically, regarding the general flow, the part about the transcription factor binding motifs is interesting but the authors should specify what they hypothesize may be happening: Would transcription in the sperm be altered prior to conception? Do they think this is carried over into the zygote? Where would the transcription factors be coming from?</p><p>2. In the part where sequencing data from Chu et al. (2019) is used, more information is needed about this study to put the presented findings into context for the reader: What kind of model for hypoxia is used in this publication? Why was this chosen and not any other paternal intervention â the justification l. 304 &quot;Placentas derived from obese sires, like hypoxic placentas, exhibit changes in gene expression and altered angiogenesis, vasculature, and development&quot; is very unspecific and likely applies to a number of different interventions therefore the choice of this dataset and model over others should be justified well.</p><p>3. The manuscript would greatly benefit from an additional experiment probing a causal relationship between the examined mechanisms. At the moment it is full of correlations, some of which are overstated, and the limitations of the methods are not discussed enough.</p><p>4. Regarding the Methods, the control diet is not the best control for the HFD, because it is from a different supplier. The fact that it is from a different manufacturer means that the content, not just fat levels, is likely completely different. This should at least be mentioned by the authors, within the limitations of this methodological issues addressed in the text. However, ideally the key experiments should ideally be performed again, using controlled diets (high fat and lower/control fat levels) from the same manufacturer, so that any differences can be related to fat (rather than potentially other molecular constituents that differ between manufacturers).</p><p>5. Were the males group or single housed during the diet intervention? How much weight did the HFD males put on compared to controls i.e. how severe was the obesity? How much food did they consume? Was their reproductive function impacted? And is this why n value for HFD was double that of controls? Some information about this aspect (e.g. in further supplementary figures) would be informative.</p><p>6. Several descriptions of procedures appear vague and need to be clarified. Why were the procedures not always the same? In which cases did they vary? The authors should be clear why there were various different protocols in place.</p><p>â E.g.: high-fat diet was given to males for &quot;8-10 weeks&quot;</p><p>â E.g.: Males were mated with &quot;1-2 females&quot;</p><p>â E.g.: Pools of sperm for ChIP-seq consisted of &quot;2-7 males&quot;</p><p>This detail specifically, in combination with the knowledge that F0 groups were n=8 for the controls and n=16 for the HFD, gives the impression that the samples were likely not equal for both experimental groups in that the pools for HFD would have been systematically larger, leading to deeper sequencing and other differences? This may constitute a methodological flaw as it may introduce a bias in the sequencing data.</p><p>7. With n=3 in ChIP-seq and n=4 per group in RNA Seq, the sample sizes are on the lower end (bare minimum) of what is considered valid. These analyses are likely underpowered and at least require independent validation, especially if the role of specific genes is discussed as mechanistically relevant.</p><p>8. In the same vein, in the GO analysis in Figure 2E(i), many of the significantly enriched pathways are only represented with a single gene, including the placenta morphogenesis pathway. The authors seem to overstate this result on l. 234 by using the plural of genes: &quot;As deH3K4me3 in sperm was located at genes involved in placental formation (Figure 2 E and Pepin et al., 2022), we assessed whether paternal obesity was associated with changes in gene expression of the placenta.&quot; If this result is assigned such importance to, it would be important to validate the result.</p><p>9. In the Results, the formulation of some results gives the wrong impression/ overstates the actual result. The authors should be generally more careful in their statements and qualify them.</p><p>10. For example, on l.166: &quot;Despite differences in experimental design and animal models, we found a significant overlap in regions showing differential (H3K4me3 deH3K4me3) from both studies (128 overlapping regions, Fisher's exact test P=2.2e-16, Figure S1 D)&quot;. These are 128 regions out of 1632 and 1410 regions, so less than 10% overlap. Therefore, in fact this is a surprisingly low overlap despite methodological similarities, and should be discussed as such, not the opposite.</p><p>11. Another example is l. 322: &quot;Overall, the trends for directionality of changes in specific cellular abundances were consistent across the two mouse models (Figure 6B).&quot; While the effects on cell type abundance cannot be said to substantially diverge, saying they are consistent may be overstating things. From the data, it appears that hypoxia has a much stronger effect. This should be discussed in terms of differences between the models etc, not glossed over as &quot;consistent&quot;.</p><p>12. In Figure S3D (ii)/(iii): Do those genes which are differentially expressed in males and females from HFD fathers and also differentially methylated in sperm (45 in F, 48 in M) overlap at all?</p><p>13. The authors state they perform the cell-type based deconvolution of sequencing data because transcriptional differences between cell types can be obscured by averaging of expression data over many cell types in Bulk tissue RNA-Seq. This is true, however the re-analysis actually leads to a much lower number of DEGs detected (as shown in FiguresS6G,H). This should be noted and discussed by the authors.</p><p>14. In the same deconvolution analysis, the authors state they detect 15 cell types, out of 28 detected by the original study from which the dataset was taken. Why do the authors think this is the case? This means almost half the cell types are not included in the tissue sample? Or are they too low in abundance to detect? This should be mentioned.</p><p>15. The Discussion seems a little superficial. It should delve more into the implications and limitations of the study.</p><p>16. The discussion of specific genes is inappropriate in the absence of validation experiments.</p><p>17. In Figure S1 C: This PCA analysis looks strange: the points for both groups are perfectly symmetrical. Is this an artefact? I cannot make sense of a scenario where this would be the result.</p><p>18. Figure S1E: It is unclear from the figure and figure legend what the numbers 1-15 indicate.</p><p>19. The representations of cell type abundance in the placenta are too small, in combination with very thick lines and bold fonts, they are difficult to read. (e.g. Figure 5A, 6A, S5, S7D).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The study would be significantly strengthened by a more nuanced analysis of the data, as well as more specific follow up and functional validation of individual genes that may be responsible for placental phenotypes in offspring. For example, in situ hybridization or Western blots in placenta to confirm the expression differences detected by RNA-seq would better support the claims.</p><p>2) Validation of deconvolution analysis, for example by sorting or immunofluorescence to experimentally validate the cell type composition of the placentas, would increase confidence in the deconvolution results.</p><p>3) Statistical tests (e.g. Fisher's Exact test) should be done to show the significance of overlaps when comparing gene sets.</p><p>4) Because the differences in H3K4me3 signal between conditions appear to be very modest (Figure 2B, 2F), it is not clear whether these differences are real or just due to variations between libraries. Spike-ins in the ChIP libraries would drastically improve confidence in these differences.</p><p>5) In Figure S3C (PCA for placenta RNA-seq data), there does not seem to be good separation between placental gene expression in offspring of HFD compared to control sires. This should be explained.</p><p>6) In Figure 2D: regions losing H3K4me3 are predominantly &gt;5kb from the TSS. Can an explanation of what these sites are likely to correspond to be provided? Most sites of strong H3K4me3 are at a TSS.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors build upon their previous work on mouse models testing the contribution of parental diet to the health and development of the offspring. Previously, the Sloboda lab had reported that HFD induced placental hypoxia while the Kimmins lab had identified genomic regions that show differentially enrichment of H3K4me3 upon HFD. With this work the authors aim to explore &quot;the role of paternally driven gene expression in placenta&quot; as well as the potential role of H3K4me3 in transmitting information from sperm to embryo.</p><p>Firstly, the authors assessed H3K4me3 changes in sperm samples of the HFD model from the Kimmins lab. They identified DE regions of H3K4me3 between HFD and control sperm and annotated these regions based on their genomic location (promoter/enhancer). Next, the authors associated these genomic locations to genes for which they performed ontology analysis. In addition, they performed Motif enrichment analysis</p><p>Secondly, the authors performed bulk RNAseq in placentas of embryos sired either from HFD or control males mated with C57BL6/J females. They performed differential gene expression analysis and tried to associate the placenta DE genes to sperm DE H3K4me3 regions. They further performed deconvolution of the bulk RNA seq data to identify cellularity biases of the placentae and finally they compared their data to external RNA seq data from hypoxic placentae.</p><p>The bioinformatic analysis is rigorous, however the design of the experiments cannot support the initial aims of the authors. For example, to identify paternally driven gene expression the authors should have used female animals on a different genetic background (other than C57BL6/J) to be able to differentiate between the parental origins of transcripts based on SNPs. The current experiment shows transcriptional differences that cannot be attributed to the parental origin. We cannot exclude the possibility of paternal expression affecting maternal expression in trans. In addition, as the authors acknowledge in the manuscript that the association of DEGs in placenta to sperm differentially H3K4 methylated regions is difficult given the high cellular heterogeneity within the tissue. Hence, the authors are recommended to isolate cells that they identified to be more affected. In addition, or alternatively, the authors could investigate trophoblast cells from blastocyst embryos that give rise to placenta. In summary, the overall design of the study is not optimal, which together with rather confusing writing does not help the field to understand the impact of paternal HFD diet on chromatin landscape in sperm and physiology in offspring.</p><p>1. One major objective of the study is to relate changes in H3K4me3 occupancy levels in sperm to transcriptional changes in placenta. From the current data analyses, it is not clear at which genomic regions H3K4me3 levels have changed in a statistically significant manner between dietary conditions using the data of the replicates. When describing changes, please include fold change and adjusted p-values. Given that the authors used the csaw package to determine and normalize the H3K4me3 regions why they didn't perform the statistical significance analysis of differential enrichment using the csaw embedded functions?</p><p>2. Related to the first comment, this reviewer does not observe any difference in H3K4me3 levels for Cbx7 nor for Igf2, while Prdx6 and Slc19a1 seems to have increased H3K4me3 levels (Figure 2F). What is the significance value for changes for these 4 genomic windows? It should be indicated in the figure. For Igf2, it is not clear whether the peaks localize at its promoter or somewhere in the gene. It appears more likely to be the latter. If so, what is the significance for such occupancy for gene regulation potential? Moreover, given the prominent role that Igf2 plays within the manuscript, have the authors observed any change in H3K4me3 at the germ line ICR for this locus, which has been shown to be critical for paternal transmission of the paternal epiallele and imprinted expression in offspring? Any change in DNA methylation? Likewise, for Kcnq1 which in placental tissues is normally maternally expressed and paternally repressed by Polycomb repression system. What about H3K4me3 levels at the Kcnq1ot1 ICR element?</p><p>3. For a histone modification to fulfill a possible role in paternal inheritance, what are the overall nucleosomal occupancy levels at the deH3K4me3 regions in sperm, compared to genome wide average levels in control and HFD samples?</p><p>4. Figure S1D/E: What is the directionality of H3K4me3 changes (increased, decreased) between the two studies?</p><p>5. The authors report that &quot;Regions losing H3K4me3 showed moderate H3K4me3-enrichment in 173 CON sperm, with predominantly low CpG density, whereas regions gaining H3K4me3 showed low-to moderate enrichment with mainly high CpG density (Figure 2 C)&quot;. What could the reason be for the sequence specificity of such changes? Are there any changes in H3K27me3 levels at deH3K4me3? It is quite noticeable that none of the sites gaining H3K4me3 in HFD samples reach the level of H3K4me3 observed at CpG-rich regions in sperm of controls (grey dots in figure 2C). Why? Would it have any impact on possible transmission rates?</p><p>6. To be able to interpret / &quot;normalize&quot; the data presented in panel 2D, please provide the distribution of windows relative to TSS according to their presence in genome.</p><p>7. Figure 2E: It seems as if the GO-term for regions with decreased H3K4me3 levels serve more likely functions in placenta than those with increased levels.</p><p>8. Regarding enhancers, the current data presentation is rather superficial. To substantiate some of these findings, to what extent do the changes in H3K4me3 as monitored in sperm reflect changes in expression in testicular cells of HFD exposed males? Are any of the three genes highlighted (Tmem174, Plag1, Pdgfb) differentially expressed in placentas of male and female embryos?</p><p>9. Discovery of TF motif: when searching for TF motif enrichments in genomic windows, have the authors taken into account that the GC percentage underlying these windows is very different between regions with decreased and increased H3K4me3 levels? This has a major impact on the obtained results.</p><p>10. The authors state that previous reports indicated changes in DNA methylation after HFD exposure (line 217). Is there any link between DNA methylation and H3K4me3 alterations?</p><p>11. &quot;In response to paternal obesity, we detected 2,035 and 2,365 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in female and male placentas, respectively (Figure 4 A-B).&quot; How many DEGs are detected if authors compare the male control to female control placentas. This will help to understand which is ground truth of sex specific differences of placentas. How many are UP versus DOWN regulated in the respective sexes? How have the authors harvested the placentas? Which parts of placenta and decidua was included in the RNA-sample prep.?</p><p>12. When reviewing the heatmaps of imprinted genes in females, 1 out of 4 HFD placenta clusters with controls; for males, only 2 HFD placentas show altered gene expression. How do these changes relate to the histological changes? Why is there variation at all? How relevant would the DEGs be for phenotypic changes? Could imprinted expression serve as a means to classify the severity of the perturbation in embryos/placenta? Histological data would be needed for benchmarking.</p><p>13. Regarding imprinted genes, which ones are commonly mis-expressed in male and female placenta (e.g. Runx1, Ano1) and which are sex specific? Why? How have the imprinted genes been chosen? Please indicate and discuss which are controlled by germline derived DNA methylation and which by maternal H3K27me3.</p><p>14. &quot;To assess the link between sperm H3K4me3 and the placental transcriptome, we overlapped deH3K4me3 at promoters (n=508) with DEGs in the placenta, and identified 45 and 48 DEGs in female and male placentas, respectively (Figure S3 D ii-iii).&quot; Please specify how many UP-regulated and DOWN-regulated. The authors do not dwell further on this finding. What was the fold change in expression?</p><p>15. &quot;Of note, although a significant number of DEGs overlapped between female and male placentas (n=359, Fisher's exact test P=1.5e-19; Figure S3 D i), 82% of female DEGs and 85% of male DEGs were uniquely de-regulated, indicating sex-specific placental responses to paternal obesity.&quot;</p><p>Similarly, the overlap between the H3K4me3 peaks when comparing the 2 HFD models is less than 10%. The authors present this overlap as great similarity without acknowledging protocol specific responses. &quot;Despite differences in experimental design and animal models, we found a significant overlap in regions showing differential H3K4me3 (deH3K4me3) from both studies (128 overlapping regions, Fisher's exact test P=2.2e-16, Figure S1 D).&quot; Please discuss in a more balanced manner these results.</p><p>16. The authors should perform a histological analysis of the placenta or use the previously published histological analysis to support/or reject the deconvolution method of the bulk RNAseq data.</p><p>17. Next, it is not clear to this reviewer how the authors can assign nor normalize expression of genes that do not belong to specific cell types to be differentially expressed between experimental conditions. The meaning of any of these DEGs results can not be evaluated without any detailed follow-up analysis.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Determining the effects of paternal obesity on sperm chromatin at histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation in relation to the placental transcriptome and cellular composition&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

This major limitation of the study could be discussed in more detail, as it is possible that the results could be at least partly due to non-fat differences between the control and HFD chow, and not entirely due to increased fat consumption (although the authors state that food intake was not measured, which is another weakness in the study that should be discussed) and/or the consequent state of obesity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have updated and improved this manuscript and have provided important clarifications about some aspects. Most importantly, statistical analysis is now provided for overlaps between ChIP-seq and transcriptomic datasets. Additionally, a better discussion of the biological relevance of differentially enriched and differentially expressed genes is provided, as well as a better explanation of the deconvolution analysis.</p><p>A concern that has not been addressed is the lack of validation studies. The authors argue that validation is not required because the datasets are robust and comparisons are statistically well supported. However, these arguments do not address the main reason for validation, which is to test the conclusion using a different assay in a different sample. Validation experiments would be especially valuable since in many cases the effect sizes are small, albeit statistically significant. To this end, RT-qPCR or Western blotting could be used to validate differential expression in placentas, and ChIP-qPCR could be used to validate differential H3K4me3 enrichment in sperm.</p><p>A new concern is that after significance testing, there is no significant overlap between genes with differential H3K4me3 enrichment in sperm and differential expression in the placenta. However, because of the variable nature and small effect size of paternal epigenetic effects, this finding is not unexpected and the datasets and analysis are still interesting in demonstrating intergenerational regulatory effects of paternal diet.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83288.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) Proper statistical analyses for correlating the H3K4me3 changes with DEGs of RNA-seq data, for evaluating effect size vs. intra-sample variations, and for analyzing other sequencing data.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response 1.

It is worth reminding that we are studying the effects of obesity and not diet. To that effect the HFD induces obesity and metabolic dysfunction while the control diet does not. Although it is fair to point out that the composition of the control diet should be kept in mind, considering the desired outcomes within the scope of the study, the diets elicited the desired phenotypic effects serving as a model for obesity. We see this experimental design as a strength as in the study we compared this model to our previous published obesity model (Pepin et al., 2022) (PMID: 35183795) and there was significant overlap in the regions of differential enrichment detected between both models even though they were conducted in different research settings, with different mouse substrain and different diet combinations (Figure 1 and Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1). In our opinion this demonstrates that we are measuring robust effects of paternal obesity that can be replicated under different conditions. This comparative study design has been lacking in the field of epigenetic inheritance.</p><p>This is discussed in lines 157-173: âOf the top 5% and top 10% differentially enriched H3K4me3 (deH3K4me3) regions, some were common to those previously identified in Pepin et al., (2022) (128 and 423 overlapping deH3K4me3 regions, Fisherâs exact test P=2.2e-16 and P=2.2e-16, (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1 D i and ii, respectively). This was despite substantial differences in animal models (timing of diet exposure [3 vs 6 weeks of age], control diet [chow vs low-fat diet], and mouse substrain [C57BL/6J vs C57BL/6NCrl]. Focussing on the top 5% regions most impacted by obesity, the majority of regions showed an increase in enrichment for H3K4me3, consistent with our previous study (71.4%, n=1,257 versus n=503, Figure 2 A-B)). Regions losing H3K4me3 showed moderate H3K4me3-enrichment in CON sperm, with predominantly low CpG density, whereas regions gaining H3K4me3 showed low-to-moderate enrichment, with mainly high CpG density (Figure 2 C). Regions not impacted by diet showed high H3K4me3 enrichment in CON sperm, with low and high CpG density (Figure 2 C). Similarly to our previous findings, regions losing H3K4me3 were predominantly located &gt;5 kilobase (kb) from the transcription start site (TSS), likely at transposable elements, putative enhancer regions, and intergenic regions (Figure 2 D i) (Pepin et al., 2022). Regions gaining H3K4me3 in HFD sperm were located near the TSS (within 1 kb), likely at promoter regions (Figure 2 D ii). Furthermore, obesity-associated deH3K4me3 at promoter regions detected in each study showed enrichment at similar gene ontology (GO) processes, such as metabolic processes, cellular stress responses, transcription, and development (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1 E, Supplementary files 1b-d, Supplementary file 2).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The sample size appears to be very small, and intra-samples/mice variations in the histone marks might be greater than the effect size.

This aligns with the metabolic dysfunction in offspring and abnormal placenta development we reported in this model (Jazwiec et al., 2022) (PMID: 35377412). To address this comment, in the revised version we provide more details on the phenotypic and immuno-histopathological changes in placenta sired by obese males collected from our same model as reported in Jazwiec et al., 2022 (PMID: 35377412). These functional and phenotypic changes are linked to our experimental data identifying epigenomic alterations in sperm (Figure 2 and Figure 4 âfigure supplement 1) and transcriptomic alterations in placenta and to developmental changes in cellular distribution as described in Figures 4-6. The sperm epigenomic link between placenta function and transcriptome is shown in Figure 4 âfigure supplement 1. Briefly, 98 and 110 deH3K4me3 regions overlap DEGs in female and male placentas respectively (Figure 4 âfigure supplement 1 Dii). While not statistically significant we would argue that this does not rule out biological significance. For example, in a recent epigenome editing paper from (Takahashi et al., 2023) (PMID: 36754048), they targeted CpG islands in promoters for either the <italic>Ankrd26</italic> or <italic>Ldlr</italic> genes in embryonic stem cells, then injected the edited cells into 8-cell embryos, to give rise to mice with metabolic phenotypes. This is a key example showing that a single epigenetic change at one gene can give rise to a phenotype. Furthermore, an accumulation of evidence shows that the paternal genome and epigenetic imprinting is critical for placental development. This was first proposed ~40 years ago with studies showing that the paternal and maternal genomes display divergent potential for the development of the inner cell mass versus the trophectoderm (PMIDs: 6482961, 6722870, 6709062, 3834032, 3625116). More specifically, through genetic manipulation studies, it was demonstrated that androgenetic embryos have a greater developmental potential for the trophoblast lineage compared to parthenogenetic embryos. Further evidence supporting this notion is the finding that paternally expressed genes are enriched in the placenta (PMID: 23754418). All things considered, we therefore interpret our experimental data as: obesity altered sperm H3K4me3 enrichment levels may lead to altered placenta gene expression and development. With the cumulative effects being abnormal placenta function and metabolic phenotypes as we demonstrated our same model (Jazwiec et al., 2022); (PMID: 35377412) from which the placenta was derived for the genomic analysis.</p><p>We made the following revisions to the text:</p><p>Lines 127-139: âIn two research settings using different obesity mouse models, we studied male mice exposed to either a preconception control (CON) or a high-fat diet (HFD), and the paternal effects on offspring.

Here we used sperm and placenta from a similar paternal obesity model described in (Jazwiec et al., 2022), where we demonstrated paternal offspring born to obese fathers have impaired whole body energetics and are glucose intolerant. In addition, we showed that pregnancies sired by obese males were associated with placenta showing characteristics of hypoxia, accompanied by histo-morphological changes in blood vessel integrity. Specifically, histological and immunohistology analyses of placentas collected at embryonic day 14.5 and 18.5 in (Jazwiec et al., 2022) revealed that paternal obesity resulted in significant changes in transcription factors that regulate blood vessel development, blood vessel integrity and signalling pathways governed by hypoxia (HIF1A, VEGF and VEGR).â</p><p>The following text has been added or edited to better emphasize the sperm placenta connection:</p><p>Lines# 107-126: âNotably, genetic manipulation studies have determined that the paternal genome has greater potential for extraembryonic and trophoblast development compared to the maternal genome, and paternally expressed genes dominate placenta gene expression (S. C. Barton, Adams, Norris, and Surani, 1985; Sheila C. Barton, Surani, and Norris, 1984; J. McGrath and Solter, 1986; James McGrath and Solter, 1984; Surani, Barton, and Norris, 1984; Wang, Miller, Harman, Antczak, and Clark, 2013). Additionally, we recently showed that sperm chromatin profiles highly resemble that of trophectoderm and placenta tissue, and H3K4me3-enriched regions in sperm are expressed in these tissues, highlighting a molecular connection from the male germline to the developing placenta (Pepin et al., 2022).</p><p>The connection between paternal gene expression and placenta development has led to a growing interest in the role of paternal factors in placental development and function and offspring health (Wang et al., 2013). In mice, we demonstrated that paternal folate deficiency was associated with an altered sperm epigenome, differential gene expression in the placenta, and abnormal fetal development (Lambrot et al., 2013). In other mouse models, advanced paternal age and toxicant exposure have been linked to altered placental imprinting and reduced placental weight, and paternal obesity was linked to alterations in placental DNA methylation, aberrant allocation of cell lineage to trophectoderm (TE) (Binder, Hannan, and Gardner, 2012; Binder, Sheedy, Hannan, and Gardner, 2015; Denomme et al., 2020; Ding, Mokshagundam, Rinaudo, Osteen, and Bruner-Tran, 2018). Male partner metabolic syndrome and being overweight have been associated with an increased risk for pre-eclampsia and negative pregnancy outcomes (Lin, Gu, and Huang, 2022; Murugappan et al., 2021).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is essential to phenotype the offspring to determine whether the changes in placental transcriptome indeed have an impact on offspring metabolic states.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response 8: We appreciate that we should have better emphasized that we had indeed phenotyped the offspring metabolic states from this same obese mouse model, from which the placentaâs used here were derived from. We referenced these results in our manuscript (Lines 105-107; 131-133; 135-139; 147-150; 232-235; 270-273; 297-300; 384-386; 433-435; 441-448; 507-514). To summarize, as we reported in (Jazwiec et al., 2022) (PMID: 35377412), male and female young adult offspring sired by either control or obese male mice underwent metabolic profiling using a Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System and were subjected to a glucose tolerance test to assess changes in glucose tolerance. In Jazwiec et al., we report that offspring born to obese fathers have impaired whole body energetics and are glucose intolerant as young adults (Figure 7 in the published paper). We also showed that obese sires produce hypoxic placentae â accompanied by changes to placental vessel integrity. In the current study, we set out to investigate whether obesity induced changes in sperm histones which are potentially upstream of placental signalling pathways associated with vessel development, and/or hypoxia signalling pathways â we show this to be the case. To further substantiate this finding, we used an available data set based on the placenta transcriptome from a hypoxic model (Chu et al., 2019) (PMID: 30718791). We compared how paternal preconception obesity and in utero late-gestational exposure to hypoxia similarly impact the placental transcriptome and cell-type proportions. Here we show that placenta transcriptomes as well as tissue cellular compositions altered by hypoxia were similarly altered in placenta sired by obese males (Figures 4-6 and Figure 5 âfigure supplement 2-3 and Figure 6 âfigure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>General comments:</p><p>The text is well written, and the figures are generally well presented and clear.

Hypoxia is also a hallmark of placental insufficiency, reflecting poor oxygen and nutrient supply to the fetus, resulting in fetal growth restriction, low birth weight, and consequently heightened risk for cardiometabolic disease. Placentas derived from obese sires, like hypoxic placentas, exhibit changes in gene expression and altered angiogenesis, vasculature, and development (Binder et al., 2015, 2012; Jazwiec et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2022; McPherson et al., 2015; Mitchell et al., 2017, and this study). To determine whether transcriptomic and pathological phenotypes in paternal obese-sired placentas relate to that of hypoxic placentas, we compared our HFD placenta RNA-seq data to a hypoxia-induced IUGR mouse model RNA-seq dataset (Chu et al., 2019). In this model, hypoxia was induced during late gestation, which resulted in pregnancies with aberrant placental transcriptome, IUGR, decreased birth weights, and offspring exhibiting adult-onset cardiometabolic disturbances (Chu et al., 2019).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The manuscript would greatly benefit from an additional experiment probing a causal relationship between the examined mechanisms. At the moment it is full of correlations, some of which are overstated, and the limitations of the methods are not discussed enough.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response 13 (also please see response 3 and 10): We agree with this reviewer that our study is correlative, and that causal relationships between obesity-induced sperm epimutations and the placental transcriptome and functions should be investigated in the future using epigenome edited approaches. We also agree that we should delineate the limitations of our approach and analysis. We have modified the text in response to these concerns that some of our remarks come across as overstating our findings including modifying the text and elaborating on the limitations of the study in the discussion. However before progressing to epigenome editing in sperm these experimental studies were a necessary proof of principle and make a major advance for the field. The novelty in our study is that we have identified a paternal factor (obesity) that effect the sperm epigenome and showed that it is a non-genetic route influencing placenta development and offspring health. Also, the paternal contribution to placental insufficiency is understudied, and how paternal preconception exposures including obesity can impact placental development is unknown.</p><p>Lines 1-2: Revised title to: Determining the effects of paternal obesity on sperm chromatin at histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation in relation to the placental transcriptome and cellular composition</p><p>In the discussion, we expand on the limitations of the study and softened the conclusions that can be drawn from our work:</p><p>Lines 402-421: âWe previously reported in the same model from which our placenta samples are derived that paternal obesity leads to functional and histopathologic abnormalities in placenta and dysfunctional offspring metabolism. The epigenomic link between sperm enrichment differences in H3K4me3 and DEGs in placenta are minor. While not statistically significant we would argue that this does not rule out the likely biological significance of deH3K4me3 in sperm. For example, in a recent epigenome editing model from (Takahashi et al., 2023) using embryonic stem cells, CpG islands in promoters for either the <italic>Ankrd26</italic> or <italic>Ldlr</italic> genes were targeted to alter DNA methylation then injected into 8-cell embryos. These embryos gave rise to mice with metabolic phenotypes. This is a key example showing that a single epigenetic change at one gene can give rise to a phenotype (McNamara et al., 2018; Nativio et al., 2011; Takahashi et al., 2023). In addition, the limited overlap between sperm deH3K4me3 and placenta DEGs may also reflect the terminally differentiated state and heterogenous nature of the placenta at E14.5. Perhaps a greater correspondence between sperm deH3K4me3 may have been observed at earlier developmental timepoints such as at first lineage segregation corresponding to trophoblast formation. In future studies, it will be worthwhile to examine the trophoblast gene expression in comparison to deH3K4me3 in sperm. Indeed, we previously showed by <italic>in silico</italic> analysis that most regions bearing H3K4me3 in sperm are enriched for this mark in trophectoderm (TE), correlate with TE H3K4me3 signal, and correspond to genes expressed in TE (Pepin et al., 2022). Another limitation of this study is that placenta profiles are from bulk RNA-seq and measures average gene expression across a heterogenous cell population and identification of DEGs can therefore be confounded by cell composition. To address this, we used a deconvolution approach in our analysis using a scRNA-seq dataset.â</p><p>Lines 423-438: âThe identification of alterations of cell type proportion must be considered within the limitations of a deconvolution analysis. This analysis only provides estimates of cell-type relative within a heterogeneous tissue. While this allowed us to adjust for the effect of differences in cell-type composition, the exact cell-type composition and their specific gene expression changes need to be validated by single-cell approaches such as single-cell RNA-seq or spatial transcriptomics. Furthermore, even though we used a reference dataset which included cells representative of placental tissues, the detection capacity of this approach is limited for low-abundant cell types, such as blood cells, immune cells, and inflammatory cells, which would be informative of placental pathological states. For example, aberrant abundance of decidual inflammatory cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, has been linked to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia (Aneman et al., 2020; Bachmayer, Rafik Hamad, Liszka, Bremme, and Sverremark-EkstrÃ¶m, 2006; Du et al., 2022; Milosevic-Stevanovic et al., 2016; Williams, Bulmer, Searle, Innes, and Robson, 2009). Incidentally, it was previously shown that paternal diet-induced obesity is associated with placental inflammation (Claycombe-Larson, Bundy, and Roemmich, 2020; Jazwiec et al., 2022). Interestingly, many GO terms related to inflammatory processes were enriched in the obesity-induced deH3K4me3 in sperm (Figure 2 E, Supplementary file 1c, and Pepin et al., 2022), suggesting sperm deH3K4me3 might be partly influencing placental inflammation. However due to the low representation of immune cells in the data set this could not be assessed.â</p><p>Lines 478-484: âNext, it will be important to assess earlier developmental time points to determine when and how these paternally-induced effects originate. Indeed, studies have shown that paternal obesity alters preimplantation development, such as cellular allocation to TE versus ICM lineages (Binder et al., 2012). Investigating multiple and earlier time points would help reveal the dynamic trajectory of paternally-induced deregulated transcriptomic and epigenetic signatures which might be at the origin of adult-onset disease. Translating these findings to humans will be beneficial to further understand and emphasize the paternal preconception contribution to pregnancy outcomes, placental integrity and offspring health.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Regarding the Methods, the control diet is not the best control for the HFD, because it is from a different supplier. The fact that it is from a different manufacturer means that the content, not just fat levels, is likely completely different. This should at least be mentioned by the authors, within the limitations of this methodological issues addressed in the text. However, ideally the key experiments should ideally be performed again, using controlled diets (high fat and lower/control fat levels) from the same manufacturer, so that any differences can be related to fat (rather than potentially other molecular constituents that differ between manufacturers).</p></disp-quote><p>Author response 14: This concern has been addressed in author response 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

All animals had free access to water and food ad libitum, housed in the same room which was maintained at 25Â°C on a controlled 12-hour/12-hour light/dark cycle. Two weeks prior mating and throughout the mating period, male mice were housed individually to prevent fighting and aggression, and to facilitate timed-mating. We have previously reported and characterized this model of high-fat diet-induced obesity (Jazwiec et al., 2022). As reported in our previous work, male mice fed a high-fat diet became significantly heavier weighing approximately 40 g (20 g in weight gain); had elevated body adiposity; elevated fasting blood glucose; were glucose intolerant; had significantly increased serum insulin concentrations, and were insulin resistant as assessed by HOMA-IR (Jazwiec et al., 2022). Food consumption data was not collected. High fat male mice had impaired mating efficiency (Jazwiec et al., 2022), and therefore more males were needed in the high fat fed group compared to controls to generate a sufficient number of pregnancies and placental tissue for RNA-sequencing experiments.â</p><p>Given that we have thoroughly documented the male phenotype, and we reference it in our manuscript (Lines 105-107; 131-133; 135-139; 147-150; 232-235; 270-273; 297-300; 384-386; 433-435; 441-448; 507-514), and the aim of our current study was to investigate the relationship between obesity-induced sperm histone changes and placental signalling pathways, we do not believe it necessary to include this information in the current manuscript. The impact of a high fat diet on male metabolism has been thoroughly, and repeatedly investigated previously (Binder, Beard, et al., 2015; Binder et al., 2012; Binder, Sheedy, et al., 2015; Chambers, Morgan, Heger, Sharpe, and Drake, 2016; de Castro Barbosa et al., 2016a; Ghanayem, Bai, Kissling, Travlos, and Hoffler, 2010; Jazwiec et al., 2022; Ng et al., 2010; Pepin et al., 2022; Schjenken et al., 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

This may constitute a methodological flaw as it may introduce a bias in the sequencing data.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response 16: We added details to the methods for clarification. Sperm was collected from (for chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing experiments) male mice fed either a standard chow diet or a high fat diet for a minimum of 8 weeks before timed-mating â it often takes a few weeks to confirm pregnancies â thus this timing varies (see (Jazwiec et al., 2022); (PMID: 35377412)). This is normal for mouse breeding studies to have a small range and several weeks that are unlikely to change the results as the mice are still being bred with sperm from the same spermatogenic cycle. Importantly all mice were similarly altered in metabolic profiles where at 8 or 10 weeks as detailed in our paper (Jazwiec et al., 2022); (PMID: 35377412).</p><p>To generate pregnancies, a single male mouse was paired with either one or two females overnight. When a copulation plug was identified in a female mouse, this individual mouse is housed individually, and body weight was monitored for 10 days to determine whether she was pregnant. Which then leaves one individual mouse, left with a male overnight to mate once again. Therefore, it is correct to state that males are housed with 1-2 females overnight.</p><p>We added the following text:</p><p>Lines 502-516: âSix-week-old C57BL/6J male mice were co-housed (2 per cage) and randomly allocated to either the control (n=8; CON; standard chow diet, Harlan 8640, Teklad 22/5 Rodent Diet; 17% kcal fat, 54% kcal carbohydrates, 29% kcal protein, 3 kcal/g) or high-fat diet (n=16; HFD; Research Diets Inc, D12492; 20% kcal protein, 20% kcal carbohydrates, 60% kcal fat, 5.21 kcal/g) group, for 10-12 weeks.

The animal N used was 7 (control) and 16 (HFD) mice. The pooling was required to create replicates with an equal amount of total sperm to perform the ChIP-seq. The strength in pooling samples is that you are assessing the most robust changes within the experimental group. The details on samples and pooling can be found in Supplementary file 1a. With regards to sequencing bias that is highly unlikely. The replicates were based on the same cell number per sample, and the sequencing depth was excellent for each replicate ranging from 37-45M reads (Supplementary file 1a). Differences in library size are accounted for in the normalization.</p><p>We have added the following to the text for clarification:</p><p>Lines 541-543: âPools of sperm from 2-7 male mice per sample were used for ChIP-seq (Supplementary file 1a).

With n=3 in ChIP-seq and n=4 per group in RNA Seq, the sample sizes are on the lower end (bare minimum) of what is considered valid. These analyses are likely underpowered and at least require independent validation, especially if the role of specific genes is discussed as mechanistically relevant.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response 17: Regarding effect and sample size: It appears that on review the animal numbers used for the ChIP-seq were confused with the number of replicates by the reviewers. These details were in Supplementary file 1a. There were 3 replicates per experimental group and each replicate contained sperm from pooled samples that was equalized in cell number and comprised of sperm from n=7 control males, or n=16 HFD males. For the RNA-seq n=4 placentas were used from each experimental group from both males and females for a total n of 16. Although the sample size is moderate, we followed the Canadian Council of Animal Care guideline which calls for the use of the lowest animal number that elicits significant effects (CCAC guidelines p6 âConsideration must also be given to reduction, to determine the fewest number of animals appropriate to provide valid information and statistical power, while still minimizing the welfare impact for each animalâ).</p><p>Regarding intrasample variation: The PCA plot (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1 C) and heatmap (Figure 2 A) show little intra-group variability, and the heatmap (Figure 2 A) shows consistency of the H3K4me3 signal within groups. The PCA plot shows that the variance explained by the dietary treatment is greater than the inter-sample variance (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1 C, PC1=51.9% versus PC2=28.9% variance, respectively). Intra-variation is unlikely to driving the significant differences identified between groups for H3K4me3 enrichment differences for the following reasons: we compared H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data sets from this study to our prior obesity model (Pepin et al., 2022) (PMID: 35183795), where individual mice rather than pooled samples were used and determined there was significant overlap in the differentially enriched regions detected in these models. This consistency occurred despite the models coming from different animal facilities, differences in HFD and controls diets and mouse substrain.</p><p>Regarding validation: We used a high standard of computational validation and visualization strategies, to ensure confidence in genomic data. This also allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the biological and physiological impacts of paternal obesity on the sperm epigenome and placenta transcriptome.

In the same vein, in the GO analysis in Figure 2E(i), many of the significantly enriched pathways are only represented with a single gene, including the placenta morphogenesis pathway. The authors seem to overstate this result on l. 234 by using the plural of genes: &quot;As deH3K4me3 in sperm was located at genes involved in placental formation (Figure 2 E and Pepin et al., 2022), we assessed whether paternal obesity was associated with changes in gene expression of the placenta.&quot; If this result is assigned such importance to, it would be important to validate the result.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response 18: Good points. We made the following revisions: Figure 2E(i and ii) have been removed from the manuscript. The text has been updated accordingly. This figure reflected a GO analysis focused on deH3K4me3 regions showing a decrease in enrichment, which represented n=503 regions, of which most were located at intergenic regions. Because our GO analyses are focused at regions located at promoters, this analysis was therefore restricted to only n=36 promoters. This explains why some of the significantly enriched GO terms contained only 1 gene. It is also worth noting that there is a lack of research on the placenta relative to research on most (if not all) other mammalian organs, and consequently there are currently only 18 gene ontology terms annotated for the placenta, hindering the effectiveness of gene ontology analyses to study effects on placental functions and limiting the discovery capacity of various conditions on placental effects (Naismith and Cox, 2021)(PMID: 34237528).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. In the Results, the formulation of some results gives the wrong impression/overstates the actual result. The authors should be generally more careful in their statements and qualify them.</p><p>10. For example, on l.166: &quot;Despite differences in experimental design and animal models, we found a significant overlap in regions showing differential (H3K4me3 deH3K4me3) from both studies (128 overlapping regions, Fisher's exact test P=2.2e-16, Figure S1 D)&quot;. These are 128 regions out of 1632 and 1410 regions, so less than 10% overlap. Therefore, in fact this is a surprisingly low overlap despite methodological similarities, and should be discussed as such, not the opposite.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response 18 (and also response 7): We respectfully disagree that we have overinterpreted the findings regarding overlap between the two studies in the context of the differences in experimental, methodological, exposure window, control diets and mouse substrains. These differences are highlighted in lines 159-161. Across the two studies, the animals were generated independently in two different animal facilities (McMaster University and McGill University), using two different mouse substrains (C57BL6J versus C57BL6NCrl), which have been shown to show varying degrees of severity of phenotypes induced by high-fat diet feeding (Hull et al., 2017; Mekada et al., 2009; Mekada and Yoshiki, 2021; SiersbÃ¦k et al., 2020) (PMID: 28138002; 19448337; 33441510; 32820201). The control diets differed across studies (chow diet versus low-fat diet) which could differentially impact metabolism (Hu et al., 2018)(PMID: 30017356) and consequently the epigenome, therefore the epigenetic differences when comparing chow- or low-fat diet feeding to high-fat diet could vary. Furthermore, the dietary interventions were performed at different time points; starting at 3 weeks during the first wave of spermatogenesis, versus at 6 weeks entering the second wave of spermatogenesis. These waves are known to be transcriptionally unique (Hermann et al., 2018). In terms of the ChIP-seq experiment, in this study the sperm from multiple mice was pooled in each sample, versus in our previous study sperm from individual mice were used per sample.</p><p>Therefore, our interpretation of the data is that, remarkably, despite substantial differences in terms of animal models, experimental design, and methodological approaches, we obtain a statistically significant overlap of regions detected across there two studies, as tested by a Fisherâs exact test. Further supporting similarities across the two datasets generated, the diet-sensitive genomic regions detected show common feature characteristics. These observations support the idea that diet-induced obesity associated regions are not random and therefore not as a result of chance.</p><p>In light of your comment, we have altered the text and analysis as follows: We extended the analysis to include overlapping both region sets with the top 10% regions impacted by diet.</p><p>Lines 157-159: âOf the top 5% and top 10% differentially enriched H3K4me3 (deH3K4me3) regions, some were common to those previously identified in Pepin et al., (2022) (128 and 423 overlapping deH3K4me3 regions, Fisherâs exact test P=2.2e-16 and P=2.2e-16, Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1 D i and ii, respectively).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Another example is l. 322: &quot;Overall, the trends for directionality of changes in specific cellular abundances were consistent across the two mouse models (Figure 6B).&quot; While the effects on cell type abundance cannot be said to substantially diverge, saying they are consistent may be overstating things.

The authors state they perform the cell-type based deconvolution of sequencing data because transcriptional differences between cell types can be obscured by averaging of expression data over many cell types in Bulk tissue RNA-Seq.

This should be noted and discussed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Author response 19: The list of detected DEGs is indeed smaller as this analysis takes into account estimated cell type proportions and therefore in theory removes the initially detected DEGs associated with changes in cell-type proportion. A similar analysis using human term placenta (normal versus preeclamptic) showed that differential expression analysis adjusted for estimated cell-type proportions via data deconvolution resulted in the detection of zero DEGs (Campbell et al., 2023)(PMID: 36914823).</p><p>We made the following revisions to the text:</p><p>Lines 282-290: âThis reduction in the number of detected DEGs before versus after accounting for cellular composition suggests that changes in cell-type proportions at least partly drive tissue-level differential expression.

There were similarities between the bulk RNA-seq and deconvoluted analysis in that there was overlap of DEGs detected before and after adjusting for cell-type proportions (Figure 5 âfigure supplement 3 G and H, Fisherâs exact test P=1.8e-105 and P=0e+00, respectively).

In the same deconvolution analysis, the authors state they detect 15 cell types, out of 28 detected by the original study from which the dataset was taken. Why do the authors think this is the case?

In these studies, we showed that H3K4me3 is present at functional genomic regions that include developmental enhancers, transposable elements and more (see our review (Ariane Lismer and Kimmins, 2023); PMID: 37059740). The data generated in this study showed a genomic distribution consistent with these previous studies and therefore we do not include repetitive findings in the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors build upon their previous work on mouse models testing the contribution of parental diet to the health and development of the offspring. Previously, the Sloboda lab had reported that HFD induced placental hypoxia while the Kimmins lab had identified genomic regions that show differentially enrichment of H3K4me3 upon HFD. With this work the authors aim to explore &quot;the role of paternally driven gene expression in placenta&quot; as well as the potential role of H3K4me3 in transmitting information from sperm to embryo.</p><p>Firstly, the authors assessed H3K4me3 changes in sperm samples of the HFD model from the Kimmins lab. They identified DE regions of H3K4me3 between HFD and control sperm and annotated these regions based on their genomic location (promoter/enhancer). Next, the authors associated these genomic locations to genes for which they performed ontology analysis. In addition, they performed Motif enrichment analysis.</p><p>Secondly, the authors performed bulk RNAseq in placentas of embryos sired either from HFD or control males mated with C57BL6/J females. They performed differential gene expression analysis and tried to associate the placenta DE genes to sperm DE H3K4me3 regions. They further performed deconvolution of the bulk RNA seq data to identify cellularity biases of the placentae and finally they compared their data to external RNA seq data from hypoxic placentae.</p><p>The bioinformatic analysis is rigorous, however the design of the experiments cannot support the initial aims of the authors. For example, to identify paternally driven gene expression the authors should have used female animals on a different genetic background (other than C57BL6/J) to be able to differentiate between the parental origins of transcripts based on SNPs.</p><p>The current experiment shows transcriptional differences that cannot be attributed to the parental origin. We cannot exclude the possibility of paternal expression affecting maternal expression in trans. In addition, as the authors acknowledge in the manuscript that the association of DEGs in placenta to sperm differentially H3K4 methylated regions is difficult given the high cellular heterogeneity within the tissue. Hence, the authors are recommended to isolate cells that they identified to be more affected. In addition, or alternatively, the authors could investigate trophoblast cells from blastocyst embryos that give rise to placenta. In summary, the overall design of the study is not optimal, which together with rather confusing writing does not help the field to understand the impact of paternal HFD diet on chromatin landscape in sperm and physiology in offspring.</p><p>1. One major objective of the study is to relate changes in H3K4me3 occupancy levels in sperm to transcriptional changes in placenta. From the current data analyses, it is not clear at which genomic regions H3K4me3 levels have changed in a statistically significant manner between dietary conditions using the data of the replicates. When describing changes, please include fold change and adjusted p-values. Given that the authors used the csaw package to determine and normalize the H3K4me3 regions why they didn't perform the statistical significance analysis of differential enrichment using the csaw embedded functions?</p></disp-quote><p>Author response 34. As described in the Methods section, we used csaw (Lun and Smyth, 2016) (PMID: 26578583) to select the genomic regions with read counts of a fold change enrichment of more than 4. Using those called regions we chose the top 5% enriched regions that contribute the most to the Principal component associated with diet as shown in Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1 C. This same approach was used in our folate deficient diet study (Ariane Lismer et al., 2021)(PMID: 33596408) and we consider it highly stringent as we are only selecting the top 5% of regions associated with diet by PCA analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Related to the first comment, this reviewer does not observe any difference in H3K4me3 levels for Cbx7 nor for Igf2, while Prdx6 and Slc19a1 seems to have increased H3K4me3 levels (Figure 2F). What is the significance value for changes for these 4 genomic windows? It should be indicated in the figure. For Igf2, it is not clear whether the peaks localize at its promoter or somewhere in the gene. It appears more likely to be the latter. If so, what is the significance for such occupancy for gene regulation potential? Moreover, given the prominent role that Igf2 plays within the manuscript, have the authors observed any change in H3K4me3 at the germ line ICR for this locus, which has been shown to be critical for paternal transmission of the paternal epiallele and imprinted expression in offspring? Any change in DNA methylation? Likewise, for Kcnq1 which in placental tissues is normally maternally expressed and paternally repressed by Polycomb repression system. What about H3K4me3 levels at the Kcnq1ot1 ICR element?</p></disp-quote><p>Author response 35 (also response 34): We revised Figure 2 F (now Figure 2 E) to improve the visualization of the enrichment differences at the selected genes and the genomic region. We detect deH3K4me3 at Igf2 (lines 178-180) is in the list of regions showing a decrease in H3K4me3 in sperm, Kcnq1 (lines 182-184) is in the list of regions showing an increase in H3K4me3. In Figure 4 E and F the heatmaps show only deregulation of imprinted genes by sex and experimental group. There are significant differences in expression that are sex-specific in maternally and paternally imprinted genes in response to paternal obesity. We did not include DNAme analysis in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. For a histone modification to fulfill a possible role in paternal inheritance, what are the overall nucleosomal occupancy levels at the deH3K4me3 regions in sperm, compared to genome wide average levels in control and HFD samples?</p></disp-quote><p>Author response 36<bold>:</bold> The nucleosome occupancy is not expected to change â see correlation heat map Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1 B that shows peaks for H3K4me3 are highly homogenous between experimental and control groups (Pearson correlation values 0.99). In our KDM1A transgenic model where there were severe epigenetic changes at over 5000 promoters in H3K4me2 and me3, we detected no differences in nucleosome occupancy (Ariane Lismer et al., 2020; Siklenka et al., 2015) (PMID: 33068438; 26449473). In the context of obesity, changes in the epigenome have been observed at various marks (here histone methylation, others found changes at DNAme and ncRNA abundance), but not nucleosome occupancy (Donkin et al., 2016) (PMID: 26669700).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The authors report that &quot;Regions losing H3K4me3 showed moderate H3K4me3-enrichment in 173 CON sperm, with predominantly low CpG density, whereas regions gaining H3K4me3 showed low-to moderate enrichment with mainly high CpG density (Figure 2 C)&quot;. What could the reason be for the sequence specificity of such changes? Are there any changes in H3K27me3 levels at deH3K4me3? It is quite noticeable that none of the sites gaining H3K4me3 in HFD samples reach the level of H3K4me3 observed at CpG-rich regions in sperm of controls (grey dots in figure 2C). Why? Would it have any impact on possible transmission rates?</p></disp-quote><p>Author response 38: The DNA sequence specificity of low CpG regions that lost deH3K4me relates to the genomic functional region implicated that include those in intergenic spaces that include placenta, testes and ESC enhancers (Lines 167-169) for example. In contrast, the high CpG regions that gained H3K4me3 are mostly at promoters and contain binding sites for TF (section 2.2 and Figure 3). Figure 2 C shows the H3K4me3 signal level versus CpG density, including all regions in sperm bearing H3K4me3, and the deH3K4me3 regions labeled based on directionally change upon HFD (increased versus decreased enrichment). It appears that the regions least sensitive to paternal obesity are those with high H3K4me3 levels, potentially regions that are less dynamic and therefore less likely to be subjected to epigenetic changes upon environmental exposures. This is certainly the case for DNAme in sperm where we report in several studies the regions bearing intermediate levels of methylation are the most responsive to environmental exposures (Chan et al., 2019; A Lismer et al., 2022) (PMID: 31393794). We speculate that these lower methylated regions are similar for H3K4me3 because they may be subject to more transcriptional turnover for example which is linked to re-establishment of H3K4me. We did not perform ChIP-seq targeting H3K27me3 in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Regarding enhancers, the current data presentation is rather superficial. To substantiate some of these findings, to what extent do the changes in H3K4me3 as monitored in sperm reflect changes in expression in testicular cells of HFD exposed males? Are any of the three genes highlighted (Tmem174, Plag1, Pdgfb) differentially expressed in placentas of male and female embryos?</p></disp-quote><p>Author response 41: These genes did not appear in our DER list. However, it is important to keep in mind that we are looking at one developmental time point and the effect of sperm deH3K4me3 at enhancers for these genes could be very early in placenta development, or not at all. It is not reasonable to expect that every deH3K4me3 will impact gene expression in the placenta. For example, many of the deH3K4me3 could impact the embryo and not the placenta. Some deH3K4me in sperm may not affect the expression of the corresponding gene at all. We did not examine testis germ cells in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Discovery of TF motif: when searching for TF motif enrichments in genomic windows, have the authors taken into account that the GC percentage underlying these windows is very different between regions with decreased and increased H3K4me3 levels?

The authors state that previous reports indicated changes in DNA methylation after HFD exposure (line 217). Is there any link between DNA methylation and H3K4me3 alterations?</p></disp-quote><p>Author response 43: We have updated the text in order to answer this question and include this information in the discussion.</p><p>Lines 388-401: âInterestingly, changes in sperm DNA methylation upon HFD feeding has been previously reported, and ETS motifs (enriched in obesity-associated deH3K4me3 in sperm) have been found to be DNA-methylation sensitive, including in spermatogonial stem cells (Domcke et al., 2015; Dura et al., 2022; Lea et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2017). Given the interplay between H3K4 and DNA methylation, it is conceivable that HFD-induced epimutations at either of these marks could influence one another (reviewed in Janssen and Lorincz, 2022), and these could in turn alter TF functions. This phenomenon has been described in a mouse model of paternal low-protein diet, where oxidative stress-induced phosphorylation of the <italic>Atf7</italic> TF was suggested to impede its DNA-binding affinity in germ cells, leading to a decrease in H3K9me2 at target regions (Yoshida et al., 2020). As in the low-protein diet model, oxidative stress is a hallmark of obesity and increased levels of reactive oxygen species have been observed in testes of diet-induced obesity mouse models and linked to impaired embryonic development (T. Fullston et al., 2012; Lane et al., 2014; Mitchell et al., 2011). These findings provide avenues for further investigation such as whether epigenetic changes on paternal alleles may impact TF binding during early embryogenesis.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. &quot;In response to paternal obesity, we detected 2,035 and 2,365 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in female and male placentas, respectively (Figure 4 A-B).&quot; How many DEGs are detected if authors compare the male control to female control placentas.

We did a gene-level analysis at transcript resolution (Lancaster method, See author response 44), and the heatmaps in Figure 4 A and B show the <italic>transcripts</italic> that code for the detected differentially expressed genes â that is the strength of the analysis because it is sensitive to these transcript-level changes which clusters perfectly here (Yi, Pimentel, Bray, and Pachter, 2018). In Figure 4 E and F we show the expression levels of the <italic>genes</italic> and with this visualization we list these imprinted genes. These heatmaps show the <italic>gene</italic> signal rather than the transcript signal so that is why the clustering differs, but they are still being detected as differentially expressed in the transcript-level analysis. When one shows the gene signal rather than the transcript signal, the individual transcriptional changes can look like they are &quot;cancelled out&quot; as they are aggregated into a gene-level signal. For these reasons, using the Lancaster method avoids masking transcript-level dynamics (Yi, Pimentel, Bray, and Pachter, 2018).</p><p>Although imprinted genes have been implicated in placental defects and imprinted disorders, we believe it is too early at this point to conclude that these targets could be used to classify placentas and embryos phenotypic severity.

To assess whether there are differentially expressed imprinted genes in placentas, we overlapped the lists of DEGs from males and females with a list of previously identified imprinted genes (Tucci et al., 2019) (PMID: 30794780). Therefore, the differentially expressed imprinted genes shown on the heatmaps in Figure 4 E-F are those overlapping between these two lists. There are 7 imprinted genes differentially expressed in both male and female placentas (Tnfrsf23, Ano1, Htra3, Runx1, Bag3, Bbx, Cdkn1c), while the remaining genes are sex-specific. We have updated Figure 4 E-F to highlight the imprinted genes that are deregulated in both male and female placentas, by denoting these genes with asterisks.

This approach involves a differential analysis on transcript counts, followed by aggregation of p-values from individual transcript to obtain a list of differentially expressed genes based on changes at the transcript level. This approach allows to consider transcript-level dynamics and therefore increases sensitivity and accuracy. Because multiple transcripts that code for the same gene can show varying directionality changes (i.e. some transcripts show increased expression whereas other transcripts that code for the same gene show decreased expression), and because the detected DEGs are based on changes in transcript expression, it is not possible to show which genes are <italic>up-regulated</italic> or <italic>down-regulated</italic>, and therefore can only describe <italic>de-regulated</italic> genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. &quot;Of note, although a significant number of DEGs overlapped between female and male placentas (n=359, Fisher's exact test P=1.5e-19; Figure S3 D i), 82% of female DEGs and 85% of male DEGs were uniquely de-regulated, indicating sex-specific placental responses to paternal obesity.&quot;</p><p>Similarly, the overlap between the H3K4me3 peaks when comparing the 2 HFD models is less than 10%.

Thank you for this comment and we apologize for not being clearer regarding our previously published observations. We have previously performed extensive histological analyses at embryonic day 14.5 and 18.5 in Jazwiec et al. 2022 and found that male diet-induced obesity results in significant changes in transcription factor that regulate blood vessel development, blood vessel integrity and signalling pathways governed by hypoxia (HIF1A, VEGF and VEGR). We found that paternal obesity did not appreciably impact fetal or placental growth, placental nutrient transporter transcripts, placental endocrine-related cell number (giant cells for placental lactogen), or cellular stress related signalling transcripts and proteins (ER stress pathways) (Jazwiec et al., 2022); (PMID: 35377412). Future studies should perform single-cell RNA sequencing on placentas derived from control- versus obese-sires in order to confirm changes in cell-type proportions within these placentas, as well as to identify cell-type-specific changes in gene expression.

To account for cellular composition within a tissue for bulk RNA-sequencing differential gene expression analysis, the inferred cell type proportions can be accounted for in the differential analysis, as described in (Campbell et al., 2023) (PMID: 36914823). To do so, a principal component analysis is first applied to the deconvoluted proportion values, and the principal components are added as covariates into the model (see Methods). This approach allows to limit the number of covariates in the model and consider the dependence between the individual cell type proportions. We carefully chose available single-cell RNA-sequencing data from mouse placenta that matched for the same mouse strain as well as developmental time point as that of our samples to ensure the data could be comparable. We would also like to remind this reviewer of the current state of the field: this is the first placenta RNA-seq dataset generated from a paternal obesity model. Therefore, prior to the current study, there was no rationale to perform placenta single-cell RNA-sequencing in such model. While generating single-cell RNA-sequencing data from samples from our HFD model was out of the scope of this study, future work should focus on performing such experiments to be able to directly assess changes in cell-type proportions and delineate the cell-type-specific changes in gene expression. The datasets generated in the current study are now publicly available and can be used to make novel findings and move the field forwar</p><p>References</p><p>Aliee, H., and Theis, F. J. (2021).

The second reviewer strongly advocates for additional controls that would support the central claims. If you can provide these, we feel it would significantly strengthen the final paper.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript has been extensively revised to address the comments of myself and the other reviewers, and is substantially improved. The remaining major weakness, commented upon by myself and at least on other reviewer, was the fact that the control chow was not matched to the HFD chow, which impacts on interpretation of the study. This major limitation of the study could be discussed in more detail, as it is possible that the results could be at least partly due to non-fat differences between the control and HFD chow, and not entirely due to increased fat consumption (although the authors state that food intake was not measured, which is another weakness in the study that should be discussed) and/or the consequent state of obesity.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer states as a limitation of our study that the results we are showing may be due to non-fat differences between the standard chow and the high-fat diet (i.e. macro or micronutrient composition), rather than increased fat consumption. It is important to note that the goal of the present study was not to assess the effects of high-fat feeding, nor of varying macronutrient or micronutrient intake, but instead to study the effects of paternal <italic>obesity</italic> on the sperm epigenome, its links to placental development, gene expression, and cellular composition. The diets used elicited the desired effects on weight gain, excess adiposity, and metabolic outcomes, as described in our previously characterized model (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35377412/). The standard chow diet has been used as a control in many previous studies that described diet-induced obesity models (for example: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4452998/#R24 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23924601/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35377412/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28434881/).</p><p>Additionally, it was shown that a standard chow diet versus a purified low-fat diet show similar phenotypic, metabolic, and behavioral outcomes (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28721750/). Furthermore, it was previously shown that dietary fat, and no other macronutrients, regulates increased adiposity in diet-induced obesity mouse models (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30017356/). Importantly, given the current study was a follow-up on our previously published work (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35377412/), it was necessary to be consistent with our characterized preconception paternal obesity mouse model, and therefore use the same experimental design such as the dietary treatments. Using the same experimental model allowed us to further characterize the model, demonstrate consistencies in obesity-associated changes in the sperm epigenome despite differences in experimental models, and newly demonstrate links between paternal preconception obesity, placenta development, and cellular composition.</p><p>We have added a sentence to highlight that we are not comparing two diets that are experimentally controlled for macro and micronutrients, but instead to induce paternal obesity and assess the effects on the sperm epigenome and placental development.</p><p>Lines 149-151: âHere we used the same pre-conception paternal obesity model as described in Jazwiec et al., (2022), where offspring were previously phenotyped for metabolic function and placenta was histopathologically characterized (Figure 1). Of note, this model does not compare diets that are experimentally controlled for macro or micronutrients, but instead is used to assess the effects of obesity on the sperm epigenome and its impacts on placental development.â</p><p>We had also highlighted that despite differences in paternal obesity models, including the use of the standard chow diet as a control (versus a low-fat diet matching for macro and micronutrients), we are able to replicate a significant number of obesity-associated changes in the sperm epigenome.</p><p>Lines 160-165: âOf the top 5% and top 10% differentially enriched H3K4me3 (deH3K4me3) regions, some were common to those previously identified in Pepin et al., (2022) (128 and 423 overlapping deH3K4me3 regions, Fisherâs exact test P=2.2e-16 and P=2.2e-16, Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1 D i and ii, respectively). This was despite substantial differences in animal models (timing of diet exposure [3 vs 6 weeks of age], control diet [chow vs low-fat diet], and mouse substrain [C57BL/6J vs C57BL/6NCrl]).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have updated and improved this manuscript and have provided important clarifications about some aspects. Most importantly, statistical analysis is now provided for overlaps between ChIP-seq and transcriptomic datasets. Additionally, a better discussion of the biological relevance of differentially enriched and differentially expressed genes is provided, as well as a better explanation of the deconvolution analysis.</p><p>A concern that has not been addressed is the lack of validation studies. The authors argue that validation is not required because the datasets are robust and comparisons are statistically well supported. However, these arguments do not address the main reason for validation, which is to test the conclusion using a different assay in a different sample. Validation experiments would be especially valuable since in many cases the effect sizes are small, albeit statistically significant. To this end, RT-qPCR or Western blotting could be used to validate differential expression in placentas, and ChIP-qPCR could be used to validate differential H3K4me3 enrichment in sperm.</p><p>A new concern is that after significance testing, there is no significant overlap between genes with differential H3K4me3 enrichment in sperm and differential expression in the placenta. However, because of the variable nature and small effect size of paternal epigenetic effects, this finding is not unexpected and the datasets and analysis are still interesting in demonstrating intergenerational regulatory effects of paternal diet.</p></disp-quote><p>Our previous study (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35377412/) involved the characterization of a paternal preconception obesity model that revealed impacts on placental vascularization, hypoxia, and offspring metabolic functions. In the current study, we take a step further with genome-wide approaches to study the effects of paternal obesity on placental gene expression, we compare our findings with an intra-uterine growth restriction model, infer placental cell-type proportion changes using publicly available single-cell datasets that match our samplesâ developmental time point and mouse strain, connect our findings with paternal obesity-associated changes on the sperm epigenome, and demonstrate consistent changes across different studies.</p><p>As a validation for the differential expression analysis in placentas, we show that some of the detected differentially expressed genes by RNA-seq in this study were also found to show significant changes associated by paternal obesity, as detected by RT-qPCR in the initial characterization of the model (<italic>Igf1</italic> and <italic>Irs1</italic>; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35377412/).</p><p>We have added these findings in the text:</p><p>Lines 234-236: âOf note, the gene <italic>Irs1</italic> was found to be differentially expressed in placentas in association with paternal obesity, validating our previous findings in the initial characterization of the model (Jazwiec et al., 2022).â</p><p>Lines 295-296: âSimilarly to our previous characterization of the model, here we detected differential expression of <italic>Igf2</italic> in placentas sired by obese sires (Jazwiec et al., 2022).</p><p>Lines 185-186: âInterestingly, <italic>Igf2</italic> was also previously shown to be differentially expressed in placentas derived from obese males (Jazwiec et al., 2022).â</p><p>Additionally, throughout the text we demonstrate findings that are consistent with our previous characterization of our model showing that paternal obesity is associated with a hypoxic placenta (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35377412/). We show here that inferred changes in placental cell-type proportions associated with paternal obesity are indicative of a hypoxic placenta (Figure 5). Furthermore, we show significant overlap of DEGs in our placentas derived from obese sires, with DEGs in a model of hypoxia-induced IUGR, as well as similar associated changes in cell-type proportion (Figure 6).</p><p>As a validation for the H3K4me3 enrichment analysis in sperm, we show consistent changes on the sperm epigenome across our two different paternal obesity models. Specifically, we show a significant overlap of regions showing obesity-associated changes in H3K4me3 enrichment in sperm as detected in the current study and our other previous study (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35183795/). Furthermore, we show that the characteristic features of those impacted genomic regions are consistent across both datasets (Figure 2 and Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1).</p></body></sub-article></article>
