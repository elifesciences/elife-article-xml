However, the relationship between protein synthesis and presynaptic structural plasticity remains unclear. Here, we investigated structural changes in cannabinoid-receptor 1 (CB<sub>1</sub>)-mediated long-term depression of inhibitory transmission (iLTD), a form of presynaptic plasticity that involves a protein-synthesis-dependent long-lasting reduction in GABA release. We found that CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD in acute rat hippocampal slices was associated with protein synthesis-dependent presynaptic structural changes. Using proteomics, we determined that CB<sub>1</sub> activation in hippocampal neurons resulted in increased ribosomal proteins and initiation factors, but decreased levels of proteins involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, such as ARPC2 and WASF1/WAVE1, and presynaptic release. Moreover, while CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD increased ubiquitin/proteasome activity, ubiquitination but not proteasomal degradation was critical for structural and functional presynaptic CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD. Thus, CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD relies on both protein synthesis and ubiquitination to elicit structural changes that underlie long-term reduction of GABA release.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>structural plasticity</kwd><kwd>presynaptic</kwd><kwd>protein synthesis</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>cannabinoid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31MH114431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monday</surname><given-names>Hannah R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-MH081935</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castillo</surname><given-names>Pablo E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DA17392</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castillo</surname><given-names>Pablo E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS113600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castillo</surname><given-names>Pablo E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AG039521</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jordan</surname><given-names>Bryen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rainwater Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bourdenx</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CB<sub>1</sub>-receptor-mediated inhibitory long-term depression (LTD) relies on both protein synthesis and ubiquitination to elicit structural changes that underlie long-term reduction of GABA release.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to change their strength in response to activity or experience, underlies information storage in the brain. While presynaptic forms of plasticity, thatÂ is long-term synaptic strengthening (long-term potentiation or LTP) and weakening (long-term depression or LTD) due to long-lasting increase and decrease in neurotransmitter release, respectively, are widely expressed in the brain, their mechanism remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Castillo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Monday and Castillo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Monday et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Yang and Calakos, 2013</xref>). A good example of a ubiquitous form of long-lasting reduction of transmitter release is type-1 cannabinoid receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>)-mediated LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araque et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Castillo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Heifets and Castillo, 2009</xref>). Here, endogenous cannabinoids (eCBs) are released upon activity and travel in a retrograde manner to bind presynaptic CB<sub>1</sub>, a G<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled receptor, resulting in CB<sub>1</sub>-LTD at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Induction of long-term eCB-mediated plasticity requires extended (minutes) CB<sub>1</sub> activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chevaleyre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Ronesi, 2004</xref>). Although the presynaptic changes downstream CB<sub>1</sub> that suppress transmitter release in a long-term manner remain unclear, there is evidence that presynaptic protein synthesis is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Yin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Younts et al., 2016</xref>), but what proteins are synthesized and the precise role of these proteins in CB<sub>1</sub>-LTD is unclear.</p><p>Proteostatic mechanisms, the cellular processes that balance protein synthesis and degradation, are vital for neuronal function and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Biever et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Birdsall and Waites, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cohen and Ziv, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Liang and Sigrist, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In postsynaptic forms of plasticity, such as NMDA receptor-dependent LTP, local protein synthesis has been tightly correlated with both consolidation of LTP and structural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bosch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Ostroff et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tominaga-Yoshino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). In particular, synthesis of Î²-actin, AMPA receptors, and CaMKII proteins may be critical for the increase in dendritic spine volume and synapse strength associated with LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bramham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Nakahata and Yasuda, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Rangaraju et al., 2017</xref>). Concurrent regulation of protein degradation through the proteasome and lysosome is also required for activity-dependent pre- and postsynaptic changes in synapse strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Biever et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cohen and Ziv, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hegde, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Monday et al., 2018</xref>). We and others have recently provided evidence for rapid (&lt;30 min) presynaptic protein synthesis under basal conditions and during plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hafner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Younts et al., 2016</xref>), but whether these newly synthesized proteins participate in CB<sub>1</sub>-LTD by regulating presynaptic structural changes is unknown.</p><p>Presynaptic structure and function are controlled by actin polymerization and depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cingolani and Goda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>). Branched actin filaments in the presynaptic compartment provide a scaffold for synaptic vesicles and the active zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Michel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Rust and Maritzen, 2015</xref>). Moreover, structural changes of the presynaptic terminal are associated with altered synapse strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gundelfinger and Fejtova, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Matz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Monday and Castillo, 2017</xref>), and the size of the presynaptic terminal and active zone has been correlated with the postsynaptic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartol et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bourne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>). There is evidence that CB<sub>1</sub> activation alters the ultrastructural vesicle distribution in CB<sub>1</sub>-expressing (CB<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>) boutons on short time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">GarcÃ­a-Morales et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">RamÃ­rez-Franco et al., 2014</xref>) and leads to retraction of growth cones in developing axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Roland et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is not known whether CB<sub>1</sub>-LTD is associated with morphological changes in presynaptic structure in the mature mammalian brain.</p><p>Here, to gain insights into the expression mechanisms of CB<sub>1</sub>-LTD, we examined potential structural changes in CB<sub>1</sub>-mediated LTD of inhibitory transmission (CB<sub>1-</sub>iLTD) in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003</xref>). Using high-resolution microscopy in acute rat hippocampal slices we found that this form of plasticity was associated with a reduction of presynaptic bouton volume that required protein synthesis. To test how protein synthesis could alter presynaptic structure during CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD, we used an unbiased proteomics approach to identify CB<sub>1</sub> activation-mediated changes in the proteome of hippocampal neuron cultures. CB<sub>1</sub> activation elicited an increase in proteins involved in protein synthesis, processing and degradation, whereas presynaptic and actin cytoskeletal proteins, including ARPC2 and WASF1/WAVE1 were decreased. CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD involved actin remodeling, Rac1 and the actin branching protein complex Arp2/3. Lastly, ubiquitination of proteins but not proteasomal degradation was necessary for both structural and functional CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Induction of CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD is associated with a reduction in CB<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup>Â bouton size</title><p>Diverse forms of long-lasting synaptic plasticity require translation-dependent structural remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bramham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Nakahata and Yasuda, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Rangaraju et al., 2017</xref>). To test whether CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD is associated with structural plasticity, we examined changes in the morphology of CB<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> boutons following induction of CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD. To accurately measure individual bouton volume in acute hippocampal slices, we utilized high-resolution and high yield Airyscan confocal microscopy combined with 3D reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To induce CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD the CB<sub>1</sub> agonist WIN 55,212â2 (5 ÂµM) was bath applied for 25 min, and induction was confirmed by monitoring extracellular field inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (fIPSPs), which allows non-invasive, stable long-term assessment of inhibitory synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Heifets et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Younts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

This structural change was long-lasting as it persisted for 60 min after WIN treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and it was blocked by concurrent bath application with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX, 80 ÂµM), demonstrating a requirement for protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). CHX alone did not affect basal bouton volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). This overall shrinkage by WIN treatment was driven by an increase in the proportion of the small CB<sub>1</sub> boutons and a trend toward a decrease in large boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). This effect was specific because volume of parvalbumin (PV<sup>+</sup>) boutons in the CA1 pyramidal layer was not altered by WIN application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A,B</xref>), as assessed by immunolabeling for PV boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Younts et al., 2016</xref>), which do not express CB<sub>1</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Glickfeld and Scanziani, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). As a complementary approach, we used Bassoon immunolabeling to assess the size of the presynaptic active zone. Similar to the total bouton volume, Bassoon size within CB<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> boutons was also significantly decreased following WIN application and this effect was blocked by CHX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâF</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>).

These results strongly suggest that CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD is associated with a protein-synthesis-dependent shrinkage of CB<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> boutons, which may contribute to the long-lasting reduction in neurotransmitter release observed in this form of plasticity.

To identify and quantitate changes in the neuronal proteome, we used Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jordan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Two populations of cultured rat hippocampal neurons (âmediumâ and âheavyâ) were labeled using distinct combinations of âmediumâ or âheavyâ stable-isotope weight variants of Arginine and Lysine.

Samples were combined and simultaneously analyzed by tandem MS/MS to identify and quantify changes induced by CB<sub>1</sub> receptor activation. To strengthen the robustness of findings, we performed a replicate âreverseâ experiment where âheavyâ neurons were treated with WIN and observed a high degree of correlation between replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>We found significant changes across the protein landscape.

A number of presynaptic proteins were downregulated following CB<sub>1</sub> activation. Notably, two key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, Actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 2 (ARPC2) and Wiscott-Aldrich Associated Protein family (WASF1/WAVE1) were significantly downregulated, suggesting these proteins could be implicated in the reduction of neurotransmitter release and presynaptic volume associated with CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD. Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>), we identified enriched functional gene ontology (GO) terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). To reduce redundancy, we clustered closely related GO terms using network analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Merico et al., 2010</xref>), where edge length corresponds to the number of overlapping proteins in the GO term, node size indicates the number of proteins belonging to the term, and color represents the enrichment score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In accordance with translational upregulation following CB<sub>1</sub> activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Younts et al., 2016</xref>), the top cluster represented upregulated GO terms related to âProtein synthesis and processingâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The second cluster was composed of GO terms relating to âNeuronal projectionsâ, suggestive of the structural change associated with CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD. The third cluster was GO terms associated with âEnergy metabolismâ which may be representative of the previously reported CB<sub>1</sub>-mediated decrease in cellular respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hebert-Chatelain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Mendizabal-Zubiaga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD was impaired by application of NSC (30 ÂµM, 25 min) during induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

To directly test the role of Arp2/3 in CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD we utilized CK-666 (100 ÂµM), a compound that inhibits Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly by stabilizing the inactive conformation of Arp (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Basu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hetrick et al., 2013</xref>).

Unlike NSC, CK-666 had no effect on basal inhibitory transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), presumably because the inhibitor stabilizes the inactive (unbound) Arp2/3, but does not affect the Arp2/3 bound to actin filaments.

The enhancement of CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD by CK-666 application probably occurs because the unbound Arp2/3 that has not been degraded following CB<sub>1</sub> activation becomes inhibited and cannot maintain actin branches, thereby resulting in further depolymerization.

We analyzed ubiquitination sites on a subset of proteins that were decreased by CB<sub>1</sub> activation and found that most ubiquitination sites (~60%) were located in protein-protein or protein-membrane interaction domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akimov et al., 2018</xref>), indicating that ubiquitination of these proteins could impact their function.

Using two structurally and mechanistically distinct E1 Ubiquitin ligase inhibitors, ziram and PYR-41 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Rinetti and Schweizer, 2010</xref>), we directly tested whether ubiquitination was required for CB<sub>1-</sub>iLTD and found that bath application of ziram or PYR-41 blocked CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) but had no significant effect on basal transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D</xref>).

Ubiquitination is required for protein synthesis-dependent structural and functional changes of CB<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> boutons. CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD is associated with decreases in presynaptic and cytomatrix proteins, including ARPC2 and WASF1/WAVE1, and relies on actin dynamics. However, while proteasomal activity increases by CB<sub>1</sub> activation, only protein ubiquitination is required for structural and functional CB<sub>1-</sub>iLTD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We discovered that CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD involves structural changes of the presynaptic bouton that require protein synthesis.

Increased proteins are implicated in protein synthesis, processing and degradation, whereas decreased proteins are implicated in presynaptic structure, including ARPC2 and WASF1/WAVE, and function. CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD involved actin remodeling, Rac1 and Arp2/3 signaling. Unexpectedly, we found that protein ubiquitination, but not proteasomal degradation, is responsible for structural and functional CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD. Together, these findings point to a mechanism by which inhibitory presynapses can control their strength in response to CB<sub>1</sub> activation via rapid proteostatic regulation of presynaptic structural change.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Presynaptic structural changes in CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD</title><p>While structural changes are part and parcel of postsynaptic forms of plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bramham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Nakahata and Yasuda, 2018</xref>), and changes associated with plasticity are thought to be coordinated across the synaptic cleft, the involvement of structural changes of the presynaptic terminal in forms of long-term presynaptic plasticity are less clear. Here, we provide evidence for long-term structural changes at mature CB<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> terminals associated with CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD. Previous work showed CB<sub>1</sub> receptor activation can trigger ultrastructural changes in vesicle distribution associated with short-term CB<sub>1</sub>-mediated plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">GarcÃ­a-Morales et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">RamÃ­rez-Franco et al., 2014</xref>), collapse of axonal growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berghuis et al., 2007</xref>), and inhibitory bouton formation in response to strong postsynaptic excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). Our data show that transient activation of CB<sub>1</sub> receptors leads to a long-term reduction of the presynaptic CB<sub>1</sub><sup>+</sup> compartment volume in somatic synapses onto CA1 pyramidal cells. Our findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) are consistent with a previous study showing that CB<sub>1</sub> receptors regulate actin dynamics in growth cones by directly interacting with Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Njoo et al., 2015</xref>), a Rho GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mattheus et al., 2016</xref>). By directly binding CB<sub>1</sub>, Rac1 can localize the WRC which consists of WASF1/WAVE1, Cyfip1, Nap1, Abi and HSP300, at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Eden et al., 2002</xref>). The WRC is intrinsically inactive at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Derivery et al., 2009</xref>), but upon recruitment to the membrane by Rac1 the cytoplasmic side is opened for binding to Arp2/3 and actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Eden et al., 2002</xref>), leading to dissociation of WASF1. Although the exact mechanism of degradation has not been shown for Arp2/3 or WASF1/WAVE1, the non-neuronal, structurally homologous isoform WAVE2 was demonstrated to undergo activation-dependent dissociation from the WRC ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, Rac1 could be required for the degradation of WASF1/WAVE1, but its direct involvement in presynaptic degradation of Arp2/3 is not as clear. Our strategy of bath application of pharmacological inhibitors does not allow us to rule out an extra-presynaptic effect.</p><p>Other studies have suggested alternative signaling pathways by which structural changes occur downstream of CB<sub>1</sub> activation. For instance, atypical coupling of CB<sub>1</sub> to G<sub>12/13</sub> proteins reportedly engages Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) signaling to the actomyosin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Roland et al., 2014</xref>), whereas in another example, Î²-integrin signaling to ROCK has been implicated in a cannabinoid-mediated form of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>). Therefore, the signaling pathways and structural changes involved downstream of CB<sub>1</sub> receptors seem to be synapse and cell-type-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Steindel et al., 2013</xref>). Whether CB-LTD at other synapses shares similar mechanisms remains unclear.</p><p>We showed that CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD involves a rapid reduction in the size of CB<sub>1</sub> boutons and the volume of active zones that requires both actin dynamics and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). CB<sub>1</sub> bouton size was measured by immunolabeling the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor, which, due to the extremely high density and of CB<sub>1</sub> receptors expressed on presynaptic boutons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, has been shown to be a reliable approximation of bouton volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Dudok et al., 2015</xref>).

It is unlikely that CB<sub>1</sub> internalization can account for the volumetric change since the high density of CB<sub>1</sub> means that a large proportion of receptors would have to be internalized to affect measurement of the bouton size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Thibault et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the CB<sub>1</sub>-mediated presynaptic shrinkage is blocked by protein synthesis inhibition whereas internalization is not protein synthesis-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hsieh et al., 1999</xref>) and is also detectable at the sub-presynaptic compartment level with Bassoon and VGAT labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>), two well-established markers of presynaptic structure.

We found that CB<sub>1</sub> activation significantly upregulated proteins involved in protein synthesis and processing pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This increase in initiation factors and ribosomal proteins suggests that plasticity likely triggers an enhanced translational capacity which is consistent with our previous findings using Fluorescent Noncanonical Amino acid Tagging (FUNCAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Younts et al., 2016</xref>). mRNAs for Arp2/3, WAVE1, and Î²-actin have been detected in axonal preparations and their synthesis may be important for axon formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Donnelly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Spillane et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wong et al., 2017</xref>). However, in CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD, protein synthesis seems to mediate the change in presynaptic structure via the UPS, rather than direct synthesis of actin regulators. What then is being synthesized to mediate the change in structure and function? Our finding of downregulation of many presynaptic proteins and upregulation of components of the UPS suggested to us that perhaps this upregulation represents an activity-dependent synthesis of regulatory elements in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation pathway.</p><p>Although such a mechanism requires greater coordination, it would also reduce energy expenditure over time, thatÂ is if a presynaptic terminal will not be releasing neurotransmitter for an extended period of time (hours to days) it makes sense to degrade and recycle the release machinery, to reduce energy production, and to shrink the terminal to make space for new growth. Protein synthesis is likely necessary for the coordination and engagement of these structural, metabolic, and degradative processes. We measured changes in the protein landscape that occur fairly rapidly after CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD induction (25 min) given that CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD was dependent on protein synthesis during this time window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Younts et al., 2016</xref>).

In contrast, components of the protein degradation pathway, including proteasomal subunits, E2 ubiquitin ligases, and degradative enzymes, were upregulated perhaps reflecting on-demand synthesis which could regulate fast, local presynaptic protein degradation. While activity-dependent local presynaptic synthesis of UPS machinery has never been demonstrated, there is strong evidence that presynaptic function can be regulated by expression of specific E3 ubiquitin ligases and degradation of select presynaptic proteins.

This rapid activity-dependent degradation could be mediated by the recently discovered neuron-specific proteasome complex (NMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ramachandran et al., 2018</xref>), although this complex is believed to target non-ubiquitinated substrates. Protein degradation has also been shown to regulate presynaptic silencing, specifically by degradation of presynaptic proteins such as RIM1 and Munc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>) and CB<sub>1</sub>-mediated suppression of transmission at excitatory synapses via degradation of Munc18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Schmitz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>). Homeostatic plasticity in response to neuron silencing has also been associated with degradation of select presynaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lazarevic et al., 2011</xref>). However, our data strongly support the idea that protein degradation by the UPS is not directly required for CB<sub>1-</sub>iLTD, but likely does occur quickly after CB<sub>1</sub> activation, as indicated by rapid loss of presynaptic proteins measured with both SILAC and western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This rapid reduction in protein levels presumably occurs as a consequence of enhanced UPS activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), but we cannot exclude that a different mechanism could be involved including reduced synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">DÃ¶rrbaum et al., 2020</xref>) or other protein degradation pathways, such as autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Liang and Sigrist, 2018</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrated that ubiquitination is required for CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD, likely by controlling the trafficking, interactions, or the activity of its substrates, upstream of degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hamilton and Zito, 2013</xref>). A previous study showed that inhibition of protein ubiquitination and degradation increased miniature EPSCs/IPSCs in cultured neurons, suggesting an important role for these processes in maintaining normal neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Rinetti and Schweizer, 2010</xref>). However, in our hands, proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 had no significant effects on basal synaptic transmission and neither did E1 ubiquitin ligase inhibitors, ziram and PYR-41. To our knowledge, our study is the first to describe a mechanism of long-term presynaptic structural and functional plasticity that relies on ubiquitination. The regulation of presynaptic ubiquitination is likely achieved through the targeted expression of different E2 and E3 ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hallengren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Koga et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Yao et al., 2007</xref>) or via presynaptic cytomatrix proteins themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ivanova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Waites et al., 2013</xref>).

CNQX, D-APV, SR 141716, and WIN 55,212â2 were acquired from the NIMH Chemical Synthesis and Drug Supply Program; salts for making cutting, ACSF, ziram, and intracellular recording solutions from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO); AM251, NSC-23766, MG-132, DAMGO, cycloheximide from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol UK); jasplakinolide, anisomycin, PYR41 from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI); CK-666 from EMD Millipore. Reagents were either acutely bath applied, diluted into the intracellular recording solution, or preincubated with slices/cultures, as indicated in Results.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Thomas Younts, Dr. Matthew Klein, and Dr. Ana Maria Cuervo for helpful discussions.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Erin M Schuman (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers were positive about the manuscript but had a robust discussion of points that they though required additional input. The summary includes the main points that arose in the discussion. The original reviews follow. Please address both the summary and the reviews in your revised manuscript.</p><p>Summary of reviewer discussion:</p><p>1) Immunostaining for the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor was used as a proxy for terminal size. This could be OK, but the bouton volume data should be checked critically. For example, the shrinkage of the terminal as measured by Bassoon is smaller than that measured by CB<sub>1</sub>. The authors use an agonist of CB<sub>1</sub> throughout the paper â this will certainly change the configuration of the receptor (dimerization, clustering, internalization) that could artificially inflate the shrinkage they claim. This point should be discussed.</p><p>2) The MS data needs the tolerance value and stats. The link between the requirement for ubiquitination and protein synthesis is not as strong as it could be. The authors could add experimental data or should at least include a working model in their discussion addressing such questions as: Are both required? Do they operate in parallel or is new synthesis needed for ubiquitination?</p><p>3) Drug alone controls are missing for several conditions, particularly CHX and JSK.</p><p>4) The conclusions RE Rac and Arp need to be modified because the cellular site of action is not established in this study. The manipulations are pharmacological, and although the narrative and proteomics wants us to think about a pre-terminal action, one could imagine postsynaptic effects as these proteins are well-known for postsynaptic roles. The authors need to modify their conclusions or use tools that exist to cell specifically manipulate these proteins and establish the site of action.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript explores a functional role for presynaptic protein synthesis in modulating structural plasticity of inhibitory presynaptic boutons during LTD. The authors provide data for protein synthesis dependent shrinkage of CB<sub>1</sub>+ boutons during endocannabinoid mediated LTD. Using proteomics, they identify 33 upregulated and 27 downregulated proteins during LTD. They narrow in and explore a role for actin remodeling during LTD, focusing on the role of Rac1 and Arp2/3, specifically the downregulation of both, for the manifestation of CB<sub>1</sub>+ boutons shrinkage. Lastly, they argue that while proteasomal degradation is induced during LTD, only the ubiquitination itself is important for the structural and functional manifestation of LTD.</p><p>The data presented on presynaptic structural plasticity are exciting but there are missing key control experiments and validations â as indicated below.</p><p>Figure 1:</p><p>While the detailed description of the analysis of the boutons was appreciated, the data presented in 1C are not convincing in their present state. The authors provide no controls to ensure that it's not endocytosis/remodeling of the CB<sub>1</sub> receptors themselves, which would also result in a decreased CB<sub>1</sub> volume. Additional inhibitory presynaptic markers (such as VGAT) should also be assessed and scored. Given the strict cutoffs the authors use in the analysis (ie sphericity value within the Imaris analysis), it could be that they're simply detecting a subset of smaller CB<sub>1</sub> puncta resulting from local changes in the receptor pool; while the boutons themselves remain largely unchanged. The use of this CB<sub>1</sub> volumetric analysis through the paper is problematic, as in almost all cases the authors do not test the effects of the pharmacological treatment alone (CHX, JSK, CK-666, NSC and ziram). Most if not all of the conclusions could be substantially undercut if these treatments in control conditions show the same change as when paired with WIN treatment. The study of structural plasticity in the postsynapse has largely relied on live cell imaging, so the compartment can be analyzed before, during and post treatment. While challenging, the authors should consider a similar approach, even if only to demonstrate their CB<sub>1</sub> volumetric approach is valid. Using either an inhibitory neuron restricted GFP expression or expression of a tagged inhibitory presynaptic protein to allow live imaging of the bouton volume before and after WIN application, the authors could the perform fixation and staining for CB<sub>1</sub> receptors and analyze how this compartment changed during the course of the treatments. This would bring their approach more in line with the standard in the field and allow for much more current and compelling analysis for structural plasticity to be performed.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>â Examples (similar as in 1A) should be provided of CB<sub>1</sub> boutons with WIN/WIN+CHX treatment.</p><p>â CHX treatment alone should be assessed for C.</p><p>â CHX and WIN+CHX should be assessed for D.</p><p>â Did the authors look at what happens to the corresponding inhibitory postsynaptic compartments? Presumably these also may decrease in size as well.</p><p>â For Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C, the indicated mean for the WIN group for the graph provided should be checked. Given the large increase in the low volume population seen in the WIN group vs control group; and the similar size of the groups (540 vs 602) it's hard to understand how both means can be right around 1.</p><p>Figure 2:</p><p>The experimental design (multiplexing of fully medium-heavy and heavy labeled cell cultures) is nice, but there are several potential issues regarding data processing and interpretation.</p><p>Protein identification and quantification:</p><p>â The accepted parent mass tolerance of 50 PPM is very high and might lead to false identifications. When acquiring the data with an MS1 resolution of 60k on a well-calibrated Orbitrap LTQ instrument, a MS1 mass tolerance of ~5 PPM should be used.</p><p>â Why are the SILAC labels (Lys4/Arg6 and Lys8/Arg10) specified as variable modifications instead of âSILAC pairsâ? Please describe in more detail how the medium-heavy and heavy counterparts were quantified and how the fold-changes were calculated. Were only peptides species considered that were quantified in the medium heavy and heavy form? Why not using software that provide well-established workflows for SILAC quantification (such as the freeware MaxQuant)?</p><p>â From Supplementary file 1, we understand that each ~700 proteins were identified in the forward and the reverse samples. The overlap between the two samples is 391 proteins (main text), indicating that the reproducibility is fairly low between the measurements.</p><p>Statistics:</p><p>â Please perform proper statistics to identify differentially regulated proteins (e.g. t-test and multiple testing correction). A simple fold-change cut-off (as described in Figure 2C) is not state-of-the-art.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>â The supplementary data should be improved to enable the reader to understand the proteomics data and inspect all quantified proteins. Please include one table that presents the quantitative results for all proteins in all biological replicates (forward and reverse), so that the reader can get a sense for the biological variability. Please include a column with gene names. In Supplementary file 1, why does the table contain proteins from <italic>rattus norvegicus</italic>, <italic>mus musculus</italic> and human?</p><p>â All mass spec raw data and database search results should be uploaded to the PRIDE repository prior to publication and the PRIDE identifier should be included in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Data interpretation:</p><p>â Protein up-regulation is often interpreted as increased protein synthesis and protein down-regulation is often interpreted as increased degradation in the manuscript. However, based on the SILAC-MS data one cannot draw these conclusions. Protein up-regulation could result from more synthesis or less degradation and protein down-regulation could result from less synthesis or more degradation. Based on the presented data there is no evidence for one or the other.</p><p>â Based on the proteomics data one cannot distinguish proteins from different subcellular compartment or different cell types. The following statement from the Discussion sections is hence misleading: &quot;[â¦] why ribosomal proteins would be synthesized locally if ribosomes are exclusively assembled in the nucleolus is unclear.&quot;</p><p>Figure 3:</p><p>The authors refer to JSK as an &quot;actin stabilizing drug&quot;, whereas in fact it's a drug that promotes actin polymerization. This fact complicates the data presented in this figure as essential controls (such as JSK treatment alone for 3A) are missing. If JSK treatment alone increases the bouton size, is this really demonstrating that the structural remodeling requires actin depolymerization?</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>â 3A, the examples provided with the black background are harder to examine. The authors should use the white background used in Figure 1 and Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 examples.</p><p>â 3B, what explanation do the authors have for why the +JSK/WIN treated curve stabilizes around 80%?</p><p>â Additionally, the authors should test the effect of the Arp2/3 inhibitor and Rac inhibitor with and without WIN treatment on the bouton volume.</p><p>Figure 5:</p><p>Specific comments</p><p>â 5D, examples would be better with white backgrounds.</p><p>â Analysis for the effect of ziram alone needs to be done.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study by Monday and colleagues, the investigators reveal structural plasticity of presynaptic terminal bouton sizes and underlying molecular mechanisms for iLTD, a form of endocannabinoid induced long-term depression of inhibitory synapses. Their discovery establishes that the well-described post-synaptic phenomenon of spine growth/shrinkage with plasticity can also exist in presynaptic compartments in presynaptic forms of plasticity. This finding is demonstrated by volumetric bouton measurements of CB<sub>1</sub>+ terminals in hippocampal slices. The remainder of the study involves a series of elegantly and rigorously designed experiments to provide insights to the molecular mechanisms for this structural plasticity. Insights begin with a proteomic analysis performed on cultured hippocampal neurons, and then use pharmacology and Western analysis to test a main hypothesis that changes in the abundance and activity of actin regulators underlie the structural plasticity. The study continues to reveal that despite their hypothesis that proteasomal degradation could drive those shifts, experiments instead support the idea that ubiquitination, in the absence of degradation (assessed by MG-132) appears to underlie the functional differences required for iLTD.</p><p>Overall, this study provides an important extension to the Castillo lab's recent work demonstrating the requirement for local protein synthesis for this form of plasticity (Younts et al., 2016). Strengths of this study include the mechanistic depth, general rigor in approaches, and novel insights to a relatively less understood aspect of synaptic plasticity.</p><p>I have two major concerns that should be addressed.</p><p>1) Boutons simply should not be considered individual n's for statistics. The authors are welcome to argue for what the independent biological unit is. Please also clarify, for a given condition (such as Veh or WIN), were slices from the same animal used for multiple conditions, or were the slices from one animal used for one condition at a time? If the latter, then an animal is the biological unit, with the possibility of using nested data statistical approaches. Alternatively, the mean value/slice could be considered. Issues such as animal health, temperature fluctuations, buffer osmolarity et cetera could otherwise exist and generate 100s of values per slice that are a little bigger or smaller due to technical variables. This is a foundational observation for the study and needs to be robust. As presented, it looks small and only visible when n's are in the 1000s. Likewise, although it was good to consider involvement of other inhibitory synapses (like PV<sup>+</sup>), a figure showing no significant difference that is potentially grossly underpowered is not so useful (n's of 500).</p><p>2) In general, the bioinformatics approach was rigorously and thoroughly presented. It is also nice that the authors further discuss results from other programs. One item to clarify â since the GO analyses are the major data presented: please review and clarify the extent to which the <italic>same</italic> protein is annotated with multiple functional properties such that it is populating (and driving) multiple terms on those lists.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors show that CB<sub>1</sub>-LTD involves presynaptic structural plasticity: bouton volumes are reduced, which occurs at least partially via actin reorganization.</p><p>Mass spec data showed results that may have been expected (downregulation of synaptic proteins), but also some unexpected results were found (upregulation of protein synthesis as well as protein degradation system). Finally, the authors show that activation of the ubiquitination system is required for CB<sub>1</sub>-LTD, however not by promoting protein degradation by the proteasome.</p><p>The manuscript contains an interesting data set and the involvement of the ubiquitination system in CB<sub>1</sub>-LTD is highly intriguing. However, after reading the manuscript there are many âlose endsâ, and it is still not clear what happens during CB<sub>1</sub>-LTD. Indeed, the authors themselves describe these events as âcoordinated engagement of multiple cellular processesâ, which does not clarify much. I would like to encourage the authors to try and formulate a more complete hypothesis of the cellular events that underlie CB<sub>1</sub>-LTD.</p><p>I have two major points:</p><p>1) It is not easy to link the proteomics findings to changes in the actin cytoskeleton in presynaptic boutons. For instance, the authors show that WIN slightly reduces Arp2c protein levels, but that inactivating Arp2/3 actually enhances CB<sub>1</sub>-LTD. I am wondering if the explanation given by the authors the most plausible interpretation of the data. Is it known how CB<sub>1</sub>-LTD is expressed (fewer vesicles? reduced release probability?) and is it possible to link this to specific changes in the actin cytoskeleton?</p><p>2) The proteomics data show that multiple processes are activated during CB<sub>1</sub>-LTD. The manuscript does not provide a model or hypothesis for how these processes are linked. For instance, are ubiquitination and protein synthesis independently regulated by CB<sub>1</sub>? What is the link between ubiquitination and presynaptic actin remodeling? Would it be possible to link CB<sub>1</sub>-LTD to a specific E2 or E3 ligase in the presynapse?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised article &quot; CB<sub>1</sub> receptor-mediated inhibitory LTD triggers presynaptic remodeling via protein synthesis and ubiquitination&quot; to <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Erin M Schuman (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor. There are some remaining concerns raised by one of the reviewers and by me that we would like you to address as below. These are concerns about the data presentation as embodied in comment 1 of reviewer 2 in the original review. The issue concerns what constitutes &quot;n&quot; in the bouton counts. We suggest a compromise in which supplemental data are shown by slice for full data transparency. Overall, we suspect that artifact is not the basis of the findings, but the data presentation does not allow that assessment and therefore lowers the rigor and potential reproducibility.</p><p>Requested revisions</p><p>1) The authors in their rebuttal argue that standard power calculations are &quot;unreasonable&quot; because n of 145 slices would be required. At the most fundamental level, if this were true, this question and conclusion are not appropriate given the constraints of the methodology and one should focus on powerable questions. However, a statistical analysis by a statistician might indicate other analytical approaches. The authors show how close to being powered they may be with the slice means alone (not including nesting) showing significance. If the authors want to show the data as is in the main figure, the authors could address this concern by creating supplemental figures that show bouton size distributions for each slice and also figures with slice means and exact p values.</p><p>2) Bassoon puncta were to serve as an independent measure of bouton size to support the CB<sub>1</sub> observations. However, the methods describe first making a binary mask of CB<sub>1</sub> signal, then using the &quot;and&quot; function to isolate the bassoon pixels that overlap with CB<sub>1</sub> pixels. As described, it is almost impossible to reach any other conclusion than reproducing the CB<sub>1</sub> measurement results. Please clarify methods substantially to remove this concern.</p><p>3) In working to propose a solution for data presentation, the authors raise an important point, supplemental data should include an analysis that addresses whether the plasticity effects preferentially involve a particular size subset, smaller or large.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot; CB<sub>1</sub> receptor-mediated inhibitory LTD triggers presynaptic remodeling via protein synthesis and ubiquitination&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We have addressed the reviewers concerns about using CB<sub>1</sub> as a proxy for bouton volume in the following ways: 1. While CB<sub>1</sub> internalization has been reported, it does not require protein synthesis, so the fact that we see a blockade of the structural change with cycloheximide would suggest we are measuring a change in volume, not internalization of CB<sub>1</sub>. 2. Based on previous work, it seems unlikely that our protocol would cause significant redistribution of CB<sub>1</sub> (Dudok et al., 2015; Thibault et al., 2013). In particular, the very high density of CB<sub>1</sub> on interneuron boutons makes it such that even a partial shift of CB<sub>1</sub> to endosomes would not affect the labeling of the bouton membrane (Thibault et al., 2013). 3. We have quantified the colocalization of CB<sub>1</sub> and endosomal marker, Rab7 (Feng et al., 1995), a way of estimating internalized CB<sub>1</sub> (Howlett et al., 2010), which was not significantly altered by CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD induction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> in response to reviewer 1 below) 4. We do not anticipate that clustering or dimerization could artificially inflate the shrinkage because these processes would not necessarily pull receptors towards the bouton centerpoint, but would more likely stochastically change the distribution of CB<sub>1</sub> on the surface of the membrane which, given our 3D analysis, would still provide an accurate measure of the bouton volume. Moreover, dimerization/clustering should not be sensitive to protein synthesis inhibition. 5. Finally, and as suggested by reviewer 1, we have added new data demonstrating that VGAT, an additional CB<sub>1</sub>-independent marker of inhibitory boutons, is also robustly reduced by CB<sub>1</sub> (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E). 6. Lastly, we have now added a thorough discussion of the research that exists on CB<sub>1</sub> internalization.</p><p>In addition, as requested, we have added new data in which we analyzed the Bassoon size following cycloheximide treatment (See Figure 1F). In this dataset, which now includes more ânâsâ, the magnitude of the reduction in active zone size following WIN treatment is similar to that measured with CB<sub>1</sub>. However, it is not clear whether all components of the presynaptic bouton shrink proportionately. For example, we see a fairly large change in VGAT volume, consistent with previous reports of short-term CB<sub>1</sub> activation-induced vesicle redistribution and changes in numbers of docked/primed vesicles (Garcia-Morales et al., 2015; Ramirez-Franco et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The MS data needs the tolerance value and stats. The link between the requirement for ubiquitination and protein synthesis is not as strong as it could be.

The manipulations are pharmacological, and although the narrative and proteomics wants us to think about a pre-terminal action, one could imagine postsynaptic effects as these proteins are well-known for postsynaptic roles.

While these proteins have been well studied postsynaptically, they also have established roles in presynaptic function (Gokhale et al., 2016; Njoo et al., 2015; Roesler et al., 2019). Given that our induction protocol relies only on presynaptic receptor activation (e.g. CB<sub>1</sub> receptors are expressed at GABAergic terminals but not CA1 pyramidal neurons), which triggers a presynaptic structural change that relies on actin dynamics, a presynaptic target is the most likely explanation for our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[â¦]</p><p>Figure 1:</p><p>While the detailed description of the analysis of the boutons was appreciated, the data presented in 1C are not convincing in their present state. The authors provide no controls to ensure that it's not endocytosis/remodeling of the CB<sub>1</sub> receptors themselves, which would also result in a decreased CB<sub>1</sub> volume. Additional inhibitory presynaptic markers (such as VGAT) should also be assessed and scored. Given the strict cutoffs the authors use in the analysis (ie sphericity value within the Imaris analysis), it could be that they're simply detecting a subset of smaller CB<sub>1</sub> puncta resulting from local changes in the receptor pool; while the boutons themselves remain largely unchanged. The use of this CB<sub>1</sub> volumetric analysis through the paper is problematic, as in almost all cases the authors do not test the effects of the pharmacological treatment alone (CHX, JSK, CK-666, NSC and ziram). Most if not all of the conclusions could be substantially undercut if these treatments in control conditions show the same change as when paired with WIN treatment. The study of structural plasticity in the postsynapse has largely relied on live cell imaging, so the compartment can be analyzed before, during and post treatment. While challenging, the authors should consider a similar approach, even if only to demonstrate their CB<sub>1</sub> volumetric approach is valid. Using either an inhibitory neuron restricted GFP expression or expression of a tagged inhibitory presynaptic protein to allow live imaging of the bouton volume before and after WIN application, the authors could the perform fixation and staining for CB<sub>1</sub> receptors and analyze how this compartment changed during the course of the treatments. This would bring their approach more in line with the standard in the field and allow for much more current and compelling analysis for structural plasticity to be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for her constructive criticism.</p><p>Protein synthesis inhibition blocks the change in bouton volume, whereas receptor internalization or dimerization is not dependent on protein synthesis.

While some in vitro data supports the notion that JSK promotes actin nucleation, the effect of JSK is highly dependent on the presence of monomeric actin, other actin binding proteins, and the concentration and duration of JSK exposure (Bubb et al., 2000). There is also evidence for a paradoxical decrease in the amount of F-actin with JSK in some parts of the cell wherein actin remodeling was prevented via a sequestration of monomeric actin (Bubb et al., 2000; Spector et al., 1999). Overall, the net effect of JSK may be hard to predict, but all reports agree that it interferes with the normal polymerization of actin. For this reason and since we cannot measure exact F- or G-actin levels at these particular boutons, we have modified our conclusions with JSK accordingly to indicate only that CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD relies on âactin dynamicsâ and not polymerization specifically.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>â 3A, the examples provided with the black background are harder to examine.

The most likely explanation is that the mechanism of iLTD may rely only partially on the stabilization of filamentous actin. This is somewhat borne out by the structural data which is also not completely restored to baseline and may be due to the additional requirement of Arp2/3 or other actin binding proteins in iLTD. Alternatively, this could be a result of incomplete stabilization of actin polymers due to the inability of the drug to permeate deep enough into the tissue or other changes associated with JSK treatment such as sequestration of monomeric actin (discussed in more detail above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Additionally, the authors should test the effect of the Arp2/3 inhibitor and Rac inhibitor with and without WIN treatment on the bouton volume.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to perform this experiment but were interrupted by the COVID-19-related shutdown of the lab which resulted in the loss of the samples we had collected.

The authors are welcome to argue for what the independent biological unit is. Please also clarify, for a given condition (such as Veh or WIN), were slices from the same animal used for multiple conditions, or were the slices from one animal used for one condition at a time? If the latter, then an animal is the biological unit, with the possibility of using nested data statistical approaches. Alternatively, the mean value/slice could be considered. Issues such as animal health, temperature fluctuations, buffer osmolarity et cetera could otherwise exist and generate 100s of values per slice that are a little bigger or smaller due to technical variables. This is a foundational observation for the study and needs to be robust. As presented, it looks small and only visible when n's are in the 1000s. Likewise, although it was good to consider involvement of other inhibitory synapses (like PV<sup>+</sup>), a figure showing no significant difference that is potentially grossly underpowered is not so useful (n's of 500).</p></disp-quote><p>In these figures, we have used slices from the same rats for multiple conditions. We absolutely agree that slices are vulnerable to factors such as temperature fluctuations, changes in buffer osmolarity/oxygenation, etc. For this reason, each experiment and all conditions were performed at the same time on the same day with the same buffer using slices from the same animal. In order to further balance the conditions, slices were matched by location in the dorsalventral axis across the conditions. We also image at 3 specific locations in the CA1 pyramidal layer to tile the area between CA2 and subiculum. However, even with all these variables controlled for, it is still highly expected that boutons will not be uniform in size. We feel that the intrinsic variability in volume present in the population of boutons is biologically relevant and should be represented for the reader as has been previously reported (Dudok et al., 2015; Lees et al., 2019; Meyer et al., 2014). Moreover, while we fully acknowledge that the percent change we see in bouton volume is small, it is clear that small changes in the nervous system are no less functionally important. According to our power analysis, in order to achieve 80% power, given the standard deviation of bouton volume per slice was averaged at ~0.45, we would require 142 slices per group for an effect size of 10% (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>).

Here, each node represents a GO term and edges represent overlap between gene sets. This analysis highlighted 4 dense clusters (e.g. protein synthesis and processing, neuronal projections, energy metabolism and extracellular space). The observation of distinct clusters of enriched GO terms demonstrates the low overlap between gene-sets and confirms that the associated functional properties are populated by distinct gene-sets.

For instance, the authors show that WIN slightly reduces Arp2c protein levels, but that inactivating Arp2/3 actually enhances CB<sub>1</sub>-LTD. I am wondering if the explanation given by the authors the most plausible interpretation of the data. Is it known how CB<sub>1</sub>-LTD is expressed (fewer vesicles? reduced release probability?) and is it possible to link this to specific changes in the actin cytoskeleton?</p></disp-quote><p>CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD causes a reduction in neurotransmitter release, i.e. reduced release probability (Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2004; Heifets et al., 2008), however the mechanism(s) driving this phenomenon are, as yet, unknown. We have attempted to address this question here, but more work is still needed to understand the exact molecular pathways involved. Early research suggested the mechanism of CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD might rely on dephosphorylation of the active zone protein RIM1Î± (Chevaleyre et al., 2007), but phosphorylation of RIM1Î± by PKA was later shown not to be involved (Kaeser et al., 2008). CB<sub>1</sub> receptor activation has also been suggested to control release via change in vesicular release mode (Aubrey et al., 2017) or change in the distribution of vesicles around the active zone (Garcia-Morales et al., 2015; Ramirez-Franco et al., 2014), but these studies were performed at different synapses that may not express the same form of CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD. In general, it is well-established that the size of the presynaptic bouton and active zone is correlated with the postsynaptic response (Bartol et al., 2015; Bourne et al., 2013; Meyer et al., 2014). Here, we suggest that a smaller bouton and active zone in combination with ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of presynaptic release machinery proteins could explain the reduction in GABA release associated with iLTD.</p><p>The finding that Arp2/3 inactivation enhances CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD may seem a bit counterintuitive but in fact fits well with literature demonstrating that loss of interaction between WASF1/WAVE1 and Arp2/3 causes a loss of functional presynapses (Wegner et al., 2008) and CB<sub>1</sub> activation drives growth cone collapse in a Rac1 dependent manner (Njoo et al., 2015) Our SILAC and WB data show that CB<sub>1</sub>-iLTD triggers loss of ARPC2 and WASF1/WAVE1 which functionally would have the effect of reducing neurotransmitter release (i.e. LTD). Presumably, when we apply CK-666 we are further reducing the pool of Arp2/3 available to participate in the maintenance of actin branches, on top of the Arp2/3 protein that is presumably being degraded, and that is why we see enhanced LTD (i.e. further reduction in neurotransmitter release).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The proteomics data show that multiple processes are activated during CB<sub>1</sub>-LTD. The manuscript does not provide a model or hypothesis for how these processes are linked. For instance, are ubiquitination and protein synthesis independently regulated by CB<sub>1</sub>? What is the link between ubiquitination and presynaptic actin remodeling? Would it be possible to link CB<sub>1</sub>-LTD to a specific E2 or E3 ligase in the presynapse?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided a proposed model in Figure 5E. Based on two pieces of data, the most likely scenario seems to be that protein synthesis triggered by CB<sub>1</sub> activation via mTOR (Younts et al., 2016) is upstream of ubiquitination and structural change. CB<sub>1</sub> activation triggers an upregulation of several proteasomal subunits and E2 ligases (Figure 2, 4), which suggests these components may be synthesized on demand to regulate protein degradation locally. While we cannot exclude that their upregulation comes from a reduction in their degradation, the long half-life of proteasomal subunits makes it unlikely that we could see such a strong increase from reduction in degradation alone in such a short time window (25 min)(Dorrbaum et al., 2018). Structural change requires protein synthesis. Our data suggests that CB<sub>1</sub> activation induces rapid reduction of ARPC2, WASF1/WAVE1 and other components of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), and that this pathway is required for iLTD. We propose that ubiquitination of these proteins underlies structural remodeling.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Requested revisions:</p><p>1) The authors in their rebuttal argue that standard power calculations are &quot;unreasonable&quot; because n of 145 slices would be required.

If the authors want to show the data as is in the main figure, the authors could address this concern by creating supplemental figures that show bouton size distributions for each slice and also figures with slice means and exact p values.</p></disp-quote><p>Excellent point. In response, we have created new supplemental figures (Superplots) that show the bouton size distribution color-coded by slice with the slice means plotted on top and the overall mean of slices overlaid with a vertical line representing the 95% confidence interval (CI) to clearly represent the effect size (Lord et al., 2020). For these figures, we reanalyzed the data and balanced the number of slices/animals across conditions and performed one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey test for multiple comparisons. Exact p-values and confidence intervals are included in each supplemental figure legend. Importantly, our key observations were reproduced using slice as the independent variable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Bassoon puncta were to serve as an independent measure of bouton size to support the CB<sub>1</sub> observations. However, the methods describe first making a binary mask of CB<sub>1</sub> signal, then using the &quot;and&quot; function to isolate the bassoon pixels that overlap with CB<sub>1</sub> pixels. As described, it is almost impossible to reach any other conclusion than reproducing the CB<sub>1</sub> measurement results. Please clarify methods substantially to remove this concern.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. A dilated CB<sub>1</sub> mask was used to isolate Bassoon in the vicinity of and inside CB<sub>1</sub> boutons, the size of Bassoon is free to vary inside the presynaptic terminal since Bassoon labeling is considerably smaller than the CB<sub>1</sub> terminal volume (Average control volume of bassoon: ~ 0.51 Î¼m<sup>3</sup> v. CB<sub>1</sub>: 1.85 Î¼m<sup>3</sup>). We acknowledge the limitations of our method and have removed mentions of the CB<sub>1</sub>-independent nature of this measurement. Of note, our findings are consistent with a large body of previous work showing the active zone size is highly correlated to the overall presynaptic size (Matz et al., 2010; Maus et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In working to propose a solution for data presentation, the authors raise an important point, supplemental data should include an analysis that addresses whether the plasticity effects preferentially involve a particular size subset, smaller or large.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a histogram showing binned bouton distribution per slice to address this question (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C). These data suggest that iLTD results in a reduction in the number of large boutons and an increase in the fraction of small boutons.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) The supplementary figures are highly appreciated and allow critical review of the nature of the experimental data and robustness of the conclusions.</p><p>2) The authors' response indicating that data was removed to balance slice numbers needs to be clarified. One should not have to remove data. If slices were removed from supplementary figure analyses, what guided those decisions? Do the removed slices remain in the main figure data? I would suggest all the data that were believed to be valid in the original submission be included in the main and supplementary figures. (Or was there a situation of grossly unequal n's in the control/win condition and the authors' are trying to make statistical comparisons across similarly sized groups post hoc? In principle, a similar number of interleaved controls should exist for each additional test condition.) Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made the requested clarification points in the manuscript. The reviewers suggested we include <italic>all</italic> slices and use âsliceâ as our independent variable. Following their advice, we went ahead and included plots showing average bouton volume per slices in the main figures (similar to the plots we included in our response to the reviewers) and kept the superplots in supplementary figures.</p><p><bold>References</bold></p><p>Bubb, M.R., Spector, I., Beyer, B.B., and Fosen, K.M.
