<italic>CHD7</italic> are the major cause of CHARGE syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1/15,000. We have little understanding of the disruptions in the developmental programme that underpin brain defects associated with this syndrome. Using mouse models, we show that <italic>Chd7</italic> haploinsufficiency results in reduced <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression in the isthmus organiser (IsO), an embryonic signalling centre that directs early cerebellar development. Consistent with this observation, <italic>Chd7</italic> and <italic>Fgf8</italic> loss-of-function alleles interact during cerebellar development. CHD7 associates with <italic>Otx2</italic> and <italic>Gbx2</italic> regulatory elements and altered expression of these homeobox genes implicates CHD7 in the maintenance of cerebellar identity during embryogenesis. Finally, we report cerebellar vermis hypoplasia in 35% of CHARGE syndrome patients with a proven <italic>CHD7</italic> mutation. These observations provide key insights into the molecular aetiology of cerebellar defects in CHARGE syndrome and link reduced FGF signalling to cerebellar vermis hypoplasia in a human syndrome.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01305.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01305.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01305.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>CHARGE syndrome is a rare genetic condition that causes various developmental abnormalities, including heart defects, deafness and neurological defects. In most cases, it is caused by mutations in a human gene called <italic>CHD7</italic>. CHD7 is known to control the expression of other genes during embryonic development, but the molecular mechanisms by which mutations in <italic>CHD7</italic> lead to the neural defects found in CHARGE syndrome are unclear.</p><p>During embryonic development, the neural tube—the precursor to the nervous system—is divided into segments, which give rise to different neural structures. The r1 segment, for example, forms the cerebellum, and the secretion of a protein called FGF8 (short for fibroblast growth factor 8) by a nearby structure called the isthmus organiser has an important role in this process. Since a reduction in FGF8 causes defects similar to those found in CHARGE syndrome, Yu et al. decided to investigate if the FGF signalling pathway was involved in this syndrome.</p><p>Mice should have two working copies of the <italic>Chd7</italic> gene, and mice that lack one of these suffer from symptoms similar to those of humans with CHARGE syndrome. Yu et al. examined the embryos of these mice and found that the isthmus organiser produced less FGF8. Embryos with no working copies of the gene completely lost the r1 segment. The loss of this segment appeared to be caused by changes in the expression of homeobox genes (the genes that determine the identity of brain segments).</p><p>Embryos that did not have any working copies of the <italic>Chd7</italic> gene died early in development, which made further studies impossible. However, embryos that had one working copy of the <italic>Chd7</italic> gene survived, and Yu et al. took advantage of this to study the effects of reduced FGF8 expression on these mice. These experiments showed that mice with just one working copy of the <italic>Fgf8</italic> gene and one working copy of the <italic>Chd7</italic> gene had a small cerebellar vermis. This part of the cerebellum is known to be very sensitive to changes in FGF8 signalling. Yu et al. then used an MRI scanner to look at the cerebellar vermis in patients with CHARGE syndrome, and found that more than half of the patients had abnormal cerebella.</p><p>In addition to confirming that studies on mouse embryos can provide insights into human disease, the work of Yu et al. add defects in the cerebellar vermis to the list of developmental abnormalities associated with CHARGE syndrome. The next step will be to test if any mutations in the human FGF8 gene can contribute to cerebellar defects in CHARGE syndrome, and to investigate if any other developmental defects in CHARGE syndrome are associated with abnormal FGF8 levels.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01305.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01305.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>CHARGE syndrome</kwd><kwd>CHD7</kwd><kwd>FGF8</kwd><kwd>OTX2</kwd><kwd>GBX2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>091475</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Basson</surname><given-names>M Albert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K022377/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Basson</surname><given-names>M Albert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fund Nuts-Ohra</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1202-023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Monica TY</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PG/12/44/29658, RG/15/13/28570</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scambler</surname><given-names>Peter J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reinberg</surname><given-names>Danny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mutations in CHD7, which cause CHARGE syndrome, cause a reduction in FGF8 signalling and subsequent abnormalities in the cerebellar vermis in both mice and humans.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The segmental organisation of the embryonic neural tube is imparted by the action of homeobox genes that show defined expression patterns along its anterior-posterior axis, in combination with growth factors secreted from distinct organising centres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kiecker and Lumsden, 2012</xref>). The cerebellum is derived from dorsal rhombomere 1 (r1), the anterior-most segment of the embryonic hindbrain. The survival and patterning of r1 is controlled by Fibroblast Growth Factor 8 (FGF8), secreted from the isthmus organiser (IsO), an organising centre located at the boundary between the embryonic midbrain (mesencephalon, mes) and r1 (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakamura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martinez et al., 2013</xref>). The IsO forms at the expression boundary of two homeobox genes: <italic>Otx2</italic> (Orthodenticle Homeobox 2) in the anterior neural tube and, <italic>Gbx2</italic> (Gastrulation Brain Homeobox 2), in the posterior neural tube. <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression in the IsO is initiated at early (3–5) somite stages in the mouse embryo, resulting in a stable gene-regulatory network at the IsO, where (1) cross-repressive interactions between <italic>Otx2</italic> and <italic>Gbx2</italic> maintain the IsO, (2) <italic>Otx2</italic> represses <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression, thus restricting it to r1, and (3) <italic>Fgf8</italic> and <italic>Gbx2</italic> contribute to the maintenance of each other’s expression (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Joyner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martinez et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Studies in the mouse embryo have shown that the level of FGF gene expression and signalling from the IsO has to be tightly controlled to ensure normal cerebellar development. Altered FGF signalling in the mes/r1 region preferentially affects the development of the medial cerebellum, the vermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Trokovic et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yu et al., 2011</xref>), which is derived from precursors in the most anterior part of r1, closest to the source of FGF8 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sgaier et al., 2005</xref>). The observation that reduced FGF signalling results in hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis in mice raises the possibility that reduced FGF signalling might underlie vermis hypoplasia in certain human conditions. However, studies in mice have also found that FGF signalling has many essential roles during development and even small reductions in <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression during embryonic development are incompatible with postnatal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meyers et al., 1998</xref>). These findings suggest that mutations causing sufficiently reduced <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression or signalling throughout the whole embryo to result in cerebellar defects are unlikely to yield viable offspring. Rather, it seems more likely that a disruption of the mechanisms that regulate local <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression at the IsO will be responsible for cerebellar vermis hypoplasia in humans.</p><p>CHARGE syndrome (MIM#214800) is an autosomal dominant disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1/15,000. Central nervous system defects have been reported in CHARGE (Coloboma of the eye, Heart defects, Atresia of the choanae, Retarded growth and development, Genital anomalies and Ear malformations or deafness) syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tellier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Issekutz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sanlaville et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sanlaville and Verloes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergman et al., 2011</xref>), including reports of cerebellar defects in pre-term CHARGE fetuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sanlaville et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Legendre et al., 2012</xref>). Depending on the clinical selection, 60–90% of the individuals suspected for CHARGE syndrome have de novo<italic>,</italic> heterozygous mutations in the <italic>CHD7</italic> (Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7, MIM#608892) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vissers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bilan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janssen et al., 2012</xref>). CHD7 is a member of the SNF2H-like chromatin-remodelling family and has been shown to function as a ‘transcriptional rheostat’ by maintaining appropriate levels of developmental gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schnetz et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>A number of clinical findings led us to hypothesise that some developmental defects in CHARGE syndrome might be caused by insufficient FGF signalling levels. For example, CHARGE syndrome shows significant clinical overlap with 22q11.2 deletion and Kallmann syndromes, both of which have been linked to reduced FGF signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scambler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miraoui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Corsten-Janssen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Randall et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore set out to test the hypothesis that CHD7 is required for normal levels of <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression during development by focusing on the embryonic IsO and cerebellar development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CHD7 regulates <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression levels in the IsO</title><p>We previously reported that mice heterozygous for the <italic>Chd7</italic><sup><italic>XK403</italic></sup> gene-trap allele (henceforth referred to as <italic>Chd7</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice) phenocopy several aspects of CHARGE syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Randall et al., 2009</xref>). To determine whether FGF signalling at the IsO was affected by <italic>Chd7</italic> deletion, we first visualised the expression of <italic>Fgf8</italic> in E9.5 embryos by in situ hybridisation. <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression in the IsO appeared reduced in <italic>Chd7</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> embryos and was substantially downregulated in <italic>Chd7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed that <italic>Fgf8</italic> transcripts were reduced by 20% in <italic>Chd7</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> embryos, and by 40% in <italic>Chd7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression was reduced by 80% in <italic>Chd7</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup><italic>;Fgf8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> embryos, compared to 40% reduction in <italic>Chd7</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup><italic>;Fgf8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To ask whether this synergistic genetic interaction between <italic>Chd7</italic> and <italic>Fgf8</italic> loss-of-function alleles translated to defects in FGF signalling, the expression of the FGF target gene <italic>Etv5</italic> was analysed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Roehl and Nusslein-Volhard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). Whereas <italic>Etv5</italic> expression was clearly diminished in <italic>Chd7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos compared to wildtype controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,G</xref>), it did not appear substantially reduced in <italic>Chd7</italic><sup>+/−</sup> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), an observation confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).

To determine whether cerebellar defects are a common post-natal feature of CHARGE syndrome, we systematically examined cerebellar structure in a cohort of 20 patients with CHARGE syndrome and mutations in the <italic>CHD7</italic> gene. MRI scans revealed cerebellar defects in 55% (11/20) of these patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Patients exhibited cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, varying from slight to pronounced hypoplasia (35%, 7/20, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>) and an anticlockwise rotated vermis (35%, 7/20, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C’</xref>). As a consequence of these abnormalities, fluid-filled spaces surrounding the cerebellum appeared larger. Examples of large foramen of Magendi and fourth ventricle (50%, 10/20) and large subcerebellar cistern (25%, 4/20) are indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>. Thus, cerebellar defects in CHARGE syndrome have some clinical similarities to Dandy-Walker malformations (vermis hypoplasia and anticlockwise rotated vermis), without the overt posterior fossa enlargement typical of Dandy-Walker malformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doherty et al., 2013</xref>). Two patients with vermis hypoplasia exhibited broad gait or ataxia, consistent with defects that disrupt cerebellar function (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, 25% (5/20) of the patients had foliation abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,D’</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), implying additional roles for CHD7 during the process of foliation. We conclude that a substantial proportion of patients with CHARGE syndrome present with cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. The incomplete penetrance of cerebellar vermis defects in patients with <italic>CHD7</italic> mutations is consistent with our studies in the mouse, which suggests that mutations in FGF pathway genes are likely to substantially modify the severity of cerebellar defects in CHARGE syndrome.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01305.007</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Representative sagittal MRI scans of CHARGE syndrome patients.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sagittal T1 scan of patient #18 showing a normal vermis with a normal position, foramen of Magendi (asterisk) and subcerebellar cistern (SC).

We propose that CHD7 remodels chromatin at multiple <italic>Otx2</italic> and <italic>Gbx2</italic> regulatory elements, thereby modifying higher order chromatin architecture and interactions with tissue-specific transcription factors at these loci. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that CHD7 also directly fine-tunes <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression in addition to affecting <italic>Otx2</italic> and <italic>Gbx2</italic> expression, the finding that <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression is not substantially changed in the pharyngeal region of <italic>Chd7</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> embryos (compare e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> with H), suggest that such effects will have to be mediated by CHD7 recruitment to tissue-specific <italic>Fgf8</italic> regulatory elements.</p><p>Our findings predict that mutations and epigenetic alterations of <italic>OTX2</italic> and <italic>GBX2</italic> regulatory regions are likely to contribute to cerebellar hypoplasia in humans and that <italic>OTX2, GBX2</italic> and <italic>FGF8</italic> deregulation might underlie other developmental defects associated with CHARGE syndrome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The <italic>Chd7</italic><sup><italic>XK403</italic></sup> and <italic>Fgf8</italic><sup><italic>lacZ/+</italic></sup> loss-of-function alleles were maintained on C57BL/6J and C57BL/6J × DBA/2J F1 backgrounds for these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ilagan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Randall et al., 2009</xref>).

Images of stained sections were taken and the cerebellar surface area on each section traced and measured by ImageJ. The total volume of each cerebellar region was calculated by multiplying the total surface area of all sections from the same region by the thickness of the sections.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 4 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Robb Krumlauf (Reviewing editor); Kathleen Millen and Mark Lewandowski (peer reviewers).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>There was a uniform opinion among the reviewers that this was an interesting paper thath would be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> following revisions to address several concerns.</p><p>1) This study formally adds cerebellar malformation to the features of CHARGE, demonstrating that isthmic disruption can cause human cerebellar malformations as has long been demonstrated in mice and other models. However, the authors oversell the connection by claiming (in the Abstract and start of the section on cerebellar defects) that their mouse observations “led us to search for cerebellar defects...”. Rather, several previous clinical reports clearly described the occurrence of vermis deficiency as a non-random association with CHARGE, although the authors' series appears the largest in which an MRI study has been conducted.</p><p>2) An additional major concern is with the phenotypic features of the MRI data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. As Barkovich and others have pointed out, Dandy-Walker Variant is not acceptable terminology (see more recent references Barkovivh 2009; Aldinger 2009). Dandy-Walker malformation is a combination of cerebellar hypoplasia and posterior fossa enlargement. These MRI scans show cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. There is not clear evidence of an enlarged posterior fossa.</p><p>3) In the cases shown, the enlarged fourth ventricle is simply filling a normal-sized or perhaps even small posterior fossa. It is an illusion that the cisterna is enlarged. The cerebellum is small, so the space looks large. Other features are noted, but are not visible in the panels presented – in particular the large foramen of Magendi and indented dorsal pons, abnormal foliation in 2 cases. These issues in establishing the connections of cerebellar defects to CHARGE and the interpretation need to be properly dealt with in the text.</p><p>4) An important aspect of the work relates to the conclusion that <italic>Chd7</italic> directs binds regulatory regions of the <italic>Otx2</italic> locus. However there are concerns about the technical aspects of this data. The ChIP-PCR study of <italic>Otx2</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is weak and heavily influenced by a genome-wide ChIP-seq study of murine ES cells described by Schnetz et al. The authors (1) did not provide primer sequences for the regions of <italic>Otx2</italic> analysed (which were chosen from the Schnetz work) and more importantly (2) did not provide any negative control data, for example comparing with other regions of the <italic>Otx2</italic> gene sequence. Although there are some suggestive correlations with other epigenetic marks, there are too few analyses to contextualise the signal they obtained and therefore to interpret it, as they do, as “suggesting a role for CHD7 in directly regulating <italic>Otx2</italic> gene expression through interacting with these elements”. This part of the work would ideally need to be strengthened by conducting a complete PCR-based survey of the <italic>Otx2</italic> gene. Even then, since CHD7 may not bind DNA directly, the conclusions are indirect without a lot more information on co-binding factors. Since this is likely to be beyond the scope of this work, the authors should revise the text to interpret the direct action of <italic>Chd7</italic> on <italic>Otx2</italic> more circumspectly, taking into consideration these potential caveats.</p><p>5) Did they consider undertaking a similar study of <italic>Gbx2</italic>?</p><p>6) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref> do not clearly show differences in <italic>Gbx2</italic> and <italic>Otx2</italic> expression. While it is clear at the later stages the data at E7.5 are not very compelling and add little to the story. They should either be removed, or to clarify the embryonic data at E7.5 the authors should repeat the <italic>Otx2/Gbx2</italic> analysis with embryos that are more closely stage-matched. In particular, the <italic>Otx2</italic>-stained normal embryo is clearly older than the <italic>Chd7</italic> mutant.</p><p>7) The posterior expansion of <italic>Otx2</italic> is an important observation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> shows a 6ss embryo doubly stained for both <italic>Otx2</italic> and <italic>Hoxa2</italic>. The expanded region of label is interpreted to be due to caudally expanded <italic>Otx2</italic> expression, but it could also be due to <italic>Hoxa2</italic> expression rostrally expanded from r2. This could be resolved with two color “in situs”. However, another solution is to stain solely for <italic>Otx2</italic> and place a photo of such a sample as an insert in 2D. Alternatively a more compelling way to illustrate the shifts and a potential transformation would be to employ <italic>Krox20</italic>. It is expressed in r3 and r5. This would indicate that the changes were restricted to r1 and not a truncation of the anterior hindbrain. This general issue needs to be addressed in one of the ways suggested above.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01305.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) This study formally adds cerebellar malformation to the features of CHARGE, demonstrating that isthmic disruption can cause human cerebellar malformations as has long been demonstrated in mice and other models.

Examples of large foramen of Magendi and fourth ventricle (50%, 10/20) and large subcerebellar cistern (25%, 4/20) are indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C and D</xref>.”</p><p><italic>4) An important aspect of the work relates to the conclusion that</italic> Chd7 <italic>directs binds regulatory regions of the</italic> Otx2 <italic>locus. However there are concerns about the technical aspects of this data. The ChIP-PCR study of</italic> Otx2 <italic>in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>is weak and heavily influenced by a genome-wide ChIP-seq study of murine ES cells described by Schnetz et al. The authors (1) did not provide primer sequences for the regions of</italic> Otx2 <italic>analysed (which were chosen from the Schnetz work) and more importantly (2) did not provide any negative control data, for example comparing with other regions of the</italic> Otx2 <italic>gene sequence. Although there are some suggestive correlations with other epigenetic marks, there are too few analyses to contextualise the signal they obtained and therefore to interpret it, as they do, as “suggesting a role for CHD7 in directly regulating</italic> Otx2 <italic>gene expression through interacting with these elements”. This part of the work would ideally need to be strengthened by conducting a complete PCR-based survey of the</italic> Otx2 <italic>gene. Even then, since CHD7 may not bind DNA directly, the conclusions are indirect without a lot more information on co-binding factors. Since this is likely to be beyond the scope of this work, the authors should revise the text to interpret the direct action of</italic> Chd7 <italic>on</italic> Otx2 <italic>more circumspectly, taking into consideration these potential caveats</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for these criticisms, which have allowed us to improve our analysis of CHD7 association with Otx2 regulatory elements significantly. First, we performed an unbiased screen of the Otx2 gene that led to the identification of several regions that show specific CHD7 association, as well as adjacent negative control regions that show no CHD7 binding. Secondly, instead of being led by the Schnetz ES cell data, we tested CHD7 binding around known regulatory regions identified by the Aizawa group to drive Otx2 expression in the embryonic fore- and midbrain after E9.5, referred to as the FM1 and FM2 enhancer regions, as well as an early epiblast/anterior neuroectoderm (AN) enhancer region. We could demonstrate strong, specific association of CHD7 with these regions. All primer sequences used have been included in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We have revised the text to clarify that the association of CHD7 with Otx2 and Gbx2 (see below) regulatory elements do not constitute incontrovertible proof that CHD7 directly regulates these genes. We also include the caveat that the mechanisms whereby CHD7 might be recruited to these regions and the actual role of CHD7 at these elements are not known and fall beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p><italic>5) Did they consider undertaking a similar study of</italic> Gbx2?</p><p>Given the success of our Otx2 ChIP experiments, we also screened the Gbx2 gene, with emphasis on the 10kb region upstream of the gene, as this region likely encompasses an enhancer region that can direct Gbx2 expression to r1, based on studies in zebrafish. We could demonstrate specific CHD7 association with regions upstream of Gbx2. In addition, some of the elements tested represented negative controls with no CHD7 binding. These data are included in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>6) The data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3A,B</italic></xref> <italic>do not clearly show differences in</italic> Gbx2 <italic>and</italic> Otx2 <italic>expression. While it is clear at the later stages the data at E7.5 are not very compelling and add little to the story. They should either be removed, or to clarify the embryonic data at E7.5 the authors should repeat the</italic> Otx2/Gbx2 <italic>analysis with embryos that are more closely stage-matched. In particular, the</italic> Otx2<italic>-stained normal embryo is clearly older than the</italic> Chd7 <italic>mutant</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that these data do not add much to the story, in particular since the Otx2 enhancers that drive expression at E7.5 are likely different from those that control expression in the mes/r1 region at the stages we deal with in the manuscript. We have therefore removed these data and included additional analyses of E8.25 embryos as requested.</p><p><italic>7) The posterior expansion of</italic> Otx2 <italic>is an important observation.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3D</italic></xref> <italic>shows a 6ss embryo doubly stained for both</italic> Otx2 <italic>and</italic> Hoxa2<italic>. The expanded region of label is interpreted to be due to caudally expanded</italic> Otx2 <italic>expression, but it could also be due to</italic> Hoxa2 <italic>expression rostrally expanded from r2. This could be resolved with two color “in situs”. However, another solution is to stain solely for</italic> Otx2 <italic>and place a photo of such a sample as an insert in 2D. Alternatively a more compelling way to illustrate the shifts and a potential transformation would be to employ</italic> Krox20<italic>. It is expressed in r3 and r5. This would indicate that the changes were restricted to r1 and not a truncation of the anterior hindbrain. This general issue needs to be addressed in one of the ways suggested above</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for these constructive criticisms. We addressed this point in two of the ways suggested. We include pictures of 4ss embryos hybridized with only Otx2 that clearly shows the upregulated, expansion of Otx2 expression. Additionally, we repeated the analysis using Krox20 as a marker for r3+r5 to clearly demonstrate the posterior expansion of Otx2 expression and lack of posterior hindbrain truncation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
