Can they, based on experienced mismatch with a known target, plan the necessary changes to recover the target in a practice-free manner without intermittently singing? In adult zebra finches, we drive the pitch of a song syllable away from its stable (baseline) variant acquired from a tutor, then we withdraw reinforcement and subsequently deprive them of singing experience by muting or deafening. In this deprived state, birds do not recover their baseline song. However, they revert their songs toward the target by about 1 standard deviation of their recent practice, provided the sensory feedback during the latter signaled a pitch mismatch with the target. Thus, targeted vocal plasticity does not require immediate sensory experience, showing that zebra finches are capable of goal-directed vocal planning.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>zebra finch</kwd><kwd>vocal learning</kwd><kwd>auditory feedback</kwd><kwd>birdsong</kwd><kwd>reinforcement learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_182638</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zai</surname><given-names>Anja T</given-names></name><name><surname>Stepien</surname><given-names>Anna E</given-names></name><name><surname>Hahnloser</surname><given-names>Richard HR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_156976/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zai</surname><given-names>Anja T</given-names></name><name><surname>Stepien</surname><given-names>Anna E</given-names></name><name><surname>Hahnloser</surname><given-names>Richard HR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>268911 VOTECOM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zai</surname><given-names>Anja T</given-names></name><name><surname>Stepien</surname><given-names>Anna E</given-names></name><name><surname>Hahnloser</surname><given-names>Richard HR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Zebra finches are capable of overt vocal planning, but to reach a distant vocal target beyond the range of recently produced pitch requires both practice and auditory feedback.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Speech planning is an important part of human communication and the inability to plan speech is manifest in disorders such as apraxia. But to what extent is targeted vocal planning an entirely human ability? Many animals are capable of volitional control of vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brecht et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Veit et al., 2021</xref>), but are they also capable of planning to selectively adapt their vocalizations toward a target, such as when striving to reduce the pitch mismatch of a note in a song? Target-specific vocal planning is a cognitive ability that requires extracting or recalling a sensory target and forming or selecting the required motor actions to reach the target. Such planning can be covert or overt. Evidence for covert planning is manifest when a targeted motor change is executed without intermittent practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costalunga et al., 2023</xref>), for example, when we instantly imitate a word upon first hearing. Overt planning, by contrast, includes practice, but without access to the sensory experience from which target mismatch could be computed, for example, when we practice a piano piece by tapping on a table.</p><p>The vocal planning abilities in animals and their dependence on sensory experience remain poorly explored. Motor learning has been mostly studied in tasks where a skilled behavioral response must be produced on the spot, such as when a visual target must be hit by a saccade or by an arm reaching movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brashers-Krug et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galea et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shmuelof et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krakauer et al., 2005</xref>). In this context, motor planning has been shown to enhance motor flexibility as it allows separation of motor memories when there are conflicting perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sheahan et al., 2016</xref>). However, for developmental behaviors such as speech or birdsong that rely on hearing a target early in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Konishi, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Immelmann, 1969</xref>), the roles of practice and of sensory feedback for flexible vocal control and for target-directed adaptation are unknown.</p><p>Recovery of a once-learned vocal skill could be instantaneous (covert) or it might require practice (overt). In support of the former, many motor memories are long-lasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2013</xref>), for example, we can recall the happy-birthday song for years without practice. Some memories are even hard to get rid of such as accents in a foreign language. By contrast, practice-dependent, but feedback-independent recovery is argued for by arm reaching movements during use-dependent forgetting: following adaptation to biasing visual feedback, arm movements recover when the bias is either removed or the visual error is artificially clamped to zero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galea et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shmuelof et al., 2012</xref>). One explanation put forward is that motor adaptation is volatile and has forgetting built-in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krakauer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smith et al., 2006</xref>), leading to practice-dependent reappearance of the original motor program even without informative feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). Given these possibilities, we set out to probe songbirds’ skills of recovering their developmental song target when deprived of either singing practice (to probe covert planning) or of sensory feedback (to probe overt planning).</p><p>Adult vocal performances in songbirds can be altered by applying external reinforcers such as WN stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tumer and Brainard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andalman and Fee, 2009</xref>). When the reinforcer is withdrawn, birds recover their original song within hundreds of song attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tumer and Brainard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canopoli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Warren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoffmann et al., 2016</xref>). We argued that these attempts may be unnecessary and birds could recover their original performance by recalling either (1) the original motor program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aronov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nottebohm et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Prather et al., 2009</xref>) or (2) its sensory representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yazaki-Sugiyama and Mooney, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kojima and Doupe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yanagihara and Yazaki-Sugiyama, 2016</xref>) plus the mapping required for translating that into the original program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canopoli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Warren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These options might not need sensory feedback, which is argued for by birds’ large perceptual song memory capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). That is, birds’ song practice may be mainly expression of deliberate playfulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Riters et al., 2019</xref>), conferring the skill of vocal flexibility rather than serving to reach a target, evidenced by young birds that explore vocal spaces close to orthogonal to the song-learning direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kollmorgen et al., 2020</xref>) and that are already surprisingly capable of adult-like singing when appropriately stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kojima and Doupe, 2011</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Recovery of pitch target requires practice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two hypotheses on birds’ ability to recover a song target away from their current vocal output (green circles, motor states on the left, sensory states on the right, shading represents probabilities): Either they could recall the motor target and reactivate it without practice or they could recall a sensory target plus the neural mapping (black arrows) required to transform it into a motor state.

We then unmuted birds and tested whether the song has covertly reverted back to the original target. We used syllable pitch as the targeted song feature because we found that birds did not reliably recover syllable duration in experiments in which we induced them to shorten or lengthen syllable duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We first drove pitch away from baseline by at least 1 standard deviation using a WN stimulus delivered whenever the pitch within a 16 ms time window locked to the targeted syllable was above or below a manually set threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, see ‘Materials and methods’). We muted these WNm (WN reinforced and muted) birds by implanting a bypass cannula into the abdominal air sac (see ‘Materials and methods’). While muted, air is leaking from the abdominal air sac and as a result, sub-syringeal air pressure does not build up to exceed the threshold level required for the self-sustained syringeal oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elemans et al., 2015</xref>) that underlie singing. Physical absence of such oscillations essentially strips muted birds from all pitch experience. In some cases, the bypass cannula got clogged during the muted period and birds were spontaneously unmuted, allowing them to produce a few songs before we reopened the cannula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–G</xref>).</p><p>We quantified recovery in terms of normalized residual pitch (NRP) to discount for differences in the amount of initial pitch shift where NRP = 0% corresponds to complete recovery and NRP = 100% corresponds pitch values before withdrawal of reinforcement (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) and thus no recovery. After spending 5.1 ± 1.6 days (range 3–8 days, N = 8) in the muted state and upon unmuting, WNm birds displayed an average NRP of 89%, which was far from baseline (p=6.2 · 10<sup>–8</sup>, tstat = -23.6, N = 8 birds, two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test of H0: NRP = 0%, songs analyzed in 2 hr time window – early (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>), see ‘Materials and methods’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), suggesting that in the muted state, birds are unable to recover their pre-reinforced songs. The average NRP in WNm birds was comparable to that of unmanipulated control (WNC) birds within the first 2 hr after withdrawal of the reinforcer (average NRP = 91%, p=3.7 · 10<sup>–11</sup>, tstat = 14.8, two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test for NRP = 0%, N = 18 WNC birds). Indeed, during 5 days without song practice, birds recovered no more pitch distance than birds normally do within the first 2 hr of release from reinforcement (p=0.82, tstat = -0.23, N = 8 WNm and N = 18 WNC birds, two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test). In WNm birds, there was no correlation between the NRP in the early window and the time since the muting surgery (correlation coefficient R=0.26, p=0.53), suggesting that the lack of pitch recovery while muted was not due to a lingering burden of the muting surgery. These findings did not sensitively depend on the size of the analysis window — we also tested windows of 4 and of 24 hr.</p><p>Subsequently, after 4 days of unmuted singing experience (roughly 9 days after withdrawal of WN), WNm birds displayed an average NRP of 30%, which was significantly different from the average NRP within the first 2 hr after unmuting (p=3 · 10<sup>–4</sup>, tstat = 4.83, N = 8 birds, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test early (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) vs. late (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) time window) but still significantly different from zero (p=0.04, tstat = 2.59, N = 8 birds, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, late (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) time window). The amount of recovery was neither correlated with the number of renditions sung between early and late windows (R=0.03, p=0.95), nor with the duration the birds were muted (R=–0.50, p=0.20), nor with the time since they last sung the target song before reinforcement (R=–0.43, p=0.29), suggesting the limiting factor for recovery was neither the amount of song practice nor the recovery time from the muting surgery (although for the latter there was a trend). Overall, these findings rule out covert planning in muted birds and suggest that motor practice is necessary for recovery of baseline song.</p><p>Next, we tested whether motor experience but not sensory experience is necessary for overt recovery, similar to arm reaching movements that can be restored without guiding feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galea et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Galea et al., 2015</xref>). In a second group of birds, we provided slightly more singing experience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Instead of muting, WNd birds were deafened through bilateral cochlea removal immediately after the end of WN reinforcement. This latter manipulation does not suppress the act of singing as does muting, but it eliminates auditory feedback from singing. Deaf birds could gain access to some pitch information via somatosensory stretch and vibration receptors and/or air pressure sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Suthers et al., 2002</xref>). Our aim was to test whether such putative pitch correlates are sufficient for recovery of baseline pitch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, in the deaf state, WNd birds did not recover baseline pitch even after 4 days of song practice: on the fifth day (late, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) after deafening, their average NRP was still 50%, which was different from zero (p=0.03, tstat = 2.73, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test of H0: NRP = 0%, N = 10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and significantly larger than the average NRP of WNC birds on the fifth day since withdrawal of reinforcement (difference in NRP = 49%, p=0.003, tstat = 3.34, df = 26, N = 10 WNd and N = 18 WNC birds, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Recovery of pitch target is impaired after deafening.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) WNd birds were first pitch-reinforced using white noise (WN) and then deafened by bilateral cochlea removal.

Thus, dLO birds were unable to recover baseline pitch, suggesting that song recovery requires undiminished sensory experience, which includes auditory feedback.</p><p>Deaf birds' decreased singing rate could not explain their lack of pitch recovery. Deaf birds sang less during the first 2 hr since release of reinforcement (early) than control birds: 87 ± 59 motif renditions for WNd and 410 ± 330 renditions for dLO compared to 616 ± 272 renditions for WNC birds. Also, WNd birds sang only 4,300 ± 2,300 motif renditions between the early and late period compared to the average of 11,000 ± 3,400 renditions that hearing WNC birds produced in the same time period. However, despite these differences, when we inspected WNd birds’ behavior 9 days after the early window, when they sung on average 12,000 ± 6,000 renditions, their NRP was still significantly different from zero (NRP = 0.37, p = 0.007, tstat = 3.47, df = 9). Thus, even after producing more practice songs than control birds, deaf birds did not recover baseline pitch and so the number of songs alone cannot explain why deaf birds do not fully recover pitch. We conclude that auditory experience seems to be necessary to recover song.</p><p>That song practice and sensory experience are required for full recovery of song does not imply that without experience, birds are incapable of making any targeted changes to their songs at all. We therefore inspected birds’ fine-grained vocal output and whether they changed their song in the direction of baseline when deprived of sensory experience. We hypothesized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) that when birds experience a target mismatch during reinforcement (i.e., they hear that their song deviates from the target), they plan to recover the pitch target, and a portion of this plan they can execute without feedback. If, by contrast, they have no mismatch experience before deafening, they will make no corresponding plan. Hence, we predicted that WNd birds that experienced a pitch mismatch during reinforcement and before deafening would slightly revert their song toward baseline even in the absence of auditory feedback. By contrast, dLO birds that did not experience a mismatch because they did not hear their song while it was reinforced would not revert toward the target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Target mismatch experience is necessary for revertive pitch changes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) WNd birds heard a target mismatch during reinforcement whereas dLO birds did not. dC birds were not pitch reinforced, their analysis windows (letters as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) matched those of manipulated birds in terms of time since deafening.

If the number of songs were to determine the rate of recovery, we would have seen the opposite effect (dLO birds should recover similar amounts as WNC birds and significantly more than WNd birds). In conclusion, singing rate does not explain the difference between WNd and dLO birds.</p><p>To discount for the effect of time elapsed since deafening and quantify the change in pitch specifically due to reinforcement, we bootstrapped the difference in <italic>d'</italic> between dLO/WNd birds and a new group of dC birds that were deafened but experienced no prior reinforcement (see ‘Materials and methods’). To discount for possible influences of circadian pitch trends, we assessed early and late pitch changes in reinforced birds and in dC birds in 2 hr time windows separated by multiples of 24 hr (and again flipped pitch changes in birds that were reinforced to decrease pitch, see ‘Materials and methods’). In agreement with the findings above, we found that significant reversion toward baseline was only seen in WNd birds and very consistently so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), showing that prior experience of a target mismatch is necessary for pitch reversion independent of auditory feedback.</p><p>We further validated our finding using a linear mixed effect model on the combined NRP data of all groups (see ‘Materials and methods’), which confirmed our previous findings: we did not find a significant effect of the time without practice between <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> windows on the NRP in the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> window (fixed effect –0.04, p = 0.2), confirming that birds do not recover without practice. Neither deafening nor muting had a significant effect by itself but the interaction between deafening and time (late) was associated with an NRP increase of 0.67 (fixed effect, p = 2 · 10<sup>–6</sup>), demonstrating that deaf birds are significantly further away from baseline (NRP = 0) than hearing birds in late windows, thereby confirming that birds require auditory feedback to recover a distant pitch target. Importantly, we found that mismatch experience was associated with a significant fixed effect of –0.37 on the NRP (fixed effect toward the target, p = 0.006), supporting our finding that limited vocal plasticity is possible even in the absence of auditory feedback.</p><p>Our results thus argue for a model of song maintenance in which birds extract from target mismatch experience a plan of reducing the mismatch. Without practice and auditory experience, birds cannot reach a distant motor target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). With practice and without auditory experience, they can make small changes toward a target, which we refer to as the planning range.

But to reach a distant vocal target beyond the pitch range they have recently produced necessitates auditory feedback, which sets a limit to zebra finches’ overt planning ability.</p><p>Our insights were gained in deaf birds, and we cannot rule out that deaf birds could gain access to pitch information via somatosensory-proprioceptive sensory modalities. However, such information, even if available, cannot explain the difference between the ‘mismatch experience’ (WNd) and the ‘no mismatch experience’ (dLO) groups, which strengthens our claim that the pitch reversion we observe is a planned change and not merely a rigid motor response (as in simple use-dependent forgetting; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galea et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shmuelof et al., 2012</xref>). Also, it is unlikely that dLO birds’ inability to recover baseline pitch is somehow due to our use of a reinforcer of a non-auditory (visual) modality since somatosensory stimuli do not prevent reliable target pitch recovery in hearing birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sober and Brainard, 2009</xref>). Thus, the overt planning ability is an active experience-dependent process.</p><p>In our two-stage model, recovery of a developmentally learned vocal target is controlled by two nested processes, a highly flexible process with limited scope (<italic>d'</italic><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf27"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>≃</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), and a dependent process enabled by experience of the former. Such motor learning based on separate processes for acquisition and retention is usually referred to as motor consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brashers-Krug et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fenn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karni and Sagi, 1993</xref>). Accordingly, the flexible process of acquisition or planning as we find is independent of immediate sensory experience, but the dependent process (consolidation of the flexible process) requires experience. Perhaps then, it is the sensory experience itself that is consolidated, and therefore, consolidation of sensory experience may be a prerequisite for extensive planning.</p><p>We cannot distinguish the overt planning we find from a more complex use-and-experience-dependent forgetting since we only probed for recovery of pitch and did not attempt to push birds into planning pitch shifts further away from baseline. Evidence for more flexible planning is provided by the pitch matching skills of nightingales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costalunga et al., 2023</xref>). Interestingly, although nightingales can reach without practice even distant pitch targets, the targets in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costalunga et al., 2023</xref> were also located within the extent of nightingale’s recent song practice, so also satisfied <italic>d'</italic> <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>≃</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> 1. Perhaps then, our two-stage model of song plasticity of planning and consolidation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> applies more broadly in songbirds and not just in zebra finches.</p><p>Consolidation in motor learning generally emerges from anatomically separated substrates for learning and retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galea et al., 2011</xref>). Such separation also applies to songbirds. Both reinforcement learning of pitch and recovery of the original pitch baseline depend on the anterior forebrain pathway and its output, the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Warren et al., 2011</xref>). LMAN generates a pitch bias that lets birds escape negative pitch reinforcers and recover baseline pitch when reinforcement is withdrawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andalman and Fee, 2009</xref>), thus is likely involved in planning. This pitch bias is consolidated outside of LMAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Warren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tian and Brainard, 2017</xref>) in a nonlinear process that is triggered when the bias exceeds a certain magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tachibana et al., 2022</xref>). This threshold magnitude is roughly identical to the planning limit we find (<italic>d'</italic> <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf29"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>≃</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> 1), suggesting that birds’ planning limit arises from the consolidation of LMAN-mediated motor plasticity. Although it remains to be seen whether LMAN is capable of executing motor plans without sensory feedback, our work provides a new perspective on the neural basis of birdsong learning and consolidation in and around LMAN.</p><p>The formation of a planned motor change may not require LMAN itself because pharmacological suppression of LMAN sets the bias to zero, but upon removal of output suppression, the pitch of the song syllable that was targeted by reinforcement jumps by about 1% away from the reinforced pitch zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charlesworth et al., 2012</xref>), which corresponds to about <italic>d'</italic> = 1, about the planning limit we find. Originally, this jump was interpreted as evidence of functional connectivity or an efference copy between the anterior forebrain pathway of which LMAN is part of and some other unspecified variability-generating motor area. However, in our view, a simpler explanation requiring neither functional connectivity nor efference copy is that LMAN is involved in putting a plan into action, which in that case is to produce syllable variants that are unaffected by WN.</p><p>Zebra finches’ ability to plan directed song changes could hinge on song memories that feed into LMAN and that could drive neurons there to produce diverse perceptual song variants. LMAN neurons are selective for the bird’s own song but not the target song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yazaki-Sugiyama and Mooney, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kojima and Doupe, 2007</xref>), which makes them well suited for executing song plans within the range of recent experience (i.e., if the song is outside recent experience, it elicits no LMAN response and so does not gain access to planning circuits). Furthermore, LMAN neurons show mirrored activity, that is, similar activity when a zebra finch produces a vocal gesture and when it hears the same gesture played through a loudspeaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanuschkin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oztop et al., 2013</xref>). This mirrored activity has been argued to be involved in translating an auditory target into the corresponding motor command, also known as an inverse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giret et al., 2014</xref>). Mirroring in LMAN was observed across the song variability generated over a period of several hours, which is about the same as the experience-dependent pitch planning limit we find. Zebra finches could thus transform a desired pitch change into the corresponding motor plan via LMAN’s aligned sensory and motor representations of recent vocal output.</p><p>In a broader context of motor recovery, birds’ failure to recover baseline pitch without guiding sensory feedback agrees with reports that binary reinforcement (as we used) slows down or prevents forgetting of the adapted behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shmuelof et al., 2012</xref>). However, whereas forgetting is fast when sensory errors affect arm movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shmuelof et al., 2012</xref>), the contrary applies to birdsong, where pitch learning from artificial sensory errors is slower and less forgotten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sober and Brainard, 2009</xref>) than is pitch learning from binary reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tumer and Brainard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canopoli et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, the commonality of short-term visuo-motor adaptation and of birdsong maintenance is that slow learning leads to slow forgetting, regardless of whether it is due to sensory errors or reinforcement. Such conclusion also agrees with observations that zebra finch song does not recover to pre-manipulated forms, both after restoring auditory feedback after long-term (&gt;5 months) deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zevin et al., 2004</xref>) and after restoring normal syrinx function after long-term (16 weeks) manipulation with beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hough and Volman, 2002</xref>), suggesting that song can spontaneously recover only within some limited time since it was manipulated.</p><p>Our observations in zebra finches could be relevant to other species including humans. The planning abilities we find bear resemblance to human motor imagery for movement learning, which is most effective when subjects already show some competence for the movements to be learned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mulder et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting a recall-dependent process. Naively, human vocal flexibility seems superior to that of zebra finches since we can flexibly change sound features such as loudness, pitch, and duration to convey emotional state or to comply with the tonal and rhythmical requirements of a musical piece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dichter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belyk and Brown, 2016</xref>), whereas zebra finches produce more subtle modulations of their songs, for example, when directing them to a female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stepanek and Doupe, 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, a limit of human vocal flexibility is revealed by non-native accents in foreign languages, which are nearly impossible to get rid of in adulthood. Thus, a seeming analogous task to feedback-dependent learning of zebra finch song, in humans, is to modify developmentally learned speech patterns.</p><p>Our findings help elucidate the meaning of song signals in songbirds and the evolutionary pressures of singing. Because zebra finches seem incapable of large jumps in performance without practice, their current song variants are indicative of the recent song history, implying that song is an honest signal that zebra finches cannot adapt at will to deceive a receiver of this signal. Hence, if high pitch has either an attractive or repelling effect on another bird, a singer must commit to being attractive or repulsive for some time. In extension, we speculate that limited vocal flexibility increases the level of commitment to a group and thereby strengthens social cohesion.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experimental procedures were in accordance with the Veterinary Office of the Canton of Zurich (licenses 123/2010 and 207/2013) or by the French Ministry of Research and the ethical committee Paris-Sud and Centre (CEEA no. 59, project 2017-12).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>We used in total 76 birds.

In all birds, we recorded baseline vocal activity for at least 3 days before doing any manipulation (deafening or pitch reinforcement).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Pitch reinforcement</title><p>We calculated pitch (fundamental frequency) as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canopoli et al., 2014</xref>. To provide pitch reinforcement in real time, we used a two-layer neural network trained to detect a manually clustered syllable containing a harmonic stack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamahachi et al., 2020</xref>). We evaluated the fundamental frequency of that syllable in a 16–24 ms time window following detection. For pitch reinforcement, we either broadcast a 50–60-ms-long WN stimulus through a loudspeaker or briefly switched off the light in the isolation chamber for 100–500 ms (LO) when pitch was below or above a manually set threshold. The WN/LO stimulus onset occurred 7 ms after the pitch calculation offset. We performed cumulative pitch shifts across several days by adjusting the pitch threshold for WN/LO delivery each day, usually setting it close to the median value of the previous day. Sometimes the threshold was set more than once during a day, in this case we set it close to the median of the pitch values measured so far during that day. All birds were shifted by at least 1 standard deviation (<italic>d'</italic> &gt; 1, see ‘Pitch analysis’).</p><p>Reported pitch values were collected as above, except in muted birds that directly after unmuting produced syllables of lower amplitude and with distorted spectral features (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, E and F</xref>), which resulted in frequent mis-detections by the neural network. In muted birds, we therefore performed semi-automatic (manually corrected) syllable detection and computed pitch at a fixed time lag after syllable onset. Despite deafening leading to degradation of birds’ song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lombardino and Nottebohm, 2000</xref>), syllable detection and pitch calculation were still possible in all deaf birds (birds were recorded during 13–50 days after deafening surgery, age range 90–300 dph, N = 44 birds). Since pitch shifting was balanced in all deaf bird groups (the same number of birds were up- and down-shifted), systematic changes in pitch post deafening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lombardino and Nottebohm, 2000</xref>) will average out and so would not affect our findings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Duration reinforcement</title><p>Duration reinforcement was performed similarly as pitch reinforcement, but instead of measuring the pitch of a targeted syllable, we measured the duration of a targeted song element (either a syllable, a syllable plus the subsequent gap, or just a gap).

However, one bird shifted the pitch down, in an apparent appetitive response to WN, this bird responded appetitively also when the WN contingency was changed, resulting in a net upward shift at the end of the WN period (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamahachi et al., 2020</xref>). In two birds, we targeted high-pitch variants and these birds shifted the pitch down, as expected. Thus, in total, in 6/8 birds (including the bird with the apparent appetitive response), we drove the pitch up, and in 2/8 birds, we drove the pitch down.</p><p>Two birds underwent the muting surgery directly after withdrawal of WN stimuli. We observed that the two birds had recovered a mere 10% and –6% of their total WN-driven pitch change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). We hypothesized that unreinforced singing would initiate the song recovery process in WNm birds that we assumed birds might be able to accomplish while mute. Therefore, we allowed the subsequent 6/8 WNm birds (four up-shifted and two down-shifted) to sing a few hundreds of target syllables without reinforcement prior to muting them. During on average 4 hr 51 min (range 10 min to 14 hr), these latter birds produced on average 649 song motifs (56, 100, 400, 458, 480, and 2400 motifs) without WN; the example bird shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> produced 56 song motifs within 11 min during the 30 min it was allowed to sing without aversive reinforcement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>WN deaf (WNd)</title><p>Ten birds were first pitch reinforced (5/10 were up-shifted and 5/10 down-shifted) with WN, and then they were deafened immediately after by bilateral cochlea removal.

These birds were first deafened by bilateral cochlea removal, then they underwent pitch reinforcement with light-off (LO) stimuli that acts as an appetitive stimulus in deaf birds. The lamp in the recording chamber was switched off for 100–500 ms when the pitch was either above or below a manually set threshold (daily threshold adjustment followed the same procedure as for WNm birds). 3/8 birds received LO for low-pitched syllables and 5/8 birds for high-pitched syllables. One of the birds that received LO for high-pitched syllables changed its pitch away from LO instead of toward it, thus we ended up with a balanced data set with 4/8 birds shifting pitch up and 4/8 birds shifting down. dLO birds were recorded for at least 5 days after the deafening surgery.

We exposed the right abdominal air sac by shifting aside the fat tissue and punctured it to create an opening. Immediately, we closed the opening by inserting the cannula and sealing the contact region with tissue glue. With the free end of the glued thread, we made one suture to the lowest rib. We closed the wound in the skin around the cannula with tissue glue and sutures using a new thread. Finally, we applied betadine solution on the wound and lidocaine gel around the injured site.

If song was detected, the cannula was inspected for clogging and cleaned. Five birds unmuted spontaneously; they produced at most 300 songs before the bypass cannula was inspected and the clog was removed to re-mute the bird. To unclog the bypass cannulas, we used sharp forceps and sterile tissue dipped in saline.

However, we found that unlike for pitch, after withdrawal of reinforcement, these WNdur birds did not reliably recover their baseline syllable duration: after 4 days of song practice without reinforcement, their average normalized residual syllable duration (NRD) – the remaining fraction of duration difference to baseline since release – was significantly different from zero (NRD = 42%, p=0.007, two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test for NRD = 0, N = 12 birds, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that adult birds do not maintain syllable duration as rigidly as they do maintain pitch.</p><p>Indeed, in contrast, pitch-reinforced (WNC) birds fully recovered baseline pitch 4 days after withdrawal of reinforcement (average NRP = 1%, p=0.91 two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test for NRP = 0, N = 18 birds, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>, same data as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>).

By contrast, they found that duration (of mostly syllables + gaps) reverted toward baseline at only about a quarter of the rate measured during reinforcement (0.8 ms/day vs. 3.4 ms/day) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that recovery of duration proceeds at a much slower pace than birds are capable of. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roberts et al., 2017</xref> found pitch recovered faster than it changed during reinforcement, whereas syllable + gap durations recovered slower than they changed during reinforcement five birds each. Both studies used only a few birds and did not directly compare the recovery of duration versus pitch. Also, the published reports preclude a comparison in terms of the unit-free <italic>d'</italic> measure post hoc because the baseline pitch and the duration variability are not reported in these studies.</p><p>Interestingly, in the context of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, duration reverts similarly to pitch.

Thus, it remains unclear whether the difference in NRP and NRD recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) could be confounded by the disparity in experimental parameters (i.e., difference in total shifts). Nevertheless, all studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roberts et al., 2017</xref>) and our analysis concur that the recovery of baseline pitch is more efficient than the recovery of duration, suggesting that duration is less accurately maintained than pitch. We therefore decided to perform all experiments using pitch as the targeted song feature and not syllable duration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Bootstrapping</title><p>To test whether deaf birds indeed make small pitch changes toward a target if and only if they experienced target-mismatch during reinforcement, we bootstrapped the difference in pitch changes between reinforced (WNd and dLO) and deaf control birds (dC). All dC birds were recorded for at least 5 days after they started singing while deaf.</p><p>In dC birds, we defined the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf66"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf67"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf68"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> windows such that they matched those of WNd and dLO birds in terms of days since deafening. Additionally, in dLO birds we chose the windows such that they matched in terms of time of day (because LO always ended overnight). Thus, the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf69"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> windows in dC birds either corresponded to the last 2 hr before deafening (as control for WNd birds) or to the last 2 hr of the day before <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf70"><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (as control for dLO birds).</p><p>For WNd birds, we obtained in total 26 control syllables from 20 dC birds. For dLO birds, we obtain 17 control syllables from 13 dC birds (some dC birds did not provide any useable data because they stopped singing or were not recorded for long enough).</p><p>For the bootstrapping procedure, we randomly paired control syllables (N = 26 for WNd and N = 17 for dLO) one-by-one with matchable syllables from reinforced birds (with replacement), computed the mean pitches <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf71"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf72"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf73"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> in corresponding windows, calculated the standard deviation <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf74"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> , calculated the average pitch changes <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf75"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>′</mml:mo></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf76"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>′</mml:mo></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> for both manipulated and control birds, and multiplied these by –1 if the reinforced bird was down-shifted (as we did for <italic>d'</italic> above). We then took the differences in average pitch changes between manipulated (WNd and dLO) and dC birds, for example, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf77"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>`</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>`</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. We repeated this procedure 10,000 times and plotted the distribution of average pitch change differences between WNd and dC (red) and between dLO and dC (blue) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and perform bootstrap statistics.</p><p>Our results were qualitatively unchanged (only WNd significantly reverted pitch toward baseline) when we aligned the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf78"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> windows by the time of day of the corresponding <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf79"><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> windows (two dC birds started singing later on the day of the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf80"><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> window than they stopped singing on the days before; in these two birds, we used the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf81"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> windows instead; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Although the <italic>d'</italic> values in both groups increased (and in dLO birds, the average <italic>d'</italic> in the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf82"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> windows was positive, p&lt;0.05, two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test), we found a significant pitch difference between WNd or dLO birds in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf83"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> windows, which upholds our findings that mismatch experience is necessary for pitch reversion. The reason for the increases in <italic>d'</italic> likely is that birds further shifted their pitch away from baseline on the last day of reinforcement (after the time-aligned <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf84"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> window). Also, results were robust when we analyzed pitch changes after release from reinforcement in units of NRP: without practice, WNd birds made small and significant pitch changes toward baseline, and dLO birds stayed at NRP ≥ 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Linear mixed effect model</title><p>We simulated a linear mixed effect model on the combined NRP data from all groups with fixed effects corresponding to time (general offset <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf85"><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, late <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf86"><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>), treatment (deafened <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf87"><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, muted <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf88"><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>), mismatch-experience <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf89"><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, and a fixed effect <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf90"><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> that is linear in the time between the time <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf91"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> of the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf92"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> window and the time <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf93"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> of the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf94"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> window.

Past work showed that after the pitch of targeted song syllables are driven outside of birds' preferred target range with external reinforcement, birds revert to baseline (i.e. restore their song to their target). Here the authors tested the extent to which this restoration occurs in muted or deafened birds. If these birds can restore, this would suggest an internal model that allows for sensory-to-motor mapping.

They point out that while some animals are known to be capable of volitional control of vocalizations, it has been unclear if animals are capable of planning vocalizations-that is, modifying vocalizations towards a desired target without the need to learn this modification by practising and comparing sensory feedback of practised behavior to the behavioral target. They study zebra finches that have been trained to shift the pitch of song syllables away from their baseline values. It is known that once this training ends, zebra finches have a drive to modify pitch so that it is restored back to its baseline value. They take advantage of this drive to ask whether birds can implement this targeted pitch modification in a manner that looks like planning, by comparing the time course and magnitude of pitch modification in separate groups of birds who have undergone different manipulations of sensory and motor capabilities. A key finding is that birds who are deafened immediately before the onset of this pitch restoration paradigm, but after they have been shifted away from baseline, are able to shift pitch partially back towards their baseline target. In other words, this targeted pitch shift occurs even when birds don't have access to auditory feedback, which argues that this shift is not due to reinforcement-learning-guided practice, but is instead planned based on the difference between an internal representation of the target (baseline pitch) and current behavior (pitch the bird was singing immediately before deafening).</p><p>The authors present additional behavioral studies arguing that this pitch shift requires auditory experience of song in its state after it has been shifted away from baseline (birds deafened early on, before the initial pitch shift away from baseline, do not exhibit any shift back towards baseline), and that a full shift back to baseline requires auditory feedback. The authors synthesize these results to argue that different mechanisms operate for small shifts (planning, which does not need auditory feedback) and large shifts (through a mechanism that requires auditory feedback).</p><p>The authors also make a distinction between two kinds of planning: covert-not requiring any motor practice and overt-requiring motor practice but without access to auditory experience from which target mismatch could be computed. They argue that birds plan overtly, based on these deafening experiments as well as an analogous experiment involving temporary muting, which suggests that indeed motor practice is required for pitch shifts.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The primary finding (that partially restorative pitch shift occurs even after deafening) rests on strong behavioral evidence. It is less clear to what extent this shift requires practice, since their analysis of pitch after deafening takes the average over within the first two hours of singing. If this shift is already evident in the first few renditions then this would be evidence for covert planning. Technical hurdles, such as limited sample sizes and unstable song after surgical deafening, make this difficult to test. (Similarly, the authors could test whether the first few renditions after recovery from muting already exhibit a shift back towards baseline.)</p><p>This work will be a valuable addition to others studying birdsong learning and its neural mechanisms. It documents features of birdsong plasticity that are unexpected in standard models of birdsong learning based on reinforcement and are consistent with an additional, perhaps more cognitive, mechanism involving planning. As the authors point out, perhaps this framework offers a reinterpretation of the neural mechanisms underlying a prior finding of covert pitch learning in songbirds (Charlesworth et al., 2012).</p><p>A strength of this work is the variety and detail in its behavioral studies, combined with sensory and motor manipulations, which on their own form a rich set of observations that are useful behavioral constraints on future studies.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The argument that pitch modification in deafened birds requires some experience hearing their song in its shifted state prior to deafening (Fig. 4) is solid but has an important caveat. Their argument rests on comparing two experimental conditions: one with and one without auditory experience of shifted pitch. However, these conditions also differ in the pitch training paradigm: the &quot;with experience&quot; condition was performed using white noise training, while the &quot;without experience&quot; condition used &quot;lights off&quot; training (Fig. 4A). It is possible that the differences in ability for these two groups to restore pitch to baseline reflects the training paradigm, not whether subjects had auditory experience of the pitch shift. Ideally, a control study would use one of the training paradigms for both conditions, which would be &quot;lights off&quot; or electrical stimulation (McGregor et al. 2022), since WN training cannot be performed in deafened birds. In the Discussion, in response to this point, the authors point out that birds are known to recover their pitch shift if those shifts are driven using electrical stimulation as reinforcement (McGregor et al. 2022); however, it is arguably still relevant to know whether a similar recovery occurs for the &quot;lights off&quot; paradigm used here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90445.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zai</surname><given-names>Anja T</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Zurich/ETH Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Stepien</surname><given-names>Anna E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Zurich/ETH Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Giret</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut des Neurosciences Paris Saclay</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris Saclay</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hahnloser</surname><given-names>Richard HR</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Zurich/ETH Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In this revision the authors address some of the key concerns, including clarification of the balanced nature of the RL driven pitch changes and conducting analyses to control for the possible effects of singing quantity on their results. The paper is much improved but still has some sources of confusion, especially around Fig. 4, that should be fixed. The authors also start the paper with a statistically underpowered minor claim that seems unnecessary in the context of the major finding. I recommend the authors may want to restructure their results section to focus on the major points backed by sufficient n and stats.</p><p>Major issues.</p><p>(1) The results section begins very weak - a negative result based on n=2 birds and then a technical mistake of tube clogging re-spun as an opportunity to peak at intermittent song in the otherwise muted birds. The logic may be sound but these issues detract from the main experiment, result, analysis, and interpretation. I recommend re-writing this section to home in on, from the outset, the well-powered results. How much is really gained from the n=2 birds that were muted before ANY experience? These negative results may not provide enough data to make a claim. Nor is this claim necessary to motivate what was done in the next 6 birds. I recommend dropping the claim?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the recommendation. We moved the information to the Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Fig. 4 is very important yet remains very confusing, as detailed below.</p><p>Fig. 4a. Can the authors clarify if the cohort of WNd birds that give rise to the positive result in Fig 4 ever experienced the mismatch in the absence of ongoing DAF reinforcement pre-deafening? Fig4a does nor the next clearly specifies this. This is important because we know that there are day timescale delays in LMAN-dependent bias away from DAF and consolidation into the HVC-RA pathway (Andalman and Fee, 2009). Thus, if birds experienced mismatch pre-deafening in the absence of DAF, then an earnly learning phase in Area X could be set in place. Then deafening occurs, but these weight changes in X could result in LMAN bias that expresses only days later -independent of auditory feedback. Such a process would not require an internal model as the authors are arguing for here. It would simply arise from delays in implementing reinforcement-driven feedback. If the birds in Fig 4 always had DAF on before deafening, then this is not an issue. But if the birds had hours of singing with DAF off before deafening, and therefore had the opportunity to associate DA error signals with the targeted time in the song e.g. pauses on the far-from-target renditions (Duffy et al, 2022), then the return-to-baseline would be expected to be set in place independent of auditory feedback. Please clarify exactly if the pitch-contingent DAF was on or off in the WNd cohort in the hours before deafening. In Fig. 3b it looks like the answer is yes but I cannot find this clearly stated in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not provide DAF-free singing experience to the birds in Fig. 4 before deafening. Thus, according to the reviewer, the concern does not apply.</p><p>Note that we disagree with the reviewer’s premise that there is ‘day timescale delay in LMAN-dependent bias away from DAF and consolidation into the HVC-RA pathway’. More recent data reveals immediate consolidation of the anterior forebrain bias without a night-time effect (Kollmorgen, Hahnloser, Mante 2020; Tachibana, Lee, Kai, Kojima 2022). Thus, the single bird in (Andalman and Fee 2009) seems to be somewhat of an outlier.</p><p>Hearing birds can experience the mismatch regardless of whether they experience DAF-free singing (provided their song was sufficiently shifted): even the renditions followed by white noise can be assessed with regards to their pitch mismatch, so that DAF imposes no limitation on mismatch assessment.</p><p>We disagree with their claim that no internal model would be needed in case consolidation was delayed in Area X. If indeed, Area X stores the needed change and it takes time to implement this change in LMAN, then we would interpret the change in Area X as the plan that birds would be able to implement without auditory feedback. Because pitch can either revert (after DAF stops) or shift further away (when DAF is still present), there is no rigid delay that is involved in recovering the target, but a flexible decision making of implementing the plan, which in our view amounts to using a model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 4b.

And if this means planning, then it is not clear why this would be analogous to &quot;humans modifying developmentally learned speech patterns&quot;.
