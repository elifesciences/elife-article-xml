A portion of ALS cases are caused by mutation of the proteasome shuttle factor <italic>Ubiquilin 2</italic> (<italic>UBQLN2</italic>), but the molecular pathway leading from UBQLN2 dysfunction to disease remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that UBQLN2 regulates the domesticated gag-pol retrotransposon ‘paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10)’ in human cells and tissues. In cells, the PEG10 gag-pol protein cleaves itself in a mechanism reminiscent of retrotransposon self-processing to generate a liberated ‘nucleocapsid’ fragment, which uniquely localizes to the nucleus and changes the expression of genes involved in axon remodeling. In spinal cord tissue from ALS patients, PEG10 gag-pol is elevated compared to healthy controls. These findings implicate the retrotransposon-like activity of PEG10 as a contributing mechanism in ALS through the regulation of gene expression, and restraint of PEG10 as a primary function of UBQLN2.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ALS</kwd><kwd>ubiquilin</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>UBQLN2</kwd><kwd>domesticated retrotransposon</kwd><kwd>PEG10</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM142607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>Julia E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32CA174648</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holling</surname><given-names>G Aaron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Biological Sciences Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ung</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Exploring how UBQLN2 mutations cause ALS leads to the discovery of a pathway by which an ancient retroelement changes gene expression in human cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that typically presents in mid-life and is characterized by a progressive loss of motor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Al-Chalabi, 2017</xref>). In many cases, loss of motor function is accompanied by frontotemporal dementia (FTD), characterized by cognitive impairment, behavioral changes, and loss of executive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couratier et al., 2017</xref>). Of all ALS cases, 90% are sporadic (sALS), while the remaining 10% are familial (fALS) and can be traced to mutations in a variety of genes, including the proteasome shuttle factor <italic>UBQLN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gorrie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williams et al., 2012</xref>). Animal models of fALS have led to discoveries that are broadly applicable to both fALS and sALS, including the involvement of oxidative stress, RNA binding proteins, and protein aggregation in ALS-mediated neuronal dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferraiuolo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peters et al., 2015</xref>); however, the specific molecular pathways that lead to disease remain poorly understood.</p><p>In a previous global proteomic study, animal models of <italic>UBQLN2</italic>-mediated fALS revealed a dramatic accumulation of the domesticated retrotransposon PEG10 in diseased tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Whiteley et al., 2021</xref>). Domesticated retrotransposons are a class of genes that encode virus-like proteins which have lost the ability to replicate and have evolved adaptive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Volff, 2006</xref>). <italic>PEG10</italic>, which is necessary for placental development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ono et al., 2006</xref>), is one of a family of domesticated retrotransposon genes derived from the Sushi-ichi lineage of Ty3/Gypsy LTR retrotransposons and codes for both <italic>gag</italic> and <italic>pol</italic> domains separated by a programmed ribosome frameshifting site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandt et al., 2005</xref>). Use of the ribosomal frameshift occurs with high efficiency, resulting in two forms of PEG10 proteins: gag, and gag-pol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lux et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manktelow et al., 2005</xref>). The overwhelming share of research on PEG10 has focused on its contributions to placental development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abed et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ono et al., 2006</xref>) and cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akamatsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2019</xref>); however, PEG10 has also recently been implicated in the neurological disease Angelman’s syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pandya et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we describe a novel potential role for PEG10 in the neurodegenerative disease ALS due to its ability to accumulate in the absence of functional UBQLN2, leading to changes in the expression of neuronal genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>UBQLN2 exclusively regulates degradation of the frameshifted gag-pol PEG10</title><p><italic>UBQLN2</italic> is one of five human Ubiquilin (<italic>UBQLN</italic>) genes that facilitate proteasomal degradation of ‘client’ proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hjerpe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Itakura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Brown, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suzuki and Kawahara, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Whiteley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>) via an N-terminal protein domain which binds to the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Finley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saeki, 2017</xref>), and a C-terminal domain which binds to ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). All five <italic>UBQLNs</italic> have similar protein domain architecture and amino acid sequences, and are widely assumed to have shared client populations.

TKO cells had more than twice the amount of PEG10 gag-pol protein in cell lysate as compared to WT cells, while gag protein levels were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). In contrast, TKO cells expressing an inducible WT <italic>UBQLN2</italic> construct were able to restrain PEG10 gag-pol to the level seen in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>).

The gag region contains a retroviral capsid domain and CCHC-type zinc finger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The pol region of PEG10 is less well understood but contains an aspartic protease domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2007</xref>) and a 27 AA C-terminal PPR region containing twelve prolines in tandem, and 18 in total (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To identify a region of PEG10 necessary for UBQLN-dependent degradation, either PEG10 gag-pol, or a construct lacking the C-terminal PPR, was expressed in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). While gag-pol protein was more abundant in TKO cells compared to WT cells, PEG10 lacking the PPR failed to accumulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–I</xref>).

From this, we conclude that the PPR contributes to PEG10’s ability to evade traditional proteasomal degradation pathways: when present, it renders the cell dependent on UBQLNs to facilitate degradation. When absent, the protein is capable of being degraded by pathways shared with WT cells, including traditional proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To complement the flow-based abundance assay, cycloheximide chase experiments were also performed with the ΔPPR construct.

Transfection with an HA-tagged form of PEG10 showed that in addition to the expected gag and gag-pol bands, there were two HA-positive lower molecular weight bands, which we hypothesized were products of self-cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). When the active site aspartate of the PEG10 protease was mutated to alanine to disrupt proteolytic activity (gag-pol<sup>ASG</sup>), we observed a total disappearance of the lower molecular weight HA-tagged bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that the protein products were dependent on PEG10 protease activity. Detailed biochemical analysis and bioinformatic prediction were then performed to identify the precise sites of PEG10 self-cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). Together, the results suggested that PEG10 cleaves itself in two locations: AA114-115, and AA260-261. The N-terminal cleavage halves the capsid region, and the C-terminal cleavage generates a zinc-finger containing fragments reminiscent of retrotransposon and retroviral nucleocapsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

PEG10 was overexpressed in cells and VLPs were harvested from the cultured supernatant by ultracentrifugation. Abundance of VLPs was then probed by western blot. Self-cleavage was not a prerequisite for PEG10 VLP release, as gag and gag-pol<sup>ASG</sup> were capable of releasing VLPs with similar efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>).</p><p>To observe the liberated NC protein directly, we generated a polyclonal antibody directed against the predicted NC cleavage product, encompassing AA259-325 of PEG10 gag. Western blot of HA-tagged gag-pol, gag-pol<sup>ASG</sup>, gag, and NC using this antibody clearly showed the presence of gag-pol and gag, as well as a number of protease-dependent bands of high molecular weight that were not previously visible in the HA blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Because the NC has been cleaved from CA and CA<sup>NTD</sup> fragments, neither of these were visible by western blot; however, a new fragment derived from gag that is independent of protease activity was visible between 20–25 kDa for all constructs examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). HA-tagged NC was weakly visible between 10–15 kDa despite identical transfection conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Upon overexposure, a band at 10 kDa, corresponding to the approximate molecular weight of an isolated NC fragment, became visible only upon transfection with cleavage-competent gag-pol protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).

Further, because the relative ratio of gag:gag-pol abundance has been estimated at ~60–80% gag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lux et al., 2010</xref>), the majority of PEG10 signal is generated from gag protein. Because of the observed role of gag-pol in generating NC, we sought to specifically quantify the presence of gag-pol in human tissue. Unfixed post-mortem samples of the lumbosacral spinal cord were obtained for global proteomic analysis using a tandem mass tagging (TMT) approach for liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS).

As a result, the quantification of peptides favors those that are more highly abundant. PEG10 is expressed at very low levels in spinal cord lysate, and in our experience is often below the technical limit of detection by LC-MS. Therefore, we adapted a technique used for single-cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Budnik et al., 2018</xref>) or small-cell population experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yi et al., 2019</xref>) by adding a carrier, or ‘spike-in’ channel that triggers quantitation of PEG10 specifically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The carrier channel, containing 95% spinal cord lysate and 5% cell lysate from HEK cells transfected with PEG10, drives the detection of PEG10 peptides by increasing the number of PEG10 peptide ions in MS1.

Seven peptides were identified from the gag region of PEG10, and three peptides were identified from the pol region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). While gag was not changed in <italic>UBQLN2</italic>-mediated or sporadic ALS samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), peptides originating from PEG10 pol were significantly enriched in ALS compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). This was specific to the protein level, as <italic>PEG10</italic> transcript counts were not elevated in ALS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). When PEG10 gag and pol were considered as unique proteins (two peptides per protein minimum, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig8sdata1">Figure 8—source data 1</xref>), PEG10 pol was among the most upregulated proteins in all ALS cases compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>).

Taken together, the accumulation of PEG10 gag-pol in ALS tissue, paired with our findings of PEG10 self-cleavage and effects on gene expression, suggest that this pathway may represent a novel pathological contribution to the development of ALS with promise for novel drug development strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we have explored in detail the regulatory mechanisms and cellular consequences of PEG10 gag-pol self-processing and observed the accumulation of PEG10 gag-pol in both sporadic and <italic>UBQLN2</italic>-mediated ALS. PEG10 gag-pol exhibited protease-dependent self-cleavage and generated a nuclear-localized fragment that is reported to bind nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abed et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Segel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steplewski et al., 1998</xref>). This fragment was sufficient to change transcript abundance in the cell, including the expression of genes involved in axon remodeling, linking PEG10 dysregulation to neuronal dysfunction. Finally, we observed a specific accumulation of PEG10 gag-pol in the spinal cord tissue of ALS patients, suggesting that PEG10 activity may contribute to disease in humans.</p><p>Data outlined here suggest a specific relationship between UBQLN2 and the domesticated retrotransposon, PEG10. Notably, only UBQLN2 is capable of restraining PEG10 abundance, meaning that Ubiquilins do not universally share client populations. The unique ability of UBQLN2 to mediate PEG10 degradation is likely dependent on the PXX domain of UBQLN2, which is not found in other <italic>UBQLN</italic> genes, and is a mutational hotspot in <italic>UBQLN2</italic>-mediated fALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2011</xref>). Rescue of UBQLN TKO cells with either <italic>UBQLN2<sup>P506T</sup></italic> or <italic>UBQLN2<sup>P497H</sup></italic> resulted in changes to gag-pol abundance, which is consistent with our hypothesis. Interestingly, we observed that <italic>UBQLN2<sup>P497H</sup></italic> expression was sufficient to control endogenous PEG10 levels whereas <italic>UBQLN2<sup>P506T</sup></italic> was not. However, both alleles are deficient compared to WT <italic>UBQLN2</italic> when cells overexpress tagged PEG10. Together, these data indicate that there are allele-specific differences in the ability of UBQLN2 to facilitate PEG10 degradation. Different UBQLN2 alleles have been shown to display unique properties of phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dao et al., 2019</xref>), autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2020</xref>), and protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang and Monteiro, 2015</xref>), which may explain their unique behavior with regard to PEG10. Regardless, in the human spinal cord of an ALS patient bearing the <italic>UBQLN2<sup>P497H</sup></italic> allele, PEG10 pol protein was elevated compared to controls.</p><p>It is also notable that only the gag-pol form of PEG10 is a client of UBQLN2, due in part to the presence of the unique PPR of the pol domain. <italic>UBQLN2</italic> and the PPR of PEG10 exist only in eutherian mammals, suggesting an evolutionary relationship. In comparison, the rest of the <italic>UBQLN</italic> gene family is more conserved among eukaryotes: <italic>UBQLN3</italic>, <italic>5</italic>, and <italic>L</italic> are shared among earlier mammalian ancestors, <italic>UBQLN1</italic> first appears in fish species, and <italic>UBQLN4</italic> is thought to reflect adaptation of the ancestral <italic>Dsk2</italic> gene in single-celled eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marín, 2014</xref>). These points, paired with the finding that PEG10 was by far the most dysregulated protein in global proteomic studies of <italic>UBQLN2</italic> loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Whiteley et al., 2021</xref>), raise the intriguing possibility that contrary to its presumed role as a regulator of generalized protein degradation, <italic>UBQLN2</italic> may have evolutionarily arisen specifically to restrain PEG10 abundance. Further, the unique relationship between <italic>PEG10</italic> and <italic>UBQLN2</italic> highlights a potential genetic conflict between the requirement for PEG10 expression in placental development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ono et al., 2006</xref>) with pathological roles in neural tissue which would have necessitated the evolutionary development of a tissue-specific inhibitor of gag-pol activities. In addition to our findings in ALS, PEG10 abundance is also linked to the neurodevelopmental disorder Angelman’s syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pandya et al., 2021</xref>). This observed dysregulation of PEG10 in affected tissues of neurological disease, as well as the unique enrichment of UBQLN2 in neuromuscular tissues, further supports our hypothesis.</p><p>Proteasomal degradation is a major contributor to the UBQLN2-mediated PEG10 phenotype. Previously, <italic>UBQLN2</italic> loss in neuronal cultures was shown to delay PEG10 gag-pol degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Whiteley et al., 2021</xref>). However, it remains unknown whether ubiquitination of PEG10 is necessary for UBQLN2-mediated degradation via the proteasome. Canonically, Ubiquilins have been thought to work with one or more E3 ubiquitin ligases to facilitate ubiquitination and degradation of client proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Itakura et al., 2016</xref>); however, the specific E3(s) that Ubiquilins work with remain unidentified. In this case, E3 ligases known to facilitate the suppression of retroelements would be prime candidates to examine. In fact, overexpression of the yeast E3 ligase SCF complex subunit Hrt1 (also known as Rbx1) potently inhibits Ty3 retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Seol et al., 1999</xref>), though it is unknown whether inhibition is dependent on degradation of Ty3 protein.</p><p>Our work also adds insight into the biology of PEG10. Previous work has suggested that PEG10 self-processes in a manner reminiscent of the self-processing of retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Golda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lux et al., 2005</xref>). Our study confirms and adds to these findings by determining precise locations of self-cleavage, the fate of cleaved products, and the effects of these cleaved products on cellular health. PEG10 behaves similarly to its ancestor, the Ty3 retrotransposon, in its ability to generate a short ‘NC’ protein fragment consisting of the isolated zinc finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirchner and Sandmeyer, 1993</xref>), which uniquely moves to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beliakova-Bethell et al., 2009</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that expression of just the PEG10 NC cleavage product resulted in unique transcriptional changes to the cell. Neuronal genes were some of the most altered transcripts upon gag-pol and nucleocapsid transfection, implicating a link between protease-dependent PEG10 self-cleavage, nucleocapsid liberation, and neuronal dysfunction. However, further work is needed to identify the molecular mechanism by which nucleocapsid mediates transcriptional changes. The PEG10 zinc finger has been reported to bind cellular mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abed et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Segel et al., 2021</xref>), as well as DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steplewski et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, nucleocapsids may influence gene expression by acting as a classical transcription factor, or as a regulator of transcript abundance, stability, or availability. While we did not observe bulk changes to trafficking or splicing, PEG10 may regulate mRNA stability, trafficking, or splicing in a gene-dependent manner. These possibilities remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Strikingly, among the more than 7000 proteins quantified by our analysis, PEG10 pol was the fifth most significantly upregulated protein in spinal cord tissue of ALS patients, suggesting a strong connection to disease and the potential utility of PEG10 as a novel biomarker for ALS progression. Even in the absence of overt <italic>UBQLN2</italic> mutation, PEG10 gag-pol protein is accumulated in post-mortem tissue of sALS patients compared to non-neurological controls. We hypothesize that this disease-wide accumulation is related to the inclusion of UBQLN2 in sALS-associated protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williams et al., 2012</xref>), which would lead to a loss of function phenotype despite normal <italic>UBQLN2</italic> expression. This further suggests that PEG10 gag-pol accumulation may be considered alongside TDP43, FUS, and UBQLN2 mislocalization and aggregation as shared hallmarks of familial and sporadic ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blokhuis et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Elevated PEG10 has been observed in Angelman’s syndrome, where its overexpression has been shown to influence neuronal trafficking in the embryonic brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pandya et al., 2021</xref>). In line with these findings, our work supports a putative role for PEG10 gag-pol accumulation as a mechanism of ALS disease progression. The ability of elevated PEG10 to influence gene expression in cell culture models suggests that its accumulation in human tissues may induce similar disruption to transcriptional programming. Indeed, elevated PEG10 protein abundance, as well as transcriptional changes to the genes <italic>TXNIP</italic> and <italic>DCLK1</italic>, were observed in both PEG10-expressing cell lines and in ALS tissue compared to controls.</p><p>Additional studies are required to determine the precise contribution of PEG10 to the transcriptional changes observed in ALS tissues and to in vivo neurodegeneration. Ultimately, further understanding of PEG10 biology in the context of ALS, as well as other conditions where PEG10 is elevated, may provide novel avenues for therapeutic development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rosetta</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma</td><td align="char" char="endash" valign="bottom">70954–3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">DH5α</td><td align="left" valign="top">Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="top">18265017</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293 WT and <italic>UBQLN1, 2, 4</italic> TKO cells, inducible <italic>UBQLN2</italic> expression</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Itakura et al., 2016</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Human ESCs (H9) WT and <italic>UBQLN1, 2</italic>, or <italic>4</italic> sinbgle KO cells</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Harvard Medical School Cell Biology Initiative for Genome Editing and Neurodegeneration</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-UBQLN1/2 (Mouse Monoclonal M03)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abnova</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">H00029978;

PEG10 Nucleocapsid (NC) was cloned into pET-SUMO2, and the resulting recombinant plasmid was transformed in Rosetta cells. A single colony was used to inoculate Luria broth (LB) with carbenicillin (100 µg/mL, Gold Biotechnology) and chloramphenicol (20 µg/mL, Gold Biotechnology) and grown overnight with shaking at 37 °C. Following this initial growth, 5–10 mL of the culture was used to inoculate 750 mL of LB supplemented with the same antibiotics and incubated at 37 °C with shaking until an OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.6–0.8 was achieved. Expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 M IPTG and cultures were left shaking overnight at 16 °C. Cells were harvested by pelleting at 4500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C.</p><p>The resulting pellet was resuspended in 30 mL of Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole, 0.1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, (pH 7.4) and one protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Sigma Aldrich)).</p><p>The resuspended cells were lysed by sonication for 15 min with an amplitude of 80, in 30 s on/off intervals. The lysed cells were then centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 hr. The supernatant was then processed by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using nickel-NTA resin (Gold Biotechnology) in a gravity column, equilibrated with Lysis Buffer. Cleared lysate was added to the column and flowthrough was collected. The resin was then washed four times with 20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole (pH 7.4), and flowthrough from each wash was collected. Protein was then eluted with ~30 mL of Elution Buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole (pH 7.4)). The presence of SUMO-NC in each fraction was determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (ThermoFisher). Fractions containing SUMO-NC were placed in dialysis tubing (Pierce) and dialyzed in Dialysis Buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM DTT). Dialyzed sample was analyzed by Bradford assay (ThermoFisher) to determine relative protein amounts, and ULP1 protease (1.25 mg/mL) was added at 1:100 ratio and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The dialyzed sample was brought to 1 M NaCl and 20 mM imidazole, and processed by a subsequent round of IMAC. Nickel-NTA resin was equilibrated in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 1 M NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole (pH 7.4). The sample was then added to the column and washed three times with 20 mM sodium phosphate, 1 M NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole. Dialysis was then performed again, overnight at 4 °C, using 3000 MWCO dialysis tubing (Pierce).</p><p>The dialyzed sample was subjected to another round of IMAC, with nickel-NTA resin equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate and 100 mM NaCl (pH 7.4). Bound protein was then washed with 20 mM sodium phosphate and 100 mM NaCl (pH 7.4). NC was found to bind nickel-resin due to the contained zinc-finger, and was eluted from the column using Elution Buffer, and all fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. Purified protein was then dialyzed in Dialysis Buffer without DTT, using 3000 MWCO dialysis tubing, and concentrated to 1 mg/mL using a 3000 MWCO concentrator (Millipore). Concentrated protein was snap frozen and stored at –80 °C before shipment to ThermoFisher for antibody production.</p><p>Antibody generation via ThermoFisher involved conjugation to KLH immunogen and subsequent immunization of rabbits. Rabbits were immunized and boosted three times with protein. Rabbits were bled at 72 days and antibody reactivity was confirmed by ELISA.

Acquisition intensity was fixed across samples. The fluorescence images were analyzed using home-built code in the MATLAB (R2021b) language. Due to the large file sizes of the raw data, the images were loaded in quadrants, and each quadrant was reduced in size by calculating the average intensity of 2 × 2 pixel blocks. The reduced images were then reconstituted and saved as uncompressed TIFF files. These reduced files were used in the rest of the analysis. We validated that this approach did not lead to major differences in the final data by comparing the mean intensity measured using a full-sized image and the mean intensity of our reduced version. For each image, a binary mask to identify regions of interest was generated using thresholding the DAPI-stained nuclear image. Manual corrections were made as necessary to remove erroneously identified regions, e.g., pieces of detached tissue. The average fluorescence intensities of MAP2 and PEG10 signals within the masked region were then calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Sample preparation for RNA sequencing</title><p>HEK293 cells were grown in 12-well plates, transfected for overexpression of genes of interest, and collected for RNA isolation 48 hr later.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewer, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jeannie Chin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Suzanne Sandmeyer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. It is critical that data directly linking Ubqln2 regulation of PEG10 to ALS pathogenesis be provided. Previous work showed that the Ubqln2-/- mouse model of ALS develops motor deficits. Thus, one means to substantially increase the current work would be if the authors were to show in the Ubqln2-/- mouse that forms of Ubqln2 that alter PEG10- pol levels in cells (Figure 5) improve motor performance in Ubqln2-/- mice. Another approach might be to delete the PPR from PEG10 in a murine model and see if expression in WT mice causes ALS behavior.</p><p>2. Figure 1 presents evidence that ubqln2 regulates PEG10 accumulation. The authors use human embryonic stem cells to investigate how knockout (KO) of different ubqln isoforms (1, 2, and 4) affects PEG10 accumulation, showing that only KO of ubqln2 increases the RF1/2 product. However, there is considerable variation in PEG10 expression in the duplicate sample sets provided that is not reflected by the error bars (Figure 1 A and B). For example, RF1/2 is quite different in the two ubqln4 KO lysates, yet the error bars do not capture the variation. Better loading and quantification are needed. Also, in the KO cells, gag levels are slightly increased, which is consistent with alterations in proteasomal degradation. Alternatively, changes in RF1/2 may result from changes in read-through translation, this should be investigated. It would be helpful to include blots showing the lower Mol weight PEG10 products, to see how they change relative to Figure 3.</p><p>3. In Figure 1G, the authors examined if removal of the poly proline-rich region (PPR) from PEG10 affects RF1/2 regulation by ubqln, confirming its requirement. Yet, the mechanism why deletion of the PPR abolished RF1/2 regulation by ubqlns was not examined. Is it from accelerated degradation? Also, it is not clear why the authors use the triple ubqln KO cells and did not perform tests in the different ubqln KO cells. The latter comment applies to several of their investigations, leading to uncertainty regarding the specificity of ubqln2 in PEG10 regulation. It is possible that removal of most ubqlns stalls protein degradation affecting PEG10 turnover?</p><p>4. To examine the phylogenetic relationship between PEG10 and ubqln2 demonstrating PEG10 levels from marsupials that lack a PPR can be increased by appending a PPR from human PEG10. They used triple ubqln KO cells for these investigations. The change described is not obvious in Figure 2C and E as they appear quite small. They also conclude that ubqln2 regulates PEG10 by these studies, but really the experiments show it is from loss of all ubqlns, not ubqln2 specifically. Thus, the data presented do not support their conclusion in a very convincing manner.</p><p>5. The authors show PEG10 is capable of self-cleavage of the RF1 product, generating 2 detectable N-terminal products, and other fragments, including a C-terminal nuclear capsid (NC) fragment (Figure 3). They show expression of HA-tagged NC fragment localizes to mainly the nucleus, whereas several other PEG10 products and fragments localize to the cytoplasm. They provide strong support that PEG10 is capable of self-cleavage by mutation of an aspartate residue (D) in a DSG motif in the protein to alanine (A to → ASG), which abolished cleavage. They also conducted a nice experiment showing the ASG mutant can be cleaved in trans by the introduction of WT PEG10. Unfortunately, the authors never show evidence for liberation and accumulation of the NC fragment, only for an artificially tagged protein by immunofluorescence. The use of a tag to study its localization and effects is problematic as it could influence its properties. They need to show that the fragment is detectable because of their central claim that it is responsible for inducing changes in genes. Biochemical fractionation studies could also reveal the extent of the partitioning of the fragment in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The mechanism by which the NC fragment induces changes in gene expression is not clear.</p><p>6. The authors show differences in gene expression upon transfection of HEK293 cells with PEG10 RF1, RF1/2, and NC expression constructs. They show that two PEG10-regulated genes, DCLK1 and TXNIP, are both increased in the spinal cord in sporadic ALS cases compared to controls. It is not clear from these studies whether the changes found in ALS are related to changes in PEG10 specifically, or for other reasons. Additionally, more rigorous comparison in many more ALS and controls is needed. PEG10 levels increase upon cell differentiation (Abed et al.) so the changes in ALS may reflect a compensatory and protective response</p><p>7. To investigate if PEG10 RF1/1 levels are altered by ALS mutations in ubqln2 they transfected ubqln TKO cells with either wt ubqln2, or with mutants carrying either the P497H or P506T ALS mutations and found that PEG10 RF1/2 levels are reduced by overexpression of both the wt and P497H mutant, but not by the P506T mutant. They claim that P497H expression did not affect RF1/2 levels. The authors conducted a proteomic comparison of extracts from the spinal cord of two controls, one P497H ubqln2 case, and six sporadic ALS cases, founding increased levels of RF1/2 in the ALS cases. They also found neurofilament medium and neurogranin were both reduced in the ALS cases. Based on these changes they speculate that PEG10 is a novel marker for ALS. The conclusion that the P497S mutant did not affect RF1/2 is incorrect. It reduced RF1/2 slightly more than WT ubqln2. It appears that expression of all three (WT and the 2 ALS mutants) ubqln2 proteins reduces RF1/2 significantly, compared to the TKO cells. In addition, changes in PEG10 found in the ALS cases are difficult to evaluate since very few controls and ALS cases were used for the comparison. Huge variations in the levels of PEG10 and of the other proteins graphed In Fug 6B-F were seen in the two controls. The comparison needs to be done with many more samples for sound statistical comparison. Were the samples compared from the same region of the spinal cord?</p><p>8. The authors need to comment on two important points; (1) The cleavage activity of PEG10 has been shown previously – how does this work add to this finding; (2) How do the authors interpret that only one form of fALS affected PEG10?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It is critical that data directly linking Ubiquilin 2 regulation of PEG10 to ALS pathogenesis be provided. Previous work showed that the Ubiquilin 2-/- mouse model of ALS develops motor deficits. Thus, one means to substantially increase the current work would be if the authors were to show in the Ubiquilin 2-/- mouse that forms of Ubiquilin 2 that alter PEG10- pol levels in cells (Figure 5) improve motor performance in Ubiquilin 2-/- mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Additional Experiments</p><p>1. Pulse-chase analysis should be conducted to see if any of the changes stem from alterations in protein stability, with and without proteasome inhibitors. It would be nice if the authors examined KD of the different ubqlns in neuronal cells to better relate their findings to ALS. The epitope recognized by the PEG10 antibody could be easily mapped using the deletion constructs in Figure 3.</p><p>2. Studies in the absence of only ubqln2, and following the rescue of its expression need to be examined. Effects on changes in protein stability also need to be provided.</p><p>3. The mechanism by which the NC fragment induces changes in genes needs clarification.</p><p>4. Examination of PEG10 in other human diseases may clarify whether the changes they have observed are specific to ALS.</p><p>5. Immunostaining could help clarify and identify the cell types involved in PEG10 induction.</p><p>General Comments</p><p>1. Many ubqln2 mutations in the PXX domain are known and these need to be examined to reach any conclusion about the domain. Additionally, the PEG10 changes could also be examined in ALS mouse models of ubqln2 and other gene models of ALS.</p><p>Overall, more rigorous studies are needed to support the claims made by the authors. As it stands, the current manuscript provides a minor advance in our understanding of PEG10 by ubqlns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Because authors demonstrate that PEG10 PPR is required for UBQLN2 activity targeting PEG10, this manuscript would be strengthened if they further implicated UBQLN2 in ALS behavior by showing that PEG10 lacks PPR in mouse model is associated with elevated PEG10 and ALS-like behavioral phenotype.</p><p>Of possible interest, the ubiquitin ligase subunit Cdc53 / Hrt1 is a high copy suppressor of Ty3 retrotransposition (Seol et al., 1999). There are some additional similarities to Ty3 that may be of interest to authors. Ty3 Gag3 does not detectably localize to nucleus but similar to PEG10 in this work, Ty3 NC localizes to the nucleus (changes in gene expression not investigated).</p><p>Figure 1, Please define the promoter and copy number from which PEG10 is expressed so that it is clear whether these constructs approximate native levels of expression in neuronal tissue. Is there a basis for the choice of HEK (kidney) cell lines for these experiments?</p><p>Figure 1. A-C Why is there only one lane of the key protein UBQLN2-/-? If the gel is representative only, then why do B and C have two bar plots for UBQLN1 and 4 rather than one (as does UBQLN2-/-)?</p><p>Would make more sense to have the structure diagram of Gag-Pol first rather than fourth place in the figure.</p><p>Figure 1 Sup 1 adjust label upward to coincide with migration of protein species UBQLN2,1.</p><p>Sup 2 B, PPP &gt; PPR.</p><p>Figure 2C, why is the rat/murine PEG10 gag-pol migrating more slowly than other gag-pol species?</p><p>P6 l6-8 and Figure 2D,E &quot;PEG10 did not depend on UBQLN expression for its regulation. However, when the human PEG10 PPR was appended to the C-terminus of Koala PEG10, its overall abundance decreased and it became more dependent on UBQLNs for restriction (Figure 2D-E).&quot; This difference which supports the argument that PPR mediates turnover in the Koala example is not very convincing (and is not marked with an asterisk). P6 l8 doesn't really reflect the figure which shows very little difference between koala plus and minus PPR in the presence of UBQLN2</p><p>Figure 3C uses modeling for Ty3 Gag from 2007 to propose structure of PEG10 Gag, however, the Ty3 structure was revised based on the ARC protein crystal structure and Ty3 VLP cryoEM in 2019 (Dodonova et al). Authors should revise or remove the suggested structure.</p><p>P3, l21 Description of pools of gag and gag-pol may incorrectly create the impression they are separately sequestered and should probably be rephrased.</p><p>P6 suggests that authors are exploring PEG10 self-processing for the first time, but this was already demonstrated in Clark et al. (2007) which was cited, but not for the aspartyl protease result. Were experiments regarding cleavage carried out in cells known not to express PEG10? Because the PR can cleave in trans, the native element untagged element could be exhibiting background cleavage of the transfected element.</p><p>P7 l20, The statement &quot;unlike traditional retrotransposons, self-cleavage was not a prerequisite for PEG10 VLP formation as gag and gag-Pol asg…&quot; is incorrect. Gag and Gag-Pol (Ty3 and retroviruses) are thought to assemble in order to facilitate PR dimerization and PR activation. Furthermore, multiple AFM and cryoEM studies show the assembly of immature PR- retrovirus and Ty3 mutants. However, maturation reorganization, RT, and IN activities (lacking in PEG10) all do require PR activation.</p><p>P11 l3, It would help the reader if authors were more clear about the fALS mutations. For example &quot;Consistent with a loss of function phenotype, mutant UBQLN2P506T-expressing cells failed to restrict PEG10 gag-pol levels (Figure 5A-B), whereas UBQLN2P497H had no effect on gag-pol. &quot; Does this mean that some fALS alleles are associated with increased gag-pol but others are not? Wouldn't this undermine the authors' thesis that fALS UBQLN2 alleles act through loss of PEG10 level control? P11, l11 states that UBQLN2P497 mediated ALS. Other work from Whitely showed that p497 actually has a different phenotype and reduces PEG10? Recheck this</p><p>P10 l9 Authors compare changes in gene expression between sALS and the changes in fALS and conclude that there are similar disruptions of gene expression, but do we know that this sALS isolate does not have spontaneous mutations in UBQLN?</p><p>Figure 4 should indicate cell type in legend (HEK); Hierarchical heat map looks like duplicates did not cluster? Au comment?</p><p>Figure 5 should be a key figure to illustrate increased levels of PEG10 protein in the presence of fALS UBQLN2 but instead, it appears that the dif from wt is minimal despite being starred and that gag-pol is significantly increased in the TKO over the fALS mutant. Are there differences in severity of these UBQLN2 mutant phenotypes that should be described (see above also)? The implication that not all fALS mutations in UBQLN act through PEG10 is counter to the general argument of the authors reflected in the title.</p><p>Figure 6 EF, Why is the control a non-neurological sample rather than a non ALS lumbar sample?

Figure 1 presents evidence that ubqln2 regulates PEG10 accumulation. The authors use human embryonic stem cells to investigate how knockout (KO) of different ubqln isoforms (1, 2, and 4) affects PEG10 accumulation, showing that only KO of ubqln2 increases the RF1/2 product.

The best way to determine the rate of readthrough translation in these cells would be to transfect a tagged form of PEG10 into each ES cell line and assess the ratio of gag-pol:gag in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor to eliminate the contribution of gag-pol protein accumulation to the ratio. Because of the difficulty in transfecting ES cells, we instead compared our HEK cell lines (WT versus TKO) for gag-pol:gag ratio and found that even the knockout of UBQLN1, 2, and 4 does not appear to influence the rate of readthrough translation (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).

We thank the reviewers for the insightful question about how the dPPR’s protein degradation changes compared to full-length gag-pol. The question was asked: Is its degradation accelerated compared to full-length gag-pol protein? In the steady state protein abundance assay, we see that removal of the PPR results in a very small increase in protein abundance in WT cells, and a decrease of protein abundance in TKO cells. This is shown in a new panel of Figure 2H. From this, we conclude that the PPR renders the cell dependent on UBQLNs to regulate the protein’s abundance. However, without the PPR, PEG10 can be degraded by typical proteasomal degradation pathways. A putative model of this difference is shown in Figure 2 Supplement 1B.</p><p>We also performed a cycloheximide-based assay on dPPR in WT and TKO cells. This showed that there was still a modest increase in the half-life of PEG10 protein in TKO cells by 8 hours, though there was considerable variability in the behavior of this construct in TKO cells. This is shown in a new panel of Figure 2 Supplement 1C.</p><p>Discussion of these new pieces of data is included in the Results section on Page 8-9, lines 14-6.</p><p>B. Our rationale for using triple Ubiquilin KO cells is that they naturally express high levels of PEG10 and that the stably integrated, doxycycline-inducible UBQLN2 alleles can be titrated to approximately endogenous levels with restriction of dox in medium. Therefore, these cells serve as an excellent model from which to determine the sufficiency of UBQLN2 to regulate PEG10 degradation. From there, we continued using this model cell line because of the ease of use and establishment as a model system for our purposes.</p><p>We have reorganized some of our data to make this rationale more evident. In Figure 1A-C, we start by studying single knockout ES cell lines, which reveal the unique necessity of UBQLN2 to restriction of PEG10 gag-pol. Then, in Figure 1E-G, we show that in HEK cells lacking UBQLN expression, rescue of UBQLN2 is sufficient to reduce PEG10 to WT levels. There, we also introduce information about UBQLN2 mutants and establish the idea that UBQLN2 loss or mutation results in PEG10 gag-pol accumulation (Figure 1F). The Results section has been reorganized accordingly to reflect these changes in organization.</p><p>We hope that with these changes, our use of TKO cells as a simple, tractable model for UBQLN essentiality – and its useful service in this case as a proxy for UBQLN2 essentiality – is clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. To examine the phylogenetic relationship between PEG10 and ubqln2 demonstrating PEG10 levels from marsupials that lack a PPR can be increased by appending a PPR from human PEG10. They used triple ubqln KO cells for these investigations. The change described is not obvious in Figure 2C and E as they appear quite small. They also conclude that ubqln2 regulates PEG10 by these studies, but really the experiments show it is from loss of all ubqlns, not ubqln2 specifically. Thus, the data presented do not support their conclusion in a very convincing manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret that this data was presented in a manner that was not very convincing. We have changed the presentation of this data and have changed text to reflect the nuanced nature of our results.</p><p>Visually, we have changed the visualization of our data to break down our interpretation of the data into discrete steps. In Figure 3D-E, we show biological replicates of four independent experiments, rather than the amassed technical and biological replicates that we had originally shown, to highlight the Dendra/CFP signal for each species. We also split the visualization of these results between placental mammals and marsupials, which are now parts D and E, respectively. The use of biological replicates slightly changed the statistical analysis to where every placental mammal shows a significant elevation of protein abundance in TKO cells, whereas marsupials show no significant differences, even with the addition of the human PPR sequence at the C-terminus (Figure 3E). However, we find two aspects of this data notable. First, that addition of the PPR to Koala PEG10 resulted in a dramatic decrease in its abundance, meaning that the PPR introduces a means of protein regulation independent of UBQLN2 in this situation. Second, that even though the Dendra2/CFP ratios are not significantly different between WT and TKO cells +PPR in Figure 3E, the ratio of TKO/WT values is consistently above 1 +PPR, whereas standard Koala PEG10 has a ratio just below 1. This difference is significant as measured by Student’s paired T test, which is now highlighted in Figure 3F.­­­</p><p>On Pages 9-10 lines 20-3, we have changed the emphasis of this data to instead reflect the complementary nature of the phylogenetic results to our data in Figure 2H-I showing that the PPR confers some UBQLN dependency to PEG10. We have emphasized that adding a PPR to Koala PEG10 decreases its abundance in WT cells, which is consistent with our data showing that removal of a PPR in human PEG10 increases its abundance in WT cells. We have also emphasized that the ratio of TKO/WT abundance is significantly different for Koala PEG10 lacking and including the human PPR region, consistent with a partial role for the PPR in contributing to UBQLN-dependent PEG10 degradation. Finally, we have removed the statement speculating on the evolutionary relationship between UBQLN2 and PEG10 given the subtle nature of our phylogenetic data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors show PEG10 is capable of self-cleavage of the RF1 product, generating 2 detectable N-terminal products, and other fragments, including a C-terminal nuclear capsid (NC) fragment (Figure 3). They show expression of HA-tagged NC fragment localizes to mainly the nucleus, whereas several other PEG10 products and fragments localize to the cytoplasm. They provide strong support that PEG10 is capable of self-cleavage by mutation of an aspartate residue (D) in a DSG motif in the protein to alanine (A to → ASG), which abolished cleavage. They also conducted a nice experiment showing the ASG mutant can be cleaved in trans by the introduction of WT PEG10. Unfortunately, the authors never show evidence for liberation and accumulation of the NC fragment, only for an artificially tagged protein by immunofluorescence. The use of a tag to study its localization and effects is problematic as it could influence its properties. They need to show that the fragment is detectable because of their central claim that it is responsible for inducing changes in genes. Biochemical fractionation studies could also reveal the extent of the partitioning of the fragment in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The mechanism by which the NC fragment induces changes in gene expression is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We have broken down this comment into multiple sections for ease of response.</p><list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>Evidence for liberation and accumulation of NC fragment from cleavage-competent PEG10</p></list-item><list-item><p>Exploration of the mechanism by which the NC fragment induces gene expression changes</p></list-item></list><p>A. We agree that tags can sometimes compromise the activity of a given protein, but we do not think this is the case for HA-NC because the identical HA tag was appended to all forms of PEG10 and did not universally induce nuclear localization for gag-pol or gag, indicating that something unique about the NC sequence drives its localization.</p><p>That being said, we completely agree on the value of detecting endogenously cleaved NC fragment in cells. We have visualized the generation of tag-less NC fragment from gag-pol, but not gag-pol<sup>ASG</sup>, using a custom-made NC antibody. The antibody was generated against gag AA260-325; therefore, it will recognize NC fragment as well as any PEG10 protein (gag, gag-pol) containing the NC region. We first visualized the cleaved NC fragment by western blot of whole cell lysate, which showed that a NC-staining, 10 kDa fragment is only present in cells expressing PEG10 gag-pol, and not gag-pol<sup>ASG</sup>, indicating that the presence of this fragment is dependent on an intact protease domain. We take this as evidence for self-cleavage of PEG10 gag-pol to generate an NC fragment. This data is shown as a new panel in Figure 4I.</p><p>To determine the contribution of the HA-tag to HA-NC localization, we removed the HA tag and performed the same immunofluorescence using our custom NC antibody. We saw an identical staining pattern, indicating that the HA tag is not influencing localization of this protein fragment. This data is included as a new panel of Figure 5B.</p><p>B. The mechanism by which the NC fragment induces gene expression changes remains unclear. We have performed some experiments that explored two favorable hypotheses: changes to mRNA splicing and changes to mRNA trafficking. However, we found no significant differences in either phenomenon upon PEG10 transfection. We consider further examination of this particular aspect of PEG10 function to be beyond the scope of the current study. We have added to the text on Page 14 lines 15-23 that briefly summarize our negative data. Further speculation of NC’s mechanism of action is discussed on Page 20 lines 14-18.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors show differences in gene expression upon transfection of HEK293 cells with PEG10 RF1, RF1/2, and NC expression constructs. They show that two PEG10-regulated genes, DCLK1 and TXNIP, are both increased in the spinal cord in sporadic ALS cases compared to controls. It is not clear from these studies whether the changes found in ALS are related to changes in PEG10 specifically, or for other reasons. Additionally, more rigorous comparison in many more ALS and controls is needed. PEG10 levels increase upon cell differentiation (Abed et al.) so the changes in ALS may reflect a compensatory and protective response</p></disp-quote><p>We have broken down this comment into multiple sections for ease of response.</p><list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>Clarification of source of changes to gene expression in sALS tissue samples</p></list-item><list-item><p>Improvement of ALS data with more ALS cases and controls.</p></list-item></list><p>A. We agree with the reviewers that it is impossible to determine from these patient samples whether the similar increases observed in <italic>DCLK1</italic> and <italic>TXNIP</italic> are a result of PEG10 specifically, or due to other reasons (such as a compensatory/protective response, as suggested). We included this data from patient samples to highlight the shared transcriptional changes between these two very different populations – transfected cells and patient tissues – but agree that we should fully acknowledge that the source of these transcriptional changes in patient tissues is unresolved. We have changed the text of our Results on Page 14 lines 8-11 to reflect that we are examining alteration of transcript abundance in sALS tissue, rather than whether these transcript changes contribute to disease. We have also emphasized the future work necessary to tease apart these changes in our text on Page 21 lines 7-17.</p><p>B. We appreciate the reviewer’s comment that many more ALS cases and controls were needed. We reached out to Target ALS to improve our RNA-Seq dataset and were able to increase the number of datapoints included. Our updated RNA-Seq tissue sample cohort is the most comprehensive dataset of RNA-Seq samples available in the US as of Fall 2022 and includes 17 ‘non-neurological controls’ (post-mortem samples where the cause of death was something other than a neurological disease), 127 ALS cases, and 2 known <italic>UBQLN2</italic>-mediated cases. We performed an identical RNA-Seq analysis on this updated cohort and received similar results for <italic>DCLK1</italic>, <italic>TXNIP</italic>, and <italic>PEG10</italic> transcript abundance, thereby increasing the significance of the difference between ALS and controls. This data has now replaced the original data in Figure 6G and Figure 7G. Our Methods section has also been updated on Page 37 lines 6-11 to reflect these updates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. To investigate if PEG10 RF1/1 levels are altered by ALS mutations in ubqln2 they transfected ubqln TKO cells with either wt ubqln2, or with mutants carrying either the P497H or P506T ALS mutations and found that PEG10 RF1/2 levels are reduced by overexpression of both the wt and P497H mutant, but not by the P506T mutant. They claim that P497H expression did not affect RF1/2 levels. The authors conducted a proteomic comparison of extracts from the spinal cord of two controls, one P497H ubqln2 case, and six sporadic ALS cases, founding increased levels of RF1/2 in the ALS cases. They also found neurofilament medium and neurogranin were both reduced in the ALS cases. Based on these changes they speculate that PEG10 is a novel marker for ALS. The conclusion that the P497S mutant did not affect RF1/2 is incorrect. It reduced RF1/2 slightly more than WT ubqln2. It appears that expression of all three (WT and the 2 ALS mutants) ubqln2 proteins reduces RF1/2 significantly, compared to the TKO cells. In addition, changes in PEG10 found in the ALS cases are difficult to evaluate since very few controls and ALS cases were used for the comparison. Huge variations in the levels of PEG10 and of the other proteins graphed In Fug 6B-F were seen in the two controls. The comparison needs to be done with many more samples for sound statistical comparison.

We regret the confusion regarding the effects of the P497H mutation on PEG10 levels. With regards to the statement that P497S decreases RF1/2 compared to WT cells, this was not significant by our metrics. According to multiple comparisons T test performed on data in Figure 1F, the difference in gag-pol abundance between WT UBQLN2 and P497H expression is insignificant. This has now been annotated in the Figure for clarity.</p><p>Based on data presented in Figure 1F, we agree with the statement that ‘it appears that expression of all three ubqln2 proteins reduces RF1/2 significantly compared to the TKO cells’. We would conclude that the UBQLN2 mutations present in disease confer a partial loss of function with regards to gag-pol degradation. We have included text reflecting this point on Page 6, lines 1-3.</p><p>B. We agree that as a rule, it is always ideal to include as many samples as possible in a proteomic dataset. This dataset consists of samples obtained from post-mortem lumbosacral spinal cord from either non-neurological controls (NNC, named as such because ‘healthy’ is an inappropriate word to describe post-mortem samples; however it was confirmed that these individuals did not have any diagnosed neurological condition) or ALS cases. After considerable work with nonprofit foundations, we were only able to secure two matched NNC samples’ unfixed lumbosacral spinal cords to go with our ALS samples. Overall, the legal process to obtain these samples took almost one year. Therefore, we are unable to add to this proteomic dataset in any reasonable amount of time.</p><p>However, we would like to emphasize the uniqueness of this dataset in the literature. Human spinal cord proteomic datasets are rare, and an n = 7 is quite substantial. Even rodent proteomics have used an n = 5 per group<sup>1</sup>, or n = 3 of pooled samples<sup>2</sup>. Of course, more samples would be ideal, but it is notable that we were able to amass the samples that we did.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Nelvagal et al., “Comparative Proteomic Profiling Reveals Mechanisms for Early Spinal Cord Vulnerability in CLN1 Disease.” <italic>Scientific Reports</italic> (2020).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Yang et al., “Proteomic Analysis of Spinal Cord Tissue in a Rat Model of Cancer-Induced Bone Pain.” <italic>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience</italic> (2022).</p></list-item></list><p>Fixed histological sections are easier to obtain, but do not provide the same opportunity for detailed examination of gag versus gag-pol protein quantitation, because no antibody exists that reliably detects the pol region of PEG10, and the cross-linking of proteins caused by fixation precludes us from performing proteomic analysis of these samples. When we initially performed immunofluorescence staining of PEG10 in fixed tissue sections (now in Figure 7A-C), we saw detectable PEG10 signal in both non-neurological control samples and ALS samples that was very similar when quantified. This data is included in Figure 7. But because this antibody detects both gag and gag-pol, we were unable to discern unique changes to gag-pol protein in disease. Western blots of spinal cord tissue are not clean enough to be able to see PEG10, so we instead performed the work-intensive global proteomics to pull out PEG10 gag-pol abundance.

The authors need to comment on two important points; (1) The cleavage activity of PEG10 has been shown previously – how does this work add to this finding; (2) How do the authors interpret that only one form of fALS affected PEG10?</p></disp-quote><p>(1) We appreciate the reviewers request for us to clarify how our work adds to previous findings of PEG10 cleavage activity. The main study that touches on PEG10 self-cleavage is Clark et al. 2007. It is also mentioned and likely observed by Lux et al. 2005 (though not directly tested with a protease-dead mutant), as well as Golda et al. 2020. These previous findings are highlighted in Page 10 lines 12-14 of our Results section and Pages 19-20, lines 22-1 of our Discussion. Our study improves on these findings in three ways. First, we used a tagged form of PEG10 to observe self-cleavage with much greater clarity than the previous manuscripts. Second, we were able to determine the likely locations of PEG10 self-cleavage events through a combination of biochemical methods. By determining the precise cleavage sites, we were uniquely able to explore the consequences of fragment generation on protein fate. Finally, our study is the first to examine the functional consequences of self-cleavage with the generation of NC and its effects on the cell. These points are mentioned on Page 20, lines 2-6 of our Discussion.</p><p>(2) Concerning the second point, we should clarify that while P497H did not mimic P506T in the accumulation of endogenous PEG10 compared to WT rescue in HEK cells, this may not reflect what happens in human disease. In fact, as pointed out by reviewers above, we observed elevated PEG10 pol levels in the spinal cord of P497H-associated fALS. Furthermore, we found that P497H, as well as P506T, were significantly less able to restrain overexpressed PEG10-Dendra2 levels in TKO HEK cells compared to WT counterparts, indicating that P497H does share some defective activity with P506T. Discussion of this new data, shown in Figure 2D-E, are mentioned in the Results section on Pages 7 lines 9-14. Discussion of the unique properties of each allele are on Page 18 lines 4-13 of the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
