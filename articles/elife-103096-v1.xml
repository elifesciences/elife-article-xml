Their large biomass and synchronized movements, like diel vertical migration (DVM), significantly impact ecosystem structure and the biological carbon pump. Despite decades of research, the mechanistic basis of DVM remains unclear. Circadian clocks help organisms anticipate daily environmental changes, optimizing adaptation. In this study, we used a recently developed activity monitor to record swimming activity of individual, wild-caught krill under various light conditions and across different seasons. Our data demonstrate how the krill circadian clock, in combination with light, drives a distinct bimodal pattern of swimming activity, which could facilitate ecologically important behavioral patterns, such as DVM. Rapid damping and flexible synchronization of krill activity indicate that the krill clock is adapted to a life at high latitudes and seasonal activity recordings suggest a clock-based mechanism for the timing of seasonal processes. Our findings advance our understanding of biological timing and high-latitude adaptation in this key species.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The Southern Ocean is home to whales, seals, seabirds and other iconic wildlife. All of these animals depend either directly, or indirectly, on a small marine prey species known as Antarctic krill, which thrives in the harsh conditions of the Southern Ocean. At night, large swarms of krill move towards the water surface to feed on plankton before returning to the depths during the day to avoid whales, fish and other predators. This synchronized movement influences the structure of the ecosystem in a number of ways by transporting carbon and influencing predator-prey interactions.</p><p>Researchers have observed the movements of krill swarms for many decades, but the processes controlling this swimming behavior remained unknown, in part, due to a lack of tools that can track the movements of individual krill. Do the krill simply respond to light and other external cues, or do they also have internal biological clocks that can maintain the observed rhythms even without such cues?</p><p>In 2024, researchers developed a new monitor known as AMAZE, which can record the swimming activity of individual krill in tanks of seawater. Hüppe et al. – including many of the researchers involved in the 2024 work – have now used this technique to trace the movement of individual wild-caught krill under different light conditions and seasons.</p><p>Hüppe et al. captured krill from the Southern Ocean on a commercial fishing boat and transferred them into a tank on the vessel for experiments. Observations revealed that the krill were most active at night, matching their natural patterns of migration in the wild. These patterns of nighttime activity adjusted to the changing length of the night over the seasons. Furthermore, the krill maintained a daily rhythm of activity even when they were kept in constant darkness for several days.</p><p>These findings suggest that an internal biological clock, in combination with light cues, regulates the swimming patterns of krill and helps them adapt to daily and seasonal changes in their environment. Understanding these internal rhythms will be key to assessing how well krill may cope with rapid changes in their environment due to climate change, which are particularly pronounced in polar regions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Euphausia superba</italic></kwd><kwd>Antarctic krill</kwd><kwd>circadian clock</kwd><kwd>activity</kwd><kwd>DVM</kwd><kwd>seasonal</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FO 207/17-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hüppe</surname><given-names>Lukas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Behavioral experiments provide strong evidence that krill swimming behavior is controlled by biological clocks throughout the year, revealing a key mechanism for adaptation to high-latitude habitats.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antarctic krill (<italic>Euphausia superba,</italic> hereafter referred to as krill) is a pelagic, up to 6 cm long crustacean, which is endemic to the Southern Ocean. With an estimated biomass of 300–500 million tons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Atkinson et al., 2009</xref>), krill is among the most abundant wild species worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bar On et al., 2018</xref>) and an important prey for predators such as whales, seals, and penguins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Trathan et al., 2016</xref>). Its huge abundance and central position in the food web makes krill a key species of fundamental importance for the functioning of the Southern Ocean ecosystem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cavan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Trinh et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Krill is mostly found in swarms, the largest of which can be hundreds of meters long and tens of meters in height, likely reflecting a behavioral adaptation to minimize the risk of predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tarling et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hamner and Hamner, 2000</xref>). Along with their pronounced swarming behavior, krill display diel vertical migration (DVM), a common behavior among many pelagic zooplankton organisms across different taxa found in all oceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bandara et al., 2021</xref>). DVM is commonly characterized by an ascent to the surface layers in the dark of the night to feed and a descent to darker parts of the water column during the day to avoid visually hunting predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bandara et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hays, 2003</xref>). The regular, synchronized movement of this large biomass significantly shapes the structure of ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nichols et al., 2022</xref>) and has large impacts on biogeochemical cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aumont et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archibald et al., 2019</xref>). This includes the recycling of nutrients, stimulation of primary production, as well as transport and storage of carbon in the deep ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cavan et al., 2019</xref>). Although such a ‘regular’ DVM pattern has been commonly observed for krill swarms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Godlewska, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Everson, 1983</xref>), there is considerable behavioral variation, including reverse DVM, higher frequency migrations, or no synchronized migrations at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Godlewska, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bahlburg et al., 2023b</xref>). While the adaptive advantage of balancing increased predation pressure during the day with the need to feed seems obvious, the underlying mechanisms of DVM and its modulations are not understood. Light is thought to be the most reliable and thus important environmental cue for DVM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ringelberg and Van Gool, 2003</xref>). However, a study in the marine copepod <italic>Calanus finmarchicus</italic> indicates that DVM behavior is underpinned by a circadian clock, which helps the animals to adjust behavior, physiology, and gene expression to the day-night cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Häfker et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, a study on Norwegian krill, <italic>Meganyctiphanes norvegica</italic>, suggested swimming activity in krill is under clock control, with increased activity during the dark phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Velsch and Champalbert, 1994</xref>). In Antarctic krill, similar studies have been conducted to test the hypothesis of a clock involvement in DVM behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gaten et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Piccolin et al., 2020</xref>). While these studies gave first hints that daily behavioral activity in krill is partly under endogenous control, a large variability hindered a clear characterization of the circadian behavioral activity of krill.</p><p>Previous studies on endogenous rhythms in krill identified the molecular components of a krill circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Biscontin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shao et al., 2023</xref>). It has further been shown that the krill circadian clock drives daily rhythms in gene expression, metabolism, and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Piccolin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Teschke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Biscontin et al., 2019</xref>). Part of krill’s success lies in its strong adaptation to the extreme seasonality of the Southern Ocean environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ducklow et al., 2007</xref>), which is reflected in a fundamental, seasonal regulation in body composition, metabolic activity, feeding, growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Quetin and Ross, 1991</xref>), sexual maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kawaguchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Siegel, 2012</xref>), and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Seear et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Höring et al., 2021</xref>). Results from laboratory studies showed that photoperiod is a major driver for seasonal ecophysiological changes in krill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Höring et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Teschke et al., 2007</xref>), and it has been suggested that an endogenous timekeeping system (i.e. biological clock) is involved, which uses photoperiod as a synchronizing cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Höring et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Piccolin et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p>Circadian clocks are widespread and well-studied endogenous timing mechanisms which allow an organism to fine-tune biological functions to specific times of the day-night cycle. The endogenous oscillation is produced by transcriptional-translational feedback loops of a set of clock genes and their translation products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tomioka and Matsumoto, 2010</xref>), which, under the absence of external cues, produce a temporal signal with a period (τ) of about 24 hr. Under natural conditions, the rhythm of the central oscillator is synchronized to exactly 24 hr by predictable environmental cycles, called <italic>zeitgeber</italic>, of which light is usually the most important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roenneberg et al., 2003</xref>). The rhythmic signal of the central oscillator is superimposed on downstream processes, which results in the temporal regulation of several biological functions, such as gene expression, physiology, and behavior. Thus, the circadian clock allows organisms to anticipate daily environmental cycles and adapt their biology, ultimately increasing survival and fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krittika and Yadav, 2020</xref>). Since the circadian clock implicitly measures day length, it is also capable of providing seasonal information. Consequently, the circadian clock has also been shown to be involved in the timing of seasonal functions, such as the induction of reproduction or diapause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saunders, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Helfrich-Förster, 2024</xref>).</p><p>While most knowledge about circadian clocks and their involvement in organism’s daily and seasonal processes stems from terrestrial model organisms, little is known about clocks in the marine environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tessmar-Raible et al., 2011</xref>). This is especially true for marine habitats in polar regions, characterized by extreme photic conditions, including polar night and midnight sun phases. An understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of biological timing is essential to comprehend how organisms adapt to their specific environment. This is particularly important in times of rapid environmental change, which can alter the temporal synchronization of trophic interactions, including DVM, feeding, and swimming behavior, and, thus, the functioning of whole ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Helm et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we use the novel Activity Monitor for Aquatic Zooplankter (AMAZE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hüppe et al., 2024</xref>) to investigate the mechanistic basis of swimming activity of wild-caught Antarctic krill under controlled environmental conditions onboard a commercial krill fishing vessel. We provide novel evidence that the circadian clock underlies ecologically important behaviors, such as DVM, and discuss how the krill circadian clock could control the timing of seasonal life cycle functions in krill.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Two sets of experiments were conducted for this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Furthermore, the time of increased activity during the dark phase exhibits a discernible pattern comprising three distinct activity bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). First, an increase in activity is observable in the evening (i.e. end of illumination), followed by a decrease in activity toward midnight. A second increase in swimming activity is observable in the latter half of the dark phase, followed by a decline in activity just before morning. A third short activity bout is observed in the morning (i.e. onset of illumination). This distinctive activity pattern during the dark phase is observed regardless of the photoperiod, resulting in a compression of the three activity bouts in short nights, while they spread out in long nights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), demonstrating that krill can entrain to the long and short days provided.

In contrast, the morning activity bout is not visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that the circadian clock drives a distinct bimodal activity pattern with two activity peaks in one day, i.e., the evening and late-night activity bouts. In contrast, the morning activity bout is triggered by the onset of illumination in the experimental setup. Furthermore, the amplitude of swimming activity is higher under LD than DD conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, Mann-Whitney U-test: p-value&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref><italic>,</italic> p-value&lt;0.001).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Circadian swimming activity persists with a stable phase after entrainment to a wide range of natural photoperiods</title><p>To gain insights into potential seasonal differences in the regulation of krill swimming activity, we sampled krill from the field in summer (summer treatment), late summer (late summer treatment), autumn (autumn treatment), and winter (winter treatment) and recorded their swimming activity for 4–8 days under constant darkness conditions, without previous entrainment in the activity monitor (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for details).</p><p>Similar to our previous analysis of individual krill swimming activity under constant darkness conditions, a large proportion of the recorded individuals in each experiment (44–100%) exhibited significant rhythmicity in the circadian range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">4</xref>), which is also reflected in rhythmic swimming activity at the group level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).

To date, only three studies have investigated the involvement of a circadian clock in the regulation of swimming behavior in krill species, including <italic>E. superba</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gaten et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Piccolin et al., 2020</xref>) and <italic>M. norvegica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Velsch and Champalbert, 1994</xref>). Data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Piccolin et al., 2020</xref>, showed a strong damping of the amplitude and indication of a remarkably short (~12 hr) free running period (FRP) of vertical swimming behavior of a group of krill under constant darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Piccolin et al., 2020</xref>). The short period found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Piccolin et al., 2020</xref>, is in line with our findings of a bimodal activity pattern under DD conditions on the individual level, suggesting that the ~12 hr rhythm in group swimming behavior in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Piccolin et al., 2020</xref>, could have resulted from a bimodal activity pattern at the individual level, as found in our study. Bimodal locomotor activity rhythms are well known across different species, possibly most prominently in the fruit fly (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>), where two coupled endogenous oscillators control morning and evening activity bouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Helfrich-Förster, 2001</xref>). In our experiments, we observed a strong weakening of the evening activity under constant conditions, especially after entrainment to long days, while the late-night activity peak appeared more robust. The differential variation in the morning and late-night activity suggests that the circadian activity bouts could also be controlled separately at the neuronal level in krill.</p><p>Comparing the daily pattern of swimming activity under LD conditions with those under DD, it is clear that the amplitude of the rhythm was significantly higher under LD than under DD. In addition, the activity under LD was organized into three activity phases, one in the evening, one late at night, and a smaller one in the morning. In contrast, under DD there were a maximum of two activity phases during the subjective night. Light is known to play a dual role in regulating daily behavioral activity. On the one hand, light functions as a <italic>zeitgeber</italic>, which synchronizes the circadian clock with the day-night cycle, a process called <italic>entrainment</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aschoff, 1960</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, it can directly affect clock output functions such as physiology and behavior, known as <italic>masking</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aschoff, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mrosovsky, 1999</xref>). The masking response depends on the activity type of the organism, and light was shown to promote activity in diurnal animals while inhibiting activity in nocturnal ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aschoff and von Goetz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aschoff and von Goetz, 1988</xref>). Krill are regularly observed performing nocturnal DVM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Godlewska, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Everson, 1983</xref>), including in the present study, with higher activity during the night, including the times of twilight, related to foraging and feeding activity and vertical ascend and descend movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhou and Dorland, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Klevjer and Kaartvedt, 2011</xref>). The observed effect of light on reducing krill swimming activity under LD conditions in our study is thus in line with previous concepts of the exogenous effects of light on nocturnal organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aschoff, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mrosovsky, 1999</xref>). However, under LD conditions, the observed swimming activity pattern in krill is not solely driven by light. The increase in activity in the evening and the second half of the dark phase under LD conditions flexibly adjusts to the length of the night and seems to persist under constant darkness, suggesting these bouts to be under clock control, as discussed above.</p><p>The reduced amplitude in swimming activity after the switch to DD conditions and further damping of amplitude over time under constant darkness has been found in other studies in krill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Piccolin et al., 2020</xref>) and other marine zooplankton organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Häfker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cohen and Forward, 2005</xref>). A rapidly damping output signal under constant conditions could indicate a weak, low amplitude circadian oscillator, where the damping amplitude of the clock output signal is caused by a rapid desynchronization of clock neurons, when zeitgeber signals are absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Webb et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, weak oscillators have been found in different fruit fly species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bertolini, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Beauchamp et al., 2018</xref>), the Svalbard reindeer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold et al., 2018</xref>), and Svalbard ptarmigan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Appenroth et al., 2021</xref>), native to high latitudes and species that exhibit pronounced seasonal rhythmicity, such as aphids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Beer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Barberà et al., 2017</xref>). It is known that weaker clocks are more flexible and can be entrained more efficiently than those that are more rigid and self-sustained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Webb et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2010</xref>). This could confer a significant adaptive advantage to species inhabiting environments characterized by extreme photic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bertolini, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Beauchamp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bloch et al., 2013</xref>), such as phases of polar night or midnight sun as well as rapid changes in day length, or species that rely on precise photoperiodic time measurement for accurate seasonal adaptation. In the Southern Ocean, photoperiod becomes extreme around the solstices, and its daily change is rapid around the spring and autumn equinoxes. A weak oscillator could, therefore, ensure that krill remains synchronized with the extreme and rapidly changing photic conditions and, thus, its environment.</p><p>Indeed, our data from activity recordings under DD conditions of krill sampled in different seasons indicate persistent circadian swimming activity, irrespective of the season. Our findings suggest that the krill circadian clock remains functional and drives rhythmic behavioral output in natural conditions throughout the year. This finding is complemented by the hydroacoustic recordings in the days preceding krill sampling for activity experiments. In summer, late summer, and autumn, krill swarms exhibited apparent DVM behavior, synchronized to the natural photoperiod. While we did not observe DVM in the upper water column during sampling in winter, acoustic recordings from other studies in winter indicate that krill may perform DVM also in winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cisewski et al., 2010</xref>), potentially in deeper layers.</p><p>Our data show that light acts in concert with, and is likely modulated by, the circadian clock to achieve the observed daily regulation in krill swimming activity. Nevertheless, further studies at the behavioral, molecular, and neuronal levels are required to elucidate the endogenous and exogenous effects of light and the circadian clock on the different behavioral aspects observed and to gain further insights into the characteristics of the molecular mechanism of the krill clock.</p><p>In a high-latitude region, such as the Southern Ocean, the timing of crucial life history functions to seasonal fluctuations of light, food availability, and sea ice extent is key to organisms’ success. In contrast to early studies, which suggested that only food availability was the main driver of krill’s seasonal physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ikeda and Dixon, 1982</xref>), later studies have revealed that photoperiod, likely in concert with circannual timing, drives the seasonal regulation of key life cycle functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Höring et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Teschke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Piccolin et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p>Although the exact molecular mechanism of seasonal timing remains unknown, there is clear evidence that the circadian clock measures day length and provides information about the seasonal progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saunders, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Helfrich-Förster, 2024</xref>). Several studies in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saunders, 2024</xref>) and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vicentini et al., 2023</xref>) support the external coincidence model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pittendrigh and Minis, 1964</xref>). This model explains how the circadian clock regulates the expression of a light-sensitive substance during the late dark phase. Under long days, this substance is degraded by morning light, suppressing a winter response, while the substance accumulates under short days (and long nights), inducing a winter-like response. In the case of krill, this response could include sexual regression, increased lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kawaguchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Höring et al., 2018</xref>), and a reduction in overall metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Piccolin et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p>Our data on krill circadian swimming activity of animals sampled from the field in different seasons show a remarkably stable peak in late-night activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e–h</xref>). Assuming that the behavioral activity under constant darkness reflects the direct influence of the circadian clock, our findings suggest that the krill circadian clock can measure the length of the day (or night) via external coincidence. The increased rhythmicity and synchronization of animals under shortening photoperiods indicate the potential of precise day length measurement especially during seasonal physiological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meyer et al., 2010</xref>). The day length information could subsequently be used directly to synchronize physiological functions with the environment and/or indirectly to entrain a circannual clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miyazaki, 2023</xref>), which subsequently drives rhythmic annual output. While the individual activity recordings provide first insights into potential mechanisms for the control of daily and seasonal processes in krill, it must be noted that behavioral output does not always reflect the detailed characteristics of the circadian oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Häfker et al., 2024</xref>). Further investigations into the molecular clock mechanism and its downstream functions across seasons are needed to clarify the involvement of the circadian clock in photoperiodism and circannual rhythms in krill.</p><p>Circadian clocks have the potential to anticipate the daily light-dark cycle and thereby enable a fine-tuned synchronization of behavioral and physiological functions with environmental cycles, which increases an organism’s fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krittika and Yadav, 2020</xref>). Consequently, synchronizing krill behavioral output with the day-night cycle provides potential adaptive advantages on various levels.</p><p>DVM of zooplankton seems to be a trade-off between predation risk and feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ringelberg and Van Gool, 2003</xref>). As it is complex to directly sense predation risk, light is a robust proxy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Benoit Bird and Moline, 2021</xref>) and a circadian clock provides an additional mechanism to anticipate and synchronize the times of vertical migration, active feeding, and foraging with nighttime. Our data show that light, in addition to the clock, ensures robust, synchronized activity patterns. Differences between entrained and free running conditions further indicate that evening and late-night activity are under clock control. At the same time, the activity peak in the morning is a response to the onset of light. A differential regulation of certain phases of DVM has previously been suggested for marine zooplankton species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Häfker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cohen and Forward, 2005</xref>). A clock-driven evening ascent would allow for the anticipation of sunset and thus the timely initiation of migration when krill swarms are in deeper water layers, resulting in optimized surface feeding time. The clock-controlled late-night activity could support a second feeding bout and preparation for a timely morning descent before sunrise increases visual predation risk. Interestingly, the decrease in clock-controlled swimming activity during the early night, right after the evening activity bout, may further facilitate a phenomenon called ‘midnight sinking’, which describes the sinking of animals to intermediate depths after the evening ascent, followed by a second rise to the surface before the morning descend. This behavior has been observed in a number of zooplankton species, including calanoid copepods (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tarling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cushing, 1951</xref> and references therein) and krill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tarling and Johnson, 2006</xref>). While previous studies suggested several exogenous factors, such as satiation or predator presence, as drivers of the midnight sink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tarling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cushing, 1951</xref>), our study suggests that this pattern may be partly under endogenous control. In situ hydroacoustic observations have demonstrated increased swimming speeds during nighttime for both <italic>M. norvegica</italic> and <italic>E. superba</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhou and Dorland, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Klevjer and Kaartvedt, 2011</xref>). This increase is likely related to active foraging and feeding behavior, as higher swimming speeds increase the chance of encountering food particles and thus increase food uptake. Nevertheless, swimming in krill is energetically costly and can make up more than 70% of the total energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kils, 1981</xref>). Reducing swimming activity to the baseline level during the day thus represents a significant opportunity for energy conservation.</p><p>At high latitudes, biological clocks are exposed to extreme changes in photoperiod throughout the year, including phases of midnight sun and polar night. Many organisms inhabiting polar regions show arrhythmicity, at least during parts of the year, and potential mechanisms include direct impacts on the central oscillator and uncoupling between output functions and the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bloch et al., 2013</xref>). Previous investigations of krill clock gene expression in the laboratory indicated a weaker oscillation of the krill clock and metabolic output functions under simulated extreme photic conditions (i.e. LL and LD 3:21), compared to more balanced day-night cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Piccolin et al., 2018a</xref>). Data on the transcriptomic and organismic level further indicate that krill can flexibly adapt to the photic conditions at different latitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Höring et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Höring et al., 2018</xref>). This aligns with our findings, where krill, sampled across a wide range of photoperiods, remain behaviorally synchronized with the local photoperiod under entrained conditions, but show reduced endogenous rhythmicity under DD after entrainment to long-day conditions. Krill inhabits a broad range of latitudes, including regions with clear day-night cycles and regions with polar night and midnight sun during the seasonal extremes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Siegel et al., 2016</xref>). At the same time krill is transported rapidly between regions via ocean currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fach et al., 2006</xref>), potentially exposing the same individuals to various photic conditions during their life span. A weak circadian clock in close interaction with the ambient light regime could thus allow krill to adopt the best strategy for the environmental conditions prevailing in the current location. For example, at high latitudes, the adaptive advantage of predator evasion with DVM diminishes in summer when the upper water column is illuminated constantly. In this case, arrhythmic behavior would allow flexibly exploiting food patches at any time of day, when the need for food is high to fuel reproductive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Quetin and Ross, 2001</xref>). Further, a study on the marine annelid <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic> recently highlighted a differential regulation of clock-controlled processes, where behaviorally arrhythmic individuals show increased rhythmicity in physiological output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Häfker et al., 2024</xref>), indicating the possibility of flexibly adapting timed processes to environmental conditions.</p><p>Adapting to a fluctuating environment involves significant seasonal physiological changes in krill to survive the harsh, food-scarce winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meyer, 2012</xref>). Crucial processes, such as accumulating enough lipids, must begin long before winter, requiring an anticipatory mechanism. Recent evidence suggests that photoperiod and circannual timing drive these seasonal changes in krill physiology, using photoperiod as a proxy for seasonal progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Höring et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Teschke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Piccolin et al., 2018b</xref>). Rapid warming in the Southern Ocean is observed to cause shifts in phytoplankton bloom timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thomalla et al., 2023</xref>), which may lead to temporal mismatches between photoperiod synchronized krill physiology and their primary food source, with the potential to reduce reproductive success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Helm et al., 2013</xref>) and negatively impact the krill-dependent ecosystem. Understanding the mechanistic basis of species adaptation and their flexibility is therefore crucial in times of rapid environmental change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Helm et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We used a new krill activity monitor to identify the endogenous underpinnings of swimming activity of wild-caught Antarctic krill. The results of our experiments provide clear evidence that a circadian clock underlies krill behavior, driving a distinct bimodal pattern of clock-controlled swimming activity. The damping of the activity amplitude under constant darkness suggests that krill possess a ‘weak’, highly flexible circadian clock adapted to a life under extreme and variable conditions. These findings are further supported by experiments conducted under simulated short-day and long-day conditions, demonstrating a flexible adaptation of the krill swimming activity pattern to a wide range of photoperiods. The results provide novel insights into the combined impacts of the circadian clock and light on the daily regulation of swimming activity. Furthermore, hydroacoustic recordings demonstrate that most krill swarms sampled exhibited synchronized DVM in the field in the days directly before sampling for behavioral experiments, indicating that in this region, krill remain behaviorally synchronized across a wide range of photoperiods. Seasonal recordings of field-entrained circadian swimming activity suggest that the krill circadian clock may be involved in measuring day length and, consequently, the timing of seasonal events. The findings provide novel insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of daily and seasonal timing in Antarctic krill, a marine pelagic key species, endemic to a high-latitude region. Mechanistic studies are a prerequisite for understanding how krill adapt to their specific environment and their flexibility in responding to environmental changes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal collection</title><p>Sampling of Antarctic krill (<italic>E. superba</italic>) for experimental purposes was conducted at various points throughout the seasonal cycle from the Bransfield Strait and South Orkney Island regions (for detailed locations, please refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) by use of the continuous fishing system onboard the krill fishing vessel Antarctic Endurance. During fishing, the vessel trawled at a speed of 1.5–2 knots using a commercial trawl. The krill was pumped on board by creating a vacuum in a hose connected to the cod-end of the trawl. On board, the krill was separated from the water on a metal grate, from which the krill was sampled. Sampled krill were kept in surface seawater at densities of ~1 Ind./L, at 1°C under constant darkness for an acclimation period between 4 and 10 hr, to reduce the impact of sampling stress and to check for the condition of krill individuals before transfer to the experimental setup. Prior to the start of each experiment, the experimental columns were filled with seawater sampled from the surface. For experiments conducted during summer, late summer, and autumn, when high food concentrations were to be expected, seawater was filtered through a 0.25 µm filter. During winter, field measurements showed a very low surface chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> level (below 0.5 µg/L; data not shown) and any potential larger particles in the water were excluded by sedimentation. The columns were distributed to the setup and the temperature was adjusted to 0.8°C. Only krill that were unharmed and lively were selected for behavioral experiments in the setup. At the end of each experiment, the krill were removed from the setup, evaluated for overall condition and total length (measured from the front of the eye to the tip of the telson, excluding setae), and their sex was determined under a stereomicroscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Krill swimming activity recording and experimental design</title><p>Krill swimming activity was recorded using the AMAZE setup, described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hüppe et al., 2024</xref>. In short, the recording principle is based on krill swimming in vertical acrylic experimental columns (height: 80 cm, diameter: 9 cm). Each column contains five infrared (IR) detector modules, equally spaced over the height of the column. Vertical movements of krill are detected by IR light beam breaks. A computer on each column controls data acquisition and stores beam break data. The experimental columns are placed in a compressor cooled incubator, which allows for a precise temperature control. Programmable LED light bars in the top of the incubator simulate underwater light spectra and daily light intensity cycles.</p><p>To investigate the behavioral activity of individual krill under light-dark conditions, 12 krill were exposed to 3 days of simulated short-day conditions (short-day treatment), and 10 krill to 5 days of simulated long-day conditions (long-day treatment). Due to technical problems, only data from 11 krill were analyzed from experiment 1 and data from 9 krill from experiment 2. Light-dark cycles were adjusted to a photoperiod of 5.5 hr simulating short days and 15 hr simulating long days. Day length was arranged symmetrically around local solar noon, to approximate the natural photoperiodic light regime at the time of sampling. The intensity and spectrum in the activity monitor were adjusted to field measurements, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hüppe et al., 2024</xref>. In short, light regime increased and decreased in a linear fashion from a maximum light intensity of 8.8 mW/m<sup>2</sup> during midday. To further investigate the involvement of an endogenous clock in krill activity, the initial phase of day-night simulations was followed by 5 days of constant darkness conditions in both experiments.</p><p>To investigate seasonal changes in krill circadian activity, four additional experiments were conducted, namely summer treatment (sampling date: January 22, 2022), late summer treatment (sampling date: March 1, 2022), autumn treatment (sampling date: March 15, 2022), and winter treatment (sampling date: June 10, 2022). For these experiments, krill were caught at the dates described above and after acclimation, 10 animals per experiment were distributed to the activity monitor, where their activity was recorded for 4–8 days under constant darkness conditions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for details).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Behavioral data analysis</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Experiment 1 (LD-DD)</title><p>Swimming activity of krill individuals was calculated from raw beam breaks as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hüppe et al., 2024</xref>. In short, we only considered upward swimming movements of individuals to separate baseline activity from increased activity, as krill are negatively buoyant. To accomplish this, we organized the raw beam break data from all five detector modules in each experimental column in chronological order. We selected only those beam break detections that occurred after a detection in the detector module positioned lower on the column. Like this, we consider upward swimming movements throughout the full height of the column. Beam breaks caused by upward swimming were summed over 10 min intervals and normalized between 0 and 1 for each individual. Data were smoothed by a centered moving average, with a smoothing window of 6 data points under light-dark simulations and 24 data points under constant darkness conditions.</p><p>To calculate the group activity of rhythmic krill under DD conditions, we first detrended the normalized swimming activity data of each individual to account for individual variability in baseline shifts of activity over time. This was done by subtracting the daily mean activity from each activity value of the same day. As the individual FRP varies between individuals, in the next step we corrected the data for each individual’s FRP and assigned them to a 24 hr day. To achieve this, we tested the detrended and smoothed activity data of each krill for rhythmic activity and determined the period of the rhythm using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis. We considered individuals with a period τ between 20 and 28 hr, a power of ≥50, and a p-value of less than 0.01 to be significantly rhythmic. The activity data of each rhythmic krill were subsequently assigned a new modified timestamp to cover the individual FRP within a 24 hr experimental day. This maintains the original resolution of the time series data while allowing for comparative analysis of individuals with differing FRPs. Group behavior was determined by calculating the mean and standard error of the mean (s.e.m.) per 10 min time interval and subsequent smoothing, as described above.</p><p>Average day analysis for a group of krill under LD cycles was done by determining the mean and s.e.m. per 10 min time interval of a 24 hr day over all experimental days and all individuals in one experiment and subsequent smoothing. Average day analysis for a group of krill under DD conditions was done in the same way, but based on the detrended and FRP-corrected data. The amplitude of swimming activity under LD and DD conditions was based on individual, normalized, detrended, and smoothed activity data, and was calculated for every experimental day as the difference between the daily maximal and minimal swimming activity. Differences in the activity amplitude between light conditions (i.e. LD vs. DD) were tested with the Mann-Whitney U-test and amplitude differences between the first and last day under DD conditions were tested with a paired t-test (R <italic>stats</italic> package version 4.1.2).

In a previous manuscript they explained the system, and here they employ it to show a circadian clock, supplemented by exogenous light, produces an activity pattern consistent with &quot;twilight&quot; diel vertical migration (DVM; a peak at sunset, a midnight sink, and a peak in the latter half of the night).</p><p>They used light:dark (LD) followed by dark:dark (DD) photoperiods at two times of the year to confirm the circadian clock, coupled with DD experiments at four times a year to show rhythmicity occurs throughout the year along with DVM in the wild population. The individual activity data show variability in the rhythmic response, which is expected. However, their results showed rhythmicity was sustained in DD throughout the year, although the amplitude decayed quickly. The interpretation of a weak clock is reasonable, and they provide a convincing justification for the adaptive nature of such a clock in a species that has a wide distributional range and experiences various photic environments. These data also show that exogenous light increases the activity response and can explain the morning activity bouts, with the circadian clock explaining the evening and late-night bouts. This acknowledgement that vertical migration can be driven by multiple proximate mechanisms is important.</p><p>The work is rigorously done, and the interpretations are sound. I see no major weaknesses in the manuscript. Because a considerable amount of processing is required to extract and interpret the rhythmic signals (see Methods and previous AMAZE paper), it is informative to have the individual activity plots of krill as a gut check on the group data.</p><p>The manuscript will be useful to the field as it provides an elegant example of looking for biological rhythms in a marine planktonic organism and disentangling the exogenous response from the endogenous one. Furthermore, as high-latitude environments change, understanding how important organisms like krill have the potential to respond will become increasingly important. This work provides a solid behavioral dataset to complement the earlier molecular data suggestive of a circadian clock in this species.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103096.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript provides experimental evidence on circadian behavioural cycles in Antarctic krill. The krill were obtained directly from krill fishing vessels and the experiments were carried out on board using an advanced incubation device capable of recording activity levels over a number of days. A number of different experiments were carried out where krill were first exposed to simulated light:dark (L:D) regimes for some days followed by continuous darkness (DD). These were carried out on krill collected during late autumn and late summer. A further set of experiments was performed on krill across three different seasons (summer, autumn, winter), where incubations were all DD conditions. Activity was measured as the frequency by which an infrared beam close to the top of the incubation tube was broken over unit time. Results showed that patterns of increased and decreased activity that appeared synchronised to the LD cycle persisted during the DD period. This was interpreted as evidence of the operation of an internal (endogenous) clock. The amplitude of the behavioural cycles decreased with time in DD, which further suggests that this clock is relatively weak. The authors argued that the existence of a weak endogenous clock is an adaptation to life at high latitudes since allowing the clock to be modulated by external (exogenous) factors is an advantage when there is a high degree of seasonality. This hypothesis is further supported by seasonal DD experiments which showed that the periodicity of high and low activity levels differed between seasons.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Although there has been a lot of field observations of various circadian type behaviour in Antarctic krill, relatively few experimental studies have been published considering this behaviour in terms of circadian patterns of activity. Krill are not a model organism and obtaining them and incubating them in suitable conditions are both difficult undertakings. Furthermore, there is a need to consider what their natural circadian rhythms are without the overinfluence of laboratory-induced artefacts. For this reason alone, the setup of the present study is ideal to consider this aspect of krill biology. Furthermore, the equipment developed for measuring levels of activity is well-designed and likely to minimise artefacts.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103096.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hüppe</surname><given-names>Lukas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Würzburg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Würzburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bahlburg</surname><given-names>Dominik</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bremerhaven</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Driscoll</surname><given-names>Ryan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Oceanography Centre</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Southampton</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Helfrich-Förster</surname><given-names>Charlotte</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Würzburg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Würzburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Bettina</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bremerhaven</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Hüppe and colleagues had already developed an apparatus and an analytical approach to capture swimming activity rhythms in krill. In a previous manuscript they explained the system, and here they employ it to show a circadian clock, supplemented by exogenous light, produces an activity pattern consistent with &quot;twilight&quot; diel vertical migration (DVM; a peak at sunset, a midnight sink, and a peak in the latter half of the night).</p><p>They used light:dark (LD) followed by dark:dark (DD) photoperiods at two times of the year to confirm the circadian clock, coupled with DD experiments at four times of year to show rhythmicity occurs throughout the year along with DVM in the wild population. The individual activity data show variability in the rhythmic response, which is expected. However, their results showed rhythmicity was sustained in DD throughout the year, although the amplitude decayed quickly. The interpretation of a weak clock is reasonable, and they provide a convincing justification for the adaptive nature of such a clock in a species that has a wide distributional range and experiences various photic environments. These data also show that exogenous light increases the activity response and can explain the morning activity bouts, with the circadian clock explaining the evening and late-night bouts. This acknowledgement that vertical migration can be driven by multiple proximate mechanisms is important.</p><p>The work is rigorously done, and the interpretations are sound. I see no major weaknesses in the manuscript. Because a considerable amount of processing is required to extract and interpret the rhythmic signals (see Methods and previous AMAZE paper), it is informative to have the individual activity plots of krill as a gut check on the group data.</p><p>The manuscript will be useful to the field as it provides an elegant example of looking for biological rhythms in a marine planktonic organism and disentangling the exogenous response from the endogenous one. Furthermore, as high latitude environments change, understanding how important organisms like krill have the potential to respond will become increasingly important. This work provides a solid behavioral dataset to complement the earlier molecular data suggestive of a circadian clock in this species.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive evaluation of our work by Reviewer 1, acknowledging our approach to record locomotor activity in krill and the importance of the findings in assessing krill’s potential to respond to environmental change in their habitat.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript provides experimental evidence on circadian behavioural cycles in Antarctic krill. The krill were obtained directly from krill fishing vessels and the experiments were carried out on board using an advanced incubation device capable of recording activity levels over a number of days. A number of different experiments were carried out where krill were first exposed to simulated light:dark (L:D) regimes for some days followed by continuous darkness (DD). These were carried out on krill collected during late autumn and late summer. A further set of experiments was performed on krill across three different seasons (summer, autumn, winter), where incubations were all DD conditions. Activity was measured as the frequency by which an infrared beam close to the top of the incubation tube was broken over unit time. Results showed that patterns of increased and decreased activity that appeared synchronised to the LD cycle persisted during the DD period. This was interpreted as evidence of the operation of an internal (endogenous) clock. The amplitude of the behavioural cycles decreased with time in DD, which further suggests that this clock is relatively weak. The authors argued that the existence of a weak endogenous clock is an adaptation to life at high latitudes since allowing the clock to be modulated by external (exogenous) factors is an advantage when there is a high degree of seasonality. This hypothesis is further supported by seasonal DD experiments which showed that the periodicity of high and low activity levels differed between seasons.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>Although there has been a lot of field observations of various circadian type behaviour in Antarctic krill, relatively few experimental studies have been published considering this behaviour in terms of circadian patterns of activity. Krill are not a model organism and obtaining them and incubating them in suitable conditions are both difficult undertakings. Furthermore, there is a need to consider what their natural circadian rhythms are without the overinfluence of laboratory-induced artefacts. For this reason alone, the setup of the present study is ideal to consider this aspect of krill biology. Furthermore, the equipment developed for measuring levels of activity is well-designed and likely to minimise artefacts.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank Reviewer 2 for their positive assessment of our approach to study the influence of the circadian clock on krill behavior. We are delighted, that Reviewer 2 found our mechanistic approach in understanding daily behavioral patterns of Antarctic krill using the AMAZE set-up convincing, and that the challenging circumstances of working with a polar, non-model species are acknowledged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses</p><p>I have little criticism of the rationale for carrying out this work, nor of the experimental design. Nevertheless, the manuscript would benefit from a clearer explanation of the experimental design, particularly aimed at readers not familiar with research into circadian rhythms. Furthermore, I have a more fundamental question about the relationship between levels of activity and DVM on which I will expand below. Finally, it was unclear how the observational results made here related to the molecular aspects considered in the Discussion.</p><p>(1) Explanation of experimental design - I acknowledge that the format of this particular journal insists that the Results are the first section that follows the Introduction. This nevertheless presents a problem for the reader since many of the concepts and terms that would generally be in the Methods are yet to be explained to the reader. Hence, right from the start of the Results section, the reader is thrown into the detail of what happened during the LD-DD experiments without being fully aware of why this type of experiment was carried out in the first place. Even after reading the Methods, further explanation would have been helpful. Circadian cycle type research of this sort often entrains organisms to certain light cycles and then takes the light away to see if the cycle continues in complete darkness, but this critical piece of knowledge does not come until much later (e.g. lines 369-372) leaving the reader guessing until this point why the authors took the approach they did. I would suggest the following (1) that more effort is made in the Introduction to explain the exact LD/DD protocols adopted (2) that a schematic figure is placed early on in the manuscript where the protocol is explained including some logical flow charts of e.g. if behavioural cycle continues in DD then internal clock exists versus if cycle does not continue in DD, the exogenous cues dominate - followed by - major decrease in cyclic amplitude = weak clock versus minor decrease = strong clock and so on</p></disp-quote><p>We want to thank Reviewer 2 for pointing out that the experimental design and its rationale are not becoming clear early in the manuscript, especially for people outside the field of chronobiology. We added a new figure (now Fig. 1), illustrating the basic principle of chronobiological study design and how we adopted it. We also extended the description at the beginning of the Results section to clarify the rationale behind the experimental design.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Activity vs kinesis - in this study, we are shown data that (i) krill have a circadian cycle - incubation experiments; (ii) that krill swarms display DVM in this region - echosounder data (although see my later point). My question here is regarding the relationship between what is being measured by the incubation experiments and the in situ swarm behaviour observations. The incubation experiments are essentially measuring the propensity of krill to swim upwards since it logs the number of times an individual (or group) break a beam towards the top of the incubation tube. I argue that krill may be still highly active in the rest of the tube but just do not swim close to the surface, so this approach may not be a good measure of &quot;activity&quot;. Otherwise, I suggest a more correct term of what is being measured is the level of &quot;upward kinesis&quot;. As the authors themselves note, krill are negatively buoyant and must always be active to remain pelagic. What changes over the day-night cycle is whether they decide to expend that activity on swimming upwards, downwards or remaining at the same depth. Explaining the pattern as upward kinesis then also explains by swarms move upwards during the night. Just being more active at night may not necessarily result in them swimming upwards.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe there is a slight misunderstanding in how what we call “activity” is measured. The experimental columns are equipped with five detector modules, evenly distributed over the height of the column. In our analysis we count all beam breaks caused by upward movement, i.e. every time a detector module is triggered after a detector module at a lower position has been triggered, and not only when the top detector module is triggered. In this way, we record upward swimming movements throughout the column, and not only when the krill swims all the way to the top of the column. This still means that what we are measuring is swimming activity, caused by upward swimming. We use this measure, to deliberately separate increased swimming activity, from baseline activity (i.e. swimming, which solely compensates for negative buoyancy) and inactivity (i.e. passive sinking).</p><p>Higher activity is thus at first interpreted as an increase in swimming activity, which in the field may result in upwards-directed swimming but also could mean a horizontal increase in activity, for example, representing increased foraging and feeding activity. This would explain the daily activity pattern observed under LD cycles (now Fig. 3), which shows a general increase in activity during the dark phase. This nighttime increase could be used for both upward directed migration during sunset and horizontal directed swimming for feeding and foraging throughout the night.</p><p>We added the following sentence to the description of the activity metric in the Methods section to clarify this point (lines 465-469):</p><p>“To accomplish this, we organized the raw beam break data from all five detector modules in each experimental column in chronological order. We selected only those beam break detections that occurred after a detection in the detector module positioned lower on the column. Like this, we consider upward swimming movements throughout the full height of the column.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Molecular relevance - Although I am interested in molecular clock aspects behind these circadian rhythms, it was not made clear how the results of the present study allow any further insight into this. In lines 282 to 284, the findings of the study by Biscontin et al (2017) are discussed with regard to how TIM protein is degraded by light via the clock photreceptor CRYTOCHROME 1. This element of the Discussion would be a lot more relevant if the results of the present study were considered in terms of whether they supported or refuted this or any other molecular clock model. As it stands, this paragraph is purely background knowledge and a candidate for deletion in the interest of shortening the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this part is not directly related to the data presented in the manuscript. We, therefore, omitted this part in the revised version of the manuscript to keep the discussion concise and focused on the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other aspects</p><p>(i) 'Bimodal swimming' was used in the Abstract and later in the text without the term being fully explained. I could interpret it to mean a number of things so some explanation is required before the term is introduced.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing this out. We provided an explanation for the term “bimodal” in the Results section, where the two clock driven activity bouts are described first, by extending the sentence in lines 161-164, which now reads:</p><p>“This suggests that the circadian clock drives a distinct bimodal activity pattern with two activity peaks in one day, i.e. the evening and late-night activity bouts, while. In contrast, the morning activity bout is triggered by the onset of illumination in the experimental set-up.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(ii) Midnight sinking - I was struck by Figure 2b with regards to the dip in activity after the initial ascent, as well as the rise in activity predawn. Cushing (1951) Biol Rev 26: 158-192 describes the different phases of a DVM common to a number of marine organisms observed in situ where there is a period of midnight sinking following the initial dusk ascent and a dawn rise prior to dawn descent. Tarling et al (2002) observe midnight sinking pattern in Calanus finmarchicus and consider whether it is a response to feeding satiation or predation avoidance (i.e. exogenous factors). Evidence from the present study indicates that midnight sinking (and potential dawn rise) behaviour could alternatively be under endogenous control to a greater or lesser degree. This is something that should certainly be mentioned in the Discussion, possibly in place of the molecular discussion element mentioned above - possibly adding to the paragraph Lines 303-319.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the Reviewer for pointing this out and agree that adding the idea of an endogenous control of midnight sinking would be interesting to the discussion. We added the following section to the Discussion (lines 335-343):</p><p>“Interestingly, the decrease in clock-controlled swimming activity during the early night, right after the evening activity bout, may further facilitate a phenomenon called “midnight sinking”, which describes the sinking of animals to intermediate depths after the evening ascent, followed by a second rise to the surface before the morning descend. This behavior has been observed in a number of zooplankton species, including calanoid copepods (see 69, 70 and references therein) and krill (71). While previous studies suggested several exogenous factors, such as satiation or predator presence, as drivers of the midnight sink (69, 70), our study suggests that this pattern may be partly under endogenous control.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iii) Lines 200-207 - I struggled to follow this argument regarding Piccolin et al identifying a 12 h rhythm whereas the present study indicates a ~24 h rhythm. Is one contradicting the other - please make this clear.</p></disp-quote><p>In our study, we found that the circadian clock drives a bimodal pattern of swimming activity in krill, meaning it controls two bouts of activity in a 24-hour cycle. Piccolin et al. (2020) identified a swimming activity pattern of ~12 h (i.e. two peaks in 24 h) at the group level, which aligns with our findings at the individual level. We revised the Section in the discussion for more clarity, which now reads:</p><p>“Data from Piccolin et al. (20) showed a strong damping of the amplitude and indication of a remarkably short (~12 h) free running period (FRP) of vertical swimming behavior of a group of krill under constant darkness (20). The short period found in Piccolin et al. (20) complements is in line with our findings of a bimodal activity pattern the pattern of swimming activity under DD conditions on the individual level found in the present study, suggesting that the ~12 h rhythm in group swimming behavior in Piccolin et al. (20) could have resulted from a bimodal activity pattern at the individual level, as found in our study.” (lines 212-219).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iv) Although I agree that the hydroacoustic data should be included and is generally supportive of the results, I think that two further aspects should be made clear for context (a) whether there was any groundtruthing that the acoustic marks were indeed krill and not potentially some other group know to perform DVM such as myctophids (b) how representative were these patterns - I have a sense that they were heavily selected to show only ones with prominent DVM as opposed to other parts of the dataset where such a pattern was less clear - I am aware of a lot of krill research where DVM is not such a clear pattern and it is disingenuous to provide these patterns as the definitive way in which krill behaves. I ask this be made clear to the reader (note also that there is a suggestion of midnight sinking in Fig 5b on 28/2).</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify the mentioned points concerning the hydroacoustic data:</p><p>a) As mentioned in the Methods section, only hydroacoustic data during active fishing was included in the analysis. <italic>E. superba</italic> occurs in large monospecific aggregations, and the fishery actively targets <italic>E. superba</italic> and monitors their catch and the proportion of non-target species continuously with cameras. Krill fishery bycatch rates are very low (0.1–0.3%, Krafft et al. 2022), and fishing operations would stop if non-target species were caught in significant proportions at any time. Therefore, and supported by our own observations when we conducted the experiments, we argue that it is a valid assumption that <italic>E. superba</italic> predominantly causes the backscattering signal shown in Figure 5 (now Fig. 6).</p><p>b) We are aware of the fact that DVM patterns of Antarctic krill are highly variable and that normal DVM patterns do not need to be the rule (e.g. see our cited study on the plasticity of krill DVM by Bahlburg et al. 2023). The visualized data were not selected for their DVM pattern but represent the period directly preceding the sampling for behavioral experiments in four seasons (experiment 2), including the day of sampling. These periods were chosen to assess the DVM behavior of krill swarms in the field in the days before and during the sampling for behavioral experiments.</p><p>To improve understanding, we modified the description in the Results, Discussion, and Methods sections, as well as the caption of Figure 5 (now Fig. 6), which now read:</p><p>“To investigate whether krill swarms exhibited daily behavioral patterns in swimming behavior in the field before they were sampled for seasonal experiments, hydroacoustic data were recorded from the fishing vessel, continuously over a three-day period prior to sampling for the seasonal experiments described above…” (lines 191-194).</p><p>“Furthermore, hydroacoustic recordings demonstrate that most krill swarms sampled exhibited synchronized DVM in the field in the days directly before sampling for behavioral experiments, indicating that in this region, krill remain behaviorally synchronized across a wide range of photoperiods.” (lines 397-400).</p><p>“Hydroacoustic data were collected using a hull-mounted SIMRAD ES80 echosounder (Kongsberg Maritime AS) aboard the Antarctic Endurance, covering three days before the sampling for each of the seasonal behavioral experiments of experiment 2” (lines 512-515).</p><p>“We only included data during active fishing periods and the vessel is specifically targeting <italic>E. superba</italic>, which occurs in large monospecific aggregations. Further, krill fishery bycatch rates are very low (0.1-0.3%, 84), which makes it highly probable that the recorded signal represents krill swarms.” (lines 523-526).</p><p>“Hydroacoustic recordings showing the vertical distribution of krill swarms in the upper water column (&lt;220 m) below the vessel, visualized by the mean volume backscattering signal (200 kHz), on the three days prior to krill sampling for experiments…” (lines 802-804).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>As noted in the public review, this is a logical and well-written manuscript.
