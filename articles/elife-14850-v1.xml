(CRAC) channels and triggers formation of an immune synapse between T cells and antigen-presenting cells. At the synapse, actin reorganizes into a concentric lamellipod and lamella with retrograde actin flow that helps regulate the intensity and duration of TCR signaling. We find that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is required to drive actin organization and dynamics at the synapse. Calcium acts by promoting actin depolymerization and localizing actin polymerization and the actin nucleation promotion factor WAVE2 to the periphery of the lamellipod while suppressing polymerization elsewhere. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent retrograde actin flow corrals ER tubule extensions and STIM1/Orai1 complexes to the synapse center, creating a self-organizing process for CRAC channel localization. Our results demonstrate a new role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a critical regulator of actin organization and dynamics at the synapse, and reveal potential feedback loops through which Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx may modulate TCR signaling.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14850.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14850.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14850.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>An effective immune response requires the immune system to rapidly recognize and respond to foreign invaders. Immune cells known as T cells recognize infection through a protein on their surface known as the T cell receptor. The T cell receptor binds to foreign proteins displayed on the surface of other cells. This interaction initiates a chain of events, including the opening of calcium channels embedded in the T cell membrane known as CRAC channels, which allows calcium ions to flow into the cell. These events ultimately lead to the activation of the T cell, enabling it to mount an immune response against the foreign invader.</p><p>As part of the activation process, the T cell spreads over the surface of the cell that is displaying foreign proteins to form an extensive interface known as an immune synapse. The movement of the T cell's internal skeleton (the cytoskeleton) is crucial for the formation and function of the synapse. Actin filaments, a key component of the cytoskeleton, flow from the edge of the synapse toward the center; these rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton help to transport clusters of T cell receptors to the center of the synapse and enable the T cell receptors to transmit signals that lead to the T cell being activated. It is not entirely clear how the binding of T cell receptors to foreign proteins drives the actin rearrangements, but there is indirect evidence suggesting that calcium ions may be involved.</p><p>Hartzell et al. have now investigated the interactions between calcium and the actin cytoskeleton at the immune synapse in human T cells. T cells were placed on glass so that they formed immune synapse-like connections with the surface, and actin movements at the synapse were visualized using a specialized type of fluorescence microscopy. When calcium ions were prevented from entering the T cell, the movement of actin stopped almost entirely. Thus, the flow of calcium ions into the T cell through CRAC channels is essential for driving the actin movements that underlie immune synapse development and T cell activation.</p><p>In further experiments, Hartzell et al. tracked the movements of CRAC channels and actin at the synapse and found that actin filaments create a constricting “corral” that concentrates CRAC channels in the center of the synapse. Thus, by driving cytoskeleton movement, calcium ions also help to organize calcium channels at the immune synapse. Future work will focus on identifying the actin remodeling proteins that enable calcium ions to control this process.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14850.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14850.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>immunological synapse</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>T lymphocyte</kwd><kwd>actin dynamics</kwd><kwd>calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartzell</surname><given-names>Catherine A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37GM45374</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lewis</surname><given-names>Richard S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM104867</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burkhardt</surname><given-names>Janis K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By restricting actin polymerization to the perimeter of the immune synapse and promoting depolymerization, calcium influx drives centripetal actin flow, which confines CRAC channels and the endoplasmic reticulum to the synapse center.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Soon after a T cell encounters cognate antigen on an antigen-presenting cell (APC), it spreads out over the cell’s surface, forming a tightly apposed structure known as the immune synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bromley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yokosuka and Saito, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dustin, 2008</xref>). The synapse regulates T cell activation by maximizing the contact area and organizing the T cell receptors (TCR) and associated signaling proteins into zones. Strong antigenic stimuli create three concentric regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Monks et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grakoui et al., 1999</xref>): a central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC), an intermediate zone (the peripheral SMAC, or pSMAC), and a zone at the synapse edge (the distal SMAC, or dSMAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freiberg et al., 2002</xref>). TCRs assemble with scaffolding and signaling proteins to form microclusters in the dSMAC which migrate centripetally towards the cSMAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grakoui et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krummel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Varma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yokosuka et al., 2005</xref>). As they move, TCR microclusters activate a MAP kinase cascade and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Ca<sup>2+</sup> release-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CRAC) channels, both of which are essential to initiate gene expression programs that drive T cell proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feske et al., 2001</xref>). Signaling by TCR microclusters is terminated as they enter the cSMAC by the dissociation of signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yokosuka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Varma et al., 2006</xref>) and endocytosis of TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Das et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the strength of signaling at the synapse is thought to reflect a dynamic balance between formation of new microclusters in the dSMAC/pSMAC and their disassembly and internalization in the cSMAC.</p><p>Actin reorganization at the synapse is crucial for TCR microcluster assembly, movement and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaizuka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Valitutti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Varma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumari et al., 2015</xref>). In the dSMAC, actin is dense and highly branched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parsey and Lewis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bunnell et al., 2001</xref>) and exhibits rapid retrograde flow similar to actin in the lamellipod of migrating cells. In the neighboring pSMAC region, actin is less dense and resembles a lamella with actin organized into concentric arcs by myosin IIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Actin is sparse in the actin-depleted zone (ADZ) corresponding to the cSMAC. Centripetal actin flow regulates TCR function in at least two ways. First, it transports TCR microclusters towards the cSMAC where they are disassembled, limiting the signaling lifetime of each microcluster to a few minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Varma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yokosuka et al., 2005</xref>). Second, actin polymerization and depolymerization are critical for microcluster formation and function, based on the ability of cytochalasin D (an actin polymerization inhibitor) and jasplakinolide (an actin depolymerization inhibitor) to rapidly quell microcluster formation, MAP kinase signaling, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Valitutti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Varma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rivas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yi et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the mechanisms that control actin organization and flow at the synapse are key to understanding synapse formation as well as T-cell signaling.</p><p>TCR stimulation is known to drive actin reorganization by activating the Rho-family GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, which function via Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) and WASp-family verprolin homologous protein (WAVE2) to initiate actin nucleation through the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billadeau et al., 2007</xref>). Recent studies have shown that actin polymerization collaborates with myosin IIA contractility to drive retrograde actin flow from the lamellipod to the ADZ, although there is some disagreement as to their relative contributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yi et al., 2012</xref>). The mechanisms that control retrograde flow at the synapse are still not fully understood, and the possibility remains that a master regulator of some kind may act on a global scale to organize this process.</p><p>Indirect evidence suggests that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> may regulate actin organization and dynamics at the synapse. Elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) in T cells has been associated with such cytoskeleton-dependent processes as motility arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Negulescu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhakta et al., 2005</xref>), cell rounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donnadieu et al., 1994</xref>), cell spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bunnell et al., 2001</xref>) and synapse stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Negulescu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krummel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delon et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, T cells express a range of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive proteins known to regulate actin depolymerization, severing, bundling, and capping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babich and Burkhardt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joseph et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janmey, 1994</xref>). TCR engagement is known to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through CRAC channels via a cascade in which PLCγ generates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>), releasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER and causing the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor STIM1 to redistribute to ER-plasma membrane (PM) junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luik et al., 2006</xref>) where it traps and activates Orai1, the pore-forming subunit of the CRAC channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). STIM1 and Orai1 colocalize at early times at the immune synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lioudyno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barr et al., 2008</xref>) and later at the distal pole of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barr et al., 2008</xref>), but functional CRAC channel complexes as indicated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx have only been shown at the synaptic contact zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lioudyno et al., 2008</xref>). The precise localization of CRAC channels at the synapse, the mechanisms that control their localization, and their possible effects on actin organization and dynamics are all unknown.</p><p>In this study, we applied an in vitro model system to investigate the localization of CRAC channels and the role these channels may play in regulating the actin cytoskeleton at the immune synapse. We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through CRAC channels acts at multiple levels to organize actin and promote retrograde flow, which in turn drives ER remodeling and the localization of STIM1 and Orai1 to the center of the synapse. In this way, Ca<sup>2+</sup> self-organizes CRAC channels at the synapse while creating feedback loops that may help regulate T cell sensitivity to antigen.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>STIM1 and Orai1 accumulate in the actin-depleted zone of the synapse</title><p>To study the location and redistribution of the population of STIM1/Orai1 complexes positioned at the synapse, Jurkat T cells expressing STIM1 labeled with mCherry (mCh-STIM1) and Orai1 labeled with EGFP (Orai1-EGFP) were stimulated on coverslips coated with anti-CD3 mAb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bunnell et al., 2001</xref>). Under these conditions, the cells spread over the coverslip to form a structure resembling an immune synapse and time-lapse TIRF microscopy can be used to obtain high resolution 2-dimensional images of the cell region within 200 nm of the coverslip. Previous studies have shown that cells stimulated in this way reorganize their cytoskeleton similarly to T cells forming conjugates with APCs or binding to peptide-MHC complexes in supported planar bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parsey and Lewis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bunnell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yi et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>After settling on stimulatory coverslips, cells spread over several minutes until they reached a constant size and roughly circular shape. Puncta containing STIM1 and Orai1 appeared at the contact zone beginning within seconds of initial contact and continuing through the spreading phase. After cells had spread fully (3–7 min after contact with the coverslip), colocalized puncta of STIM1 and Orai1 continued to increase in number and intensity over the next several minutes and appeared to be confined to the center of the synapse (68 of 82 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). While the great majority of cells had centralized puncta, the abundance varied from only 5 to an array too densely packed to accurately count, possibly reflecting cell-to-cell variations in STIM1 and Orai1 expression and the degree of ER [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] depletion. In a minority of cells (27 of 68 cells), puncta containing STIM1 and Orai1 were detected near the periphery and moved toward the center of the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) with an average velocity of 47 ± 3 nm/s (n = 24 puncta; mean ± SEM). These motile puncta were more frequently detected in 0.5–0.8 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub>; 48% of 33 cells) than in 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub>(31% of 35 cells), probably because a greater degree of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion is expected under the reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> conditions. Thus, we suspect that our experiments actually underestimate the number of motile STIM1-Orai complexes at the synapse because they are dim and difficult to detect when ER [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is only partially depleted. Puncta of colocalized STIM1 and Orai1 correspond to ER-PM junctions where STIM1-bound Orai1 conducts Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that as the synapse matures ER-PM junctions become concentrated in the center of the contact zone, and individual ER-PM junctions loaded with STIM1 and Orai1 translocate from the periphery to further increase the density of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx sites in the center.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14850.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>STIM1 and Orai1 accumulate in puncta in the actin-depleted zone of the immune synapse.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TIRF images of Jurkat cells stimulated on anti-CD3 coated coverslips in 0.8 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub>. mCh-STIM1 (green) and Orai1-EGFP (red) puncta accumulate in the center of the synapse over time.

At the inner edge of the lamellipod, actin density dropped off sharply, marking the transition into the lamella region where actin formed arc-like structures encircling a central ADZ (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Actin moved continually in a radial retrograde direction at velocities that declined from ~100 nm/s at the cell edge to near 0 nm/s at the border of the ADZ (data not shown). The highest density of STIM1 puncta occurred within the ADZ while dimmer, more dynamic STIM1-containing tubules extended into the lamella (21 of 21 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Kymograph analysis shows that STIM1 puncta in the lamella move centripetally with and at the same velocity as F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

In general, ER tubules can extend by sliding along the sides of microtubules or by attaching to the tips of growing microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Waterman-Storer and Salmon, 1998</xref>) through an interaction between STIM1 and the microtubule tip attachment proteins EB1 and EB3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grigoriev et al., 2008</xref>). In Jurkat cells expressing EB1 labeled with EGFP (EB1-EGFP) and ER-mCh, EB1 was seen at the tips of many extending ER tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>), confirming that ER tubules can extend toward the synapse periphery by attaching to the tips of growing microtubules. ER tubules rarely extended into the lamellipod, likely reflecting infrequent microtubule forays into the lamellipod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>), as has been reported for migrating epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Waterman-Storer and Salmon, 1997</xref>). Like ER tubules, EB1 moved roughly radially though the ADZ and lamella, but at the lamellipod/lamella border the majority reoriented and moved parallel to the synapse edge or disappeared as they moved above the TIRF evanescent field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). These findings suggest that ER tubules infrequently enter the lamellipod because microtubules cannot easily penetrate this thin, actin-dense compartment.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media4" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-14850-media4.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14850.009</object-id><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>ER tubules extend toward the synapse edge on the tips of microtubules.</title><p>Time-lapse TIRF movie of a Jurkat cell expressing ER-mCh (left) and EB1-EGFP (middle) stimulated on an anti-CD3-coated coverslip.

A recent report has described WASp-associated actin foci in primary T cell synapses that were not detectable in Jurkat cells, suggesting that actin organization in primary T cells may be more complex than previously recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumari et al., 2015</xref>). Jurkat cells also lack the lipid phosphatase PTEN, which may affect actin dynamics by enhancing PIP<sub>3</sub> accumulation in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shan et al., 2000</xref>). Finally, primary T cells are normally activated by APCs displaying the integrin ICAM-1, which modestly alters actin organization and slows retrograde actin flow at the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Comrie et al., 2015</xref>). To investigate effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on actin dynamics in a more physiological model, we transduced primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphoblasts with Lifeact-GFP, a short F-actin binding peptide from Abp140 tethered to GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Riedl et al., 2008</xref>). T lymphoblasts plated on anti-CD3- and ICAM-1-coated coverslips formed a distinct lamellipod with rapid retrograde actin flow as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Comrie et al., 2015</xref>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal altered the distribution of synaptic actin and reduced ruffling and retrograde flow (20 of 21 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref>). Kymograph analysis showed that on average, Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal slowed actin flow by 44% and Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> reperfusion restored it to 97% of the initial velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Cells spreading on anti-CD3 in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> had variable [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> consistent with known cell-to-cell variation in proximal TCR signaling in Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lewis and Cahalan, 1989</xref>). When both [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and F-tractin-P fluorescence reached steady-state, Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> was removed. In some cells stimulated in 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub>, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> declined slowly following Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> removal and did not reach a plateau, probably due to the slow release of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoth et al., 1997</xref>). To avoid this complication, we studied synapses formed in 0.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub>, for which Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> removal or 2-APB application evoked a rapid and monotonic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> decline to a similar plateau level in all cells (fura-2 ratio of 0.39 ± 0.04, mean ± SEM, n = 26 cells). The decline in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was closely followed by an increase in F-tractin-P fluorescence that plateaued ~30 s after [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, right). Similarly, readdition of Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> caused [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to rise and F-actin to decline, demonstrating a rapidly reversible effect on F-actin density.</p><p>Quantifying the relationship between [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and F-actin concentration is complicated by variation in the expression of F-tractin-P among cells. We therefore quantified the change in F-tractin-P fluorescence in each cell relative to the value in 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> or following 2-APB application, which produced a similar minimum [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in all cells. F-tractin-P fluorescence and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> were measured during the initial response to the TCR stimulus (in 0.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub>) and following readdition of 2, 5, or 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). In this group of 26 cells the level of F-actin declined as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increased, and this relationship was similar regardless of whether measurements were made before or after Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal. The level of F-actin was highly correlated with [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.83) but not with [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.22), and 2-APB application and Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> removal had similar effects on F-tractin-P density, demonstrating that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> reversibly regulates the density of F-actin at the synapse.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Calcium increases the rate of actin depolymerization at the synapse</title><p>Given that the steady-state level of F-actin in cells reflects a balance between the overall rates of actin polymerization and depolymerization, Ca<sup>2+</sup> could reduce the density of F-actin by increasing the rate of depolymerization and/or by reducing the rate of polymerization. We first examined the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on synaptic actin depolymerization in cells coexpressing F-tractin-P-tdTom and photoactivatable GFP-labeled actin (PAGFP-actin). After brief photoactivation of a small region, the GFP fluorescence indicates only F-actin, because monomeric PAGFP-actin rapidly escapes the region by diffusion; thus, the subsequent decay of fluorescence provides a measure of the actin depolymerization rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGrath et al., 1998</xref>). 3–7 min after settling onto stimulatory coverslips, images of F-tractin-P-tdTom were used to identify cells with steady-state treadmilling actin and small (~1 by 3 µm) regions in the lamella and lamellipod were defined for photoactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, left, red ovals). PAGFP actin was first photoactivated in the presence Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> and again ~2 min following Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> removal when F-actin had reached a new steady-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Video 10</xref>). After each photoactivation, the resulting GFP fluorescence was measured over time by widefield microscopy rather than TIRF in order to prevent any change in signal due to possible movement of actin in the Z direction, and translocation of the photoactivated region was used to measure centripetal velocity.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14850.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Calcium accelerates actin depolymerization and centripetal velocity at the synapse.</title><p>Jurkat T cells expressing F-tractin-P-tdTom and PAGFP-actin were stimulated on anti-CD3 coated coverslips and TIRF images of F-tractin-P-tdTom (<bold>A</bold>, left) were used to identify regions in the lamellipod and lamella (red ovals) to photoactivate.

While the critical role of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation in regulating gene expression during T cell activation is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feske et al., 2001</xref>), the current study reveals several essential new functions for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in determining synapse form and function. Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through CRAC channels organizes actin into distinct lamella and lamellipod zones, stimulates retrograde actin flow and concentrates active CRAC channels in the center of the synapse, in part through its action to return extending ER tubules to the ADZ.</p><p>Our findings extend upon previous work implicating Ca<sup>2+</sup> in actin remodeling at the synapse. In a pioneering study, Bunnell et al demonstrated that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required for actin accumulation and cell spreading during the early phase of synapse formation; however, the failure of the cells to spread in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> precluded study of calcium’s effects on the mature synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bunnell et al., 2001</xref>). Likewise, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive proteins including L-plastin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wabnitz et al., 2010</xref>), gelsolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morley et al., 2007</xref>), calpain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>) and myosin IIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ilani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yi et al., 2012</xref>) have been implicated in actin remodeling at the synapse, but in these studies protein expression levels or activity were perturbed prior to synapse initiation, and thus effects on cell adhesion and spreading could not be distinguished from possible effects on actin dynamics in the mature synapse. We were able to address the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the mature synapse by acutely blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx after the synapse was fully formed as indicated by its stable contact area, well-defined lamellipod and lamella actin zones, and retrograde actin flow. In both Jurkat cells and primary T lymphoblasts, Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> removal triggered similar changes in actin organization and retrograde flow. Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> removal slowed retrograde flow in the lamellipod to nearly the same degree in both cells (41% decrease in Jurkat versus 44% in primary T cells; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal diminished the lamellipod in primary T cells, reducing its width by 61%, while in Jurkat cells the effect was somewhat more pronounced with the lamellipod becoming indistinguishable from the rest of the actin network. Overall, these results demonstrate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> effects on actin organization and dynamics are not specific to Jurkat cells but apply also to primary T cells. Furthermore, T lymphoblasts responded similarly to Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub> removal when stimulated on surfaces including ICAM-1 in order to more closely resemble an APC, indicating that our findings extend to more physiological surface interactions. New optical technologies such as light sheet microscopy may enable further studies of Ca<sup>2+</sup> effects on actin dynamics in the most physiological setting, at the synapse between a primary T cell and an APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ritter et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> acts at multiple levels to organize actin into a lamellipod and lamella with sustained retrograde flow. First, Ca<sup>2+</sup> directs actin polymerization largely to the distal edge of the lamellipod while suppressing it elsewhere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). By effectively restricting polymerization to the edge, Ca<sup>2+</sup> suppresses filament growth at random angles throughout the synapse and promotes retrograde vectorial movement of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Second, Ca<sup>2+</sup> accelerates actin depolymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), which is expected to enhance the rate of actin flow further by increasing the level of monomeric actin and therefore the rate of actin addition to free barbed ends at the lamellipod edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Overall, these findings demonstrate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> adds a second level of regulation to actin remodeling downstream of TCR triggering. The net effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is to suppress the density of F-actin at the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which was somewhat surprising given that elevating intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been reported to increase the level of F-actin in unstimulated T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dushek et al., 2008</xref>). This discrepancy may have resulted from the different imaging methods that were used; flow cytometry may indicate an increased level of F-actin globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dushek et al., 2008</xref>), while TIRF or confocal imaging at the cell footprint may instead detect a local decrease in F-actin at the synapse (this study). Alternatively, TCR triggering may initiate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive actin regulatory pathways that are quiescent in resting cells, and thus Ca<sup>2+</sup> engages a different set of actin remodeling proteins after TCR stimulation.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14850.028</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Effects of calcium on actin dynamics and retrograde flow at the synapse.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Retrograde actin flow at the immune synapse (yellow arrows) continually removes extended ER tubules (purple) from the periphery, thereby concentrating the ER in the ADZ. An expanded view of the red-boxed region (top) depicts Ca<sup>2+</sup> effects on actin regulation (bottom). Ca<sup>2+</sup> drives centripetal actin flow in two ways: (1) by restricting polymerization to the lamellipod edge (green chevrons), it enforces vectorial movement of the actin network; and (2) by increasing the rate of depolymerization, it increases the pool of free actin monomers (grey chevrons), thus enhancing polymerization on free barbed ends at the lamellipod edge (green chevrons). Ca<sup>2+</sup> restricts polymerization to the lamellipod edge by localizing WAVE2 and Abi1 to this site where they promote ARP2/3-mediated actin nucleation (blue triangles) and possibly by capping free barbed ends elsewhere (pink circles). (<bold>B</bold>) Experimentally terminating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx reduces retrograde actin flow such that extended ER tubules are no longer effectively pushed into the ADZ. In the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>o</sub>, actin depolymerization is reduced (bottom), nucleation occurs more uniformly throughout the lamellipod/lamella and capping of free barbed ends may be reduced. The overall result is a slowed, non-directional polymerization throughout the lamellipod and lamella resulting in reduced retrograde flow.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14850.028">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14850.028</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-14850-fig8-v1"/></fig></p><p>Calcium acts in two ways to spatially restrict actin polymerization at the mature synapse: by promoting polymerization around the cell perimeter and by suppressing polymerization throughout the rest of the contact area. The extensive polymerization at the lamellipod edge is closely paralleled by the recruitment of the WAVE2/Abi1 complex to the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), where it presumably activates Arp2/3 to initiate actin polymerization and branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007</xref>). A central question arising from these findings is how Ca<sup>2+</sup> directs WAVE2/Abi1 to the periphery. One possible mechanism is suggested by the ability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to stimulate PI3K localization to the lamellipod of migrating cells, where generation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>) may recruit the WAVE2 complex to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oikawa et al., 2004</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> may exert additional effects through its ability to promote GTP loading of Rac, a GTPase essential for WAVE2-mediated actin nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fleming et al., 1999</xref>). The mechanism by which Ca<sup>2+</sup> suppresses polymerization elsewhere in the lamella and lamellipod is also unknown, although Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive capping proteins expressed in T cells such as gelsolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yin, 1987</xref>) or CapG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yu et al., 1990</xref>) are attractive candidates. Our results indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent acceleration of depolymerization is unlikely to involve myosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), but the actin-severing proteins cofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2005</xref>) and gelsolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yin, 1987</xref>) remain viable candidates as both are expressed in T cells and respond to physiological levels of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Because the ER-PM junction forms the physical site for STIM1-Orai1 assembly into active CRAC channels, the location and dynamics of the ER are critical factors that determine when and where Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx sites arise when T cells contact their targets. Our results provide the first view of ER dynamics at the synapse and how the actin cytoskeleton restricts both the ER and CRAC channel distribution to the cSMAC/ADZ. As the synapse forms, STIM1 and Orai1 appear in the cSMAC/ADZ by two mechanisms. The first is related to the movement of the centrosome and associated MTOC to the synapse, as EM tomography has shown enrichment of the ER around the centrosome at synaptic contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ueda et al., 2011</xref>). This mechanism appears to account for the bulk of ER localization and STIM1-Orai1 complexes as cells settled onto coverslips. Once a stable synapse formed, microtubule extension carried ER tubules toward the periphery, and these were repeatedly returned to the ADZ by an advancing front of actin. A similar action of actin to oppose the extension of microtubules and associated ER tubules has also been described at the leading edge of migrating epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Terasaki and Reese, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Waterman-Storer and Salmon, 1997</xref>). Our observations that STIM1/Orai1 puncta and actin move towards the ADZ at similar speeds suggest that nascent ER tubules may form ER-PM junctions in peripheral regions, which then enable the assembly of active STIM1-Orai1 complexes that traverse the lamella before they are collected in the ADZ. Interestingly, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to membrane phospholipids is thought to enhance TCR signaling by exposing membrane-associated CD3 ITAM motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shi et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, an intriguing possibility is that mobile CRAC channel complexes create local sites of high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> needed to fully activate mobile TCR microclusters.</p><p>This study illustrates two new levels of signal regulation at the immune synapse. Because actin dynamics are required to sustain TCR activity at the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaizuka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Valitutti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Varma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rivas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumari et al., 2015</xref>), the action of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to promote actin turnover and flow creates a positive feedback loop that would be expected to maintain or enhance the activation of CRAC channels. This loop creates the potential for nonlinear effects, such that graded increases or decreases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> may act through actin to modulate TCR activity and bias the cell towards all-or-none, threshold-like behavior in response to antigen. At the same time, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx effectively limits the lifetime of active TCR microclusters by increasing the rate at which they are transported to the synapse center, where signaling is terminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Varma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yokosuka et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, the accumulation of STIM1 and Orai1 in the ADZ reveals a new type of CRAC channel self-organization. At the level of single ER-PM junctions, STIM1 and Orai1 complexes self-organize through a diffusion trap mechanism based on STIM1 binding to the PM and Orai1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). At the synapse CRAC channels self-organize in a second way, by promoting the retrograde flow of actin that concentrates ER-PM junctions and CRAC channels in the ADZ.

In kymographs, each pixel represents the average intensity across the 5-pixel width of the scan line. Spatiotemporal image correlation spectroscopy (STICS) analysis was used to determine the direction and velocity of actin movement by applying an ImageJ plugin (STICS map jru v2, developed by Jay Unruh at Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, MO) based on methods developed by Hebert et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hebert et al., 2005</xref>). Sample sizes were determined based on previous in situ measurements of actin depolymerization rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Theriot and Mitchison, 1991</xref>) and live-cell imaging studies of the immune synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babich et al., 2012</xref>). To measure the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dependence of F-tractin-P fluorescence, F-tractin-P intensity was normalized to an average of the final five images collected in 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup>, at which time the fura-2 ratio had reached a minimum value of 0.39 ± 0.04 (mean ± SEM, n = 26 cells). Data points represent the mean F-tractin-P fluorescence and fura-2 ratio when both signals were at steady-state and the sample size was selected to ensure that the cell population represented a broad range of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. PAGFP fluorescence decay was measured within an ROI encompassing the photoactivated region that was moved centripetally to remain centered on the fluorescent bar of actin. The time course was fitted by a single exponential function using IgorPro (Wavemetrics, Portland, OR). At each time point, the mean intensity across the width of the photoactivated bar was measured along a line perpendicular to the direction of movement, and displacement of the peak fluorescence value versus time was used to calculate velocity. To create fluorescence profile plots of PAGFP-actin incorporation, the fluorescence intensity as a function of radial position was calculated by averaging across 19 pixel-wide scan lines, subtracting the average of 10 scans acquired before photoactivation, and plotting the result relative to this pre-photoactivation signal.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Special thanks to Nathan H Roy for the preparation of primary human T cells expressing Lifeact-GFP.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, David Clapham, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Cahalan (peer reviewer).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Hartzell and Lewis examine the dynamics of Stim/Orai redistribution at the immunological synapse. The more specific question is how calcium entry through this channel alters actin and ER to drive specialization of the region (e.g., concentration of Orai Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, etc.) while recycling T cell receptors. The main conclusions are that actin reorganizes into a lamellipod with retrograde actin flow. Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx promotes actin depolymerization and localizes actin polymerization to the periphery of the lamellipod. Overall, the continuous actin reorganization drives microtubule bound ER and to the synapse center, presumably keeping the ER/PM junctions formed by Stim intact.</p><p>All three reviewers agreed that the overall the work is of high quality, the movies fascinating and the conclusions well-supported. This insightful work makes an important contribution toward understanding the molecular dynamics of the immunological synapse, in relation to calcium signaling and actin cytoskeleton.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major criticisms that require new experiments were:</p><p>1) It has been shown that the actin dynamics in Jurkat and primary mouse/human T cells differ dramatically (Kumari et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2015) making it difficult to directly extrapolate the results from the Jurkat T cell system to the ontology of the immune synapse as a whole. As suggested above, validation of some key findings in a primary cell system would in my opinion add significance to this study. In doing so, the authors would also include conditions in which ICAM1 is present. WAVE2 has been shown to directly regulate ICAM1 and localize to ICAM1 high pSMAC. The inclusion of ICAM1 is important for a functional relevance of the mechanism, in vivo T cells will encounter antigen in the context of ICAM1 and if WAVE2 is recruited to LFA1-1 this will affect the interpretation of the specific recruitment of WAVE2 to the LM actin ruffles. In addition, the Kumari paper shows WAVE2 immuno staining that is relatively uniform across the synapse, which differs from the results presented here.</p><p>This would require experiments comparing what is observed in Jurkats to T cells. Specifically, the reviewer said &quot;the experiments looking at synapses between primary T-APC can be done in 2 months.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14850.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>The major criticisms that require new experiments were:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) It has been shown that the actin dynamics in Jurkat and primary mouse/human T cells differ dramatically (Kumari et al. eLife 2015) making it difficult to directly extrapolate the results from the Jurkat T cell system to the ontology of the immune synapse as a whole.

We have responded to the reviewers’ comments by conducting a new series of experiments using human CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphoblasts plated on anti-CD3 alone as well as anti-CD3 + ICAM1, in collaboration with Dr. Janis Burkhardt’s group. We find that Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal slows actin flow and reduces the extent of the lamellipod in a reversible fashion. These effects occur whether or not ICAM1 is present. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> affects actin organization and dynamics in primary human T cells as well as Jurkat T cells, although the effects are somewhat less dramatic in primary cells. These new results demonstrate that the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> are not specific to the Jurkat cell, and do extend to a more physiological synapse model. The new data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Videos 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">8</xref> and discussed in the last paragraph of the subsection “Calcium influx organizes actin at the synapse” and in the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>We believe the different distribution of WAVE2 in our study and that of Kumari et al. is due to the fact that the localization of WAVE2 varies at different times during synapse development. In the Kumari paper WAVE2 localization (which was punctate throughout the cell footprint) was shown only in a single cell imaged at a very early time point (2’ after stimulation) when the cell was still in the spreading phase of synapse formation and the lamellipod had not yet formed (Figure 1—figure supplement 4B). In another study by Le Floc’h et al. (Le Floc’h et al. J. Exp. Med. 210:2721–37, 2013.), WAVE2 was also localized throughout the cell footprint at an early time, but became concentrated at the cell edge by 9 min, when the synapse had fully formed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> of that paper). At later times (18-45 min), WAVE2 became most concentrated in the lamella/pSMAC where LFA-1 accumulates. Our results are consistent with these studies, in that we are specifically visualizing WAVE2 at 6 min after plating, which is shortly after the cell has fully spread, and we verify this by selecting cells that have a clearly lamellipod by phalloidin staining. This phase of synapse formation is equivalent to the 9 min time point in Le Floc’h et al.</p></body></sub-article></article>
