Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the CaSR in the inactive and agonist+PAM bound states. Complemented with previously reported structures of CaSR, we show that in addition to the full inactive and active states, there are multiple intermediate states during the activation of CaSR. We used a negative allosteric nanobody to stabilize the CaSR in the fully inactive state and found a new binding site for Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion that acts as a composite agonist with L-amino acid to stabilize the closure of active Venus flytraps. Our data show that agonist binding leads to compaction of the dimer, proximity of the cysteine-rich domains, large-scale transitions of seven-transmembrane domains, and inter- and intrasubunit conformational changes of seven-transmembrane domains to accommodate downstream transducers. Our results reveal the structural basis for activation mechanisms of CaSR and clarify the mode of action of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and L-amino acid leading to the activation of the receptor.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>G-protein-coupled receptor</kwd><kwd>calcium-sensing receptor</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>calcium

(Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are required for various kinds of biological processes in the human body. Human calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that senses small fluctuations of extracellular levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 1993</xref>). It maintains Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis by the modulation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion from parathyroid cells and the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> reabsorption by the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown, 2013</xref>). Recently, it has been reported that CaSR is also a phosphate sensor that can sense moderate changes in extracellular phosphate concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Centeno et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geng et al., 2016</xref>). Dysfunctions of CaSR or mutations in its genes may lead to Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostatic disorders, such as familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism, and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hendy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pollak et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ward et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>CaSR belongs to the family C GPCR that includes gamma-aminobutyric acid B (GABA<sub>B</sub>) receptors, metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), taste receptors, GPRC6a, and several orphan receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ellaithy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hannan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heaney and Kinney, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pin and Bettler, 2016</xref>). Like most class C GPCRs, CaSR functions as a disulphide-linked homodimer. Each subunit of CaSR is comprised of a large extracellular domain (ECD) that contains a ligand-binding Venus flytrap (VFT) domain and a cysteine rich domain (CRD), and a seven-transmembrane domain (7TMD) that connects to CRD to carry signals from VFT domain to downstream G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>CaSR can be activated or modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), L-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronorharman-3-carboxylic acid (TNCA), a tryptophan derivative ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), and several commercial calcium mimetic drugs, such as cinacalcet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leach et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nemeth et al., 2004</xref>), etelcalcetide, and evocalcet (positive allosteric modulator, PAM, of CaSR) that are used for patients with end-stage kidney diseases undergoing dialysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leach et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Walter et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Recent groundbreaking structural studies of several full-length class C receptors, such as mGluR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koehl et al., 2019</xref>) and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Papasergi-Scott et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shaye et al., 2020</xref>), by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have provided a structural framework to unravel the activation mechanisms of class C GPCRs. The crystal structures of the resting and active conformations of CaSR ECD were solved by two different groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). More recently, Ling et al. have solved the cryo-EM structures of full-length CaSR in active and inactive states; however, their inactive structures do not show the fully inactive state and exhibit some characteristics of the active conformation of crystal CaSR ECD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ling et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geng et al., 2016</xref>). In their active structures, they proposed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and L-Trp work cooperatively to activate CaSR, leading to the closure of VFT domain.</p><p>In our study, we used cryo-EM to obtain the structures of full-length CaSR in inactive and agonist+PAM bound conformations. The fully inactive structure is stabilized by a negative allosteric nanobody. In the agonist+PAM bound structure, we identified a new calcium binding site at the interdomain cleft of VFT, with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and TNCA constitute a composite agonist to stabilize the closure of the VFT, leading to the conformational changes of the 7TMDs to initiate signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of camelid nanobodies stabilizing the inactive state of CaSR</title><p>For structural studies, we used nanobody to stabilize CaSR in the inactive conformation. Published structures of CaSR-ECD demonstrate that agonist binding induces conformational changes of VFT model of CaSR, whereby two separate LB2 domains approach each other, forming a novel interface in the active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geng et al., 2016</xref>). Based on these structural information, we introduced a potential N-linked glycosylation site on the contacting interface between LB2 domains in the active CaSR to block the interaction of LB2 domains and keep the CaSR in an inactive state. We made a double mutation R227N-E229S at the dimer interface of LB2 domain to introduce N-linked glycosylation at 227 residues site. We immunized two camels with the mutant of CaSR and generated nanobody phage display library. We performed two rounds of bio-panning on the mutant of CaSR and used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to verify the nanobodies that specifically bound to CaSR. We performed intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux assay to determine whether screened nanobodies could stabilize CaSR in the inactive state. Of the several CaSR binders, NB-2D11 and NB88 significantly inhibited the activity of CaSR with IC<sub>50</sub> of 41.7 nM and 167.1 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to measure binding kinetics, both nanobodies NB-2D11 and NB88 demonstrated high-affinity binding to CaSR with K<sub>D</sub> of 0.24 nM and 3.9 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).

Cryo-EM data present three conformations of inactive CaSR with an overall resolution of 5.79 Å, 6.88 Å, and 7.11 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). The local refinement focusing on the ECDs and the 7TMDs was performed separately to improve the resolutions to 4.5 Å and 4.8 Å, respectively, with quality density throughout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), which enabled us to confidently build the backbone of the inactive CaSR model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>The overall structures in the inactive and agonist+PAM bound states are homodimeric arrangement, in which two subunits almost parallelly interact in a side-by-side manner while facing opposite directions. For each subunit, the VFT domain is linked to the canonical 7TMD via CRD, which is almost perpendicular to the bilayer membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>). The agonist+PAM bound structure of CaSR displays a substantial compaction compared to the inactive structure, including the reduction of length, height, and width. Moreover, their width changed most obviously because there are four interfaces with interaction between the two protomers at each of LB1 domain, LB2 domain, CRD, and 7TM domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), both VFT modules adopt closed–closed conformation, and the TNCA and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion composite is bound at the interdomain cleft between LB1 domain and LB2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>). The closure of the VFT is relayed to TMD through the interaction of the intersubunit CRD. The overall conformation of our agonist+PAM bound structure is consistent with the recently reported active conformation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/L-Trp-bound structure of CaSR (CaSR<sup>Acc</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ling et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A–D</xref>).</p><p>In the inactive structure, there is only one interface at the apex of the receptor and the VFT module adopts an open conformation with the nanobody binding at the left lateral side of each LB2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>). The active state has the overall buried surface area of 3378 Å<sup>2</sup>, whereas it substantially decreases to 1346 Å<sup>2</sup> in the inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). Ling et al. recently published three different structures of CaSR in the inactive state, in which the VFT module adopted closed–closed, open–closed, and open–open conformations. However, due to low resolution, they only built the structure of CaSR in the inactive closed–closed conformation (CaSR<sup>Icc</sup>). Comparing our inactive open–open conformation (CaSR<sup>fully inactive</sup>) with their CaSR<sup>Icc</sup> revealed similar 7TM domains, but two totally different VFT module conformations, with their closed–closed conformation presenting similar characteristics to the active state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). This indicates that the CaSR in the inactive state has conformational heterogeneity. In other words, this suggests that in addition to the full inactive state and the active state, there are multiple intermediate states in the process of activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> and TNCA as a composite agonist activate the full-length CaSR dimer</title><p>The cryo-EM map of active state presents a distinct density at the ligand-binding cleft of each protomer, which enabled us to unambiguously model TNCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). The binding details of TNCA were the same as previously reported data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). The interactions between TNCA and VFT are primarily mediated by hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The high-resolution density of active state map enabled us to identify three distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites within ECD of each protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Two sites were previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ling et al., 2021</xref>), while a new Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site was found at the interdomain cleft of the VFT module that is close to the hinge loop and abuts the TNCA binding site, and interacts with both LB1 and LB2 domains to facilitate ECD closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). The bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is primarily coordinated with side chains of D190 and E297, carbonyl oxygen atoms of P188 backbone, and hydroxyl groups of S170 and Y489. Residues P188, D190, and S170 are located in LB1 domain, while E297 and Y489 are in LB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). The main coordination residues (S170, D190, and E297) of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion are consistent with those previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). The maps obtained by cryo-EM imaging are insufficient to confirm that the observed density corresponds to calcium. We assume that the density represents the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> based on the following reasons. First, from its hexavalent coordination (coordinating residues P188, D190, S170 and E297, and Y489), this metal is most likely to be Ca<sup>2+</sup>, although another ion cannot be ruled out. Second, we prepared the CaSR sample in a purification buffer supplemented with 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and without any other bivalent cation prior to cryo-EM imaging. Third, the main binding residues (S170, D190, and E297) of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion were previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), and that single mutation of these residues (D190K, S170K and E297K, and Y489F) significantly reduced the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The cell surface expression levels of these mutants are all above 80% compared to the wild-type level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Ling et al<italic>.</italic> tried to determine the cryo-EM structures of CaSR in the presence of a high concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to address the question of whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions alone can activate CaSR in the absence of L-Trp. However, they did not obtain the closed conformation of VFT that only contain the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion between the cleft. This result indicates that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion alone is insufficient to induce the closure of the VFT module even in the presence of a high concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ling et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our structure shows that TNCA bind at the interdomain of VFT module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), corresponding to the L-amino acid binding site in other class C GPCRs, such as mGluRs and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. However, it has been reported that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion can activate the receptor on its own in various functional assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jensen and Brauner-Osborne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Quinn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saidak et al., 2009</xref>) and L-amino acids enhance the sensitivity of CaSR to Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conigrave et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). While L-amino acids and their analogies are generally considered PAMs but not agonists of CaSR, they are the endogenous agonists of other class C GPCRs. This is somewhat inconsistent from the perspective of GPCR classification and evolution.</p><p>Our CaSR<sup>agonist+PAM</sup> structure reveals that the interaction of TNCA with the LB1 and LB2 domains can promote the closure of VFT module, which is a crucial step of the activation for Class C GPCR. The single mutation of the TNCA or L-Trp binding residues (T145I, S147A, S170A, Y218S, E297K) largely impaired the function of the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geng et al., 2016</xref>).

During the preparation of our manuscript, several CaSR structures have been reported, including structures of closed–closed conformation in the inactive state (CaSR<sup>Icc</sup> and CaSR<sup>Trp</sup>) and closed–closed conformation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Trp bound state (CaSR<sup>Acc</sup> and CaSR<sup>Ca</sup>). Open-closed and open–open conformations (CaSR<sup>Ioc</sup> and CaSR<sup>Ioo</sup>) have also been observed; however, they were not built due to low resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ling et al., 2021</xref>). The overall conformation of our CaSR<sup>agonist+PAM</sup> structure is almost identical to that of CaSR<sup>Acc</sup>, while the open–open conformational VFT module in our inactive structure (CaSR<sup>fully inactive</sup>) is different from the closed–closed conformation in their reported inactive CaSR<sup>Icc</sup> structures. In addition, the main conformation changes of CaSR during activation were also described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Complemented with solved crystal structures of CaSR ECD and full-length cryo-EM structures of other class C GPCR, these recent findings allow us to understand the structural framework and essential events that occur during the activation of CaSR. The overall structures of CaSR resemble the recently published structures of mGluR5 and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, indicating that the structural mechanism of class C GPCRs is similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koehl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Papasergi-Scott et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shaye et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Multiple structural and functional studies of class C GPCR have demonstrated that there are two typical conformational changes in the VFT domains during receptor activation. One is that the B–C helix angle at the interfaces of LB1–LB1 dimer sharply rotated from inactive to active state. This conformational transition of the LB1 domain is conducive to ligand binding, which is a prerequisite for receptor activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). For example, increased glutamate affinity and occupancy in mGluR2 active conformation were observed by the mutations in B-Helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levitz et al., 2016</xref>). Another is that the conformation of VFT domain is converted from open to closed for the change of interdomain in one protomer, which is a landmark event during receptor activation.</p><p>We used an inhibitory nanobody to stabilize the conformation of CaSR in the inactive state. Our inactive structure shows that the B-C helix angle is about 117° and VFT domain adopts an open–open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The B–C helix angle has rotated approximately 28° from inactive to agonist+PAM bound state and the VFT domain rearranged from open–open configuration to closed–closed configuration during CaSR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), consistent with other class C GPCR activation mechanism findings. In addition, Liu et al<italic>.</italic> developed a FRET-based conformation sensor for CaSR through fusion of SNAP-tag at its N-terminus of CaSR subunit to label with fluorophores. Their data showed that the CaSR dimer underwent a large conformational change of LB1–LB1 dimer during activation, in which the B–C helix angle rotated from inactive to active state as the fluorophores labeled the N-terminus of LB1 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). We used nanobody NB-2D11 to block the proximity of LB2 domains, thus locking the CaSR in an inactivate state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Altogether, our structural and functional assay data suggest that our inactive cryo-EM structure represents the full inactive state of CaSR.</p><p>The rotation of LB1–LB1 domains is a watershed between inactive and intermediate states. We have reported that the crystal structure of CaSR-ECD in the open-open state (CaSR<sup>Ioo</sup>) has the same B–C helix angle as that of the active state (CaSR<sup>agonist+PAM</sup>), with LB1 domain configuration that is ready for L-amino acid and Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, in contrast to our cryo-EM structures of the inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Similarly, the recently reported conformation CaSR<sup>Icc</sup> has the similar B–C helix angle as CaSR<sup>agonist+PAM</sup>, but adopts the closed–closed VFT conformation, which is a feature of the active state. It is likely that both CaSR-ECD<sup>Ioo</sup> and CaSR<sup>Icc</sup> are different intermediate states during the activation of CaSR. We believe that the inhibition with NB-2D11 pushes the CaSR to a completely inactive state.</p><p>At present, the prevailing view is that the principal agonist of CaSR is extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hofer and Brown, 2003</xref>). L-amino acids, such as L-Trp, can enhance the sensitivity of CaSR toward Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conigrave et al., 2000</xref>), and are considered as PAMs of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saidak et al., 2009</xref>). In line with this view, a recently reported FRET study showed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are sufficient to activate CaSR in the absence of L-amino acids, such that Ca<sup>2+</sup> could be considered as an agonist of CaSR, whereas L-amino acids are pure PAMs of CaSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). However, it is interesting to note that L-amino acids or their analogs are endogenous agonists of other class C GPCRs, suggesting inconsistency from the perspective of GPCR classification and evolution.</p><p>In contrast, some studies have also shown that if Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is higher than the threshold of 0.5 mM, L-amino acid can activate the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conigrave et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conigrave et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Young and Rozengurt, 2002</xref>), indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> and L-amino acid can act as co-agonists of the receptor. Using single-cell intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> microfluorimetry, L-Trp has been shown to directly stimulate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in cells stably expressing CaSR, with its efficacy and potency increase with increases in concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, hence providing direct evidence that L-amino acids are agonists of CaSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geng et al., 2016</xref>). However, this view has yet to be widely accepted because it is difficult to observe L-amino acids directly activating CaSR. The mode of action of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion and L-amino acids on CaSR remains controversial.</p><p>Our CaSR<sup>agonist+PAM</sup> structure shows that TNCA and a newly identified Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion bind at the interdomain cleft of the VFT module, and they both interact with both LB1 and LB2 domains to facilitate ECD closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), therefore forming the closed state of the ligand-binding domain required for CaSR activation. This indicates that both TNCA and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion contribute to the activation of CaSR. TNCA and the bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> share three common binding residues S170 and D190 of LB1 domain and E297 from LB2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>), which suggest that the CaSR is synergistically activated by TNCA and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions.</p><p>Our experiments have shown that TNCA directly stimulate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in cells stably expressing CaSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), suggesting that TNCA are agonists of CaSR. The structure of CaSR shows that TNCA binds at the cleft between LB1 and LB2 domains, which is the binding site for all class C GPCR agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kunishima et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tsuchiya et al., 2002</xref>), and TNCA has a binding pattern similar to that of the endogenous agonists of mGluR and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geng et al., 2016</xref>). The key coordination residues are very conserved, such as S147 and S170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kunishima et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, TNCA (or L-Trp) interact with residues from LB1 and LB2 to stabilize the closure of VFT, and the signal mutation of the contacting residues (T145I, S147A, S170A, Y218S, E297K) substantially reduce the function of the receptor, even if some of these residues (S147A, T145I, and Y218S) are not related to the coordinating residues of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, hence indicating that TNCA or L-Trp plays a key role in the activation of CaSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geng et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In addition, Ling et al. tried to determine the cryo-EM structures of CaSR in the presence of a high concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to address the question of whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions alone can activate CaSR in the absence of L-Trp. Three different 3D models were obtained, in which the VFT adopted closed–closed, closed–open, and open–open conformations, and an undefined L-amino acid or its derivate was buried in the closed VFT module. However, they did not obtain the closed conformation of VFT containing only Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion between the cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ling et al., 2021</xref>). The results indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion alone is not enough to induce the closure of the VFT module even in the presence of a high concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion, and L-amino acid or its derivate is required to stabilize the closed conformation of VFT module. Altogether, L-amino acids are the endogenous agonists of CaSR, in agreement with that of other class C GPCRs.</p><p>It remains controversial whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> act alone to activate CaSR in the absence of L-amino acid. Three different groups prepared CaSR samples without L-amino acids or derivatives for crystal or cryo-EM structural studies, but they all unexpectedly obtained the active structure of CaSR or CaSR ECD with closed–closed VFT conformation containing undefined ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ling et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). This ligand was subsequently identified as TNCA, which had a high affinity for CaSR, and potentiated Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). As we all know, it takes a long time to purify CaSR in TNCA-free buffer for structural study; nevertheless, the endogenous TNCA would still bind to CaSR. This indicates that TNCA tightly binds to CaSR or that it is buried in closed VFT module such that it is difficult to be washed off.</p><p>Gentle washing is impossible to remove TNCA bound to CaSR in various function assays. In the absence of TNCA (or L-amino acid) and despite well-controlled assays, it is possible that endogenous TNCA would still bind to CaSR to stabilize the closed conformation of VFT. It would then appear that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions directly activate the CaSR alone as TNCA remains undetected.</p><p>In addition to the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion binding at the cleft of VFT module to stabilize the closed conformation of VFT, another role of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions should be considered, in which Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is coordinated by D234, E231, and G557, and bridges the LB2 domain of one subunit and the CR domain of the second subunit. Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion facilitates the formation of the active conformation of CaSR, which explain why L-amino acids (or TNCA) can activate CaSR in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion above the threshold concentration of 0.5 mM. We speculate that as endogenous TNCA exists, binds to CaSR with high affinity, and is difficult to be replaced by other added L-amino acids, it is challenging to observe whether L-amino acids can directly activate CaSR. Alternatively, the observed allosteric regulation is also a comprehensive result when we performed function assay. It needs the experience of the kinetics and dynamics of L-amino acid or TNCA binding with CaSR to confirm.</p><p>We observed that the LB2 domains approach each other during CaSR activation. Although we do not have a fully active conformation of the CaSR without agonist binding as evidence, crystal structures of a fully closed VFT modules of mGluR1 with or without agonist binding were previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kunishima et al., 2000</xref>) and have demonstrated that the proximity of both LB2 domains is an automatic process rather than an agonist-driven one. Here, we showed that NB-2D11 inhibited CaSR activation by blocking the proximity of both LB2 domains.</p><p>We analyzed how the closure of ligand bound VFT module is relayed to the signaling of 7TMDs through the CRDs. First, the rotation of LB2 domain is propagated to the large-scale transition of intersubunit 7TMDs, which leads to rearrangement of 7TMDs interface from TM5–TM6-plane/TM5–TM6-plane interface to TM6–TM6-mediated interface. Liu et al. used FRET sensor to investigate the 7TM interface rearrangement during the activation of the CaSR through a disulfide cross-linking approach. They observed a TM4–TM5-plane/TM4–TM5-plane interface in the inactive state, but a TM6–TM6 contact in the active state of the CaSR dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). The conformational heterogeneity of the interface of 7TMDs in the inactive state indicates that there is a possible dynamic equilibrium between the TM4–TM5 and TM5–TM6 interfaces. TM6–TM6 contact in the active state is considered to be a hallmark of class C GPCR activation. For mGluR5 and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, the 7TMDs rearrange from TM5–TM5 interface in the inactive state to TM6–TM6 interface in the active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koehl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Papasergi-Scott et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shaye et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, structures of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor revealed some cholesterol molecules at the interface of 7TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Papasergi-Scott et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shaye et al., 2020</xref>). It is possible that the undefined maps between the 7TMD in our full inactive structure could be sterols that separate the dimer plane–plane interface and stabilize the inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In this study, we found that the conformation of ECL2 changed from the inactive to agonist+PAM state. However, the alignment of individual 7TM of both inactive and agonist+PAM states shows that the helices are well superposed, indicating that the change of ECL2 conformation is unable to drive the rearrangements of TM4 and TM5 helices and stabilize the active conformation in the TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koehl et al., 2019</xref>) This observation is consistent with findings that the active state of mGluR5 is stabilized by G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koehl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manglik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosenbaum et al., 2011</xref>). It is required to determine the structure of G protein coupling CaSR to clarify the configuration of the 7TMD in the active state.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

Five micrograms DNA plasmid was incubated with 15 μl lipofectimine (Invitrogen) in 500 μl OptiMEM (Gibco) for 10 min at room temperature and then added to the cells for overnight incubation at 37℃. The transfected cells were trypsinized and seeded in poly-D-lysine-coated 96-well plates (Greiner bio-one, cat# 655083). On the day of assay, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and washed twice. The cells were incubated with blocking buffer containing 3% skim milk in PBS followed by incubation for 1 hr with anti-Flag antibody (Yeasen) in blocking buffer. The cells were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase goat anti-mouse IgG (Yeasen) diluted 1:5000 in blocking solution for 1 hr. Chemiluminescence was measured on a Tecan plate reader immediately after addition of 10 μl/well SuperSignal ELISA Femto Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The results show that each CaSR mutant displays similar fluorescence intensity as that of wild type, which indicates that the elimination of the calcium response is not caused by misfolding or mis-trafficking of the receptor.

Through the use of both agonists and negative allosteric modulators, these structures reveal conformational changes of the receptor that contribute to signaling. CaSR has unquestionable medical relevance, and the topic is of interest to structural biologists and in cell signaling.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structural insights into the activation of human calcium- sensing receptor&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Randy B Stockbridge as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jean-Philippe Pin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. For the mutant analysis, it is essential to include a control for cell surface expression. Many of the mutants eliminate the calcium response, but this may be an indirect effect if the mutant causes misfolding of mis-trafficking of the receptor.</p><p>2. Additional quality metrics for the cryo-EM data and models should be reported. These include more extensive maps (for example, maps around excised regions of secondary structure to assess overall correspondence of maps and models, and maps of the sidechains in the ligand binding site), FSC curve and the distribution of viewing angles of the particles used in the reconstructions, and an analysis of model geometry. Please ensure that Figure 1—figure supplement 2 actually shows maps, and not a surface rendering.</p><p>3. The authors should revise the manuscript to engage more with the current literature on CaSR. Doing so is essential to support some of the structural observations. In particular:</p><p>– the authors should compare the current structures of CaSR with the recent structures of Ling et al., 2021 for the same receptor. The authors should elaborate on their rationale for arguing that the current structures are more representative of the inactive state than prior models. The authors should explain why the prior model of the inactive state is described as &quot;controversial.&quot;</p><p>– The authors propose a Calcium binding site that corresponds to one proposed to be essential for CaSR activation by Liu et al., (PNAS 2020), based on models, mutagenesis, and the use of a conformational FRET-based sensor. This work must be cited. Although such a site is very likely to bind Ca ions, the maps provided by the cryo-EM images are far from being sufficient to guarantee that the density observed corresponds to a Ca ion, rather than to another ion. The authors must clearly indicate this and argue why they think this is probably a Ca ion.</p><p>– The relative movement of the 7TM domains observed in these structures also fully agree with what was proposed by Liu et al., (2020) through a Cys cross-linking approach and functional analysis of the cross-linked dimers. This study must be discussed and cited.</p><p>4. The authors should not refer to the agonist+PAM conformation as the active one, as this is very unlikely since the 7TM domain conformation is almost identical to that observed in the nanobody stabilized inactive state. Please refer to this state as the agonist+PAM bound state.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The conclusion that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and TCA site are cooperative is based on structural evidence. Have any experiments in the literature shown cooperativity between TCA and Ca<sup>2+</sup>?</p><p>2. The nanobody is an important part of this story. It would be helpful to provide more information on the selection of the nanobody. Was the inactive conformation the target of the nanobody selection? Was anything done during the screening to select for a nanobody against the inactive conformation? I suggest introducing the nanobody selection and activity assays earlier in the manuscript.</p><p>3. The authors should elaborate on their rationale for arguing that the current structures are more representative of the inactive state than prior models. Why is the prior model of the inactive state described as &quot;controversial?&quot;</p><p>4. The quality of the model (bonds, angles, C-β deviations, etc) should be evaluated using a web server like MolProbity to ensure that the model statistics are satisfactory. These should be reported.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1 – The authors propose a Calcium binding site that corresponds to one proposed to be essential for CaSR activation by Liu et al., (PNAS 2020), based on models, mutagenesis, and the use of a conformational FRET-based sensor. This work must be cited.

I recommend they refer to this state as the agonist+PAM bound state.</p><p>3 – Most of the inactive structures of the isolated CaSR VFT dimers are all in an orientation corresponding to the active one of the mGlu receptors, with both lobes 2 being in close contact. The recent full length structures revealed three possible inactive states, the VFT dimer in the resting closed closed (Rcc), Resting open closed (Rco) or resting open-open (Roo). Here, the authors report a conformation corresponding to the Roo state that corresponds to the inactive state of mGluR VFTs, but they do not provide a clear demonstration that this is indeed the case. One argument that can be used is based on the work by Liu et al., (2020) that show that the CaSR receptor VFT dimer undergoes a similar change in its orientation during activation, as that of the mGlu receptors. Another argument will be the analysis of the functional effect of the identified nanobody. It is shown to inhibit the receptor activity (Figure 5b), but can a constitutive activity of the CaSR receptor resulting from the other resting conformation be detected? If so, can it be inhibited by NB-2D11?</p><p>4 – The relative movement of the 7TM domains observed in these structures also fully agree with what was proposed by Liu et al., (2020) through a Cys cross-linking approach and functional analysis of the cross-linked dimers, with dimers cross-linked through TM6 being constitutively active, while Ca effect was dramatically reduced in TM4 or 5 cross-linked dimers. This study must be discussed and cited.</p><p>5 – The authors must also be clear on the relative role of TNCA (or other L-AA) and Ca ions on the activation of the receptor. Using a well-controlled assay, Liu et al., (2020) reported that Ca ions are sufficient to activate the CaSR, even in the absence of L-AA, such that Ca ion can be considered as the agonist of the CaSR. In contrast, any tested L-AA did not activate the receptor, but largely potentiated the Ca effect, such that these L-AA should be considered as PAMs of the CaSR. This must be clarified in the text.</p><p>6 – The intermediate state presented should be better explain in the text.</p><p>7 – Please be more specific in Figure 4 on how the distances between the C-termini of the VFTs were measured. Indicate which atom was used as a reference.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As discussed above, I believe the manuscript could be strengthened by better discussing the distinct aspects of the structures compared to the Ling et al., published paper.</p><p>Also I would recommend the authors to go through the manuscript again and to double check typos and grammatical errors. I have noted a few here:</p><p>L9: our data shows</p><p>L33: through which can be removed.</p><p>L44: the active structure has demonstrated a calcium…I would rather say the active structure presents a calcium…</p><p>This is actually the case several times in the manuscript (L57, 65…). When speaking about structural or map features, I would suggest to replace &quot;has demonstrated&quot; or &quot;have demonstrated&quot; or 'has shown' by &quot;present&quot; or similar.</p><p>L78: the sentence is not clear ans should be rewritten:</p><p>and the closed conformation of the VFT module has shown in the active state, which is stabilized by the TNCA binding at the VFT module and 3 distinct calcium binding sites within each ECD</p><p>L102: throughout the manuscript you wrote promoter instead of protomer.</p><p>L231: is consisted (consistent)</p><p>L240: contacting with the map does not make sense in the sentence.</p><p>L254: presents similar, except …similar what?

The cell-surface expression levels of the WT and mutant CaSR constructs were examined using ELISA as described previously (Mos et al., 2019). The cell surface expression levels of the mutants of the TNCA and calcium common binding sites (S170K, D190K, E297K and Y489F) were approximately 80-100% of the wild-type level. However, each of these mutants nearly abolished or reduced ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent receptor response, indicating that their effects on TNCA and calcium binding and receptor function are not only due to the decrease in cell surface expression.</p><p>The expression of each mutant of F789A and F792A from TM5 on the cell surface were higher than that of the WT, however, both mutations still significantly attenuate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced receptor activity.</p><p>In order to verify the proximity of 7TMDs during the activation, we mutated P823R to disrupt the contact of TM6. The result demonstrated that the expression of P823R mutants was similar to that of the wild type, but after the mutation, the activity of the receptor was seriously affected. Our result shows that the P823R mutant interferes with the active interface driven by TM6, resulting in a decrease in the receptor function.</p><p>The structure reveals that the interaction between W590 and K601 of CRD and D758 and E759 of ECL2 relays the conformational changes of VFT to the TM domain. The cell surface expression level of ∆758-759 mutant was comparable to that of WT, while W590E and K601E mutants were expressed on the cell surface at approximately 40-50% of WT level. Each of these mutant leads to a largely decreased effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in cells, which indicates that the contact formed by CRD and ECL2 plays an important role in converting the ligand binding domain conformational change into the intra-7TM rearrangement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Ling <italic>et al.</italic> determined structures of CaSR homodimer in distinct conformations and their findings help us understand the global and local conformational transitions during CaSR activation. They obtained three different structures of CaSR in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free sample, which were considered to represent CaSR in inactive states. Their three models showed similar architecture, but the VFT domains adopted three different conformations, including closed-closed, open-closed, and open-open conformations, designated as CaSR<sup>Icc</sup>, CaSR<sup>Ioc</sup>, and CaSR<sup>Ioo</sup>, respectively. They indicated that the CaSR in the inactive state had conformational heterogeneity. However, they only built the structure of CaSR in the Icc conformation due to the relatively lower resolution. They also determined the structure of the CaSR-L-Trp complex, designated as CaSR<sup>Trp</sup>, as the intermediate state of CaSR during activation. They compared the structures of CaSR<sup>Trp</sup> and CaSR<sup>Icc</sup> and found that both structures were identical. Moreover, they determined two structures of CaSR in the active state, one was bound with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and L-Trp and designated as CaSR<sup>Acc</sup>, while another was obtained in the presence of a high concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and designated as CaSR<sup>Ca</sup>. Structural comparison demonstrated that the structure of CaSR<sup>Ca</sup> was almost identical to that of CaSR<sup>Acc</sup>. Except from the structure of CaSR<sup>Ca</sup> in active state, the inactive conformation of CaSR (CaSR<sup>Ioc</sup> and CaSR<sup>Ioo</sup>) were captured in the high concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, unfortunately, they still were not resolved due to lower resolution. In conclusion, they determined two structures of CaSR (CaSR<sup>Acc</sup> and CaSR<sup>Ca</sup>) in the active states and two structures of CaSR (CaSR<sup>Icc</sup> and CaSR<sup>Trp</sup>) in the inactive states (or intermediate state), and also observed two inactive conformations of CaSR (CaSR<sup>Ioc</sup> and CaSR<sup>Ioo</sup>, but their structures were not built). They reported that ca<sup>2+</sup> induced a conformational transition of CaSR from CaSR<sup>Icc</sup> to CaSR<sup>Acc</sup>, as CaSR<sup>Icc</sup> and CaSR<sup>Acc</sup> had striking different overall architectures, especially, the CRDs and TMDs separated in the dimeric receptor, while their VFT domains had tiny changes. They also reported that the L-Trp binding induced the closed-closed conformation of the VFT domains, leading to conformational conversion from CaSR<sup>Ioo</sup> to CaSR<sup>Icc</sup>.</p><p>Previous structural and functional studies have suggested a universal activation mechanism for class C GPCR. First, there are two typical conformational changes for the VFT domains in the dimeric receptor from the full inactive state to the full active state. One is that the conformation of VFT domain was converted from open to closed for the change of interdomain in one protomer, another is that the B-C helix angle on the interfaces of LB1-LB1 dimer sharply rotated from inactive state to active state. Second, the closure of VFT domain brings the CRD into close proximity which leads to rearrangement of the 7TMs and establishment of the active TM6-TM6 interface to initiate signaling.</p><p>In addition, Liu <italic>et al.,</italic> developed a FRET-based conformation sensor for CaSR through fusion of SNAP-tag at its N terminus of CaSR subunit to label with fluorophores. Their data showed that the CaSR dimer underwent a large conformational change of LB1-LB1 dimer during activation, which indicated that the B-C helix angle rotated from inactive state to active state as the fluorophores was labeled at N-terminus of LB1 domain.</p><p>In our inactive structure, the B-C helix angle is about 117° and VFT domain adopts an open-open conformation (Figure 4A, B). The B-C helix angle has rotated approximately 28° from inactive state (117°) to agonist+PAM bound state (89°) and the VFT domain rearranged from open-open configuration to close-close configuration during CaSR activation, consistent with other class C GPCR activation mechanism reported. Therefore, our data suggest that our inactive structure represents the full inactive state. Comparing our inactive open-open conformation with the recently published inactive closed-closed conformation (CaSR<sup>Icc</sup>) revealed similar CR and 7TM domains, but two totally different VFT module conformations, with their closed-closed conformation presenting some characteristics of the active state. Combined with the observations that the B-C helix of CaSR<sup>Icc</sup>, CaSR<sup>Ioc</sup> and CaSR<sup>Ioo</sup> states are the same as that of the active state and that closed conformation of VFT is a feature of the active state, it is likely that the recently reported CaSR<sup>Icc</sup>, CaSR<sup>Ioc</sup> and CaSR<sup>Ioo</sup> states are several different intermediate states during activation.</p><p>We have reported that the crystal structure of CaSR-ECD in the open-open state has the same B-C helix angle as that of the active state. We designated this as an intermediate state (CaSR-ECD<sup>Ioo</sup>) in the manuscript. It is possible that the full inactive state of CasR is in fact several populations which are difficult to capture. The inhibition with NB-2D11 captures the CaSR in its resting open-open state and inhibits the activity of CaSR, indicating that this conformation is a full inactive state of CaSR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors propose a Calcium binding site that corresponds to one proposed to be essential for CaSR activation by Liu et al., (PNAS 2020), based on models, mutagenesis, and the use of a conformational FRET-based sensor.

We have discussed our newly found calcium binding site with the one that was proposed by Liu et al<italic>.,</italic> (PNAS 2020) in the text.</p><p>Liu et al<italic>.,</italic> modeled two functional calcium binding sites in L-amino acid binding cleft and verified that these two binding sites are important for the activation of CaSR using conformational FRET-based sensor and intracellular calcium release assays. Their calcium binding site 1 is composed of S170, D190, Q193, Y218, and E297. Our newly defined bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is primarily coordinated with the side chains of D190 and E297, the carbonyl oxygen atoms of P188 backbone, and the hydroxyl groups of S170 and Y489. Among them, P188, D190 and S170 are located at LB1 domain, while E297 and Y489 are presented at LB2 domain (Figure 3C, D). The main binding residues S170 and D190 from LB1 and E297 from LB2 are consistent with findings by Liu et al.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the maps provided by cryo-EM images are insufficient to ensure that the observed density corresponds to a Calcium. We assume that the density represents the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> based on the following reasons. First, from its hexavalent coordination (the coordinating residues P188, D190, S170 and E297, and Y489), this metal is most likely to be Ca<sup>2+</sup>, although another ion cannot be ruled out. Second, we prepared the CaSR sample in a purification buffer supplemented with 10mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and without any other bivalent cation, and then applied it for cryo-EM data collection. Third, the mutation of the coordinating residues significantly reduced the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in cells. Fourth, the mutants of the residues (S147A) to bind L-amino acid also largely impaired the Ca<sup>2+</sup> effect (Geng et al., 2016), which indicates that there should be a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion near the L-amino acid because Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion activates CaSR through the L-amino acid.

The conformational heterogeneity of the interface of 7TMDs in the inactive state indicates that there is a possible dynamic equilibrium between the TM4-TM5 and TM5-TM6 interfaces. For other class C GPCRs, such as the mGluR5 and GABAB receptors, their 7TMDs rearrange from TM5-TM5 interface in the inactive state to TM6-TM6 interface in the active state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Published structures of CaSR-ECD demonstrate that agonist binding induces conformational changes of VFT model of CaSR, whereby two separate LB2 domains approach each other, forming a novel interface in the active state (Geng et al., 2016). Based these structural information, we introduced a potential N-linked glycosylation site on the contacting interface between LB2 domains in the active CaSR to block the interaction of LB2 domains and keep the CaSR in an inactive state. We made a double mutation R227N-E229S at the dimer interface of LB2 domain to introduce N-linked glycosylation at 227 residues site. We immunized two camels with the mutant of CaSR and generated nanobody phage display library. We performed two rounds of bio-panning on the mutant of CaSR, and used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to verify the nanobodies that specifically bound to CaSR. We performed intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux assay to determine whether screened nanobodies could stabilize CaSR in the inactive state. Out of several CaSR binders, NB-2D11 and NB88 significantly inhibited the activity of CaSR with IC<sub>50</sub> of 41.7 nM and 167.1 nM, respectively (Figure 1A, B). Using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) to measure binding kinetics, both nanobodies NB-2D11 and NB88 demonstrated high-affinity binding to CaSR with K<sub>D</sub> of 0.24 nM and 3.9 nM, respectively (Figure 1C, D). We then selected NB-2D11, which has a greater binding affinity of the two nanobodies, for structural study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The recent full length structures revealed three possible inactive states, the VFT dimer in the resting closed closed (Rcc), Resting open closed (Rco) or resting open-open (Roo). Here, the authors report a conformation corresponding to the Roo state that corresponds to the inactive state of mGluR VFTs, but they do not provide a clear demonstration that this is indeed the case. One argument that can be used is based on the work by Liu et al., (2020) that show that the CaSR receptor VFT dimer undergoes a similar change in its orientation during activation, as that of the mGlu receptors. Another argument will be the analysis of the functional effect of the identified nanobody. It is shown to inhibit the receptor activity (Figure 5b), but can a constitutive activity of the CaSR receptor resulting from the other resting conformation be detected?

Using a well-controlled assay, Liu et al. (2020) reported that Ca ions are sufficient to activate the CaSR, even in the absence of L-AA, such that Ca ion can be considered as the agonist of the CaSR. In contrast, any tested L-AA did not activate the receptor, but largely potentiated the Ca effect, such that these L-AA should be considered as PAMs of the CaSR. This must be clarified in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s question is very important. It is also a problem that has puzzled me and made me think for several years.</p><p>Liu et al<italic>.,</italic> (2020) reported that Ca<sup>2+</sup> are sufficient to activate the CaSR using a well-controlled assay, even in the absence of L-AA, such that Ca<sup>2+</sup> can be considered as the agonist of the CaSR.</p><p>At present, the prevailing view is that the principal agonist of CaSR is extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Hofer and Brown, 2003). The L-amino acids, such as L-Trp, can enhance the sensitivity of CaSR toward Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions (Conigrave et al., 2000), and are considered as positive allosteric modulators of the receptor (Saidak et al., 2009). However, as L-amino acids or their analogs are endogenous agonists of other class C GPCRs, this is somewhat inconsistent from the perspective of GPCR classification and evolution. Previous studies have also shown that if Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is higher than the threshold of 0.5mM, L-amino acid can activate the receptor (Conigrave et al., 2004; Conigrave et al., 2000; Rey et al., 2005; Young and Rozengurt, 2002). Therefore, it suggested that Ca<sup>2+</sup> and L-amino acid can act as co-agonists of the receptor (Conigrave et al., 2000; Young and Rozengurt, 2002). Using single-cell intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> microfluorimetry, L-Trp has been shown to directly stimulate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in cells stably expressing CaSR, with its efficacy and potency increase with increases in concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, hence providing direct evidence that L-amino acids are agonists of CaSR (Geng et al., 2016). However, this view has yet to be widely accepted because it is difficult to observe L-amino acids directly activating CaSR. The mode of action of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion and L-amino acids on CaSR remains controversial.</p><p>A few years ago, when we prepared human CaSR samples without L-amino acid for crystallization, we obtained crystal structure of CaSR ECD with a stretch of continuous density in the interdomain cleft. Unfortunately, we were not able to identify the structure of this ligand (Geng et al., 2016). Zhang et al., (2016) solved the crystal structure of human CaSR-ECD in absence of L-AA, and found density at the interdomain cleft, too. It was identified as TNCA. Moreover, they found that TNCA had a high affinity for CaSR and potentiated Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity (Zhang et al., 2016). Ling et al., (2021) found a clear extra density in both VFT domain of both structures of CaSR<sup>Icc</sup> and CaSR<sup>Ca</sup> in the absence of L-amino acid. It indicated that ambient L-amino acids (or L-amino acid derivative, such as TNCA) had bound to CaSR as an endogenous ligand (Ling et al., 2021). Our agonist +PAM bound structure shows that TNCA and a newly identified Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion bind at the interdomain cleft of the VFT module, and they both interact with both LB1 and LB2 domains to facilitate extracellular domain closure (Figure 3A), therefore forming the closed state of the ligand binding domain required for CaSR activation. This indicates that both TNCA and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion contribute to the activation of CaSR. TNCA and the bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> share three common binding residues S170 and D190 of LB1 domain and E297 from LB2 domain (Figure 3E, F), which suggest that the CaSR is synergistically activated by TNCA and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions.</p><p>Our experiments have shown that TNCA directly stimulate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in cells stably expressing CaSR (Figure 3G), suggesting that TNCA are agonists of CaSR. The structure of CaSR shows that TNCA binds at the cleft between LB1 and LB2 domains, which is the conserved ligand binding site for all class C GPCR agonists (Geng et al., 2013; Geng et al., 2016; Kunishima et al., 2000; Muto et al., 2007; Tsuchiya et al., 2002), and TNCA has a binding pattern similar to that of the endogenous agonists of mGluR and GABAB receptors (Figure 3D) (Geng et al., 2016). The key coordination residues are very conserved, such as S147 and S170 (Geng et al., 2013; Geng et al., 2016; Kunishima et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2016). Moreover, TNCA (or L-Trp) interact with residues from LB1 and LB2 to stabilize the closure of VFT, and the signal mutation of the contacting residues (T145I, S147A, S170A, Y218S, E297K) substantially reduce the function of the receptor, even if some of these residues (S147A, T145I and Y218S) are not related to the coordinating residues of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, hence indicating that TNCA or L-Trp plays a key role in the activation of CaSR (Geng et al., 2016). In addition, Ling <italic>et al.</italic> (2021) tried to determine the cryo-EM structures of CaSR in the presence of a high concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to address the question of whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions alone can activate CaSR in the absence of L-Trp. Three different 3D models were obtained, in which the VFT adopted closed-closed, closed-open and open-open conformations. They observed densities located at the interdomain crevice of the VFT module in the closed state. They suggested that L-amino acids or its derivate is bound to CaSR, because the densities were much larger than that of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion. However, they did not obtain the closed conformation of VFT containing only Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion between the cleft (Ling et al., 2021). The results indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion alone is not enough to induce the closure of the VFT module even in the presence of a high concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion, and L-amino acid or its derivate is required to stabilize the closed conformation of VFT module. Altogether, L-amino acids are the endogenous agonists of CaSR, in agreement with that of other class C GPCRs.</p><p>Three different groups prepared CaSR samples without L-amino acids or derivatives for crystal or cryo-EM structural study, but they all unexpectedly obtained the active structure of CaSR or CaSR ECD with the closed-closed conformation of VFT module containing undefined ligands (Geng et al., 2016; Ling et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2016). The ligand was identified as TNCA, which had a high affinity for CaSR and potentiated Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity (Zhang et al., 2016). As we all know, it takes a long time to purify CaSR in TNCA-free buffer for structural study, nevertheless, the endogenous TNCA would still bind to CaSR. This indicates that TNCA has a high affinity for CaSR or that it is buried in closed VFT module such that it is difficult to be washed off.</p><p>Gentle washing is impossible to remove TNCA bound to CaSR in various function assays. In the absence of TNCA (or L-amino acid), it is possible that TNCA would still bind to CaSR to stabilize the closed conformation of VFT, although the control assay is well done. Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions seem to directly activate the CaSR alone.</p><p>We speculate that as the endogenous TNCA exists and is difficult to be replaced by other added L-amino acids, it is challenging to observe the direct activation of other L-amino acids, or the observed allosteric regulation is also a comprehensive result when we performed function assay. These highlight the need for further experiments investigating the kinetics and dynamics of L-amino acid or TNCA binding to CaSR to strengthen our findings, however, such the magnitude of the experiments involved are beyond the scope of the current paper.</p><p>In addition to the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion binding at the cleft of VFT module discussed above to stabilize the closed conformation of VFT, another role of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions should be considered, in which Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is coordinated by D234, E231 and G557, and bridges the LB2 domain of one subunit and CR domain of the second domain. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion facilitates the formation of the active conformation of CaSR, which is the reason that the L-amino acids (or TNCA) activate CaSR in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion above the threshold concentration of 0.5mM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6 – The intermediate state presented should be better explain in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have discussed and explained in detail the intermediate state in the Results section. Based on the rotation of the angles of B-C Helix during the activation of CaSR as discussed above (response to Essential Revisions #3), the orientation of the LB1-LB1 dimer interface of the open-open conformation of CaSR<sub>ECD</sub> crystal structure is similar to that of agonist+PAM bound state, which is different from that of our full inactive state of CaSR, indicating that the open-open conformation of CaSR<sub>ECD</sub> crystal structure presents some characteristics of the conformation of the active state. In addition, the superimposition of different state of VFT domain shows that the distances between C-termini of VFT domain of CaSR gradually decreases from the full active state to active state. The distance between C-termini of VFT domains of the open-open conformation of CaSR<sub>ECD</sub> crystal structure is between full inactive and active states. Therefore, we defined the open-open conformation of CaSR<sub>ECD</sub> crystal structure as one of the intermediate states that are ready for binding of L-AA and calcium ions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7 – Please be more specific in Figure 4 on how the distances between the C-termini of the VFTs were measured.

We compare our inactive open-open conformation with the recently published inactive closed-closed conformation, which revealed a similar CR domain and 7TM domain that is separated in these inactive states, but the VFT module reveal the totally different conformation, the closed-closed conformation of their structure presents some characteristics of the active state. It indicates that the CaSR in the inactive state has conformational heterogeneity. In other words, it suggests that in addition to the full inactive state and the active state, there are multiple intermediate states in the process of activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also I would recommend the authors to go through the manuscript again and to double check typos and grammatical errors.
