role in nascent sensory processing in neocortex. To better understand how heterogeneity within this population relates to emergent function, we investigated the synaptic connectivity of <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs through the first postnatal week in whisker somatosensory cortex (S1BF). These SPNs comprise of two morphological subtypes: fusiform SPNs with local axons and pyramidal SPNs with axons that extend through the marginal zone. The former receive translaminar synaptic input up until the emergence of the whisker barrels, a timepoint coincident with significant cell death. In contrast, pyramidal SPNs receive local input from the subplate at early ages but then – during the later time window – acquire input from overlying cortex. Combined electrical and optogenetic activation of thalamic afferents identified that <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs receive sparse thalamic innervation. These data reveal components of the postnatal network that interpret sparse thalamic input to direct the emergent columnar structure of S1BF.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neocortex</kwd><kwd>neural development</kwd><kwd>subplate</kwd><kwd>neural circuits</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>laser scanning photostimulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>215199/Z/19/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghezzi</surname><given-names>Filippo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>086362/Z/08/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marques-Smith</surname><given-names>Andre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K004387/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Butt</surname><given-names>Simon JB</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDA0023/2008-C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Butt</surname><given-names>Simon JB</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19079</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Butt</surname><given-names>Simon JB</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>089286/Z/09/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Butt</surname><given-names>Simon JB</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combined developmental genetics, electrophysiology, and optical approach identify two distinct and dynamic components of the developing neuronal circuit that relay and interpret thalamic input in primary sensory neocortex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The emergence of function in the developing mammalian cerebral cortex is dependent on a diverse range of genetic and physiological processes that sculpt emergent network architecture. Fundamental research in animal models has revealed that transient neuronal circuits, observed in a restricted time window during early postnatal development, are a common feature of many cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanold and Luhmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marques-Smith et al., 2016</xref>). One of the first such transient circuits to be identified was that between subplate neurons (SPNs) and thalamo-recipient spiny stellate cells in layer (L)4, a circuit demonstrated to play a role in the maturation of thalamocortical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanold and Luhmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kanold et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tolner et al., 2012</xref>). The subplate is a transient layer in the developing neocortex located between the emergent cortical plate and the underlying white matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kostovic and Rakic, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoerder-Suabedissen et al., 2015</xref>). It contains a diverse population of neuronal subtypes that differ in term of molecular markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnár, 2013</xref>), morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marx and Feldmeyer, 2013</xref>), neurotransmitter identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boon et al., 2019</xref>), and connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Viswanathan et al., 2012</xref>). Electrophysiological studies performed in primary sensory areas suggest that SPNs are relatively mature when compared to cortical neurons in the more superficial cortical plate early in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marx and Feldmeyer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luhmann et al., 2000</xref>). As such they are regarded as key mediators of early spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tolner et al., 2012</xref>) and direct circuit maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanold and Luhmann, 2010</xref>). While a large proportion of SPNs undergo programmed cell death during the first postnatal week in the mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnár, 2013</xref>), the surviving SPNs form a thin, compact structure below L6, termed L6b in mature neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marx et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zolnik et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The canonical role of SPNs is to support the establishment of thalamocortical synapses onto L4 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanold and Luhmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kanold et al., 2003</xref>). In support of this model, previous studies have reported that SPNs receive thalamocortical input prior to innervation of L4 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kanold et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friauf and Shatz, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Molnár et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Higashi et al., 2002</xref>). In turn, SPNs are proposed to form feed-forward connections onto thalamo-recipient L4 neurons in a transient circuit that is eliminated upon establishment of the mature thalamocortical connectivity in L4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Viswanathan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hanganu et al., 2002</xref>). It was proposed that, by relaying thalamic inputs to L4 through SPNs, this connectivity pattern supports developmental plasticity mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kanold and Shatz, 2006</xref>) prior to the appearance of the definitive cortical architecture in primary sensory areas, e.g. ocular dominance in primary visual cortex (V1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kanold et al., 2003</xref>), barrel field formation in primary somatosensory cortex (S1BF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tolner et al., 2012</xref>), and tonotopic organisation in the primary auditory cortex (A1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wess et al., 2017</xref>). In parallel, SPNs also promote the maturation of cortical GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kanold and Shatz, 2006</xref>), pioneer cortico-thalamic projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McConnell et al., 1989</xref>), secrete proteins that control extracellular matrix composition, attract and guide thalamocortical fibres, regulate plasticity and myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kondo et al., 2015</xref>), and control the radial migration of cortical neurons at embryonic ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ohtaka-Maruyama et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>However, a number of unresolved questions remain regarding SPN function in neonatal cortex: first, it remains unclear how physiological, morphological, and molecular heterogeneity of SPNs contributes to these various roles. While previous studies performed in A1 have identified two distinct physiological populations of SPN – those that receive feedback glutamatergic input from L4 and a second cohort that only receives local input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Viswanathan et al., 2012</xref>) – this has not been explicitly linked to SPN identity per se. To this end, we have focused on a specific, genetically defined SPN population – labeled by the <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnár, 2013</xref>) to understand to what extent this population represents a homogeneous subtype of SPN and better resolve the role of these cells in neonatal somatosensory cortex. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that while thalamic input is a determinant of columnar organization in late embryonic somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antón-Bolaños et al., 2019</xref>), such activity pre-dates the transition to the mature cytoarchitecture and columnar signalling unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dupont et al., 2006</xref>). We sought to understand the role that <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPN circuits have in interpreting such information through the first week of postnatal life up until the end of the layer 4 critical period for plasticity (CPP) at around postnatal day (P)8 in the barrel field of mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1BF). We demonstrated that <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs represent two distinct subtypes: (1) transient (&lt;P5) fusiform SPNs that receive columnar input from the more superficial cortical plate but whose axons and therefore output are restricted to the SP syncytium, and (2) pyramidal SPNs that are found throughout the time period recorded (≤P8), which only receive local input from the SP network prior to P5 but whose axons traverse the full extent of the cortical plate to ramify extensively through the marginal zone. Finally, we identify that thalamic input onto <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs in S1BF is sparse throughout early postnatal life. We propose that fusiform <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs are ideally placed to interpret and amplify sparse thalamic input alongside emergent signalling from the cortical plate, thereby providing a template – through their innervation of other SPNs including the <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> pyramidal subtype – for the columnar circuit assembly up until the emergence of whisker barrels in L4 at ~P4–P5. Our data suggest that <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs do not adhere to the canonical role reported for SPNs in primary sensory cortex, and support the idea that SPNs have a variety of ways of assisting cortical circuit construction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Intrinsic electrophysiological and morphological diversity of <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs</title><p><italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs form a layer of two to three cells deep adjacent to the white matter tract in neonatal S1BF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). As a first pass to understanding the contribution of these neurons to neonatal circuits of S1BF, we recorded the intrinsic electrophysiological profiles of 103 SPNs from postnatal day (P) 1–8. We established that SPNs had an intrinsic electrophysiological profile consistent with regular firing pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>) by injecting both depolarising and hyperpolarising current steps (500 ms) of increasing amplitude into cells recorded at resting membrane potential in current clamp configuration. Analysis of passive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–f</xref>) and active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g–i</xref>) properties revealed a progressive maturation of intrinsic properties across the ages tested broadly in line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hanganu et al., 2002</xref>). Specifically, we observed a statistically significant decrease in input resistance (R<sub>IN</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) and membrane time constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), as well as increase in rheobase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>), spike amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>), and maximum firing frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>) over development.

In total, we recovered 58 morphologies of 103 recorded SPNs that showed complete or near complete preservation of both axonal and dendritic arbor. It was evident from our reconstruction of 19 of these cells that <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs fell into two categories based on dendritic arbor and, specifically, the presence or absence of an apical dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>): (1) pyramidal-like SPNs with a prominent apical dendrite projecting into L6a and (2) fusiform SPNs that lacked an apical dendrite but instead exhibited bitufted dendrites that extended horizontally in the subplate and white matter tract. With the former, it was evident that the apical dendrite did not always extend perpendicular to the subplate as further revealed by analysis of the directionality of dendritic arbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Overlaying the axonal arbor of reconstructed morphologies revealed a further difference between these two populations: the axon of pyramidal SPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) ascended through the overlying cortex, with majority of cells projecting to the marginal zone/L1 (n = 9/12 cells, with the remaining three axons severed in L2). All of these cells had axonal collaterals – sometimes extensive – projecting within the subplate (SP/L6b) or adjacent L6a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). In contrast, the axon of fusiform cells was largely restricted to the SP with a few collaterals extending into L6a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) and no axon projecting to more superficial layers (n = 7/7 cells). Both cell types had extensive, but relatively simple, axonal arbors that often extended beyond the field of the low power photomicrograph either through L1 (pyramidal) or SP (fusiform). It was evident that these long-range projections extended beyond S1BF to adjacent cortical areas such as secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). Morphologies were recovered across all recorded ages; however, the proportion of fusiform cells decreased from P5 onward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). Previous analysis of the neurotransmitter phenotype of <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs was conducted at P7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnár, 2013</xref>), a time point when fusiform SPNs are no longer present in our sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). To explore the possibility that these cells represent a transient GABAergic SP population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qu et al., 2016</xref>), we performed immunohistochemistry for GABA at P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). This confirmed that EGFP+ cells in the SP were all GABA-negative (0/79 Lpar1-EGFP SPNs co-expressed GABA), while the vast majority (84%; 16/19) of EGFP+ profiles in L5 were GABA+, consistent with our previous characterisation of the SP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnár, 2013</xref>) and L5b interneuron populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marques-Smith et al., 2016</xref>). These data identify <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs as glutamatergic projection neurons that fall into two subtypes based on their morphology: (1) fusiform cells that innervate the SP and (2) pyramidal cells whose axons extend through the entire depth of the developing cortex to ramify extensively through the margin zone/L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). We found no evidence of selectively targeted axonal innervation of L4 by either subtype at the ages recorded. However, we cannot discount innervation of L4 glutamatergic spiny stellate neurons via their apical dendrites extending to L1, which transiently exist prior to the end of the first postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Callaway and Borrell, 2011</xref>). Finally, these data suggest that the fusiform population of <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPN is a transient population of EGFP+ SPN not present in mature cortex.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Two distinct morphologies of Lpar1-EGFP SPNs in S1BF.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Streptavidin labeled morphologies of 2 EGFP+ SPNs recorded at P3; arrowhead, pyramidal subtypes with apical dendrite projecting at ~45° into L6a; arrow, fusiform morphology with horizontal, bitufted dendrites largely restricted to the SP (scale bar = 25 μm).

Recovered morphologies of SPNs mapped from P1 to P4 (n = 15) revealed that all the SPNs, which received translaminar input, were of the fusiform subtype (n = 6). Two further fusiform and seven pyramidal SPNs received local input. Of the 12 SPN morphologies recovered from P5 to P8, 9 cells received local glutamatergic input. These were all of the pyramidal subtype with the exception of the only fusiform morphology recovered from ourLSPS experiments during this later window. The remaining three pyramidal SPNs received translaminar input from L5. Taken together these data suggest that transient fusiform SPNs are the primary recipients of early translaminar input from the cortical plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>), up until P4 when they become less apparent in our sample. In parallel, pyramidal SPNs are dominated by local glutamatergic input from SP/L6a at early ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>), but acquire varied translaminar input from more superficial layers from P5 onward.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Increased cell death in subplate and adjacent cortical layers at the P4–5 transition</title><p>SPNs are regarded as a transient neuronal population, but direct evidence in support of SPN programmed cell death is limited in murine models. One possible explanation is that rapid clearance of apoptotic neurons in the developing rodent brain might preclude histological identification of dying cells. Our morphological and LSPS data point to a possible 24 hr period from P4 to P5 during a change in the make up of <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs. To test whether this is due to cell death, we performed immunohistochemistry at P3–4 and P5–6 to assess (1) the density of EGFP+ cells, (2) expression of the apoptotic marker cleaved Caspase-3 (Casp-3+), (3) pyknotic nuclei as evidenced by DAPI staining, and (4) TUNEL staining to detect DNA breaks, in <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs across these two time windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Caspase-3 staining was sparse at both time points but associated with pyknotic nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>). At P3–4, Casp-3+ cells were largely restricted to the white matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), whereas at P5–6, they were more widely distributed including in the SP. That said, we found only a couple of double-positive EGFP+/Casp-3+ SPNs (n = 2/420 cells; five animals) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). EGFP+ cells with pyknotic nuclei were however more evident, but the percentage of EGFP+ cells with pyknotic nuclei did not differ between the two time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), despite there being a significant decrease in the density of EGFP+ SPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). To further examine the latter observation, we performed a TUNEL stain as an alternative means of visualizing apoptotic cells. This revealed a similar pattern of programmed cell death to our Casp-3 experiments, in that TUNEL+ cells were primarily located in the white matter at P3–4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). However, at P5–6, we observed a significant increase in TUNEL+ profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>) that included <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f,g</xref>). Moreover, it was evident that this increase was not restricted to the subplate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), so we further quantified the density of TUNEL+ profiles across the white matter, subplate, and adjacent infragranular layers at both time points, analysis that identified a surge in cell death at this later time point across the cortical layers sampled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). Overall, this suggests that while a small proportion of <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs undergo cell death at the transition between P4 and P5, this is not specific to subplate and likely represents a wider reconfiguration of the circuit at the transition to columnar signalling in S1BF at this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dupont et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cell death increases during the postnatal day (P)5–6 window but is not confined to the subplate.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Immunohistochemistry for cleaved Caspase-3 (Casp-3) and EGFP in subplate (SP) at P4; scale bar: 25 μm.

Prior to P5, SPNs with local (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) and translaminar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) input were evident in similar numbers with the latter receiving prominent columnar input from L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b,d,e</xref>).

Electrical stimulation evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in the majority (76%) of SPNs recorded across the time window studied, although there was a drop in incidence between the P1–4 and P5–8 (chi-square test X<sup>2</sup> (1, N = 56) = 5.364, p = 0.021) time windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>); an absence of thalamic input onto any given SPN was only recorded if TC-EPSCs were observed in other SPNs or layer four neurons in the same thalamocortical slice.

To validate our optogenetic strategy at early postnatal ages, we first recorded from thalamic relay neurons in <italic>Lpar1-EGFP;Olig3 Cre;Ai32</italic> mice and established that we could evoke (1) reliable inward currents in whole-cell patch-clamp mode in response to blue, 470 nm light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7h</xref>, top panel), and (2) time-locked action potentials in cell-attached mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7h</xref>, bottom panel) from the earliest time points recorded (P1) (n=5 VB cells). We then recorded <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs and tested for TC-EPSCs using both electrical and light stimulation protocols. Across the whole time window tested (P1–8), we obtained recordings under both stimulation protocols in 19 EGFP+ cells. Of these, nine cells across all ages tested (P1–8) had short latency, low jitter (&lt;1 ms) EPSCs in response to electrical stimulation (types 1 and 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7i</xref>). However, only two cells (11% of <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs), with properties consistent with type 1 EPSCs, exhibited responses to both 470 nm light and electrical stimulation; no EGFP+ cells showed synaptic responses to light alone. To establish whether sparse thalamocortical connectivity is a property of the <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> subtypes alone, we then recorded from non-EGFP+ SPNs. Using our combined electrical and optogenetic stimulation strategy, we identified thalamic input onto only 3 of 15 (27%) non-EGFP+ SPNs in the P1–4 time window. We therefore believe that the majority of EPSCs observed after electrical stimulation, termed type two here, arise from antidromic activation of cortico-thalamic projection neurons. Taken together these data suggest that <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs in S1BF receive both thalamic and cortico-thalamic input in the first postnatal week, but that the former is relatively sparse, contacting only a small subset of the total population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have recorded from a genetically identified population of SPN through the first postnatal week to establish the contribution of this cell type to early circuits of somatosensory whisker barrel cortex (S1BF). Our data reveal that the <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPN population comprises two distinct subtypes with different somatodendritic morphologies and afferent input throughout the first four postnatal days (P1–4): first, pyramidal SPNs that receive primarily local input at this stage from the subplate (SP) network, but whose axons traverse across all the layers of cortex to project horizontally via layer 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). Second, fusiform SPNs that receive translaminar input from more superficial cortical layers, but whose axons are largely confined to the immediate layer and therefore output to the SP network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). Fusiform SPNs receive glutamatergic input from the cortical plate, including putative layer 4, as well as GABAergic input from infragranular SST+ interneurons; two signalling centres that form reciprocal connections through the L4 critical period of plasticity in S1BF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marques-Smith et al., 2016</xref>). During the later period (P5–8), the onset of which coincides with an increase in cell death across cortical layers, fusiform cells are encountered in significantly reduced numbers – indeed are absent in the P7–8 window. The remaining pyramidal SPNs are evenly split between those that are still dominated by local inputs and those that acquire an array of diverse inputs from across cortical layers, located both in the immediate and adjacent cortical columns. This diversification of synaptic input fits with the rapid transition to columnar signalling previously reported at P5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dupont et al., 2006</xref>) and suggests that this time point represents the switch from transient SP to layer 6b (L6b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zolnik et al., 2020</xref>) in S1BF.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for Lpar1-EGFP SPN circuits in early postnatal cortex.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Pyramidal Lpar1-EGFP SPNs received broad glutamatergic (grey neurons) and GABAergic (black) input from the subplate zone.

We have tested thalamic engagement with <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs using combined electrical and optogenetic stimulation of thalamic afferent fibres and found that the incidence of connectivity onto postnatal <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs to be as low as 11% in thalamocortical slices that otherwise showed good preservation of connectivity. This is at odds with a number of previous studies reliant exclusively on electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hanganu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friauf et al., 1990</xref>), which obtained levels of connectivity approaching our initial electrical stimulation paradigm. Recordings from non-<italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs suggest that this is not a property of this genetically defined population alone. As such, it is definitely worth revisiting perinatal thalamic engagement with the cortex using optogenetic approaches given that conditional expression of ChR2 in thalamic nuclei allows unequivocal discrimination of thalamocortical versus corticothalamic input without possible antidromic activation. Differences in the level of thalamic engagement aside, our data are consistent with the model that thalamic input is amplified via the subplate network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luhmann et al., 2009</xref>) and onward communicated via pyramidal SPNs to more superficial layers of cortex via layer 1. Indeed, our study builds on a number of studies that advanced our understanding of the role of subplate from a simple staging post for initial thalamic innervation to a critical mediator of plasticity and amplifier of thalamic input, a role that is fulfilled by two distinct morphological subtypes. However, how this amplified signal is relayed to the overlying cortex is unclear beyond that it is likely mediated by the pyramidal subtype with axons ramifying in the marginal zone. None of our recovered morphologies suggest dense innervation of L4 per se by this particular genetically defined subpopulation of SPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friauf et al., 1990</xref>). Indeed, this and our extensive mapping of S1BF using LSPS through early postnatal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anastasiades et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anastasiades and Butt, 2012</xref>) provide little evidence that there is a privileged route of connectivity between SP and L4 for a protracted period during early postnatal life in this primary sensory area, in contrast to other sensory modalities.</p><p>We targeted a genetically defined population of SPN using the <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> transgenic mouse line (GENSAT). Lpar1 (Edg2) is one of a number of markers previously shown to delineate SPN diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnár, 2013</xref>), with the cohort labeled by this line one of the earliest born subtypes with peak neurogenesis at embryonic day (E)11.5. EGFP expression is evident in this population at embryonic ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnár, 2013</xref>), increasing to label both SP and non-SP neurons by the end of the first postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marques-Smith et al., 2016</xref>). This reported increase in strength of EGFP expression in SPNs through early postnatal life would seem to preclude the possibility that the fusiform SPN subtype down-regulate EGFP at P5. The most parsimonious explanation – that reconciles our observation of fusiform <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> cells as a ‘classical’ transient SPN population with the fact that there is no significant decrease in the number of EGFP+ SPNs over this time window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnár, 2013</xref>) – is that this subtype represent only a small fraction of the EGFP+ SPN number. Our observed increase in the prevalence of the pyramidal subtype of EGFP+ SPNs over development has been documented by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marx et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, the <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> transgenic line is an excellent tool for targeting and recording these two morphological variants of SPN. However, our knowledge of the efferent targets of these cells is, in absence of a conditional genetic strategy, limited to a purely morphological assessment. Alternative genetic approaches such as CRE-DOG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tang et al., 2015</xref>) although useful to researchers targeting EGFP+ neuronal populations in the adult cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Naka et al., 2019</xref>) do not provide a viable means of targeting the <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> cells within the first postnatal week. What is evident from our analysis is that the two subtypes present in the earlier time window target completely different layers within the developing cortical plate, highly suggestive of different roles within the early circuitry of S1BF.</p><p>LSPS has been used previously in conjunction with glutamate uncaging to probe the early SP circuits of primary auditory cortex (A1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Viswanathan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>). Similar to these reports, we find SPNs that receive local and translaminar input. However, the temporal dynamics of the connections that we observe in S1BF, notably the early afferent input from L4, are quite different to those reported for A1 wherein L4 input emerges in the second postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Viswanathan et al., 2012</xref>). This disparity in timing could underpin differences in the role of SP in circuit maturation between sensory areas and suggests that the cytoarchitecture of sensory areas differs from the outset.</p><p>In recent years, optical approaches have extended our knowledge of the early circuit of somatosensory cortex. It is evident that prenatal spontaneous thalamic activity plays an instrumental role in determining the columnar organization of S1BF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antón-Bolaños et al., 2019</xref>). Shortly before birth thalamic afferent fibres are restricted to the subplate and thalamic stimulation elicits activity that spreads laterally through this and immediate adjacent infragranular layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Higashi et al., 2002</xref>). It is possible that at these early ages thalamic innervation of SPNs is widespread in S1BF and that the role of such spontaneous activity is to competitively select the sparse SPNs that will maintain thalamic innervation into the first few postnatal days, a time point by which sensory activity has already transitioned to the overlying cortical layers in S1BF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Antón-Bolaños et al., 2019</xref>). Our data suggest that <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> pyramidal SPNs are likely conduits for such activity, recruiting pyramidal cells and GABAergic interneurons in more superficial cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friauf and Shatz, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Che et al., 2018</xref>) via their L1 axon collaterals. In turn, neurons in the superficial cortical layers provide feedback columnar glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic input onto transient fusiform SPNs thus completing the circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). This indirect mechanism could provide the necessary framework for the interpretation of early thalamic signals resulting in columnar organisation. Indeed, such a mechanism coupled with the sparse nature of thalamic engagement with the subplate represents a plausible substrate to ensure the emergence of spatially distinct columnar circuits in S1BF. Moreover, relay of thalamic input via L1 moves away from a L4-centric view of early thalamic engagement, more in line with distributed thalamocortical input across all six layers of neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feldmeyer et al., 2013</xref>). Our findings provide insight into the earliest neuronal networks of somatosensory cortex, highlighting transient glutamatergic and GABAergic circuits that are essential for the emergence of normal perception.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, male)</td><td><italic>Tg(Lpar1-EGFP)GX193Gsat</italic></td><td>GENSAT Project at Rockefeller University</td><td>MGI:4847204; transgene insertion GX193</td><td>Y Chromo- some linked</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>, mixed sex)</td><td><italic>Sst<sup>tm2.1(cre)Zjh</sup>/J</italic></td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Stock No: 013044; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:013044">IMSR_JAX:013044</ext-link></td><td>Maintained in Butt lab on C57BL/6 background</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>, mixed sex)</td><td><italic>Olig3<sup>tm1(cre)Ynka</sup></italic></td><td>Prof. Yasushi Nakagawa <break/>University Minnesota</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>, mixed sex)</td><td>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm32(CAG-COP4*H134R/</sup><italic><sup>EYFP)Hze</sup> /J</italic></td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Stock No: 012569; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:012569">IMSR_JAX:012569</ext-link></td><td>Maintained in Butt lab on C57BL/6 background</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>, mixed sex)</td><td><italic>R26::P2x2r-EGFP</italic> (floxed-stop-rat P2x2 receptor)</td><td>Prof. Gero Miesenböck (Oxford)</td><td/><td>Maintained in Butt lab on C57BL/6 background</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Chicken anti-GFP <break/>(polyclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab13970 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_300798">AB_300798</ext-link></td><td>(1:250)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit anti-GABA (polyclonal)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat# A2052, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_477652">AB_477652</ext-link></td><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Guinea-pig anti-GABA (polyclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab17413 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_443865">AB_443865</ext-link></td><td>(1:1500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit anti-Caspase three antibody, active (cleaved) form (polyclonal)</td><td>Merck Millipore</td><td>AB3623 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_91556">AB_91556</ext-link></td><td>(1:200)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat anti-Chicken, Alexa Fluor 488 (polyclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab150169 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2636803">AB_2636803</ext-link></td><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat anti-Rabbit, Alexa Fluor 546 (polyclonal)</td><td>Thermo-Fisher</td><td>A11035 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_143051">AB_143051</ext-link></td><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, TMR red</td><td>Roche, <break/>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>SKU: 12156792910; <break/>Lot #: 45197500</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>NaCl; <break/>KCl; <break/>NaHCO<sub>3</sub>; <break/>NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>; <break/>MgCl<sub>2</sub>; <break/>CaCl<sub>2</sub>; <break/>K-gluconate; <break/>Li-GTP; <break/>Mg-ATP; <break/>HEPES; <break/>Gluconic acid; <break/>EGTA; <break/>SrCl<sub>2</sub></td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>S7653 <break/>P4504 <break/>S6014 <break/>S3139 <break/>M2670 <break/>22,350–6 <break/>G4500 <break/>G5884 <break/>A9187 <break/>H3375 <break/>G1951 <break/>E4378 <break/>204463</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>MNI-caged glutamate</td><td>Tocris Bioscience UK</td><td>Cat.

LSPS was performed using an ultraviolet (UV) laser (DSPL-355/30) and a galvanometer targeting system (UGA-42, Rapp Optoelectronic GmbH, Germany) focused through a 10× Olympus objective. The stimulation grid was organised into 17 × 9 target spots (~50 µm spatial resolution). Long-duration (100 ms), low-power (&lt;2 mW at sample plane) laser pulses were fired in a pseudo-random order at 1–2 Hz frequency. In order to cover the whole extent of the cortical column, two to three LSPS grids were sequentially employed and properly aligned and averaged offline during data analysis. For each individual LSPS grid, a minimum of three runs were obtained and averaged.</p><p>Electrophysiological current traces were analysed with Minianalysis 6.0 (Synaptosoft Inc) to extrapolate amplitude and onset time of all IPSCs or EPSCs recorded. Direct responses to glutamate were identified by their short latency and slow onset kinetics (time to peak ~100 ms) and excluded from subsequent analysis. Only EPSCs characterised by fast onset kinetics were considered for further analysis if they occurred within the putative detection window for monosynaptic events, determined according to previously published criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anastasiades and Butt, 2012</xref>). For each laser spot of the grid, all events whose onset fell within this detection window were summed and then averaged with values from different runs of the same experiment. Final heatmaps were built through a customised Matlab (Mathworks, USA) script. In order to allow the reconstruction of the layer profile on the input map, a photomicrograph of the grids relative to the slice preparation was acquired, and layer boundaries were manually determined. Normalised heatmaps were generated by dividing the value in each spot by the sum of all pixels. Linear profiles (layer and columnar) were obtained by summing all values for each line in individual heatmaps. Average maps were obtained by aligning each individual map to the SP/Layer 6a boundary and averaging corresponding pixels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> optogenetics stimulation</title><p>Optogenetic experiments were performed by conditionally expressing Channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2; via the <italic>Ai32</italic> reporter allele) in SST+ interneurons (using <italic>SST-ires-Cre</italic>) or thalamic relay neurons (using <italic>Olig3 Cre</italic>). Wide-field light stimulation was delivered through a 40× objective to focus blue (470 nm LED, CoolLED, UK) light onto the recorded cell. For each recorded SPN, two light stimulation duration pulses (1 and 10 ms) were employed at multiple LED power intensities to ensure that the minimal stimulation and full range of activation was captured irrespective of developmental age. For each LED pulse duration and intensity, five pulses were administered at a 20 s interval and the evoked postsynaptic current (PSC) recorded.</p><p>Data analysis was performed through a customised Matlab script. Light-evoked PSCs were analysed if their onset was detected within 25 ms from the onset of the light stimulus; the relatively long latency was used to account for developmental effects that may affect ChR2 expression. For events within the mono-synaptic detection window, multiple PSC features were extracted such as amplitude, latency, 10–90% rise time, and decay time constant (τ). In particular, the latency of the PSC was calculated from the onset of LED stimulation; the decay τ was found by fitting a mono-exponential curve to the decay phase of the PSC; percentage of PSC occurrence was calculated throughout the five sweeps at each LED intensity.</p><p>In a subset of experiments, recordings of light-evoked IPSCs from SST+ interneurons were performed in a modified HDC ACSF containing 4 mM SrCl<sub>2</sub> to replace CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Due to the slow onset of its effects, slices were bathed in Sr<sup>2+</sup>-containing HDC for a minimum of 20 min before light stimulation and data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gil et al., 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electrical stimulation of thalamic afferents</title><p>Thalamocortical (TC) afferent input to SPNs was tested using a bipolar microelectrode (Harvard Apparatus, UK) placed either in the ventrobasal nucleus (VB) of the thalamus or the internal capsule (IC) and connected to a current isolator (DS3, Digitimer Ltd, UK). The strength of the electrical stimulation was varied to find the minimal stimulation value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raastad et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Isaac et al., 1997</xref>), corresponding to EPSC evoked on ~50% of trials. The interstimulus interval was set at either 30 or 60 s depending on developmental age. TC-EPSCs were considered if calculated standard deviation (jitter) of the EPSC latency was &lt;1 ms at minimal stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Morphological reconstruction of recorded cells</title><p>Following electrophysiological assessment, slices containing biocytin-filled cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, PBS) overnight at 4°C. Slices were then rinsed in PBS and incubated in 0.05% PBST containing Streptavidin-Alexa568 (1:500; Molecular Probes, USA) for 48–72 hr at 4°C. Slices were then washed 3× 10 min in PBS and mounted on histology slides with Fluoromount (Sigma) mounting medium.</p><p>Slices were imaged through an Olympus FV1200 confocal microscope equipped with 10× or 20× dry objective. Z-stack images were acquired in order to maximise imaging of all neuronal processes containing biocytin to allow the offline morphological reconstruction. Image analysis was performed with Fiji-ImageJ software (NIH): confocal images of filled cells were selected for morphological reconstruction, performed using the Simple Neurite Tracer plugin. Dendrite directionality was calculated using the Directionality plugin implemented in Fiji-ImageJ onto reconstructed dendritic morphologies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL stain</title><p>Mice were terminally anesthetised with pentobarbital (90 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with 4% PFA in PBS. Dissected brains were incubated in PFA for 2 hr at 4°C and then cryoprotected in 20% sucrose for 24 hr at 4°C. Brains were then embedded into O.C.T. (VWR), frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80°C. Each brain was sectioned into 14–16 μm thick slices and mounted on histology slides; slides were stored at −20°C. Slides selected for immunohistochemistry were air-dried overnight at RT and washed 3× 10 min at RT in PBS. Slides were then permeabilised for 30 min in 0.5% PBST (0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) and incubated in blocking solution (PBST 0.1%, Normal Goat Serum 5%) for 1 hr at RT. Primary antibodies used were chicken anti-GFP (ab13970, Abcam, dilution 1:250), rabbit anti-GABA (A2052, Sigma, 1:1000), guinea-pig anti-GABA (ab17413, Abcam, 1:1500), and rabbit anti-Caspase-3 (AB3623, Merck Millipore, 1:200). Slides were incubated in primary antibody solution overnight at 4°C. Slides were then washed 3× 10 min at RT in PBS and subsequently incubated in secondary antibody (Goat anti-Chicken IgG Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate, Goat anti-Rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 568 conjugate; diluted in blocking solution 1:1000) for 2 hr at RT. Finally, the slides were washed in PBS, counterstained with DAPI (diluted 1:1000 in PBS) for 3 min at RT, and mounted with Fluoromont (Sigma). For the TUNEL stain, slides were processed for GFP immunohistochemistry as above, and then the TUNEL stain was applied as per the supplier (Roche, SKU: 12156792910) instructions. Slides were then counterstained with DAPI and mounted as above. All slides were imaged through an Olympus FV1200 confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All results are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean; n indicates the number of cells recorded. Statistical analysis was performed with Prism (GraphPad, USA). Normality and equal variance tests were run to direct the appropriate statistical test choice for comparison of parametric versus non-parametric datasets. Multiple groups were compared with a two-way ANOVA test; post hoc multiple comparisons were performed with the Holm–Sidak method. Two parametric groups were compared with Student’s t-test whereas two non-parametric groups were compared with the Mann–Whitney rank sum test. Finally, cumulative frequency distributions were compared with the two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Statistical significance was evaluated at p≤0.05; for the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, p≤0.01 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Research in the Butt lab that contributed to this work was funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC)(MR/K004387/1), Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/P003796/1), Human Frontiers Science Program Organisation (CDA0023/2008 C), and Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (Narsad; ref 19079).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Guille López-Bendito (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Both reviewers highlighted the interest and novelty of your study- understanding how functional subplate circuits wire up is important to grasp the interplay between cortical development and incoming sensory information.</p><p>As you will see below, both reviewers have highlighted the need to: (1) increase the number of experimental points to reinforce the link between morphology and functional data; (2) to provide more detailed analyses of some data to clarify electrophysiological properties and determine whether Lpar1-egfp subplate cells fall into two groups or rather a continuum; (3) clarify the timeline by providing sufficient n and clarity in the presentation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a convincing and important study on the morphological and functional properties of a subpopulation of subplate neurons (SPNs) defined by the expression of Lpar1-EGFP. The authors use a variety of technologies to demonstrate that Lpar1-EGFP SPNs consist of two groups with distinct morphology and synaptic inputs.</p><p>(1) Figure 2f: Can the disappearance of fusiform cells be explained by apoptosis? Maybe some electrophysiological data would support this (e.g. less negative resting membrane potential, low input resistance, etc).</p><p>2) Figure 2h: The authors have no evidence for direct synaptic connection between fusiform and pyramidal SPN, as can be obtained by paired-recordings. I would put a ? there.</p><p>3) It is known that SPNs are also coupled via gap junctions. How did the authors differentiate direct/synaptic responses (e.g. Figure 3) from electrical synapses?</p><p>4) In discussion it would be nice to briefly discuss that SP became increasingly more important, from initial &quot;waiting station&quot; (classical papers by Carla Shatz) to plasticity gate and amplifier. The present study nicely shows that fusiform Lpar1-EGFP SPNs may act as amplifiers of thalamic inputs.</p><p>5) Figure 7: Nice figure, but how about anti-/orthodromic responses of both SPN populations following electrical thalamic stimulation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors provide an important contribution to the current knowledge of subplate neuron diversity and their function in the establishment of cortical circuitry at early stages of development. This is a well-conceived and executed study.</p><p>The authors use a combination of distinct approaches including: genetic and morphological techniques, electrical stimulation, laser scanning photostimulation and optogenetics, which strengthens the conclusions of the study. The results are novel as they provide specific circuit and developmental data on a transient layer of the cortex, the subplate, whose function is largely unknown.</p><p>1. When the authors say that Lpar1-EGFP neurons represent two morphological subtypes (line 28-29, and discussion line 309) it may be implied that all fusiform and pyramidal SPNs belong to this genetic subtype. This is not the case or at least it is not supported by the data. I suggest rephrasing to: &quot;The Lpar1-EGFP group is comprised by two morphological subtypes&quot; or similar.</p><p>2. In general, the association between the electrophysiological results and the morphological neuronal subtypes is based on a very low experimental number. In my opinion, the attempt to match the morphological subtypes is somehow forced and dampens the impact of the electrophysiological results. Furthermore, the n is low to fully support some of the conclusions raised and some quantifications and statistical analyses are missing, as specified below.</p><p>3. Lines 118-122. Can the authors provide statistical analysis to the data to fully support their conclusion on the existence of a progressive maturation in the electrophysiological properties of SPNs neurons with age?</p><p>4. Lines 130-131. These cells probably are part of a continuum, as it is evidenced in figure 2C. To unbiasedly classify cells into these two types, I would suggest a K-means cluster, and to compare statistically the difference in directionality between the two subtypes.</p><p>5. Line 132-136. Are all pyramidal SPNs extending their axons to L1 and all fusiform cells keeping theirs in the SP? The exact numbers should be provided.</p><p>6. Line 140. Is the size of the soma smaller in fusiform cells? If so, this might generate a bias when patching and filling the cells, thus giving the wrong impression that their numbers are decreased. Increasing the n at later ages would probably help. Can the apical process of pyramidal SPNs be detected from the Lpar1-EGFP sections directly? If this is the case, counting a higher number of cells in several sections from different brains might provide a better estimate of the population and thus of the reduction in number of fusiform cells. This is an important point in this paper and a key element of the circuit maturation proposed in this work.</p><p>7. Line 144-Figure 2G. Can the authors provide a quantification? (At least n and percentage)</p><p>8. Line 178-180. Can the authors specify at which ages these cells morphologies were recovered or whether they appear at all ages studied? In line 180 it says 5/5 pyramidal SPNs and in line 181 it says 6/9 pyramidal. This whole paragraph is confusing and the conclusion is important. Again, the numbers are too small to make a strong association between morphology and input.</p><p>9. Line 199-207.

The diagram might be misleading since it gives the impression that fusiform cells target specifically Lpar1-pyramidal SPNs and the authors just demonstrate that the axons are restricted to the subplate.

We revisited our intrinsic electrophysiology data but found no clear evidence of markers for apoptosis. This is likely in part due to the variability in the dataset and the fact that relatively few <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs undergo cell death. Towards addressing this point we do provide new data from immunohistochemistry experiments in which we assessed the presence of cell death markers at the P3-4 to P5-6 juncture (Figure 4 and accompanying text).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2h: The authors have no evidence for direct synaptic connection between fusiform and pyramidal SPN, as can be obtained by paired-recordings. I would put a ? there.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, there is no evidence to support a direct synaptic connection between the two <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> subtypes. One limitation of our study (see discussion) is that we cannot map the output of <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs and are reliant on recovered morphologies to determine the location of putative efferent targets. We have amended Figure 2h such that (i) the axon of the fusiform cell extends beyond the pyramidal (Pyr) subtype, with (ii) a collateral (marked with a question mark) engaging with the Pyr subtype as suggested by the reviewer, and further explained in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is known that SPNs are also coupled via gap junctions. How did the authors differentiate direct/synaptic responses (e.g. Figure 3) from electrical synapses?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that gap junction coupled spikes can at times appear like short, sharp synaptic events. Three observations suggest however that our events are due to chemical neurotransmission: (1) the latency of synaptic events likely – but not absolutely – precludes the fact that these are action potentials in a gap junction coupled cell; (2) gap junction coupling invariably acts as a low pass filter and we observed no slow outward current reflecting the after-hyperpolarisation of the action potential. Moreover, the variable amplitude, kinetics and summation of the synaptic potentials reflect those associated with chemical neurotransmission; (3) the amplitude of the synaptic response varied with the holding potential. While we did not explicitly test the contribution of gap junction coupling, for example with pharmacological blockers, we are confident that the observed response are chemical in nature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In discussion it would be nice to briefly discuss that SP became increasingly more important, from initial &quot;waiting station&quot; (classical papers by Carla Shatz) to plasticity gate and amplifier. The present study nicely shows that fusiform Lpar1-EGFP SPNs may act as amplifiers of thalamic inputs.</p></disp-quote><p>We welcome the reviewer’s input and have added text to this effect. This reflects increasing evidence from a number of labs that is transforming the way we view the function of subplate in perinatal mammalian neocortex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 7: Nice figure, but how about anti-/orthodromic responses of both SPN populations following electrical thalamic stimulation?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments on the figure. We observed no antidromic action potentials in <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs in response to electrical stimulation of the thalamus (now stated in the section detailing our thalamic electrical stimulation experiments). This suggests that these neurons are unlikely to be corticothalamic, although we cannot entirely discount that such connections are severed in preparation of the acute in vitro thalamocortical slices. We have reworded the text at the end of these results to further clarify that the majority of EPSCs evoked by electrical stimulation are likely via antidromic activation of corticothalamic (CT) projection neurons. We considered including this neuron in Figure 7b but decided against this as we neither know the location of these CT neurons in infragranular layers or how they integrate into the wider circuit at these early ages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1.

Unfortunately recovering morphologies at such early stages is problematic due in part to the small size and fragile nature of the neurons at these time points. This is further compounded by the fact that during long duration experiments, such as LSPS recordings, the neurons end up being tightly adhered to the patch electrode such that they are invariably pulled out of the tissue on withdrawal of the electrode at the end of the experiment. To address this concern we have made modifications to the text and included additional data. Overall these support our claim that P5 is a critical juncture in the <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPN circuit with fusiform subtypes – that receive translaminar input, largely absent from our sample from this time point onward.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We excluded it from the initial submission to avoid over-complicating Figure 1 and due to the fact that the trends shown by the box plots were fairly self-evident. Multiple comparisons between the groups revealed significant differences in 5 out of 6 intrinsic electrophysiological properties; the only exception is resting membrane potential. The outcome of the statistical tests are reported in Figure 1 legend and briefly explained in the first paragraph of the Results section .</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The original text was poorly worded and as such we have reworded the section dealing with figure 2a-c to emphasise that the key difference between the two subtypes in terms of dendritic arbour was the presence or absence of an apical dendrite. The directionality is interesting as it confirms that while some pyramidal subtypes have apical dendrites that are tilted (for example the cell shown in figure 2a,b), they are still – in their overall dendritic arbour – distinct from bitufted fusiform cells; a subtype of Lpar1-EGFP+ neuron that are dominated by dendrites running in parallel with the subplate/white matter tract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Line 132-136. Are all pyramidal SPNs extending their axons to L1 and all fusiform cells keeping theirs in the SP? The exact numbers should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>The text detailing our analysis of the 19 morphologies has been amended to address the comment of the reviewer . All fusiform cells (7/7) with complete or near complete morphologies extended laterally in the SP/L6a/white matter tract. For the majority (9/12) of pyramidal cells we could trace axons projecting to L1. The axons of the remaining 3 extend to L2 where they appeared to be severed. As mentioned in the text, pyramidal subtypes also had collaterals – sometimes quite extensive – in the subplate as evident in figure 2d.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Line 140. Is the size of the soma smaller in fusiform cells? If so, this might generate a bias when patching and filling the cells, thus giving the wrong impression that their numbers are decreased. Increasing the n at later ages would probably help. Can the apical process of pyramidal SPNs be detected from the Lpar1-EGFP sections directly? If this is the case, counting a higher number of cells in several sections from different brains might provide a better estimate of the population and thus of the reduction in number of fusiform cells. This is an important point in this paper and a key element of the circuit maturation proposed in this work.</p></disp-quote><p>There is no discernible difference in the size of the soma of the two subtypes. Our observed increase in the proportion of pyramidal subplate cells is consistent with previous reports (Marx et al., 2017). That said, we were (similar to the reviewer) surprised to recover no fusiform <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs at later ages. Unfortunately we have been unable to discern the presence or absence of the apical dendrite in <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> section due to the dense nature of the processes, and the fact that the pyramidal apical dendrites do not extend beyond L6a. We agree that the disappearance and possible cell death of the fusiform subtype is an important part of the paper. As such, we have carried out a detailed assessment of cell death at the P3-4 to P5-6 transition and provide evidence that suggests that a subset of <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> subplate cells do undergo cell death at this time point (Figure 4 and associated text ). This supports the idea that this time window represents an important transition in the early circuits of S1BF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Line 144-Figure 2G. Can the authors provide a quantification? (At least n and percentage)</p></disp-quote><p>Counts from n=3 animals are now provided on lines 179-80. None of the 79 EGFP+ SPNs counted across images of subplate obtained from these 3 animals co-expressed GABA. Whereas, 16/19 Lpar1-EGFP+ cells in L5 (84%) co-expressed GABA, in agreement with our previous report (Marques-Smith et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Line 178-180. Can the authors specify at which ages these cells morphologies were recovered or whether they appear at all ages studied? In line 180 it says 5/5 pyramidal SPNs and in line 181 it says 6/9 pyramidal. This whole paragraph is confusing and the conclusion is important. Again, the numbers are too small to make a strong association between morphology and input.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer that the text was confusing and have reworded the relevant section to more clearly state the number of morphologies recovered during these LSPS experiments. The numbers recovered represent 38% (15/40) of patched neurons from P1-4 and 35% of those recorded between P5 and P8. These numbers are comparable with the gold standard morphological assessment of subplate/L6b neurons reported by Marx and colleagues (2017)(Cerebral Cortex 27: 1011–1026): they analysed 76 of 230 recorded neurons (33%). Moreover, previous LSPS papers on subplate connectivity report no recovered morphologies (for example Viswanathan et al. (2012) J. Neurosci. 32 (5) 1589-1601). It is worth reiterating that recovering complete morphologies at these early ages is challenging especially after prolonged recording. Further, we believe that inclusion of these data is merited as it provides further insight into the classification and diversity of these cells through this critical first week of development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Line 199-207. To strengthen the conclusion that there is a switch in the distribution of inputs then should be comparable for both the P1-4 and the P5-8 groups.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer’s concern we have performed additional LSPS recordings of GABAergic input onto SPNs in P1-P4 animals. Of the 5 cells mapped, 4 were characterized by local GABAergic inputs and 1 received translaminar input from L5. These data have been incorporated into the P1-4 data shown in Figure 5c-e and 5i. We have also run a chi-square test on the proportion of translaminar and local cells across the two developmental time points. The proportion of the two subtypes does not differ significantly (chi-square = 0.533; p = 0.46). However, it is clear from the summary data that there is a shift from localised input from L5 (Figure 5d,e) to diverse inputs that on average represent a diffuse columnar input at P5-8 (Figure 5g,h).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.

Why is this data not shown?</p></disp-quote><p>The rationale for the P2X2 optogenetic actuator experiments was simply to confirm if the source of the early translaminar input was indeed L5 SST+ interneurons. ChR2 optogenetic experiments – shown in Figure 6a-d, do not reveal the layer location of the presynaptic SST+ cells. We have now reworded this section to emphasise our focus on the P1-P4 time window where we demonstrate that the translaminar input originates from SST+ INs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14.

Line 300. How many non-EGFP SPNs have been recorded? Again, can the authors provide a statistical test to show that connectivity in the Lpar1 population is significantly lower than in the general SPN population?</p></disp-quote><p>In the original submission we reported n=5 non-EGFP SPNs. We have now recorded a further 10 cells to bring this number up to 15 of which 3 received confirmed thalamic input. This relatively low percentage (20%) is similar to that observed with <italic>Lpar1-EGFP</italic> SPNs (11%) and distinct from previous reports that have relied on electrical stimulation alone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures</p><p>18. Figure 1A. The magnification is too low to see the recorded cell(s), please provide a better image or add an inset of the cell(s).</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of this image was to make clear the located of the subplate relative to full depth of cortex in S1BF. Detailed morphologies are provided in figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19. Figure 2H. The diagram might be misleading since it gives the impression that fusiform cells target specifically Lpar1-pyramidal SPNs and the authors just demonstrate that the axons are restricted to the subplate. Thus, their target may or may not include, and may or may not be restricted to Lpar1-pyramidal SPNs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with both reviewers on this point and have reviewer 1 recommended (major comment #2) amended Figure 2h.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20. Figure 3D. Why is the resolution in the left panel different from that in 3B or 3F?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for this error. On occasion conversion of the Matlab figure into PDF or equivalent format causes a loss of resolution. We have amended and will double check the submitted version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21. Figure 5: Why is P5-8 data missing in this condition? Can the authors include it and make a figure with a layout consistent with figure 4?</p></disp-quote><p>See our comment above – the purpose of the P2X2 optogenetic actuator experiments was to assess if the transient translaminar input from L5 – present from P1 to P4 – originated from SST+ interneurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22. Figure 5A-C. N is not specified.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies for this oversight. We have now included the N numbers in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>23. Fig5F Please note that this panel is not referenced in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out! Figure 5f (<italic>now</italic> figure 6f) is now referred to in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>24. Fig7. Legend on the figure would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion: we have added a legend.</p></body></sub-article></article>
