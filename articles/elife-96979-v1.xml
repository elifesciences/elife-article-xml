response (UPR). Despite its crucial role in long-term ER stress adaptation, regulation of ATF6 alpha (α) signalling remains poorly understood, possibly because its activation involves ER-to-Golgi and nuclear trafficking. Here, we generated an ATF6α/Inositol-requiring kinase 1 (IRE1) dual UPR reporter CHO-K1 cell line and performed an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis screen to systematically profile genetic factors that specifically contribute to ATF6α signalling in the presence and absence of ER stress. The screen identified both anticipated and new candidate genes that regulate ATF6α activation. Among these, calreticulin (CRT), a key ER luminal chaperone, selectively repressed ATF6α signalling: Cells lacking CRT constitutively activated a BiP::sfGFP ATF6α-dependent reporter, had higher BiP levels and an increased rate of trafficking and processing of ATF6α. Purified CRT interacted with the luminal domain of ATF6α <italic>in vitro</italic> and the two proteins co-immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. CRT depletion exposed a negative feedback loop implicating ATF6α in repressing IRE1 activity basally and overexpression of CRT reversed this repression. Our findings indicate that CRT, beyond its known role as a chaperone, also serves as an ER repressor of ATF6α to selectively regulate one arm of the UPR.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>UPR</kwd><kwd>genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen</kwd><kwd>ATF6⍺</kwd><kwd>calreticulin</kwd><kwd>CRT</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>CHO-K1 cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/224407</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

An imbalance between synthesis and folding can lead to ER stress, potentially resulting in ER dysfunction and pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang and Kaufman, 2016</xref>). To restore cellular homeostasis, adaptive pathways, collectively known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), are activated. The UPR is coordinated by three known ER stress transducers: inositol-requiring kinase 1 (IRE1), protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). Of the three arms of the UPR, the mechanisms that govern ER stress-dependent ATF6 activation remain the least well understood, even though ATF6 mediates much of the ER-stress-induced changes in gene expression observed in vertebrates. Thus, ATF6 is specialised in the regulation of quality control proteins in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2008</xref>) and complete loss of ATF6 impairs survival upon ER stress in cellular and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>ATF6 is a type II transmembrane ER glycoprotein containing an N-terminal portion comprising its basic leucine zipper (b-ZIP), DNA-binding and transactivation domains and a C-terminal ER luminal domain (LD) that senses stress and regulates ATF6α activity . Vertebrates have two isoforms: ATF6α and ATF6β. The ATF6α isoform dominates the regulation of UPR target genes in mammalian cells and is the focus of this study. Unlike IRE1 and PERK, which remain in the ER after UPR activation, ATF6 translocates from the ER to the Golgi, where it is sequentially cleaved by two serine protease, site-1 (S1P) and site-2 (S2P) proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haze et al., 1999</xref>) to release its soluble active N-cytosolic domain (N-ATF6α) that is further translocated into the nucleus. There, N-ATF6α acts as a potent but short-live transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">George et al., 2020</xref>) that binds ER stress response elements (ERSE-I and -II) in the promoter regions of UPR target genes in complex with the general transcription factor NF-Y and YY1 to upregulate the expression of a large number of ER chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yoshida et al., 2000</xref>). Among those, the gene encoding the ER Hsp70 chaperone BiP (<italic>GRP78</italic>) has been well documented as an important ATF6α target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>At ER level, it has been proposed that ATF6α is retained by its association with BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shen et al., 2002</xref>), yet the existence of additional factors influencing its ER localisation remains uncertain. Redox regulation has also been proposed to keep ATF6α in the ER as a mixture of monomeric and multimeric disulphide-linked forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nadanaka et al., 2007</xref>) that upon ER stress are reduced by protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) family members (such as ERp18 or PDIA5), promoting the transit of a reduced monomeric ATF6α population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Higa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oka et al., 2019</xref>). The Coat Protein Complex II (COPII)-coated vesicles have been implicated in the trafficking of ATF6α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schindler and Schekman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lynch et al., 2012</xref>) and the ATF6α_LD’s <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation state has also been proposed to influence its ER trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 2004</xref>), yet the details of these processed remain incompletely understood. Furthermore, it is widely recognised that a key step of ATF6α activation occurs in the Golgi, the site of proteolytic processing. This is reflected in the inability of cells lacking S2P to trigger BiP transcription in response to ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ye et al., 2000</xref>). Hence, although there is a relatively clear understanding of the events triggering ATF6α cleavage and activation upon reaching the Golgi, much remains unknown about the factors influencing ATF6α regulation in the ER.</p><p>ATF6α signalling also involves crosstalk with the IRE1 pathway. This is partly mediated by direct heterodimerisation of N-ATF6α with XBP1s, the active, spliced form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yamamoto et al., 2004</xref>). However, the relationship between the ATF6α and IRE1 pathway is complex: (1) XBP1 and IRE1 genes are transcriptional targets of activated ATF6α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>), (2) XBP1s and IRE1 have some different target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>), and (3) ATF6α activity can also repress IRE1 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Walter et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we established an ATF6α/IRE1 dual UPR reporter cellular model to conduct an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen focussed on ATF6α.

The functionality of this probe was confirmed by treatment with DTT that resulted in the appearance of a prominent faster migration band in sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE), compatible with the processed S2P-cleaved ATF6α (N-ATF6α) form, and depletion of the precursor form (ATF6α-P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B.1</xref>, lane 8). Subsequently, <italic>2K</italic> cells were targeted to generate <italic>2K-CRT</italic>∆ derivatives cells, enabling a comparison of ATF6α processing. <italic>2K-CRT</italic>∆ clonal cells exhibited elevated levels of the processed N-ATF6α form under both basal and stress-induced conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B.1,B.2</xref>) that correlated with a higher nuclear mGL-ATF6α signal observed by live cell microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Whereas previous high-throughput studies have broadly studied modulators of the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jonikas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Panganiban et al., 2019</xref>), we designed an ATF6α/IRE1 dual UPR reporter cell line to selectively detect regulators of ATF6α. Although a connection between CRT and ATF6α was proposed previously based on an interaction between overexpressed proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 2004</xref>), our study utilises unbiased genetic tools and manipulation of endogenous proteins to establish CRT’s role as a selective repressor of endogenous ATF6α signalling, mapping its function in retaining ATF6α in the ER.</p><p>It is notable that, though the screen identified well-known regulators of ATF6α processing (including S1P, S2P, and NF-Y, and thus validating the experimental approach), only a limited number of new genes that contribute to ATF6α signalling emerged from the screen. Despite the biochemical evidence for the role of COPII-coated vesicles and the oligomeric state of ATF6α in its activation, no cluster of genes involved in COPII vesicular transport or PDIs were found among the most enriched pathways. Nor were any counterparts to SCAP or INSIG, regulators of ER-to-Golgi trafficking of the related SREBP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2002</xref>), identified. This might reflect essentiality of the genes involved or redundancy amongst them. Cell-type specificity may also be implicated in failure to identify components that are unimportant to ATF6α activation in CHO-K1 cells. For example, deletion of ERp18, a small PDI-like protein implicated in ATF6α activation in HEK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oka et al., 2019</xref>), affected neither the ATF6α nor IRE1α UPR branches in CHO-K1 cells studied here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>The screen implicated two components of the nuclear pore complex (<italic>NUP50</italic> and <italic>SEH1L</italic>) in ATF6α pathway activity. While it might be tempting to consider a role for these components in the nuclear translocation of the processed soluble ATF6α N-terminal domain, there is no reason to think it would be regulatory, as it operates downstream of ER stress-regulated trafficking and processing events.</p><p>In addition to the identified S1P and S2P proteases, the <italic>screen for ATF6</italic>α <italic>activators</italic> identified FURIN, a Golgi-localised protease belonging to the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family (like S1P protease) responsible for proteolytic activation of a wide array of precursor proteins within the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun and Sauter, 2019</xref>). FURIN deletion synergised with S1P inhibitors in attenuating ATF6α signalling. Additionally, ATF6α_LD has a conserved region (<underline>R</underline>T<underline>K</underline>S<underline>RR</underline>) related to the FURIN cleavage motif generally described as RX-R-X-[K/R]-R↓ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nakayama, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E</xref>). It has been suggested that S1P’s role in activation is to reduce the size of ATF6α’s_LD, thereby promoting S2P cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ye et al., 2000</xref>). FURIN cleavage could contribute to such a process and account for partial redundancy between S1P inhibition and FURIN depletion observed here. Nonetheless, <italic>in vitro</italic> FURIN failed to cleave the ATF6α_LD. These findings collectively suggest that FURIN may function as an indirect enhancer of ATF6α signalling, perhaps by setting up conditions in a post-ER compartment that favours ATF6α cleavage and activation.</p><p>The <italic>screen for ATF6</italic>α <italic>repressors</italic> revealed a substantial enrichment of genes involved in glycoprotein metabolism. Among that cluster, the most notable hit, not previously identified in other high-throughput UPR screens, was CRT, a well-characterised soluble ER chaperone with a key role in protein quality control. Intriguingly, its ER-membrane counterpart, CNX, did not emerge in our screen, despite the inclusion of six sgRNA targeting CNX in the CRISPR library. This suggests a special role of CRT in the regulation of ATF6α, at least in CHO-K1 cells. CRT may not be the only repressor of ATF6α; this role may be shared by BiP, which has been widely suggested to suppress all the three branches of the UPR under basal conditions. Nevertheless, because of BiP’s pervasive effects on ER proteostasis and its role in direct repression of the IRE1 branch, its role in regulating ATF6 might have been missed by this screen.</p><p>Disruption of CRT in the <italic>XC45-6S</italic> dual ATF6α/IRE1 UPR reporter cell line selectively activated the ATF6α pathway reporter under basal conditions. This activation was accompanied by an increased baseline trafficking of ATF6α from the ER to the Golgi, enhanced processing of ATF6α to its active form and increased endogenous BiP protein levels. Loss of CRT also resulted in a conspicuous basal downregulation of the XBP1s::mCherry reporter that was associated with a reduced activity of IRE1 in <italic>CRT∆</italic> cells. These findings align with previous evidence that N-ATF6α suppresses IRE1 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Walter et al., 2018</xref>), and highlights the importance of ATF6α/IRE1 crosstalk.</p><p>CRT engages monoglycosylated glycoproteins in the ER via its glycan-binding lectin domain, retaining them in the CRT/CNX cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hebert et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ou et al., 1993</xref>). A role for CRT’s interaction with ATF6α_LD glycans in repressing ATF6α is suggested by the markedly diminished ability of a lectin mutant CRT<sup>Y92A</sup> to repress the ATF6α pathway compared to the WT. However, it is worth noting that CRT has been observed to bind proteins also in a glycan-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wijeyesakere et al., 2013</xref>). Both BLI data and immunoprecipitation from cell extracts revealed that CRT can associate with both WT and unglycosylated ATF6α (∆Gly). In the former, direct interaction is characterised by slow kinetics, consistent with previous measurements of glycosylation-independent binding of CRT to its clients (Table 1 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wijeyesakere et al., 2013</xref>). These biophysical features, coupled with the residual ability of the lectin mutant CRT<sup>Y92A</sup> to repress endogenous ATF6α, lead us to suggest that CRT repression of ATF6α may involve both glycosylation-dependent and -independent interactions.</p><p>Currently, the structural basis for ATF6α_LD interactions with CRT remains unknown, and its role in the direct or indirect retention of ATF6α in the ER is a subject for speculation. Nonetheless, the observations presented here support previous studies indicating that the stable interaction of CRT with cellular substrates combines both lectin-dependent and -independent interactions into a hybrid mode. Moreover, our observations raise the possibility that the lectin activity of CRT is dispensable for its interaction with ATF6α_LD but implicated in recruitment of a third component required for repression. Either way titration of CRT by competing ligands is a plausible regulatory mechanism coupling ATF6α activity to the burden of unfolded (glycol) proteins in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed regulatory model of ATF6α by calreticulin (CRT) proteostasis.</title><p><italic>Left panel</italic>: When concentrations of competing ligands (unfolded glycoproteins) are low, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention of the ATF6α–CRT complex is favoured (via CRT’s KDEL signal). The ATF6α–CRT interaction is cartooned here as having both glycan (Gly)-dependent and -independent components. <italic>Right panel</italic>: Unfolded glycoproteins compete with ATF6α for CRT and their increasing concentration favours ATF6α trafficking to the Golgi in stressed cells. A similar mechanism, involving BiP and shared by other unfolded protein response (UPR) transducers, has been previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>) and is included here as a complement to ATF6α-specific regulation by CRT. ATF6α-P refers to the precursor form of ATF6α, while N-ATF6α denotes the active form of ATF6α.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"

Afterwards, beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed three times in washing buffer and eluted in 35 μl of 2× SDS–DTT sample for 5 min at 95°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Live cell confocal microscopy</title><p>Cells were grown on 35 mm live cells imaging dishes (MatTek), transfected as required, and maintained in culture for 48 hr after transfection. Live cell microscopy was conducted using an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM880) in a 37°C/5% vol/vol chamber with a ×64 oil immersion objective lens with 1 Airy unit pinhole using the 488 nm (GFP; mGL), 405 nm [4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)], and/or 594 nm (mCherry) lasers as appropriate. Co-localisation analysis between fluorescence channels (Pearson correlation coefficient) within individual cells was performed using Volocity software, version 6.3 (PerkinElmer).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>RNA isolation and RT</title><p>To extract total RNA, cells were treated with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) for 10 min and then transferred to a new tube. Chloroform (200 µl) was added into each sample, vortexed for 1 min, and then centrifuged at 13,500 × <italic>g</italic>, at 4°C for 15 min. The upper clear phase was collected and mixed with equal volume of 70% ethanol. Afterward, PureLink RNA mini kit (Invitrogen) was used for washing and elution. RNA yield was assessed using NanoDrop, and 2 µg of RNA from each sample was evaluated for integrity via electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel.</p><p>For RT-PCR, 2 µg of RNA was initially heated up at 70°C with RT buffer (Thermo Scientific; Cat #EP0441), 0.5 mM deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTPs) and 0.05 mM Oligo dT18 for 10 min. Subsequently, the reaction was supplemented with 0.5 µl RevertAid Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Scientific) and 100 mM DTT, followed by incubation at 42°C for 90 min. The resulting cDNA product was diluted up to 1:4.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>PCR analysis of XBP1 mRNA splicing</title><p>XBP1s and XBP1u fragments were amplified from cDNA by PCR using primers flanking the splicing site identified by IRE1 with NEB Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neidhardt et al., 2024</xref>). Briefly, XBP1u (255 bp) and XBP1s (229 bp) were separated in a 3% agarose gel by electrophoresis and stained with SYBR Safe nucleic acid gel stain (Invitrogen). Additionally, a XBP1<sup>hybrid</sup> band (280 bp) was observed. The percentage of XBP1s was quantified by determining the band intensity with Fiji, v1.53c. For quantification, it was assumed that 50% of the XBP1<sup>hybrid</sup> signal represented XBP1s, while the remaining 50% represented XBP1u.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Immunoprecipitation and FURIN cleavage assay</title><p>To investigate whether ATF6α is directly cleaved by FURIN, GFP-ATF6α_LD<sup>S1P,S2Pmut</sup> (UK3122) construct was expressed and purified from an <italic>FURIN∆</italic> clone (#2.2.G). Equal volumes of clarified and normalised cell lysates were incubated with 15–20 μl GFP-Trap Agarose (ChromoTek) for overnight at 4°C with rotation. Afterwards, beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed three times in washing buffer and then incubated with 75 μl of FURIN cleavage buffer (20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100; pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 U FURIN (#P8077S, NEB) for 6 hr at 25°C. As a negative control, calcium-depleted FURIN buffer was used. Additionally, an FURIN control substrate, MBP5-FN-paramyosin-ΔSal (#E8052S, NEB) containing an FURIN site, was included in parallel reactions and incubated for 6 hr at 25°C. The eluted protein was then analysed either via immunoblot or Coomassie blue staining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Analysis of ATF6α redox status</title><p>Both <italic>2K-</italic>parental cells and <italic>2K-CRT</italic>∆ derivative cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes for 2 days and then treated with 2DG (4 mM) for 3 hr before harvested.

All subsequent buffers were also supplemented with 20 mM NEM. Equal volumes of clarified and normalised cell lysates were incubated with 15–20 μl GFP-Trap Agarose (ChromoTek) for overnight at 4°C with rotation. Afterwards, beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed three times in washing buffer/NEM and eluted in SDS/NEM loading buffer. After heating at 95°C, eluted proteins were split into two equal samples and separated under reducing (+50 mM DTT) or non-reducing SDS/PAGE, followed by immunoblot.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data groups were analysed as described in the figure legends using GraphPad Prism10 software.

Our CRISPR screen aimed to identify genes that selectively modulate ATF6⍺. Therefore, we excluded from consideration genes whose inactivation had effects on the broader ER environment. This would disfavour the selection of genes encoding BiP, PDI and COPII components. Additionally, a positive selection screen inherently removes essential genes like BiP. The absence of COPII components among the hits could be due to essentiality or that those components are not strong selective modulators for ATF6⍺ activation, as the stronger ATF6⍺ modulators as S1P, S2P and transcription factor S2P and NFY were among our top hits. Cell type specificity may also play a role. For example, ERp18, a small PDI previously implicated in ATF6⍺ activation (Oka et al 2019; PMID: 31368601), despite the presence of sgRNAs targeting hamster ERp18 in the library. Interestingly, depletion of ERp18 in our dual UPR reporter CHO-K1 cell line did not affect the ATF6⍺ and IRE1⍺ UPR branches in CHO-K1 cells. This new information has been incorporated into the revised manuscript as Supplemental Figure S6E and the discussion has been edited in line with these comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) CLR interacts with ATF6 independently of ATF6 glycans (and cysteines). How do the authors reconcile this observation with the lectin functions of CALR? What is the interaction mode then - if the CALR N (lectin) domain is not involved, is it the P domain that is responsible for the interaction? All the binding experiments are performed in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2, is calcium necessary for CALR to achieve binding?</p></disp-quote><p>These points merit clarification. The Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) assay reported on an interaction between ATF6 and CRT that is independently of ATF6⍺ glycans. However, cellbased experiments revealed a contribution of glycan-dependent interactions to the binding and repression. Therefore, we conclude that the interaction of CRT with ATF6⍺ likely involves both lectin-dependent and lectin-independent interactions (dependent on the P-domain). Indeed, this hybrid model has previously been suggested as the mode of stable interaction of CRT with other substrates, as cited in the discussion section (Wijeyesakere et al., 2013; PMID: 24100026). CRT is a known calcium-dependent protein, and all the in vitro experiments were conducted in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2. We do not have data from experiments without CaCl2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Does the introduction of the reporter system affect the normal BiP (or ATF6) protein levels in the cells?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we have conducted new experiments comparing endogenous BiP protein levels between the reporter-containing cells and the parental CHO-K1 cells using immunoblotting and an anti-BiP antibody. These data indicate that the reporter system does not affect to the endogenous BiP protein levels. This new information has been incorporated as revised Supplemental Figure S1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Does the depletion of CRT affect BiP interaction with ATF6? The absence of CRT may lead to misfolding of glycoproteins and titration of BiP away from ATF6 leading to activation. An indicator of ER stress levels that is independent of ATF6 and IRE1 might be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>To further assess ER stress levels in CRT-depleted cells, we compared expression levels of endogenous ER resident proteins containing a KDEL signal (e.g., P3H1, GRP94, BiP and PDI) in parental CHO-K1 cells, dual UPR reporter cell lines (XC45-6S) and CRT-depleted cells (CRT∆#2P) under basal conditions and during ER stress by immunoblotting. This comparison confirmed the basal elevation in BiP protein level in cells lacking CRT, consistent with previous findings (Figure 2D) and more broadly the integrity of UPR signalling in cells lacking CRT. In the interest of time, we did not extend the analysis to other branches of the UPR. This new information has been incorporated as Supplemental Figure S5 and in the text of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Does CALR depletion alter ATF6 redox status.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this interesting point. In response, we compared ATF6⍺ redox status in parental and CRT-depleted cells using non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Overall, the redox pattern was similar in parental and CRT-depleted cells with the detection of two redox forms: an inter-chain disulfide-stabilised dimer and the monomer. Under basal conditions, ATF6⍺ predominantly existed as a monomer, while under ER stress, the monomer band decreased with a corresponding increase in a disulfide-stabilised dimer form in parental cells, as previously reported (Oka et al, 2022; PMID: 35286189). However, under ER stress, CRTdepleted cells showed a significantly higher fraction of monomer versus dimer compared to parental cells. Taking all together, these data suggest that the loss of CRT may favour the monomeric form of ATF6α, which is proposed to be more efficiently trafficked (Nadanaka, et al 2007; PMID: 17101776), aligning with our observations that CRT depletion is associated to constitutive activation of ATF6α. These new data have been included as Supplemental Figure S7 and are detailed explained in the results section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 4C would benefit from some immunoblotting against BiP.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we acknowledge the validity of this suggestion and understand the referee's interest in comparing the amount of CRT in pulldown with that of BiP, the necessity of generating additional samples makes this experiment impractical. Consequently, we opted not to include in our conclusion any comparison regarding the retention of ATF6α by BiP relative to CRT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Overlooked requirement of cysteines for ATF6 functionality (Figure 5B).</p></disp-quote><p>We interpret this comment to refer to the inactivity of the cysteine-free allele of ATF6⍺. Whilst this is a reproducible observation of significance to the structure-activity features of ATF6⍺’s luminal domain, it is less informative in terms of understanding trans-active regulators of ATF6⍺ and was therefore not explored further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Without a clear definition of the role of CRT in ATF6 folding, one cannot infer that the observed phenotype is not based on defects in ATF6 &quot;folding&quot; and glycosylation considering the possibility of activation of newly synthesised un-glycosylated ATF6.</p></disp-quote><p>If the main role of CRT were to assist ATF6⍺ folding, one would expect that depletion of CRT would lead to a non-functional ATF6⍺, resulting in ER retention and less activity. However, our data indicate that the loss of CRT correlates with the constitutive activation of the ATF6⍺ fluorescent reporter and increased Golgi trafficking and processing of ATF6⍺. Therefore, these data suggest that in CRT-depleted cells, the majority of ATF6⍺ is likely to fold to a functional state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) ATF6 was defined in several studies as a natively unstable protein and shows a close relationship with the ERAD machinery, is the role of CALR also involved in a quality control mechanism for natively unfolded ATF6?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up a valid point too. Although we have not closely evaluated the role of CRT in the quality control machinery, we observed that the loss of CRT was not associated with an increased levels of ATF6⍺ in CRT depleted cells in basal conditions compared with parental cells (Fig 3B.1, compare line 1 and line 7; Figure 3B.2, compare line 1 and line 5). These observations suggest that if ATF6⍺ were degraded by ERAD and loss of CRT compromised ERAD functionality, CRT-depleted cells should exhibit increased levels of endogenous ATF6⍺. The fact that endogenous ATF6⍺ levels are slightly reduced in CRT depleted cells does not support a role for CRT in the quality control mechanism for natively unfolded ATF6⍺.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) C618 in ATF6 is located within the BiP binding site and in close proximity of an Nglycosylation site. Is this region of particular importance for CALR binding?</p></disp-quote><p>It is an interesting point that we have not explored in this study. Consequently, without experimental data, we cannot infer the possible implications of C618 in CRT binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) The authors have mutated all the N glycosylation sites at once; they should be mutated one by one and the impact on ATF6 stability evaluated independently of the CALR status.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that analysing each N-glycosylation site individually would provide further insight into their contributions to ATF6⍺ stability/functionality. However, given the scope of the paper in its present form we have elected not to addressing this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) The relationship between the absence of CALR and IRE1 remains weak. The authors do not exclude the possibility that CALR could have a direct effect on IRE1 itself. This should be either removed or further investigated.</p></disp-quote><p>We beg to differ. The relationship between the absence of CRT and IRE1 is not weak; loss of CRT in CHO-K1 cells represses IRE1; we conceded readily that the relationship is incompletely understood. ATF6⍺ signalling involves crosstalk with the IRE1 pathway, partly mediated by direct heterodimerisation of N-ATF6⍺ with XBP1s (Yamamoto et al., 2007, 2004). Additionally, recent research has shown that ATF6⍺ activity can repress IRE1 signalling (Walter et al., 2018). Therefore, given that our results indicate that the loss of CRT leads to constitutive activation of ATF6⍺, we suggest that a negative feedback loop in which ATF6⍺ represses IRE1 contributes to the observations made here on the relationship between CRT and IRE1. This does not exclude other aspects to the relationship, a point that is now clarified further in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor point</p><p>In the introduction on page 3 it is mentioned that loss of ATF6 impairs survival in cellular and animal models, this is not completely true as ATF6a ko in mice has no clear deleterious phenotype and only the double ko ATF6a/b has some dramatic impact.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified that sentence on the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors set out to use an unbiased CRISPR/Cas9 screen in CHO cells to identify genes encoding proteins that either increase or repress ATF6 signalling in CHO cells.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strengths of the paper include the thoroughness of the screens, the use of a novel, double ATF6/IRE1 UPR reporter cell line, and follow-up detailed experiments on two of the findings in the screens, i.e. FURIN and CRT, to test the validity of involvement of each as direct regulators of ATF6 signalling. Additional strengths are the control experiments that validate the ATF6 specificity of the screens, as well as, for CRT, the finding of focus, determining roles for the glycosylation and cysteines in ATF6 as mechanistically involved in how CRT represses ATF6, at least in CHO cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their favourable assessment of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The weaknesses of the paper are that the authors did not describe why they focused only on the top 100 proteins in each list of ATF6 activators and repressors.</p></disp-quote><p>We concede that the more genes one studies the better. However, In whole genome CRISPR screens where thousands of hits arise, it is a common practise that researchers prioritise candidates with the greatest significant as those genes are likely to have a more meaningful impact on the phenotype under investigation. Therefore, our decision to focus on the top 100 genes was based on a desire to identify the most prominent and potentially impactful candidates for further analysis, ensuring a manageable scope for in-depth study while maintaining a measure of relevance and significance. Moreover, setting the threshold at 100 hits to perform GEO enrichment analysis is a practise used by previous researchers (PMID: 30323222; PMID: 37251921). In our case, the top 100 hits included the genes with an adjusted P &lt; 0.005. For interested readers, the full ranked list is accessible in the GEO databank (GSE254745) and as supplemental Table S1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Additionally, there were a few methodology items missing, such as the nature of where the insertion site in the CHO cell genome of the XBP1::mCherry reporter. Since the authors go to great lengths to insert the other reporter for ATF6 activation in a &quot;safe harbor&quot; location, it leads to questions about whether the XBP1::mCherry reporter insertion is truly innocuous.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of our experimental procedures. In order to generate a double UPR reporter cell line, we employed a previously established the XC45 CHO-K1 clone with an integrated XBP1s::mCherry reporter (Harding et al., 2019; PMID: 31749445). Since the ROSA26 safe harbor locus was available in the XC45 CHO-K1 cell line, we directed integrated the ATF6⍺ reporter there. To provide further clarity, the revised manuscript includes additional details in the Methods section regarding the creation of the XBP1 reporter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) An additional weakness is that the evidence for the physical interaction between ATF6LD and CRT is not strong, being dependent mainly on a single IP/IB experiment in Figure 4C that comprises only 1 lane on the gel for each of the test cases. Moreover, while that figure suggests that the interaction between CRT and ATF6 is decreased by mutating out the glycosylation sites in the ATF6LD, the BLI experiment in the same figure, 4B, suggests that there are no differences in the affinities of CRT for ATF6LD WT, deltaGly and deltaCys.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to highlight that in the IP/IB experiments (see Figure 4C), where wildtype ATF6 (ATF6⍺_LDWT) and GFP-ATF6_LD∆Gly were transiently transfected, GFP-ATF6_LD∆Gly was expressed at lower levels than ATF6⍺_LDWT. This lower expression levels might explain why CRT is more prominently immunoprecipitated with ATF6⍺_LDWT and could account for the differences observed among in vitro and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) An additional detail is that I found Figure 6A to be difficult to interpret, and that 6B was required in order for me to best evaluate the points being made by the authors in this figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We have simplified Figure 6A in the revised manuscript to make it more interpretable by focussing the reader’s attention on the transfected population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, I believe that this work will positively impact the field as it provides a list of potential regulators of ATF6 activation and repression that others will be able to use as a launch point for discovering such interactions in cells and tissues or interest beyond CHO cells. However, I agree with the authors that these findings were in CHO cell lines and that it is possible, if not likely, that some of the interactions they found will be cell type/line specific.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept this point and re-emphasize the qualification that our conclusions cannot be glibly extrapolated to other cell lines.</p></body></sub-article></article>
