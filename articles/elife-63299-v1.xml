Argonaute-dependent small RNA pathways are linked to chromatin-mediated gene regulation in diverse eukaryotes, including plants, protozoans, fungi, and animals (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martienssen and Moazed, 2015</xref>). Connections between Argonautes and chromatin are best understood from studies in fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, where the Argonaute, Ago1, a novel protein, Tas3, and a heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) homolog, Chp1, comprise an RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex that maintains and expands heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Verdel et al., 2004</xref>). The Chp1 protein binds H3K9me3 through its conserved chromodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Partridge et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Partridge et al., 2002</xref>) and is thought to anchor Ago1 within heterochromatin, where it is poised to engage nascent RNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holoch and Moazed, 2015</xref>). Low-level transcription of heterochromatin is thought to create a platform for propagating small-RNA amplification and heterochromatin maintenance (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holoch and Moazed, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In yeast, a protein complex termed SHREC (Snf2/Hdac-containing Repressor complex) has been linked to both the establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin and transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Job et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Motamedi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sugiyama et al., 2007</xref>). SHREC contains a homolog of type 1 histone deacetylase (HDAC), a homolog of Mi-2 and CHD3 ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, and a Krüppel-type C2H2 zinc finger protein. SHREC therefore resembles the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Denslow and Wade, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Torchy et al., 2015</xref>). NuRD complexes play a key role in converting chromatin from an active to a silent state, and can be recruited to targets through sequence-independent interactions (e.g., modified chromatin or methylated DNA) or through sequence-specific interactions via the Krüppel-type C2H2 zinc finger protein and other DNA-binding factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ecco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lupo et al., 2013</xref>). In animals, NuRD complexes function broadly in developmental gene regulation and transposon silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ecco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feschotte and Gilbert, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ho and Crabtree, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The post-translational modification of heterochromatin factors by the small ubiquitin-like protein SUMO has been implicated at several steps in the establishment and maintenance of transcriptional gene silencing and has been linked to silencing mediated by the Piwi Argonaute (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ninova et al., 2019</xref>). The addition of SUMO (i.e., SUMOylation) requires a highly conserved E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme, UBC9, which interacts with substrate-specific co-factor (E3) enzymes to covalently attach SUMO to lysines in target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson, 2004</xref>). Whereas ubiquitylation is primarily associated with the protein turnover (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002</xref>), SUMOylation is primarily associated with changes in protein interactions, especially with proteins that contain SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kerscher, 2007</xref>). In mammals, for example, SUMOylation of the KAP1 corepressor is required to recruit the NuRD complex and the SETDB histone methyltransferase via SIM domains in CHD3 and SETDB and to silence KRAB targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ivanov et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here, we identify a connection between the SUMO pathway and transcriptional silencing initiated by the Piwi Argonaute pathway in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> germline. We show that SUMOylation of C-terminal lysines on the type 1 HDAC, HDA-1, is required for Piwi-mediated transcriptional silencing. SUMOylation of HDA-1 promotes its association with conserved components of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> NuRD complex, the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1/WAGO-9, the histone demethylase SPR-5, and the SetDB-related histone methyltransferase MET-2. Our findings suggest how SUMOylation of HDAC1 promotes the recruitment and assembly of an Argonaute-guided chromatin remodeling complex that orchestrates de novo transcriptional gene silencing in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The SUMO and HDAC pathways promote piRNA silencing</title><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, silencing initiated by the Piwi Argonaute PRG-1 depends on chromatin modifications at the target locus and on a group of worm-specific Argonautes (WAGOs), including nuclear-localized family members WAGO-9/HRDE-1 and WAGO-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bagijn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shirayama et al., 2012</xref>) and nuage-localized family members WAGO-1 and WAGO-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shirayama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xu et al., 2018</xref>).

How the downstream machinery that amplifies and maintains silencing is recruited to targets remains unknown. To identify additional components of the transcriptional silencing arm of the piRNA pathway, we performed an RNAi-based genetic screen of chromatin factors and modifiers using a sensor transgene silenced by the piRNA pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Seth et al., 2018</xref>). The piRNA sensor is 100% silenced in wild-type germlines, but is desilenced in the germlines of <italic>prg-1(tm872)</italic>, <italic>rde-3(ne3370)</italic>, and <italic>hrde-1/wago-9(ne4769)</italic> mutants, resulting in expression of a bright, easily scored GFP::CSR-1 fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Seth et al., 2018</xref>).

OMA-1::GFP localizes to the cytoplasm of oocytes.

For example, depletion of <italic>mep-1</italic> (Krüppel-type zinc finger protein) and other genes encoding NuRD-complex co-factors (<italic>let-418</italic>/Mi-2, <italic>hda-1</italic>/HDAC1, <italic>lin-40</italic>/MTA2/3, <italic>lin-53</italic>/RBBP4/7, and <italic>dcp-66</italic>/GATAD2B) desilenced the piRNA sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Depletion of SIN3-HDAC complex genes, <italic>sin-3</italic> (SIN3) and <italic>mrg-1</italic> (MORF4L1), also desilenced the reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). RNAi of two SUMO pathway genes, <italic>smo-1</italic> (SUMO) and <italic>ubc-9</italic> (SUMO-conjugating enzyme), desilenced the sensor. Notably, however, RNAi of the conserved E3 SUMO ligase gene <italic>gei-17</italic> (PIAS1/Su(var)2–10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hari et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mohr and Boswell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ninova et al., 2020</xref>) did not desilence the piRNA sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Null alleles of many of these genes cause embryonic arrest, which precludes an analysis of silencing in the adult germline. To further explore the role of SUMO and HDAC factors in piRNA silencing, we therefore tested whether partial or conditional loss-of-function alleles activate the piRNA sensor. Auxin-inducible degron alleles of <italic>hda-1</italic>, <italic>let-418</italic>, <italic>mep-1</italic>, and <italic>mrg-1</italic> and a truncation allele of <italic>sin-3</italic> all desilenced the piRNA sensor in 100% of worms examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We found that a <italic>3xflag</italic> fusion to the endogenous <italic>smo-1</italic> gene desilenced the piRNA sensor in ~40% of adults analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that this tagged <italic>smo-1</italic> allele behaves like a partial loss of function. A strain expressing a temperature-sensitive UBC-9(G56R) protein desilenced the sensor in 90% of the animals at the semi-permissive temperature of 23°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). By contrast, presumptive null alleles of <italic>gei-17</italic> completely failed to desilence the piRNA sensor strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that histone deacetylase complexes and components of the SUMO pathway promote piRNA-mediated silencing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SUMOylation of HDA-1 promotes piRNA surveillance</title><p>In a parallel study, we found that <italic>C. elegans</italic> HDA-1 is SUMOylated in the adult germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, we showed that SUMOylation of HDA-1, formation of an adult NuRD complex, and piRNA-mediated silencing depend redundantly on PIE-1, a CCCH zinc finger protein with SUMO E3-like function, and on GEI-17, a homolog of PIAS1/Su(var)2–10 SUMO E3 ligase, suggesting that SUMOylation of HDA-1 might promote piRNA surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). Human HDAC1 is SUMOylated near its C-terminus on consensus SUMO-acceptor lysines 444 and 476 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">David et al., 2002</xref>), but HDA-1 does not contain consensus SUMO acceptor sites, and poor conservation between the C-termini of human HDAC1 and worm HDA-1 did not suggest the identity of potential SUMO-acceptor sites. However, GPS-SUMO prediction software identified lysines 444 and 459 of HDA-1 as possible non-consensus SUMO-acceptor sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate whether one or both of these lysine residues is required for HDA-1 SUMOylation, we used CRISPR genome editing to mutate the endogenous <italic>hda-1</italic> gene in a strain that expresses SUMO fused to 10 N-terminal histidines, <italic>his10::smo-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). We then used nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography under stringent denaturing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tatham et al., 2009</xref>) to capture SUMOylated proteins from worm lysates. The Ni-column eluates were then analyzed by western blotting for HDA-1. SUMOylated HDA-1 was recovered by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography from wild-type lysate and from lysates of each single-site lysine-to-arginine mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 7–9), but was absent when both K444 and K459 were mutated together, HDA-1(KKRR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 10). As a control, the protein MRG-1, which is highly SUMOylated in wild-type worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2021</xref>), was readily detected in worms expressing HDA-1(KKRR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). When we introduced the piRNA sensor into the HDA-1 SUMO-acceptor site mutants, we found that whereas the piRNA sensor remained silent in the single-site mutants (n = 30) (data not shown), it was expressed in 100% of HDA-1(KKRR) worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SUMOylation of HDA-1 at K444 and K459 facilitates piRNA-mediated silencing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain structure of <italic>C. elegans</italic> type 1 histone deacetylase HDA-1 and C-terminal location of SUMO-acceptor sites.

Mutating these lysines to arginine in HDA-1(KKRR) abolished the initiation but not the maintenance of piRNA-mediated silencing and also abolished the initiation of transgenerational silencing in response to dsRNA. Appending SUMO by translational fusion to HDA-1(KKRR) completely rescued Argonaute-mediated silencing and even restored piRNA silencing in animals with mutations in the SUMO conjugating machinery.

In the future, it will be interesting to explore whether any of the three <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologs of SENP1 regulate HDA-1 SUMOylation in the worm germline. The presence of such factors, which appear to be very active in worm lysates, likely explains why so little HDA-1-SUMO was recovered in our IP studies. Indeed, it seems likely that the labile nature of the SUMO interaction could explain the discordance between its robust genetic effect and its surprisingly weak physical association with its targets in co-IP assays. Consistent with this idea, an HDA-1::SMO-1 translational fusion protein with an abnormal linkage via the N-terminus of SUMO was stable in protein lysates, strongly rescued the silencing defects of the presumptive SUMO-acceptor mutant protein HDA-1(KKRR), and dramatically enhanced the detection of protein-protein interactions between HDA-1 and components of an adult-stage NuRD complex.</p><p>We were surprised that the HDA-1::SMO-1 fusion protein, which was constructed at the endogenous and essential <italic>hda-1</italic> locus, was so well-tolerated.

The mono-ubiquitinated form of the HDA-1::SMO-1 protein exhibited reduced staining with a SUMO-specific antibody, raising the possibility that the SUMO moiety in this protein is itself modified by ubiquitin, a modification that has been reported for SUMO isoforms in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Danielsen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tatham et al., 2008</xref>).

Alternatively, adult germline-specific factors may inhibit or modify HDA-1 or other NuRD complex components to prevent their direct association. SUMOylation of HDA-1 in the adult may therefore enable it to associate with MEP-1 via a mechanism bridged by SUMO, a SUMO glue, or SUMO-SIM network mode of interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matunis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Psakhye and Jentsch, 2012</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pelisch et al., 2017</xref>).

Lysates were clarified twice by centrifugation for 30 min each at 12,000 rpm, 4°C. GBP beads were prepared by conjugating GBP nanobody to N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-activated Sepharose beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rothbauer et al., 2008</xref>). GBP beads were incubated with lysates for 1 hr at 4°C on a rotating shaker, and GFP-tagged proteins and complexes were eluted with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0 at 95°C for 10 min. Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and digested with trypsin. The resulting peptides were analyzed on a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with an Easy-nLC1000 liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were loaded on a pre-column (75 μm ID, 6 cm long, packed with ODS-AQ 120 Å−10 μm beads from YMC Co., Ltd.) and separated on an analytical column (75 μm ID, 13 cm long, packed with Luna C18 1.8 μm 100 Å resin from Welch Materials) using a 78 min acetonitrile gradient from 0% to 30% (v/v) at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. The top 15-most intense precursor ions from each full scan (resolution 70,000) were isolated for HCD MS2 (resolution 17,500; NCE 27), with a dynamic exclusion time of 30 s. We excluded the precursors with unassigned charge states or charge states of 1+, 7+, or &gt;7+ .

We carefully cut near the −1 oocyte to make sure every gonad is similar and transfer gonads into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. RNA was extracted from dissected gonads using Tri-reagent with a yield about 0.5 μg. Ribosomal RNA was depleted by RNase H digestion after being annealed with home-made anti-rRNA oligos for <italic>C. elegans</italic>. DNA was removed by DNase treatment.

Young adult worms were washed three times with M9 and once with PBS and then cross-linked with 1.1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with protease inhibitors for 10 min before being quenched with 125 mM glycine. Exchanging to CHIP Cell lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, 85 mM KCl, 0.5% NP40, pH 8.0), DNA was fragmented by sonication (Bioruptor, high intensity, 30 s on and 30 s off for 45 cycles). Samples were incubated with antibodies overnight at 4°C, and then with magnetic beads, which were precleaned with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)﻿ in PBS + 0.02% Tween-20 (PBST) for 4 hr. After a series of washes in buffers of different stringency, DNA was eluted with CHIP elution buffer (1% SDS, 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) at 65°C for 15 min twice. RNA and proteins were removed by RNase A and Proteinase K treatments. Samples were reverse cross-linked by incubating at 65°C, and the DNA was purified using a Zymo DNA clean kit (cat # D5205). Libraries were prepared with NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit. Libraries were multiplexed and sequenced on HiSeq X or NovaSeq 6000 with paired-end 150 bp sequencing. With a pair-wised IP sample and its input, a ChIP-Seq Pipeline in the DolphinNext platform (built by the Bioinformatics core at UMass Medical School) was used to analyze the CHIP-seq data. The data processing and analysis pipeline includes adapter removal (cutadapt), reads mapping (Bowtie2-align-s v2.2.3), duplicates removal (Picard-tools v1.131), peak calling (MACS2 v2.1.1.20160309), peak location, and quantification (Bedtools v2.25.0, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>).

Homemade PIR-1 was used to remove the d or triphosphate at the 5′ to generate 5′ monophosphorylated small RNA. Products were then ligated to 3′ adaptor (/5rApp/<named-content content-type="sequence">TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG</named-content>/3ddC/) by T4 RNA ligase 2(NEB) and 5′ adaptor (<named-content content-type="sequence">rGrUrUrCrArGrArGrUrUrCrUrArCrArGrUrCrCrGrArCrGrArUrCrNrNrNrCrGrArNrNrNrUrArCrNrNrN</named-content>, N is for a random nucleotide) by T4 ligase 1(NEB) sequentially, followed by reverse transcription with RT primer (<named-content content-type="sequence">CCTTGGCACCCGAGAATTCCA</named-content>) and SuperScript III (Invitrogen). PCR amplification was done with Q5 and primers with indexes (forward: <named-content content-type="sequence">AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGA</named-content>, reverse: <named-content content-type="sequence">CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT</named-content> [6bases index] <named-content content-type="sequence">GTGACTGGAGTTCCTTGGCACCCGAGAATTCCA</named-content>). PCR productions around 150 bp were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, extracted with TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), and purified with isopropanol precipitation. Libraries were equally mixed and sequenced on a NextSeq 550 sequencer using the Illumina NextSeq 500/550 high-output kit v2.5 (75 cycles) with 75 bp single-end sequencing. Adapters were trimmed by cutadapt and reads were mapped to a worm database (WS268) using Bowtie2.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Tony Hunter as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Federico Pelisch (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, your studies showed that sumoylation of HDA-1, a type 1 HDAC, at two C-terminal Lys residues plays a role in establishing transcriptional silencing of piRNA-regulated genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> through enhanced NuRD complex interaction and histone H3 deacetylation. The reviewers all found the link between HDA-1 sumoylation and silencing to be interesting, but raised a number of issues that need to be addressed. In particular, more mechanistic insights into</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The evidence that sumoylation of HDA-1 increases its silencing function is reasonably strong, but no direct evidence is provided that HDA-1 sumoylation at K444 and K459 increases its deacetylase activity, as is proposed. For this purpose, biochemical assays comparing unmodified HDA-1 (desumoylated WT or KKRR mutant HDA-1) with sumoylated HDA-1 (or SUMO-fused HDA-1) to measure changes in deacetylatase activity are required. In this connection, there are also no mechanistic insights into how the presence of a SUMO moiety at either K444 or K459 site in the C-terminal tail would increase HDA-1 catalytic activity. Finally, your evidence for sumoylation is based on K to R mutations of these two Lys, and direct mass spec evidence that the K444 and K459 sites are in fact sumoylated in vivo would be desirable, although not essential.</p><p>2. Although the evidence that sumoylated HDA-1 interacts with the NuRD complex is reasonable, it remains unclear how sumoylation of HDA-1 increases its recognition by the NuRD complex. To determine whether the HDA-1 SUMO moieties are directly involved in the interaction, testing for SIMs (and/or UIMs) in MEP-1, or another subunit of the NuRD complex subunit is needed, followed by verification of the importance of these residues in vivo or through in vitro interaction assays.</p><p>3. Evidence is provided that HDA-1 sumoylation decreases total H3K9ac histone acetylation in vivo, but the use of ChIP-seq to test if HDA-1 and NuRD complex recruitment, and local histone H3 acetylation are affected at known target genes in the KKRR mutant and HDA-1 degron strains versus the wild type strain, with correlated RNA-seq data in the same lines, would significantly strengthen the conclusion that HDA-1 sumoylation is required for piRNA regulation. The addition of ChIP-seq data for HDA-1 and HDA-1-KKRR genome-wide distribution profiles would further strengthen the authors' claims, but is not essential.</p><p>4. A possible role of the GEI-17 E3 SUMO ligase in the regulation of HDA-1 and piRNA-regulated gene silencing was excluded through the use of a gei-17 mutant. However, while neither gei-17 nor pie-1 Individually affected piRNA reporter expression in P0, the authors need to test a double mutant to confirm a lack of synergy.</p><p>5.

The authors suggest that sumoylation of HDA-1 is important for proper assembly of the NuRD deacetylase complex. The role of SUMO modification in heterochromatin has been extensively documented and it is a very interesting topic. The current manuscript provides a very interesting set of results on this topic. I have list of comments, suggestions, questions, and concerns, which are listed below, especially related to the first half of the results:</p><p>1. A general question would be how can HDA-1 sumoylation, which is barely detectable, account for such a big 'positive' effect on complex assembly? HDA-1 SUMO modification seems around 10% after enriching for SUMO-modified proteins, which means that stoichiometry will be way lower than this. While this is common for SUMO-modified proteins, it does make it difficult to associate with a 'simple' model.</p><p>2. In Figure 1, a schematic of the sensor used throughout the study would benefit the reader.</p><p>3. In Figure 1, have the authors checked if the 10xHis::tagged smo-1 has the same effect as the 3xflag::smo-1 (i.e. is it also a partial loss of function allele)?</p><p>4. In Figure 1 it would be nice to see the global SUMO conjugation levels in the different conditions, particularly in the smo-1(RNAi), 3xflag::smo-1, and ubc-9(G56R).</p><p>5. Also Figure 1, was gei-17 depletion/deletion checked in any way (i.e. WB)? Did the authors consider other SUMO E3 ligase, such as the mms-21 orthologue?</p><p>6. While I am not a big fan of fusing SUMO to proteins, in this case it seems like a very reasonable thing to do, considering the modification sites are located very close to the C-terminal end of the protein. Did the authors check an N-terminal fusion?</p><p>7. In Figure 2B, it becomes very clear that the level of SUMO modification of HDA-1 is extremely small, barely detectable after an enrichment method. I also wonder why the gels were cropped so tightly, especially considering that in Figure 3 there is an additional band corresponding to ubiquitylated, sumoylated HDA-1. in vitro modification assays would be helpful. HDA-1 alongside a known and characterised SUMO substrate would indicate how good a substrate HDA-1 is.</p><p>8. In Figure 2D, is the difference between HDA-1(KKRR)::SUMO and HDA-1::SUMO significant?</p><p>9. In Figure 3A-C, it would be useful to control whether the GFP::HDA-1 fusion behaves as the untagged one in the sensor assay (wt vs. KKRR).</p><p>10. I have a few questions regarding Figure 3D:</p><p>i. Considering the extremely low level of HDA-1 sumoylation, did the authors detect SUMO and ub conjugated HAD-1 (not the SUMO usion)?</p><p>ii. Is ub conjugated to SUMO or to HDA-1?</p><p>iii. Does MEP-1 contain any obvious SIMs and or UIMs?</p><p>iv. To make a stronger case for the SUMO-dependent interaction model, in vitro interaction assays with recombinant proteins would be extremely useful.</p><p>11. In the discussion, the authors compare the lack of requirement for GEI-17 in their manuscript with the requirement for Su(var)2-10 in flies. It is very important to back this claim that the authors control GEI-17 depletion (as pointed out in 5).</p><p>Overall, I think this manuscript provides a very interesting set of results and I believe that, with the addition of some simple biochemical experiments, the quality and impact of the overall work would be much greater.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Kim et al. describes a role of SUMOylation in Argonaute-directed transcriptional silencing in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The Authors found that SUMOylation of the histone deacetylase HDA-1 promotes its interaction with both the Argonatue target recognition complex as well as the chromatin remodeling NuRD complex. This enables initiation of target silencing. Impaired SUMOylation of HDA-1 leads to loss of interactions with several protein complexes, reduced silencing of piRNA targets, and reduced brood size. While the findings and claims are interesting, some of the novelty is overemphasized and some of the claims are not fully supported by the data.</p><p>1. The importance of HDA-1 SUMOylation for transcriptional repression. The title &quot;HDAC1 SUMOylation promotes Argonaute directed transcriptional silencing in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; implies a central role of SUMOylation in piRNA-mediated transcriptional silencing. The Argonaute HRDE-1/WAGO-9 targets countless transposons as shown previously and also in this manuscript (Figure S3), and so do the HDA-1 degron and Ubc9 mutant, indicating that histone deacetylation and protein SUMOylation are essential processes in TE silencing. However, the HDA-1 SUMOylation mutant (KKRR) only slightly affects 6 TE families (Figure S3), indicating that SUMOylation of HDA-1 might not be a key mediator of this process. Furthermore, the authors write that &quot;Our findings suggest how SUMOylation of HDAC1 promotes the recruitment and assembly of an Argonaute-guided chromatin remodeling complex to orchestrate de novo gene silencing in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline.&quot;, but then they also state that &quot;Comparison with mRNA sequencing data from auxin-treated degron::hda-1 animals revealed an even more extensive overlap with Piwi pathway mutants (Figure S2B), indicating that HDA-1 also promotes target silencing independently of HDA-1 SUMOylation.&quot; Based on their results and their own interpretations, I find that the importance of HDA-1 SUMOylation in piRNA-dependent transcriptional silencing is overemphasized.</p><p>Additionally, the model (Figure 7) implies that for initiation of silencing WAGO recruits HDA-1 to targets. This should be tested by analyzing HDA-1 distribution over WAGO targets in WT and upon loss of WAGO.</p><p>2. The mechanistic role of HDA-1 SUMOylation.</p><p>On page 17 (amongst other places) the authors claim that &quot;The SUMOylation of HDA-1 promotes its activity, while also promoting physical interactions with other components of a germline nucleosome-remodeling histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex, as well as the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1/WAGO-9 and the heterochromatin protein HPL-2 (HP1)&quot;.</p><p>• Regarding activity: Loss of deacetylation/silencing in the SUMO mutant might be due to loss of enzymatic activity, but it might also be due to defects in recruitment/complex formation. There is no data that proves altered enzymatic activity. In fact, Figure 6 indicates SUMO-dependent interaction of WAGO-9 with HDA-1, implying that recruitment is affected. To distinguish between activity and recruitment, at the very least, the authors would need to show that HDA-1 localization to its genomic targets is unaltered upon mutating its SUMOylation site (ChIP-seq of wt and KKRR mutant), while H3K9ac is increased (K9ac ChIP-seq in wt and KKRR mutant) in the mutant. This, in combination with HDA-1 localization in wt and WAGO-9 loss would imply whether complex formation to recruit HDA-1 or HDA-1 enzymatic activity is mostly affected by SUMOylation.</p><p>• Regarding physical interactions: Figure 3D shows that if we fuse a SUMO residue to HDA-1, it will interact with MEP-1, while SUMOylation deficient HDA-1 mutant doesn't interact. However, for the WT HDA-1 control, we only see unSUMOylated protein interacting with MEP-1. Furthermore, in the MEP-1 IPs of samples that should contain SUMO-fused HDA-1, the authors detect a lot of &quot;cleaved&quot;, unSUMOylated HDA-1. Unless cleavage happened after IP, during elution (unlikely, and there is &quot;cleaved&quot; HDA-1 in the inputs), these findings argue that the interaction with MEP-1 is not mediated by HDA-1 SUMOylation. An interaction between MEP-1 and unmodified HDA-1 is also shown in the accompanying manuscript, which appears to be dependent on Pie-1 SUMOylation. Thus, SUMOylation of HDA-1 alone seems unlikely to be the major factor necessary for silencing complex assembly. (as a side question: Does the protease inhibitor cocktail used inhibit de-SUMOylation enzymes? I am concerned that deSUMOylating enzymes might compromise some result interpretations.)</p><p>• Regarding functional relevance of HDA-1 acetylation: On pages 12/13 authors claim that because &quot;HDA-1(KKRR) animals and mep-1-depleted worms revealed dramatically higher levels of H3K9Ac compared to wild-type&quot; and &quot;HDA-1, LET-418/Mi-2, and MEP-1 bind heterochromatic&quot;, &quot;SUMOylation of HDA-1 appears to drive formation or maintenance of germline heterochromatin regions of the genome.&quot; These correlations do not prove function. The authors have performed H3K9me2 (although not H3K9-ac) ChIP-seq in WT, KKRR mutant and HDA-1 degron worms, yet do not analyze globally whether acetylation is lost on genes that are affected (change in RNA-seq vs. change in K9me2 or acetyl). To support the claim that SUMOylation of HDA-1 drives deacetylation and heterochromatin formation, it would be important to show changes in H3K9Ac levels (or other acetyl marks) and potentially NuRD component occupancy between control and HDA-1 SUMOylation-deficient animals at specific targets (i.e. genes derepressed upon loss of SUMOylation identified in RNA-seq, and the reporter locus).</p><p>3. The authors claim (p17) that &quot;initiation of transcriptional silencing requires SUMOylation of conserved C-terminal lysine residues in the type-1 histone deacetylase HDA-1&quot;. I do not see any supporting data that has separately looked at formation/initiation and maintenance of silencing (a technically challenging experiment).</p><p>4. The authors repeatedly claim that gei-17 does not play a role in piRNA target silencing, based on loss of gei-17 not affecting the piRNA reporter (Figure 1B). At the same time, they claim that pie-1 plays a role, even though it likewise does not affect the piRNA reporter (it affects the reporter only in F3; data on gei-17 effect in F3 is not present). In the accompanying paper, the authors show that while gei-17 loss by itself causes only moderate effect on extra intestine cells, combined with Pie-1 loss the effect is more severe than when Pie-1 loss is combined with Ubc9 or smo loss. This to me indicates an important role of gei-17 in inhibiting differentiation of germline stem cells to somatic tissues, but these effects are likely synergistic and thus masked by Pie-1. Individually neither Gei-17 nor Pie-1 show an effect on piRNA reporter in P0, but to confirm lack of synergy, their effects of should be tested together. Although possible, the present data is insufficient to rule of gei-17 involvement.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63299.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The evidence that sumoylation of HDA-1 increases its silencing function is reasonably strong, but no direct evidence is provided that HDA-1 sumoylation at K444 and K459 increases its deacetylase activity, as is proposed. For this purpose, biochemical assays comparing unmodified HDA-1 (desumoylated WT or KKRR mutant HDA-1) with sumoylated HDA-1 (or SUMO-fused HDA-1) to measure changes in deacetylatase activity are required. In this connection, there are also no mechanistic insights into how the presence of a SUMO moiety at either K444 or K459 site in the C-terminal tail would increase HDA-1 catalytic activity.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in our reply to the PIE-1 paper, we did not mean to imply that SUMO modification of HDAC increases its enzymatic activity.

We now emphasize the genetic and molecular genetic studies as support for the importance of direct HDAC SUMOylation in Argonaute-mediated germline surveillance. We have opted not to attempt in vitro HDAC assays, as it is not clear to us what additional insights any unlikely changes in activity might have. Moreover, such a study would very likely require structural investigations of any changes to the protein active site.

Although the evidence that sumoylated HDA-1 interacts with the NuRD complex is reasonable, it remains unclear how sumoylation of HDA-1 increases its recognition by the NuRD complex. To determine whether the HDA-1 SUMO moieties are directly involved in the interaction, testing for SIMs (and/or UIMs) in MEP-1, or another subunit of the NuRD complex subunit is needed, followed by verification of the importance of these residues in vivo or through in vitro interaction assays.</p></disp-quote><p><bold>Thank you for raising this interesting point regarding SIMs in MEP-1. Our results clearly show that HDA-1-SUMO promotes its interactions with the NuRD complex. Whether or not it does this through the SIMs in MEP-1 or another NuRD complex factor is not relevant to our model or story. We have generated and characterized double-SIM mutants of MEP-1. Interestingly, the MEP-1 double-SIM mutant shows a strong desilencing of the piRNA sensor, but the worms are sterile due to an oogenesis defect—like the <italic>mep-1</italic> null mutant. Interpreting this phenotype is complicated by the likelihood that the SIMs on MEP-1 interact with not only HDA-1 but also other SUMOylated proteins.

Evidence is provided that HDA-1 sumoylation decreases total H3K9ac histone acetylation in vivo, but the use of ChIP-seq to test if HDA-1 and NuRD complex recruitment, and local histone H3 acetylation are affected at known target genes in the KKRR mutant and HDA-1 degron strains versus the wild type strain, with correlated RNA-seq data in the same lines, would significantly strengthen the conclusion that HDA-1 sumoylation is required for piRNA regulation. The addition of ChIP-seq data for HDA-1 and HDA-1-KKRR genome-wide distribution profiles would further strengthen the authors' claims, but is not essential.</p></disp-quote><p><bold>The genetic evidence that HDA-1 SUMOylation promotes Argonaute-mediated silencing is quite strong, and is supported by our RNA-seq data on dissected gonads and by the heritable silencing defect of HDA-1(KKRR) worms in response to a dsRNA trigger.

While I am not a big fan of fusing SUMO to proteins, in this case it seems like a very reasonable thing to do, considering the modification sites are located very close to the C-terminal end of the protein. Did the authors check an N-terminal fusion?</p></disp-quote><p><bold>We have not checked the N-terminal fusion. We were surprised this worked too, and only later after doing this did we notice the paper showing that expressing HDA-1::SUMO in the mouse model for Alzheimers improved cognitive function. It seems like HDA-1 may be ideal for this approach since the lysines are so near the C-terminus.</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In Figure 2B, it becomes very clear that the level of SUMO modification of HDA-1 is extremely small, barely detectable after an enrichment method. I also wonder why the gels were cropped so tightly, especially considering that in Figure 3 there is an additional band corresponding to ubiquitylated, sumoylated HDA-1. in vitro modification assays would be helpful. HDA-1 alongside a known and characterised SUMO substrate would indicate how good a substrate HDA-1 is.</p></disp-quote><p><bold>We were only trying to conserve space. We have expanded the cropped region of the blot to show the higher molecular weight region. Ubiquitin-SUMO-HDA-1 is not detected. We worry that in vitro approaches would not be enlightening. There are so many other factors that would likely be absent from our in vitro assays. We feel that our genetic and molecular studies provide clear evidence for HDA-1 SUMOylation and its importance in vivo. Indeed, we think that the low level of modification detected make our story more interesting, not less. We suspect that the labile nature of the SUMO conjugation creates a “detection” issue that could explain the apparent absence of HDA-1 from a MEP1-Mi2 complex (called MEC) in a fly ovarian cell line. We now discuss this issue in both papers.</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In Figure 2D, is the difference between HDA-1(KKRR)::SUMO and HDA-1::SUMO significant?</p></disp-quote><p><bold>Thank you for raising this point. No, there is no significant difference between them.</bold></p><p><bold>WE now show this in Figure 2D.</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. In Figure 3A-C, it would be useful to control whether the GFP::HDA-1 fusion behaves as the untagged one in the sensor assay (wt vs. KKRR).</p></disp-quote><p><bold>Unfortunately, our sensor is a GFP reporter, so we would need to rebuild and validate a different sensor to do this. However, the GFP tag is inserted into the endogenous <italic>hda-1</italic> gene, which is essential. The tagged worms are viable and healthy, suggesting it is a fully functional fusion protein.</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. I have a few questions regarding Figure 3D:</p><p>i. Considering the extremely low level of HDA-1 sumoylation, did the authors detect SUMO and ub conjugated HAD-1 (not the SUMO usion)?</p></disp-quote><p><bold>We detected SUMOylated HDA-1 under denaturing conditions. In IP buffer (non-denaturing), SUMO was quickly removed from proteins. We now show this in the PIE-1 paper. We did not detect Ub-modified HDA-1 in HDA-1 IPs. Like SUMO, Ubiquitin conjugation might be labile in IP buffer or the addition of Ub to the SUMO fusion could be an artifact.</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii. Is ub conjugated to SUMO or to HDA-1?</p></disp-quote><p><bold>We don’t know. We discuss the possibility that SUMO is ubiquitinated because the SUMO antibody does not detect the ubiquitinated HDA-1::SMO-1, suggesting that the SUMO epitope is masked by Ub.</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii. Does MEP-1 contain any obvious SIMs and or UIMs?</p></disp-quote><p><bold>Yes, MEP-1 has two consensus SIM motifs, as discussed above. We now discuss this in both papers.</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv. To make a stronger case for the SUMO-dependent interaction model, in vitro interaction assays with recombinant proteins would be extremely useful.</p></disp-quote><p><bold>We are indeed interested in understanding the nature of the physical interactions—especially why SUMO is needed only in the adult. However, such a discovery would merit its own paper and would likely require months if not years of additional work. In short, we do not think SUMO alone is responsible! Some unknown factor in the adult germline may be interfering with MEP-1:HDA-1 binding. Until this factor is identified, in vitro work is unlikely to be informative. In fact, in embryos, HDA-1 is not SUMOylated AND it interacts robustly with MEP-1. So, we expect HDA-1 to interact with MEP-1 in vitro, with or without SUMO.</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. In the discussion, the authors compare the lack of requirement for GEI-17 in their manuscript with the requirement for Su(var)2-10 in flies. It is very important to back this claim that the authors control GEI-17 depletion (as pointed out in 5).</p></disp-quote><p><bold>Thanks. We addressed this point above.</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript by Kim et al. describes a role of SUMOylation in Argonaute-directed transcriptional silencing in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The Authors found that SUMOylation of the histone deacetylase HDA-1 promotes its interaction with both the Argonatue target recognition complex as well as the chromatin remodeling NuRD complex. This enables initiation of target silencing. Impaired SUMOylation of HDA-1 leads to loss of interactions with several protein complexes, reduced silencing of piRNA targets, and reduced brood size. While the findings and claims are interesting, some of the novelty is overemphasized and some of the claims are not fully supported by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done our best to acknowledge other work on SUMO and its role in piRNA silencing. We apologize if it seems we were over-emphasizing our work at the expense of others. We have expanded the Discussion to improve the context of our work. The comment regarding our claims and data will be addressed below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The importance of HDA-1 SUMOylation for transcriptional repression. The title &quot;HDAC1 SUMOylation promotes Argonaute directed transcriptional silencing in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; implies a central role of SUMOylation in piRNA-mediated transcriptional silencing. The Argonaute HRDE-1/WAGO-9 targets countless transposons as shown previously and also in this manuscript (Figure S3), and so do the HDA-1 degron and Ubc9 mutant, indicating that histone deacetylation and protein SUMOylation are essential processes in TE silencing. However, the HDA-1 SUMOylation mutant (KKRR) only slightly affects 6 TE families (Figure S3), indicating that SUMOylation of HDA-1 might not be a key mediator of this process.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript to make this point more clearly. Gene silencing by the piRNA pathway includes two stages, initation and maintenance. The Piwi Argonaute PRG-1 is required for initiation not maintenance. While this role for PRG-1 in intiation was pieced together from transgene studies, the idea is that for most transposons, PRG-1 is/was required only to initially silence the transposon. Afterward the WAGO system maintains silencing indefinitely over many generations. We now explain this important detail better in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the authors write that &quot;Our findings suggest how SUMOylation of HDAC1 promotes the recruitment and assembly of an Argonaute-guided chromatin remodeling complex to orchestrate de novo gene silencing in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline.&quot;, but then they also state that &quot;Comparison with mRNA sequencing data from auxin-treated degron::hda-1 animals revealed an even more extensive overlap with Piwi pathway mutants (Figure S2B), indicating that HDA-1 also promotes target silencing independently of HDA-1 SUMOylation.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this confusing error. We sometimes think of the WAGO pathway as being a downstream part of the Piwi pathway, but to do so is confusing in this context. We revised this section to clarify the issue as follows:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“The silencing defect was more severe in auxin-treated degron::hda-1 than in hda-1[KKRR] (<bold>Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and Figure 5—figure supplement 2</bold>), resulting in the increased expression of many more transposons and a more extensive overlap with genes upregulated in rde-3 mutant worms (<bold>Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and Figure 5—figure supplement 2</bold>). This result indicates that HDA-1 also promotes the maintenance of silencing independently of HDA-1 SUMOylation.”</p><p>Based on their results and their own interpretations, I find that the importance of HDA-1 SUMOylation in piRNA-dependent transcriptional silencing is overemphasized.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your very candid comments. I hope the above corrections help you understand the assay used here. The similarities between <italic>prg-1</italic> and <italic>hda-1(KKRR)</italic> from our mRNA-seq data are very striking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the model (Figure 7) implies that for initiation of silencing WAGO recruits HDA-1 to targets. This should be tested by analyzing HDA-1 distribution over WAGO targets in WT and upon loss of WAGO.</p></disp-quote><p>As we hope is now clear, our model is that HDA-1 is transiently SUMOylated during the initial phase of converting an active heavily acetylated target gene into a silent state. The distribution of HDA-1, most of which would not be SUMOylated in any case, would be unlikely to provide any new insight.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The mechanistic role of HDA-1 SUMOylation.</p><p>On page 17 (amongst other places) the authors claim that &quot;The SUMOylation of HDA-1 promotes its activity, while also promoting physical interactions with other components of a germline nucleosome-remodeling histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex, as well as the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1/WAGO-9 and the heterochromatin protein HPL-2 (HP1)&quot;.</p><p>• Regarding activity: Loss of deacetylation/silencing in the SUMO mutant might be due to loss of enzymatic activity, but it might also be due to defects in recruitment/complex formation. There is no data that proves altered enzymatic activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize again for the poor word choice. As stated above, we completely agree, and we did not mean to imply that SUMOylation regulates HDA-1 enzymatic activity. We have corrected this mistake throughout both papers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In fact, Figure 6 indicates SUMO-dependent interaction of WAGO-9 with HDA-1, implying that recruitment is affected. To distinguish between activity and recruitment, at the very least, the authors would need to show that HDA-1 localization to its genomic targets is unaltered upon mutating its SUMOylation site (ChIP-seq of wt and KKRR mutant), while H3K9ac is increased (K9ac ChIP-seq in wt and KKRR mutant) in the mutant. This, in combination with HDA-1 localization in wt and WAGO-9 loss would imply whether complex formation to recruit HDA-1 or HDA-1 enzymatic activity is mostly affected by SUMOylation.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope it is now completely clear that we are not proposing that the SUMO modification alters enzyme activity. As detailed above, we have extensively revised the Discussion to address the above issues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Regarding physical interactions: Figure 3D shows that if we fuse a SUMO residue to HDA-1, it will interact with MEP-1, while SUMOylation deficient HDA-1 mutant doesn't interact. However, for the WT HDA-1 control, we only see unSUMOylated protein interacting with MEP-1. Furthermore, in the MEP-1 IPs of samples that should contain SUMO-fused HDA-1, the authors detect a lot of &quot;cleaved&quot;, unSUMOylated HDA-1. Unless cleavage happened after IP, during elution (unlikely, and there is &quot;cleaved&quot; HDA-1 in the inputs), these findings argue that the interaction with MEP-1 is not mediated by HDA-1 SUMOylation. An interaction between MEP-1 and unmodified HDA-1 is also shown in the accompanying manuscript, which appears to be dependent on Pie-1 SUMOylation. Thus, SUMOylation of HDA-1 alone seems unlikely to be the major factor necessary for silencing complex assembly. (as a side question: Does the protease inhibitor cocktail used inhibit de-SUMOylation enzymes? I am concerned that deSUMOylating enzymes might compromise some result interpretations.)</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks again for your very critical read of our findings. As noted in the cover letter, we have dealt with the fleeting nature of this modification for so many years that—while developing this story—we forgot that it was not generally known or appreciated. In both studies, the SUMO modifications are completely removed when we prepare samples in IP buffer (even 5 minutes at 4°C). We only detect SUMO-conjugated proteins under stringent denaturing conditions. We now make a major discussion point of this interesting and perhaps underappreciated aspect of SUMO biology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Regarding functional relevance of HDA-1 acetylation: On pages 12/13 authors claim that because &quot;HDA-1(KKRR) animals and mep-1-depleted worms revealed dramatically higher levels of H3K9Ac compared to wild-type&quot; and &quot;HDA-1, LET-418/Mi-2, and MEP-1 bind heterochromatic&quot;, &quot;SUMOylation of HDA-1 appears to drive formation or maintenance of germline heterochromatin regions of the genome.&quot; These correlations do not prove function. The authors have performed H3K9me2 (although not H3K9-ac) ChIP-seq in WT, KKRR mutant and HDA-1 degron worms, yet do not analyze globally whether acetylation is lost on genes that are affected (change in RNA-seq vs. change in K9me2 or acetyl). To support the claim that SUMOylation of HDA-1 drives deacetylation and heterochromatin formation, it would be important to show changes in H3K9Ac levels (or other acetyl marks) and potentially NuRD component occupancy between control and HDA-1 SUMOylation-deficient animals at specific targets (i.e. genes derepressed upon loss of SUMOylation identified in RNA-seq, and the reporter locus).</p></disp-quote><p>As we note above, obtaining sufficient material for ChIP-seq studies on adult germline is technically difficult to do.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors claim (p17) that &quot;initiation of transcriptional silencing requires SUMOylation of conserved C-terminal lysine residues in the type-1 histone deacetylase HDA-1&quot;. I do not see any supporting data that has separately looked at formation/initiation and maintenance of silencing (a technically challenging experiment).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks again for pointing this out. The piRNA pathway initiates transcriptional silencing on actively transcribing genes, and it is in this context where HDA-1 SUMOylation appears to be most critical. We hope this issue is now explained better in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors repeatedly claim that gei-17 does not play a role in piRNA target silencing, based on loss of gei-17 not affecting the piRNA reporter (Figure 1B). At the same time, they claim that pie-1 plays a role, even though it likewise does not affect the piRNA reporter (it affects the reporter only in F3; data on gei-17 effect in F3 is not present). In the accompanying paper, the authors show that while gei-17 loss by itself causes only moderate effect on extra intestine cells, combined with Pie-1 loss the effect is more severe than when Pie-1 loss is combined with Ubc9 or smo loss. This to me indicates an important role of gei-17 in inhibiting differentiation of germline stem cells to somatic tissues, but these effects are likely synergistic and thus masked by Pie-1. Individually neither Gei-17 nor Pie-1 show an effect on piRNA reporter in P0, but to confirm lack of synergy, their effects of should be tested together. Although possible, the present data is insufficient to rule of gei-17 involvement.</p></disp-quote><p>You are correct. We have now completed double mutant studies that show that <italic>gei-17</italic> and <italic>pie-1</italic> function together to silence the piRNA sensor. This new data is in presented the PIE-1 paper, and discussed in both papers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
