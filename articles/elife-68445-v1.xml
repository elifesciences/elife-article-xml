homeostasis through hydrolysis of epoxides to less-reactive diols. The first discovered EH was EPHX1, also known as mEH. EH functions remain partly unknown, and no pathogenic variants have been reported in humans. We identified two de novo variants located in EPHX1 catalytic site in patients with a lipoatrophic diabetes characterized by loss of adipose tissue, insulin resistance, and multiple organ dysfunction. Functional analyses revealed that these variants led to the protein aggregation within the endoplasmic reticulum and to a loss of its hydrolysis activity. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated <italic>EPHX1</italic> knockout (KO) abolished adipocyte differentiation and decreased insulin response. This KO also promoted oxidative stress and cellular senescence, an observation confirmed in patient-derived fibroblasts. Metreleptin therapy had a beneficial effect in one patient. This translational study highlights the importance of epoxide regulation for adipocyte function and provides new insights into the physiological roles of EHs in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>genetics</kwd><kwd>epoxide hydrolase</kwd><kwd>adipocyte</kwd><kwd>cellular senescence</kwd><kwd>EPHX1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Mairie de Paris</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R18139DD</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gautheron</surname><given-names>Jeremie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008966</institution-id><institution>Société Francophone du Diabète</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R19114DD</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gautheron</surname><given-names>Jeremie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ARF20170938613</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gautheron</surname><given-names>Jeremie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EQU202003010517</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gautheron</surname><given-names>Jeremie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EQU201903007868</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fève</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name><name><surname>Vigouroux</surname><given-names>Corinne</given-names></name><name><surname>Jeru</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK52431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>Wendy K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35ES030443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morisseau</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name><name><surname>Hammock</surname><given-names>Bruce D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P42ES004699</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morisseau</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name><name><surname>Hammock</surname><given-names>Bruce D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Disruption of epoxide hydrolysis inducing oxidative stress and cellular senescence is a novel mechanism responsible for lipoatrophic monogenic diabetes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epoxide hydrolases (EHs) constitute a small protein family, first characterized as a group of detoxifying enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oesch et al., 1973</xref>). The first EHs were identified more than 40 years ago, and, to date, five genes encoding EH have been identified in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Decker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fretland and Omiecinski, 2000</xref>). Human microsomal and soluble EHs (mEH and sEH), also named EPHX1 and EPHX2, respectively, are the best known EHs. Structurally, they are alpha/beta hydrolase fold enzymes. They catalyze the rapid hydrolysis of epoxides, which are three membered cyclic ethers, to less-reactive and readily excretable diols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Oesch et al., 1971</xref>). In mammals, epoxides arise from cytochrome P450 (CYP450) oxidative metabolism of both xenobiotics and endogenous compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">El-Sherbeni and El-Kadi, 2014</xref>). Epoxides from xenobiotics are involved in the development of cancers and organ damage through interaction with DNA, lipids, and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nebert and Dalton, 2006</xref>), and EHs are necessary for their detoxification. On the other hand, epoxides derived from endogenous fatty acids, called epoxy fatty acids (EpFAs), are important regulatory lipid mediators. They were shown to mediate several biological processes, including inflammation, angiogenesis, vasodilation, and nociception. By regulating EpFAs levels, EHs play a key role in regulating crucial signaling pathways for cellular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McReynolds et al., 2020</xref>), and altered levels of EpFAs are associated with many disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morisseau and Hammock, 2013</xref>). Although a large amount of work has been made to characterize EH functions, especially through the use of specific inhibitors and animal models, the full spectrum of their substrates and associated biological functions in human remain partly unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gautheron and Jéru, 2020</xref>). It is also a challenge to clearly define the contribution of each EH in human disorders.</p><p>Association studies suggested a role of several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in <italic>EPHX1</italic> [MIM132810] and <italic>EPHX2</italic> [MIM132811] in multiple conditions, including liver cirrhosis, alcohol dependence, Crohn’s disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, preeclampsia, diabetes mellitus, and many cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">El-Sherbeni and El-Kadi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Václavíková et al., 2015</xref>). This underscores the pleiotropic and crucial role of EHs in cell homeostasis, but no high-effect variants have been reported to date. In the present study, we identified two unrelated patients with a complex lipoatrophic and neurodevelopmental syndrome with severe metabolic manifestations and carrying a de novo variant in <italic>EPHX1</italic> identified by whole-exome sequencing (WES). Lipoatrophic diabetes, also known as lipodystrophic syndromes, are characterized by clinical lipoatrophy due to a defect in adipose tissue storage of triglycerides. This results in ectopic lipid infiltration of non-adipose tissues leading to insulin resistance, increased liver glucose production, hypertriglyceridemia, and liver steatosis. About 30 genes have been implicated in lipoatrophic diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2016</xref>). Although these disorders remain genetically unexplained in the vast majority of cases, there is growing interest in identifying their molecular and cellular bases to improve genetic counseling and personalize treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Letourneau and Greeley, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sollier et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>EPHX1 is widely expressed with highest expression in the liver, adipose tissue, and adrenal glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coller et al., 2001</xref>). It was the first mammalian EH to be identified and was first purified from rabbit liver in the 1970s. It is an evolutionarily highly conserved biotransformation enzyme retained in microsomal membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coller et al., 2001</xref>). For a long time, EPHX1 and EPHX2 were thought to simply fulfill distinct complementary roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Decker et al., 2009</xref>). On the one hand, EPHX1 was well recognized to detoxify xenobiotic epoxides. On the other hand, EPHX2 was shown to hydrolyze endogenous terpenoid epoxides and EpFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">El-Sherbeni and El-Kadi, 2014</xref>). More recently, EPHX1 was also shown in animal models to play a significant role in the hydrolysis of different endogenous EpFAs derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Snider et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marowsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blum et al., 2019</xref>). These EpFAs, including epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and epoxyoctadecenoic acids (also called EpOMEs), are formed by ER-attached CYP450s and hydrolyzed by EPHX1 to their respective diols, the so-called dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) and dihydroxyoctadecenoic acids (DiHOMEs), respectively. Nevertheless, from an evolutionary perspective, EPHX1 and EPHX2 are very different enzymes, which can be differentially inhibited by distinct chemical inhibitors, and display only a partially overlapping substrate selectivity.</p><p>The <italic>EPHX1</italic> variants identified in the studied patients are localized in the catalytic domain of the enzyme and were predicted to be pathogenic. This prompted us to assess their functional consequences in several cellular models. The impact of the loss of EPHX1 activity on adipocyte differentiation and function was evaluated by developing CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome-editing approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of <italic>EPHX1</italic> variants in two unrelated patients</title><p>To identify novel genetic causes responsible for lipoatrophic diabetes, WES was carried out on a parent–offspring trio. The index case, patient 1, is a 25-year-old woman originating from Mauritania. Her disease phenotype was not explained by variants in genes known to be involved in lipoatrophic diabetes, as assessed by the analysis of a panel of genes used in routine genetic diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jéru et al., 2019</xref>). The analysis of exome data led to the identification of a heterozygous variant in exon 7 of <italic>EPHX1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Retterer et al., 2016</xref>), which was subsequently confirmed by Sanger sequencing: c.997A&gt;C, p.(Thr333Pro) (NM_000120.4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). This variant was found to be de novo after paternity confirmation by genotyping a set of polymorphic markers. Due to the key role of <italic>EPHX1</italic> in cellular homeostasis and fatty acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edin et al., 2018</xref>), this gene was a good candidate. We then looked for additional individuals carrying a molecular defect in <italic>EPHX1</italic>. A second patient carrying a different de novo EPHX1 missense variant located in exon 9: c.1288G&gt;C, p.(Gly430Arg) was identified through GeneMatcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sobreira et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Patient 2 is a 17-year-old woman originating from Western Europe and living in the United States. She also had an insulin-resistant lipoatrophic syndrome. We did not identify any alternative molecular etiology compatible with the disease phenotype in either of the two patients. A detailed list of the other rare de novo, compound heterozygous, and homozygous variants, as well as the reasons for their exclusion is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>. The presence of chromosomal abnormalities was also previously excluded in the two patients by karyotype and SNP chromosome microarrays. Several additional lines of evidence supported the causal role of the two variants in the disease phenotype.

The anthropometric parameters at birth were normal with a height of 49 cm and a weight of 2.8 kg. She was first referred for dysmorphic features including microcephaly with an occipito-frontal circumference (OFC) of 33 cm at birth (−1.5 SD), which remained present in adulthood with an OFC of 51 cm (−2.5 SD) at the age of 18 years. She also presented with a triangular-shaped face, prominent forehead, retrognathism, irregular and high hair line, high-arched palate, mandibulo-facial dysostosis including malar hypoplasia and retrognathism, teeth misalignments, arachnodactyly, camptodactyly, joint stiffness, and clitoromegaly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Patient 1 also displayed a progressive lipodystrophic phenotype with severe lipoatrophy of the face and limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,G</xref>). This lipoatrophic phenotype was further confirmed by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with a total fat mass of 15.8%, whereas the mean normal age-matched value is 31.4 ± 8.5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Imboden et al., 2017</xref>), corresponding to a Z-score of −2.8. The study of segmental body composition revealed that the loss of adipose tissue was evenly distributed throughout the body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Her body mass index (BMI) was 20.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> at the age of 25 years. The serum leptin levels, which are strongly correlated with total body fat mass, were very low in patient 1 (4 ng/mL) and similar to those usually reported in partial lipodystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haque et al., 2002</xref>), further confirming the lipoatrophic phenotype. Patient 1 was diagnosed with severe insulin-resistant diabetes at the age of 12 years, with hyperglycemia (44 mmol/L), and highly elevated HbA1c (18.9%). Insulin resistance was characterized by <italic>acanthosis nigricans</italic> in the neck, axilla, and back (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), as well as by the very high insulin requirements (15 IU/kg/day) and by the low levels of total serum adiponectin (0.5 mg/L – normal range: 3.6–9.6 mg/L). Mild hypertriglyceridemia was observed (2.66 mmol/L), with serum cholesterol levels around the lower limits. She had a major hepatomegaly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST – 120 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT – 148 IU/L), alkaline phosphatase (ALP – 170 IU/L), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT – 320 IU/L) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Liver computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed liver steatosis with focal accumulation of fat depots, especially in the posterior segment (15–27%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Non-invasive FibroTest and Acti-test scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Munteanu et al., 2008</xref>) were in favor of low-grade liver fibrosis with moderate necrosis and/or inflammation. Although pubertal development was normal, oligomenorrhea occurred rapidly and progressed over the last year to complete amenorrhea, although FSH and LH values were normal. She progressively developed hyperandrogenism signs with severe generalized hirsutism. Total serum testosterone levels were first noticed to be moderately increased at the age of 22 years (2.2 nmol/L; N: 0.3–1.5 nmol/L), with deterioration over time. At the age of 25 years, this patient presented major steroidogenesis abnormalities with especially highly elevated levels of dihydrotestosterone (2.3 nmol/L; N: 0.06–0.3 nmol/L) and testosterone (16.9 nmol/L; N: 0.3–1.5 nmol/L). Serum estradiol levels were within the normal range (121 pmol/L) in this woman with amenorrhea, contrasting with the high levels of androgens. MRI showed normal adrenal glands. Adrenal steroid profiling revealed normal levels of cortisone, cortisol, 21-desoxycortisol, 11-desoxycortisol, aldosterone, corticosterone, 21-desoxycorticosterone, 11-desoxycorticosterone, and ACTH. MRI and pelvic ultrasound did not reveal any ovarian or uterine abnormalities. Neurologically, patient 1 had a delay in language acquisition and moderate intellectual disability. An axonal neuropathy, associated with a decrease in tendon reflexes and bilateral <italic>pes cavus</italic>, was diagnosed at the age of 17 years and further confirmed by an electromyogram.

Lipoatrophy was first noted in the face and the lipoatrophic phenotype was further confirmed by DXA with a total fat mass of 12.4%, a value within the first percentile as compared to age-matched normal individuals. The study of segmental body composition revealed that the loss of adipose tissue affected the whole body and was more pronounced in upper and lower limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Her BMI was low (17.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). She had insulin resistance, as assessed by very high fasting insulin levels (284 pmol/L), which increased over time. Her fasting glucose values remained in the normal range, and she was not diabetic at last investigation. Measurement of serum levels of leptin (3 ng/mL) and adiponectin (0.3 mg/L) further confirmed the lipoatrophic and insulin-resistant phenotype.

The enzyme is retained in microsomal membranes of the ER by a single transmembrane segment located at the N-terminus and comprising around 20 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Friedberg et al., 1994</xref>). The C-terminal part of the protein, containing the two variants identified, is exposed at the cytosolic membrane surface and constitutes the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The EPHX1 mechanism of hydrolysis involves two chemical steps. A fast-nucleophilic attack leads to the formation of an ester intermediate, a covalent bond linking the substrate to the enzyme. Thereafter, hydrolysis of this complex to the final diol product is mediated by a molecule of water activated by a charge relay system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Oesch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The EPHX1 active site is composed of a so-called catalytic triad consisting of Asp226, Glu404, and His431. In addition, two tyrosine residues (Tyr299 and Tyr374) provide an essential support by polarizing the epoxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Oesch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell and Kasper, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arand et al., 1999</xref>).

Glycine 430 mutated in patient 2 is located beside the crucial His431, which is directly implicated in the water activation and hydrolytic step of the catalytic process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We used a 3D structure model from the SWISS-MODEL repository to determine the location of Thr333 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Waterhouse et al., 2018</xref>). On the 3D structure, this residue appears in close vicinity to Gly430, as well as to the three critical residues of the catalytic site (Asp226, Glu404, His431) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The location of the two de novo EPHX1 variants suggests that they could affect the enzyme activity and argues for their pathogenic effect.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Loss of EPHX1 hydrolysis activity due to the p.Thr333Pro and p.Gly430Arg variants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the EPHX1 protein, showing its sub-cellular localization and function.

Although the protein expression level was slightly diminished for the p.Gly430Arg variant, there was no significant difference in the expression of the WT and other mutated isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Collectively, these data showed that the p.Thr333Pro and p.Gly430Arg variants strongly impair EPHX1 hydrolysis function by altering its catalytic triad domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the impact of the loss of enzyme activity in vivo, we measured by liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) circulating levels of a panel of EpFAs and corresponding diols in plasma samples of patient 1. EPHX1 was previously shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of several EpFAs, also called oxylipins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Snider et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marowsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blum et al., 2019</xref>). These profiles, which result from the combined action of several EHs, were compared to the patterns determined in eleven sex- and age-matched control women with normal BMI. An accumulation of 7,8 epoxydocosapentaenoic acid, and a decrease of the corresponding diol (7,8 dihydroxydocosapentaenoic acid), was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). A recent study shows that mEH plays a significant role in the metabolism of this EpFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morisseau et al., 2021</xref>). Since oxylipin profiling is an emerging field, whose biological interpretation remains difficult, further experiments will be required to confirm this observation in additional patients and/or different cellular models.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title><italic>EPHX1</italic> variants induce the enzyme aggregation within the endoplasmic reticulum</title><p>As mentioned previously, EPHX1 is mainly localized in the microsomal fraction of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coller et al., 2001</xref>). We performed immunofluorescence staining in HEK 293 cells transiently expressing the WT and mutated forms of EPHX1 to evaluate whether missense variants alter its sub-cellular localization. Co-staining with calnexin, which is a marker of ER, confirmed that hEPHX1<sup>WT</sup> is located in the ER, as well as all mutated EPHX1 isoforms carrying the five previously mentioned missense variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, the EPHX1 isoforms carrying the two de novo variants identified in patients (p.Thr333Pro and p.Gly430Arg) were also found to form higher-order complexes or clumps within the ER, as compared to WT hEPHX1 and other mutated isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To ensure that the Flag tag did not alter EPHX1 sub-cellular localization, a new set of constructs lacking the Flag tag was generated. Of note, the two de novo variants still led to EPHX1 aggregation within the ER when the Flag tag was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The presence of these oligomers was further confirmed by western blot analysis since both hEPHX1<sup>Thr333Pro</sup> and hEPHX1<sup>Gly430Asp</sup> proteins were revealed as two bands, one corresponding to the protein monomer around 55 kDa, and another to an oligomer around 150 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). When the cell lysates were enriched in EPHX1 by immunoprecipitation with an anti-Flag antibody, western blot analysis using an anti-hEPHX1 antibody revealed an increase of these higher-order complexes in the presence of the two p.Thr333Pro and p.Gly430Arg variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). All these data demonstrate that the p.Thr333Pro and p.Gly430Arg variants confer an aberrant conformation to EPHX1 leading to its aggregation.

To investigate the role of EPHX1 in adipocytes, a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout (KO) approach was developed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). A custom-designed single-guide RNA (gRNA)/Cas9 expression vector targeting the sixth exon of <italic>Ephx1</italic> was used. The murine 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were chosen as a cellular model due to their ability to differentiate into mature adipocytes after stimulation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). 3T3-L1 cells transfected with a Cas9/scramble gRNA plasmid were used as a control (CTL). KO efficiency was further confirmed by western blot analysis.

Consistently, hydrolysis of [<sup>3</sup>H]-cSO was evaluated in cell lysates and revealed a significant loss of enzyme activity in 3T3-L1 KO cells, as compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Following validation of the KO model, the efficiency of adipocyte differentiation was evaluated by progressive lipid accumulation, as revealed both by the appearance of refractive droplets in optical microscopy and by an increase in Oil Red O staining, which is a marker of intracellular lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C</xref>). WT and control 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes differentiated into adipocytes within 12 days and displayed strong accumulation of lipid droplets in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>).

Metreleptin effectiveness was also evidenced by a decrease in liver enzymes and an improvement of liver scores for steatosis, fibrosis, and necrosis/inflammation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This translational study presents the first example of a monogenic disorder related to a gene in the EH family. The data demonstrate the pleiotropic effect of EPHX1 and its key role in cell homeostasis. This is consistent with the high evolutionary conservation of EHs across multiple organisms, including animals, insects, plants, fungi, and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Loo et al., 2006</xref>), and underscores their essential biological function.</p><p>In this study, two different <italic>EPHX1</italic> de novo missense variants were identified in patients with a progressive multisystemic disorder. According to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Richards et al., 2015</xref>), these variants can be classified as ‘pathogenic’ with the inclusion of our functional data. The two patients share a number of clinical characteristics including dysmorphic features and manifestations affecting the liver, adipose tissue, and nervous system. The broad expression of <italic>EPHX1</italic> explains how germline variants in this gene result in this multisystemic phenotype. As an example, <italic>EPHX1</italic> transcripts have been detected in various areas of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Farin and Omiecinski, 1993</xref>), and EPHX1 was also recently shown to play a complementary role to EPHX2 in the brain metabolism of naturally occurring EETs, which constitute a major class of EpFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marowsky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marowsky et al., 2009</xref>). The involvement of the <italic>EPHX1</italic> de novo variants identified herein in diabetes and liver dysfunction is also consistent with a number of previous observations. Firstly, the expression of <italic>EPHX1</italic> is regulated by various transcriptional factors including GATA4 and HNF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Peng et al., 2013</xref>), two genes implicated in other forms of monogenic diabetes. In regard to systemic hormonal regulation, it was demonstrated in primary hepatocytes that insulin positively and glucagon negatively regulate <italic>EPHX1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2003</xref>). A previous study also showed that a common polymorphism in <italic>EPHX1</italic> (p.Tyr113His) was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghattas and Amer, 2012</xref>), as well as liver cirrhosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sonzogni et al., 2002</xref>). It was shown that EPHX1 plays a key role in the liver metabolism of endogenous lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marowsky et al., 2017</xref>). Regarding hormonal pathophysiology, patient 1 developed amenorrhea associated with steroidogenesis alterations. Partial and generalized lipoatrophy are commonly associated with insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Joy and Hegele, 2008</xref>). Indeed, hyperinsulinemia directly stimulates ovarian androgen production, which in turn alters insulin sensitivity with a positive feedback loop between insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism. The major insulin resistance observed in patient 1 might thus contribute to hyperandrogenism signs. Nevertheless, her total testosterone levels are much higher than those usually observed in lipodystrophic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang-Doran et al., 2021</xref>). Such an elevation of testosterone levels in the absence of tumor and in the presence of normal estradiol levels rather argue for a direct or indirect blockade of the aromatase activity. In this regard, a potential role of EPHX1 in reproductive physiology was suggested previously. <italic>EPHX1</italic> is expressed in ovarian follicle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cannady et al., 2002</xref>) and is regulated by progesterone during the menstrual cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Popp et al., 2010</xref>). Several endogenous biologically active epoxide mediators of the steroidogenic pathway were found to be EPHX1 substrates, such as androstene oxide (16α,17α-epoxyandrosten-3-one) and estroxide (epoxyestratrienol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vogel-Bindel et al., 1982</xref>). EPHX1 protects cells from oxidative stress in oviducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheong et al., 2009</xref>). A decrease in estradiol formation from testosterone was seen in human ovaries upon treatment with an EPHX1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hattori et al., 2000</xref>). Polycystic ovary syndrome, characterized by hyperandrogenism and elevated serum testosterone levels, is observed in patients taking sodium valproate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Isojarvi et al., 1993</xref>), an anti-epileptic and anti-convulsant drug known to inhibit EPHX1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kerr et al., 1989</xref>). This observation is reminiscent of what is seen in our patient, who displays signs of hyperandrogenism in association with a loss of EPHX1 activity. The role of EPHX1 on the reproductive function could also be illustrated by the reported link between <italic>EPHX1</italic> polymorphisms and spontaneous abortion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 1998</xref>) or preeclampsia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laasanen et al., 2002</xref>). Consequently, further functional experiments in estrogen-producing granulosa cell models would be helpful to understand how EPHX1 could modulate aromatase activity or other steps of the steroidogenic pathway.</p><p>There were few data on the role of EPHX1 in adipose tissue, and its function in adipocytes remained elusive. The current study supports a role for EPHX1 in adipogenesis and adipocyte functions. We observed a defect in adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells with CRISPR-Cas9 KO of <italic>Ephx1</italic>. This cellular model also revealed decreased expression of mature adipocyte markers, as well as altered insulin signaling even in pre-adipocytes. This is consistent with the lipoatrophic phenotype observed in the two patients carrying de novo <italic>EPHX1</italic> pathogenic variants. Such an adipocyte differentiation defect has been reported in several other lipoatrophic diabetes of various genetic origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akinci et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Capel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sollier et al., 2021</xref>). Lipoatrophic diabetes are indeed characterized by an incapacity of adipose tissue to store triglycerides, leading to ectopic fat depots and insulin resistance. The profound serum leptin and adiponectin deficiency observed in patients further confirms an endocrine defect of adipose tissue, since these hormones are secreted by mature adipocytes. What is the cellular link between the loss of EPHX1 activity and adipogenesis defect? EPHX1 substrates might play a key role since oxylipins, which are EPHX1 substrates, target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) to modify adipocyte formation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barquissau et al., 2017</xref>). It has also been reported that EETs decrease mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)-derived adipocyte differentiation by inhibiting PPARγ, C/EBPα, and FAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, PPARγ agonists have been shown to increase the expression of <italic>EPHX2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Taeye et al., 2010</xref>), whose expression is also interdependent of that of <italic>EPHX1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edin et al., 2018</xref>). Additional experiments will be required to precisely define the link between the loss of EPHX1 and adipogenesis alteration, which might involve the deregulation of PPARγ agonists or antagonists. Altogether, these data show that EPHX1, with its crucial role in epoxide reactive species biotransformation, stands at the crossroad of several signaling pathways and thereby plays a key role in cell metabolism and homeostasis.</p><p>EpFAs are endogenous lipid mediators functionally regulated in part by their hydrolysis by EPHX1 and EPHX2. Strategies stabilizing or mimicking EpFAs are commonly reported to contribute to cell homeostasis maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bettaieb et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). In this regard, it has been proposed that EpFAs prevent mitochondrial dysfunction, reduce ROS formation, and alleviate ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Inceoglu et al., 2017</xref>). EETs exhibit numerous beneficial effects, such as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, vasodilatory, angiogenic, fibrinolytic, tissue-regenerating, and cytoprotective effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marowsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Imig, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morisseau, 2013</xref>). This has been deeply investigated for EPHX2, and specific inhibitors have shown beneficial effects on a wide range of apparently unrelated conditions, including diabetes, fibrosis, chronic pain, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghosh et al., 2020</xref>), so that several of these EPHX2 inhibitors were tested in phase I clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morisseau and Hammock, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Imig and Hammock, 2009</xref>). In contrast, the current study shows that a loss of EPHX1 activity can be associated with a severe multisystemic phenotype. How to reconcile these apparently conflicting data? Like numerous other signaling molecules, the function of EpFAs strongly depend on the biological context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Inceoglu et al., 2017</xref>). The absence of a measurable effect of EpFAs under basal conditions is consistently observed across different laboratories and is in stark contrast to their strong efficacy under pathological situations. EpFAs seem to function with fine tuning to regulate and maintain cell homeostasis. This point is best illustrated by the ability of EPHX2 inhibitors to shift both hypertension and hypotension toward normotension in rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ulu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The gnomAD database, which collects variants from the general population, reports several dozen predicted loss-of-function variants in <italic>EPHX1</italic>, including nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site variants. This suggests that the pathogenic effect of the missense variants identified in patients 1 and 2 is not only due to a loss-of-function, but may be associated with a dominant negative mechanism. A previous study on the 3D-structure of EPHX1 suggests that this enzyme, which is mostly membrane bound, might be dimeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zou et al., 2000</xref>). This would be in favor of a dominant negative effect, as well as the formation of higher-order complexes within the ER observed in overexpression studies. Although this aspect of EPHX1 structure has so far been poorly explored, it may have important consequences for EPHX1 function, for example, by pre-orienting the enzyme for binding of either substrates or functional partners. We did not detect any dominant negative effect in the c-SO hydrolysis assay when co-expressing WT and mutated forms of EPHX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, overexpression studies are probably not the most appropriate system to investigate such properties. Additional studies will be required to better understand EPHX1 activity when embedded in the microsomal ER membranes in endogenous conditions. In any case, the final result is a loss of the enzyme activity, consistent with the localization of the variants at the center of EPHX1 catalytic site. <italic>EPHX1</italic> KO in 3T3-L1-pre-adipocytes revealed a high rate of ROS production, an observation confirmed in patient 1-derived fibroblasts. These data reinforce the proposed role of EHs as regulators of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Inceoglu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ulu et al., 2016</xref>). Patient 1-derived fibroblasts displayed an altered morphology, senescent features such as an increase in the SA-β-gal marker, as well as a reduced proliferative rate. This senescent phenotype was reproduced by removing <italic>EPHX1</italic> in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and ASCs, which subsequently loss their capacity to differentiate into adipocytes. Our findings not only support the notion that cellular senescence is an important player in adipogenesis, but also argue that EPHX1 might directly regulate adipocyte differentiation.</p><p>Regarding available animal models, <italic>Ephx1</italic> knockout mice have already been generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miyata et al., 1999</xref>). Deletion of the gene in the heterozygous or homozygous state did not induce an obvious phenotype and histological examination of several organs revealed no difference between <italic>Ephx1</italic>-null mice and wild-type littermates. The first complexity when attempting to model lipodystrophy in mice is the differences between human and murine fat distribution and lipid metabolism, particularly the handling and oxidation of lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rochford, 2014</xref>). So far, it appears that observations made in models of congenital generalized lipodystrophies (CGL) can translate quite accurately from mice to humans. Indeed, the most frequent CGL are autosomal recessive disorders due to bi-allelic null variants. In contrast, familial partial lipodystrophy syndromes are more difficult to study in mice, since they are often autosomal dominant and some variants induce a dominant negative effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garg, 2011</xref>). Knock-in mice would be required to better investigate such pathophysiological mechanisms for <italic>EPHX1</italic> variants, and additional metabolic stress is sometimes needed to uncover more aspects of the human phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gray et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we were also interested in improving the therapeutic management of this novel clinical entity, which justifies careful clinical evaluation and requires multidisciplinary care. Patient 1 suffered from very severe diabetes with persistent glycemic imbalance despite very high insulin doses. Metreleptin was shown to reduce hyperphagia leading to weight loss, to improve insulin sensitivity and secretion, to reduce hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, and fatty liver disease in many patients with lipoatrophic diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vatier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akinci et al., 2018b</xref>). All these beneficial effects were rapidly observed in patient 1 after treatment initiation. Besides, regarding the specific role of EPHX1 as a xenobiotic detoxifying enzyme, another practical implication of this study for the patient is the contraindication to all drugs known to be metabolized by EPHX1, especially carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">El-Sherbeni and El-Kadi, 2014</xref>). They would not be properly metabolized by EPHX1 and eliminated by the patient leading to toxicity.</p><p>The data presented here emphasize that lipid mediator regulation by EHs is essential for homeostasis and that its alteration is a newly discovered mechanism in monogenic insulin-resistant lipoatrophic diabetes. The field of monogenic diabetes is quickly advancing, and knowledge gained in recent years led to great improvements in understanding of their molecular and cellular bases. This allows to improve overall quality of life for patients and their families, with earlier diagnoses and personalized treatments. Continued efforts at gene discovery may help reveal mechanistic pathways implicated in the more common forms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and lead to better treatments and outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK 293</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CRL-1573</td><td valign="top">Embryonic kidney</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">3T3-L1</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CL-173</td><td valign="top">The cells undergo a pre-adipose to adipose like conversion as they progress from a rapidly dividing to a confluent state</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Primary fibroblasts</td><td valign="top">T1</td><td valign="top">Pr.

Transient transfection of the different cell lines was carried out in six-well plates with TurboFect Transfection Reagent (#R0532; Thermo Fisher Scientific, MS, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HEK 293 cells purchased from ATCC with a negative mycoplasma contamination test were cultured in high-glucose (4.5 g/L) Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; #11960085; Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (#F7524; Sigma-Aldrich, MI, USA), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PS). 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes purchased from ATCC with a negative mycoplasma contamination test were maintained in an undifferentiated state in high-glucose (4.5 g/L) DMEM supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and 1% PS (#CA-1151500; Biosera, MI, USA). Adipocyte differentiation was induced by treating 2 day post-confluent cultures with high-glucose (4.5 g/L) DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% PS, 1 µM dexamethasone (#D4902; Sigma-Aldrich), 250 µM 3-isobutyl-1-methyl xanthine (IBMX) (#I7018; Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.17 µM insulin (#I0516; Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 days. The medium was then replaced with high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% PS, and 0.17 µM insulin and changed to fresh medium every 2 days until the 12th day. Primary fibroblast cultures were established using skin biopsies from two healthy non-obese non-diabetic women, named T1 and T2, as well as from patient 1. Fibroblasts were grown in low glucose (1 g/L) DMEM with pyruvate (#31885049; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% PS, and 2 mM glutamine. Fibroblasts were stained at a low passage number (i.e., passage 4 for patient 1, passage 9 for T1 and T2). ASCs were isolated from surgical samples of sub-cutaneous abdominal adipose tissue from a control woman of the same sex and age as patient 1 and normal BMI. Adipose tissue samples were enzymatically digested with collagenase B (0.2%). After centrifugation, stromal vascular fraction was filtered, rinsed, plated, and cultured in α-MEM with 10% FCS, 2 mmol/L glutamin, 1% PS (10,000 UI/mL), 1% HEPES, and fibroblast growth factor-2 (145 nmol/L). After 24 hr, only ASCs adhered to plastic surfaces, while other cells were removed after culture medium replacement. ASCs were maintained in an undifferentiated state in high-glucose (4.5 g/L) DMEM supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and 1% PS. All culture conditions were kept constant throughout the experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of <italic>Ephx1</italic> in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes</title><p>pSpCas9(BB)−2A-GFP (PX458) was a gift from Zhang lab (Addgene, MA, USA; plasmid #48138) and was used to transfect 3T3-L1 cells with Cas9 along with the targeting guide RNAs (gRNAs). gRNAs were designed and checked for efficiency (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cistrome.org/SSC">http://cistrome.org/SSC</ext-link>) and specificity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispr.mit.edu">http://crispr.mit.edu</ext-link>). We used the web-based tool, CRISPOR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://crispor.tefor.net/">http://crispor.tefor.net/</ext-link>), to avoid off-target sequences. Subsequently, gRNAs were cloned in the plasmid and transfected into cells using TurboFect (#R0532; Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were sorted by flow cytometry (Cell Sorting Core Facility, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine), and cells with the highest GFP positivity were transferred into a 24-well plate and propagated. We favored a plasmid transient transfection method rather than a viral transduction to reduce the expression of Cas9 in cells and prevent its integration into the host cell genome, which may lead to increased off-target activities. Moreover, to minimize the effect of possible off-target mutations, we analyzed heterogeneous populations issued from the FACS sorting rather than clonal populations. The gRNA sequences used in this study to target <italic>Ephx1</italic> were the following: gRNA (exon 6) sense:</p><p>5’ <named-content content-type="sequence">TCTTAGAGAAGTTCTCCACC</named-content> 3’; antisense: 5’ <named-content content-type="sequence">GGTGGAGAACTTCTCTAAGA</named-content> 3’. gRNA (exon 5) sense: 5’ <named-content content-type="sequence">TACAACATCATGAGGGAGAG</named-content> 3’; antisense: 5’ <named-content content-type="sequence">CTCTCCCTCATGATGTTGTA</named-content> 3’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of <italic>EPHX1</italic> in human ASCs</title><p>The lentiviral plasmid plentiCRISPRv2 was a gift from Zhang lab (Addgene, MA, USA; plasmid #52961) and contains the puromycin resistance, hSpCas9 and the chimeric guide RNA (gRNAs).

ASCs were infected with viral particles at a minimal titer of 10<sup>8</sup> transducing units per mL. Forty-eight hours post-infection, cells were selected with 5 μg/mL puromycin dihydrochloride (#P9620; Sigma-Aldrich).

Cells were washed three times with a blocking solution containing PBS with 5% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin. Primary antibodies used for immunostaining were as follows: mouse anti-Flag (Origene) (1/1000), rabbit anti-EPHX1 (Novus) (1/1000), and rabbit anti-Calnexin (#ADO-SPA-860; Enzo Life Sciences, France) (1/200).

Cells were then broken with a 10 s ultrasonic pulse. The mixture was centrifuged at 5000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Supernatants were collected and flashed frozen, before being used for further analysis. Protein concentration was quantified using the Pierce BCA assay (Pierce, IL, USA), using Fraction V bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the calibrating standard. After thawing on ice, supernatants were diluted (5- to 20-folds) with Tris–HCl buffer (0.1 M, pH 9.0) containing freshly added BSA (0.1 mg/mL). In glass tubes containing 100 μL of the diluted extract, the reaction was started by adding 1 µL of 5 mM [<sup>3</sup>H]-cSO in ethanol (10,000 cpm, [S]final = 50 µM). The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 5–120 min. The reaction was then quenched by the addition of 250 μL of isooctane, which extracts the remaining epoxide from the aqueous phase. The activity was followed by measuring the quantity of radioactive diols formed in the aqueous phase using a scintillation counter (TriCarb 2810 TR, Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT).

After incubation on ice for 10 min and centrifugation at 16,099 g for 10 min, supernatants were recovered and protein concentrations determined. Protein lysates (100–200 mg in 200 µL of TNT) were either directly analyzed by western blotting or first immunoprecipitated. In this latter case, extracts were incubated under rotation for 2 hr at 4°C with the relevant antibody. Protein G Sepharose (Sigma) was then added and the mixture incubated for a further 1 hr at 4°C. Sepharose beads were quickly centrifuged in a microfuge (30 s at 11,180 g) and washed three times with TNT.

Fluorescence images were generated with IX83 Olympus microscope, acquired with Cell-Sens V1.6 and analyzed with FIJI software. Images of 8–10 different areas per condition were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using mCherry filter, followed by computer image analysis using FIJI software. Briefly, analysis was performed by threshold converting the 8-bit Red-Green-Blue image into a binary image, which consists only of pixels representing lipid droplets (i.e., red). Importantly, after separation, the binary image was manually compared with the original image for consistency and correct binary conversion.

diabetes and insulin resistance. Two human subjects with mutations in the catalytic region of the epoxide hydrolase EPHX1 which catalyzes hydrolysis of epoxides to diols display this disease, and disruption of this enzyme in cultured cells attenuates differentiation into adipocytes. These results implicate epoxides as important disruptors of adipose tissue functions required for metabolic health.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;EPHX1 mutations cause a lipoatrophic diabetes syndrome due to impaired epoxide hydrolysis and increased cellular senescence&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David James as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Robert Semple (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This manuscript presents novel and important information on a new form of human lipodystrophy related to mutations in EPHX1, and proposes a likely mechanistic hypothesis on how this occurs based on modest support from in vitro studies. The reviewers are in general agreement that this study is meritorious and advances the field. A revised manuscript is anticipated. We have left virtually the entire texts of the reviewers for your considerations in the revision, but they are related to only 3 issues that should need to be considered or addressed.</p><p>1) As outlined in Reviewer 3's first 5 bullet points and in Reviewer 2's comments for revision, more information would be needed on the clinical phenotype and genetics of the patients analyzed. Please see the details of these requests in their reviews.</p><p>2) As outlined by Reviewer 1, might epoxide content be analyzed in human adipocytes in order to use a more relevant in vitro model and additional mechanistic information that may more strongly support the overarching hypothesis?</p><p>3) Some technical issues in data presentation, as outlines in Reviewer 3's bullet points 6 and 7</p><p>4) Off target effects of the CRISPR-based deletions would be required to assess the possibility (which is low) that the effects you observed in cultured adipocytes are due to toxic non-specific gene modificaitons by the CRISPR procedure. (Reviewer 2). This is standard practice in the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>A major strength of this study is the identification of novel mutations in EPHX1 that are linked to lipodystrophy in humans. Mechanistic data are also nicely provided, suggesting dysfunctional EPHX1 in adipocytes is detrimental to differentiation and the viability of those adipocytes that do differentiate. The data suggest the mechanism of toxicity due to EPHX1 mutation is the inability of such adipocytes to remove epoxides, and the m vitro data are supportive of this hypothesis.</p><p>Further evidence in support of the major hypothesis would be the possible identification of epoxides that may accumulate in adipocytes with mutated EPHX1. Also it would be of interest to show effects of EPHX1 disruption in human adipocytes rather than relying on the mouse 3T3-L1 cells.</p><p>Nonetheless, the study is novel, mechanistically insightful and advances the field significantly.</p><p>1. Further evidence in support of the major hypothesis would be the possible identification of epoxides that may accumulate in adipocytes with mutated EPHX1. Have the authors performed lipidomic analysis of the adipocytes that are deficient in EPHX1? Could epoxide content be measured?</p><p>2. It would be of interest to show effects of EPHX1 disruption in human adipocytes rather than relying on the mouse 3T3-L1 cells. This could be done with human preadipocytes using Cas9/sgRNA RNPs, which yield high efficiency knockdowns without the need for selection of cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>1. The key starting point for this work is the human genetics, so is it convincing. In general, I think it is highly suggestive but clearly a few more cases with EPHX1 mutations would be helpful. In the absence of this I suggest that some additional information be shared. A standard trio analysis such as that performed herein should include consideration of any homozygous variants, compound heterozygous variants and all de novo variants. This should be provided for both cases so that readers can review these data too.</p><p>2. Regarding the clinical phenotyping – this is reasonable but was more limited in the second case – there are some clinical points which ought to be addressed. Specifically, a full description of the patient's fat distribution should be included and ideally fat mass (DXA), leptin and adiponectin ought to be measured, though I appreciate this may not be feasible for some reason. Either way it should be overtly clarified.</p><p>– The image in figure 1D is not clear enough to show lipodystrophy – is it possible to improve on this or show images of the fat distribution – even if only from the DXA scan.</p><p>3. The bioinformatic structural predictions of the impact of the mutations and the impact on enzyme activity look convincing though I am not familiar with the assay.</p><p>4. The functional studies described in figure 3 are suboptimal as I worry that without the arrows in 3A, it might not be easy for a reader to see the differences. I also wonder if an 'aggregate' would really run as a clean single band as shown in the gels in 3B.</p><p>It might help to see more zoomed in views of the cells and for the authors to clarify whether or not 'aggregates' were also apparent in cells expressing the other mutations. If they were, then some form of quantification should be included.</p><p>5. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene deletion is widely felt to be challenging in 3T3L1 adipocytes as they are typically aneuploid. Then whilst the data clearly shows impaired differentiation, the underlying mechanism is unclear. I don't think this is formally required at this stage as this can be challenging to pin down conclusively but can the authors be certain that the impact is not due to an off target effect of the CRISPR strategy? Did they sequence the gene etc to confirm the expected impact?</p><p>The claim that this is a novel phenotype caused by EPHX1 mutations seems very likely to be true and the functional work is probably adequate for an initial publication. Ultimately more similar cases will be needed to validate the claims. I have highlighted some technical issues, the most important one being inclusion of more sequencing detail.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Gautheron and colleagues describe two people with heavily overlapping clinical problems including insulin resistance, reduced adipose tissue (lipodystrophy) and features of &quot;lipotoxicity&quot; (e.g. fatty liver, high serum triglyceride concentration). Other shared syndromic features include an abnormal facial appearance, and sensorineural deafness. Both probands were found to harbour de novo missense mutations in EPHX1 (i.e. the mutation is absent from the parents). EPHX1 encodes a microsomal epoxide hydrolase known to hydrolyse a range of xenobiotic and endogenous epoxides, which are a source of redox stress and cellular damage. Overexpression studies in HEK293 cells with biochemical assay of hydrolysis of a labelled substrate convincingly demonstrate nearly complete loss of function of the missense mutations identified in the probands, in keeping with structural modelling suggesting important roles in stabilising the active site of the enzyme. Overexpressed mutant but not wild type enzyme appeared to aggregate in the endoplasmic reticulum, giving rise to speculation that they might exert a dominant negative effect over co-expressed wild type.</p><p>In further studies, Crispr/CAS9 editing was used to knock out Ephx1 in 3T3-L1 cells, a clonal mouse embryo-fibroblast preadipocyte model. After selection of a polyclonal population of cells with knockdown, it was demonstrated that knockout but not control cells could differentiate into mature adipocytes, with reduced insulin responsiveness. Finally, both knockout 3T3-L1 cells and primary dermal fibroblasts were shown to have some increased markers of replicative senescence, including reduced proliferation, increased SA β-gal staining, increased reactive oxygen species, increased phosphorylation of p53, and increased protein expression of p21 and p16.</p><p>Overall, this study will be of interest in particular to genetecists, metabolic physicians, adipose biologists, and to those studying ageing. Although the argument is not developed in detail, loss of EPHX1 could confer lipodystrophy and insulin resistance in at least 2 ways. First, by allowing accumulation of toxic ROS, it may increase DNA damage and cellular ageing in adipose precursor or mesenchymal stem cells. Disorders such as Werner syndrome already suggest that this lineage is particularly vulnerable to DNA damage. It is also possible that EPHX1 deficiency reduces generation of an important endogenous ligand of PPARG, the master adipogenic transcription factor, though this is more difficult to prove.</p><p>The evidence in this study that EPHX1 mutations cause the syndrome described is moderately convincing but could be enhanced, and the variants found clearly abrogate enzyme function. The evidence for a dominant mechanism mechanism of action is circumstancial only, while some aspects of the phenotypic description seem an overreach based on the data presented. I would add the following specific observations:</p><p>Clinical phenotype:</p><p>1. There is quite a lot of discussion of &quot;steroidogenesis abnormalities&quot; but there is no clear evidence offered of anything more than is common seen in severe insulin resistance (IR), when ovarian androgen production may be extremely elevated. Please could the authors place their observations in the context of other forms of severe IR? Is there any evidence that the steroid profile is different?</p><p>2. EPHX1 expression is very high in the adrenal glands, and it is commented that these are normal in volume and morphology on MRI. But what about their function? Was synacthen testing or other profiling of adrenal steroids undertaken?</p><p>3. It is implied that leptin may be a specific treatment for this disorder. In fact the response to leptin is entirely as expected from this degree of lipodystrophy and baseline serum leptin. Parenthetically, it is claimed that the serum leptin concentration (4mcg/L) is consistent with generalised lipodystrophy, whereas to me this looks much more in keeping with known forms of partial lipodystrophy.</p><p>Evidence for causation of syndrome by EPHX1 mutations:</p><p>4. Raw exome data are not made available as part of this study. This is commonly done in human genetic studies, and I assume that when the authors say it cannot be done here, they mean that suitable consent is not in place. This is reasonable but should be explicit. Without such raw data it would be helpful to readers to have more genetic information. The headline finding of a de novo EPHX1 mutation is given, but were there any other de novo, compound heterozygous or homozygous, rare, likely loss of function mutations in the first proband studied?</p><p>5. In the GnomAD repository (up to around 250,000 alleles), there is no evidence of selection against EPHX1 loss of function variants in the general population. I counted 66 loss-of-function alleles (nonsense/frameshift/essential splice site) and a large number of missense variants, including at least one affecting a residue in the catalytic triad. It is implausible, to me, that this syndrome occurs in all these people, and this suggests that heterozygous EPHX1 loss-of-function mutations are likely only rarely associated with the syndrome described, either because of low penetrance, or because simple loss of function of one allele is insufficient. This gives circumstancial support for the notion that only certain mutations that produce dominant negative activity may be required for disease. This does not undermine the case made in the manuscript, but may be worthy of comment.</p><p>Evidence for mechanism linking EPHX1 mutations to lipodystrophy:</p><p>6. Biochemical studies in overexpressing HEK293 cells show convincingly that the EPHX1 mutations nearly abolish enzyme activity</p><p>7. 3T3-L1 knockout studies in mixed populations appear to have been well executed, and the finding that adipogenesis is impaired with increased senescence markers seems sound. Nevertheless 3T3-L1 cells are derived from mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and it is notable that Ephx1 knockout mouse were reported to be phenotypically normal (J. Biol. Chem. 274: 23963-23968). This is worth discussing.</p><p>8. Although insulin signalling appears impaired, is this simply a consequence of impaired differentiation, when expression of the insulin receptor normally increases? What about insulin signalling in preadipocytes? Any reduction could also be an indirect consequence of senescence. Although the patients have systemic insulin resistance, this does NOT necessarily need to correspond to a cell autonomous defect in insulin action. Adipose dysfunction would suffice to explain the clinical derangement.</p><p>9. The evidence for a dominant negative mechanism of action of the mutant enzymes is circumstancial only, though very plausible. The aggregates seen in HEK293s may be relevant, but this is not clear in such overexpression studies. Nevertheless it would appear straightforward to conduct some further studies in this model, looking at the ability of co-expressed mutant to reduce activity of co-expressed wild type enzyme, as long as care is taken to include suitable controls.</p><p>10. One of the challenges in studying primary dermal fibroblasts is that &quot;passage 1&quot; is often timed from establishment of outgrown cells in the lab, which in turn may take weeks from the time of tissue biospy. Could the authors clarify that the cells and controls used had roughly been through the same length of time and/or doubling times in culture?</p><p>11. Was there evidence of increased DNA damage in affected cells?</p><p>12. Speculation that loss of Ephx1 may alter generation of endogenous agonists (and maybe) antagonists of PPARG is interesting but untested.</p><p>13. More detail on birthweights and growth parameters would be useful for both probands. Was the microcephaly sustained in the first patient? What about the second patient?</p><p>14. Please address the other clinical questions above.</p><p>15. Please list other de novo, compound heterozygous or homozygous, rare, likely loss of function mutations in the first proband and add a statement in text that all parents and any siblings were clinically unaffected.</p><p>16. I assume that EPHX1 mutations were also sought in other lipodystrophy cohorts but weren't found. Can any information be offered about this?</p><p>17. Through GeneMatcher were any other EPHX1 mutations reported linked to different phenotypes?</p><p>18. HEK293 studies were undertaken as duplicates of n=2. Showing data as mean +/- SEM is inappropriate. Better just show points as a scatter plot (see below).</p><p>19. &quot;dynamite plunger&quot; plots when numbers are small can hide important data heterogeneity and are now widely disfavoured. Please could all data points be shown superimposed as a scatter plot on these graphs.</p><p>20. Language: generally good but with small grammatical lapses (e.g. in abstract). Also, even for this clinically qualified reader some of the technical jargon is obscure and not widely used in anglophone medicine. An &quot;ogival palate&quot; would usually be a &quot;high-arched palate&quot; and &quot;spaniomenorrhoea&quot; is better called &quot;oligomenorrhoea&quot;. There are other examples of whether more routine medical jargon could be made more accessible for non-clinical readers, too.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68445.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This manuscript presents novel and important information on a new form of human lipodystrophy related to mutations in EPHX1, and proposes a likely mechanistic hypothesis on how this occurs based on modest support from in vitro studies.

To address this important issue, we have added two Supplementary Files listing the characteristics of all other rare variants identified in the two families investigated herein, according to the corresponding mode of inheritance. For each variant, we indicated the items arguing against its involvement in the disease phenotype. For both patients, we did not find any likely alternative molecular etiology. This is now stated in the Results section of the manuscript (Page 5) as follows: “We did not identify any alternative molecular etiology compatible with the disease phenotype in either of the two patients.

These data have been added in the revised version of the manuscript (Page 9) together with an additional Figure 2—figure supplement 1 as follows: “To evaluate the impact of the loss of enzyme activity in vivo, we measured by liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) circulating levels of a panel of epoxy-fatty acids (EpFAs) and corresponding diols in plasma samples of patient 1.

As shown in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 3, KO cells exhibit a strong and significant reduction of c-SO hydrolysis when compared with WT and control 3T3-L1 cells (~60% reduction). This information, which strengthens the relevance of the 3T3-L1 cellular model, has been added in the revised version of the manuscript (Page 10) as follows: “Consistently, hydrolysis of [3H]-cSO was evaluated in cell lysates and revealed a significant loss of enzyme activity in 3T3-L1 KO cells, as compared to control cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 3)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some technical issues in data presentation, as outlines in Reviewer 3's bullet points 6 and 7.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with Reviewer #3 that it was inappropriate to show Figure 2D with only two independent biological experiments.

It would be of interest to show effects of EPHX1 disruption in human adipocytes rather than relying on the mouse 3T3-L1 cells. This could be done with human preadipocytes using Cas9/sgRNA RNPs, which yield high efficiency knockdowns without the need for selection of cells.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by Reviewer #1, we thought of using adipose stem cells (ASCs), which can be differentiated into adipocytes. The standard differentiation protocol requires the use of an adipogenic induction cocktail containing insulin, glucocorticoids (e.g., dexamethasone), and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (IBMX) (Lee M-J et al. Methods Enzymol. 2014;538:49-65). In addition, PPARγ agonists, such as rosiglitazone, are often used to improve cell differentiation capacity since human ASCs do not differentiate well in the absence of PPARγ ligands (Ahmadian M et al. Nat Med 2013 May:19(5):10.1038/nm.3159). For this study, we initially excluded the use of ASCs because PPARγ agonists are known to regulate the expression of epoxide hydrolases (De Taye BM et al. Obesity. 2010 Mar;18(3):489-98), notably EPHX2, and functional compensation between EPHX1 and EPHX2 has been shown to occur in vivo (Edin ML et al. J Biol Chem. 2018 Mar2; 293(9):3281-92). Therefore, the use of PPARγ agonists to differentiate ASCs may induce a compensatory phenomenon making the analysis of <italic>EPHX1</italic> KO hazardous. Since the differentiation protocol of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes does not require PPARγ agonists, we favored this model, which led to major advances in our understanding of adipogenesis and lipid metabolism over the last decade.</p><p>– Nevertheless, to comply with Reviewer #1’s suggestion, we have generated a human ASC model. As stem cells are notoriously difficult to transfect with standard methods/reagents (e.g., electroporation, lipid-based transfection), we favored the use of a lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 system to knock down <italic>EPHX1</italic>. This additional set of data confirms the observations made in 3T3-L1 cells and fibroblasts derived from patient 1 and the functional link between EPHX1 dysfunction and cellular senescence. Please also refer to comment 4 of the Editor for more details.</p><p>The new lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 system is now described in the Methods section of the revised manuscript (Page 23): “The lentiviral plasmid plentiCRISPRv2 was a gift from Zhang lab (Addgene, MA, USA; plasmid #52961) and contains the puromycin resistance, hSpCas9 and the chimeric guide RNA (gRNAs). […] ASCs were infected with viral particles at a minimal titer of 10<sup>8</sup> transducing units per mL. 48 h post infection, cells were selected with 5 μg/ml puromycin dihydrochloride (#P9620; Sigma-Aldrich). Surviving cells were propagated and the heterogeneous cell pool was used for experiments.”</p><p>The description of ASC isolation and culture has been added in the Methods section of the revised manuscript (Page 22) as follows: “ASCs were isolated from surgical samples of sub-cutaneous abdominal adipose tissue from a control woman of the same sex and age as patient 1 and normal BMI.

To summarize:</p><p>– We used the powerful and well-recognized tool “http://crispor.tefor.net” to predict and avoid off-targets.</p><p>– We favored a transient transfection method and GFP cell sorting to avoid prolonged Cas9 expression, which may enhance off-target effects.</p><p>– We analyzed heterogeneous populations issued from the FACS sorting rather than sub-clonal populations to minimize effect of possible deleterious off-target mutations. It is unlikely that a main off-target mutation occurred in all cells.</p><p>– We tested the gRNA efficacy in vitro to avoid delivery of ineffective gRNA in 3T3-L1 cells.</p><p>– We could confirm a strong and significant reduction of the hydrolysis of <italic>cis</italic>-stilbene oxide (c-SO) in lysates of <italic>EphX1</italic> KO 3T3-L1 cells. This confirms the Western blot analysis and the knock-down efficiency.</p><p>– We conducted KO experiments using a different gRNA targeting <italic>Ephx1</italic> exon 5 in 3T3-L1 cells. We could confirm a strong reduction of adipocyte differentiation with this new KO cell line, as seen with the initial gRNA. Since the sequence of this gRNA is completely different from that of the initial one, it argues against off-target effects.</p><p>– We generated an additional <italic>EPHX1</italic> KO model in human adipose stem cells (ASCs) using another gRNA targeting the third exon of human EPHX1. A near complete loss of EPHX1 expression was observed by Western blot analysis (Figure 5F). This led to a reduction of the proliferative capacity of the cells and to a major increase of cellular senescence (Figure 5G and 5H) and recapitulated the effects seen in 3T3-L1 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript Gautheron and colleagues describe two people with heavily overlapping clinical problems including insulin resistance, reduced adipose tissue (lipodystrophy) and features of &quot;lipotoxicity&quot; (e.g. fatty liver, high serum triglyceride concentration). Other shared syndromic features include an abnormal facial appearance, and sensorineural deafness. Both probands were found to harbour de novo missense mutations in EPHX1 (i.e. the mutation is absent from the parents). EPHX1 encodes a microsomal epoxide hydrolase known to hydrolyse a range of xenobiotic and endogenous epoxides, which are a source of redox stress and cellular damage. Overexpression studies in HEK293 cells with biochemical assay of hydrolysis of a labelled substrate convincingly demonstrate nearly complete loss of function of the missense mutations identified in the probands, in keeping with structural modelling suggesting important roles in stabilising the active site of the enzyme. Overexpressed mutant but not wild type enzyme appeared to aggregate in the endoplasmic reticulum, giving rise to speculation that they might exert a dominant negative effect over co-expressed wild type.</p><p>In further studies, Crispr/CAS9 editing was used to knock out Ephx1 in 3T3-L1 cells, a clonal mouse embryo-fibroblast preadipocyte model. After selection of a polyclonal population of cells with knockdown, it was demonstrated that knockout but not control cells could differentiate into mature adipocytes, with reduced insulin responsiveness. Finally, both knockout 3T3-L1 cells and primary dermal fibroblasts were shown to have some increased markers of replicative senescence, including reduced proliferation, increased SA β-gal staining, increased reactive oxygen species, increased phosphorylation of p53, and increased protein expression of p21 and p16.</p><p>Overall, this study will be of interest in particular to genetecists, metabolic physicians, adipose biologists, and to those studying ageing. Although the argument is not developed in detail, loss of EPHX1 could confer lipodystrophy and insulin resistance in at least 2 ways. First, by allowing accumulation of toxic ROS, it may increase DNA damage and cellular ageing in adipose precursor or mesenchymal stem cells. Disorders such as Werner syndrome already suggest that this lineage is particularly vulnerable to DNA damage. It is also possible that EPHX1 deficiency reduces generation of an important endogenous ligand of PPARG, the master adipogenic transcription factor, though this is more difficult to prove.</p><p>The evidence in this study that EPHX1 mutations cause the syndrome described is moderately convincing but could be enhanced, and the variants found clearly abrogate enzyme function. The evidence for a dominant mechanism mechanism of action is circumstantial only, while some aspects of the phenotypic description seem an overreach based on the data presented.

In searching for specific information to address this issue, we found a very recent publication by the Reviewer 3’s team providing key elements (Huang-Doran I et al.

In particular, total testosterone (TT) levels were measured in 173 women with lipodystrophy with a median level of 24.0 ng/dL (interquartile range: 20 – 59 ng/dL), i.e. median: 0.83 nmol/L (interquartile range: 0.69 – 2.04 nmol/L), whereas the TT levels in patient 1 were 16.9 nmol/L. In the revised version of the manuscript (Page 14), we now discuss the potential contribution of insulin resistance in hyperandrogenism signs, in relation to TT levels as follows: “Regarding hormonal pathophysiology, patient 1 developed amenorrhea associated with steroidogenesis alterations.

It is implied that leptin may be a specific treatment for this disorder. In fact the response to leptin is entirely as expected from this degree of lipodystrophy and baseline serum leptin.

Raw exome data are not made available as part of this study. This is commonly done in human genetic studies, and I assume that when the authors say it cannot be done here, they mean that suitable consent is not in place. This is reasonable but should be explicit. Without such raw data it would be helpful to readers to have more genetic information. The headline finding of a de novo EPHX1 mutation is given, but were there any other de novo, compound heterozygous or homozygous, rare, likely loss of function mutations in the first proband studied?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this important issue, we have provided two Supplementary Files listing the characteristics of all rare de novo, compound heterozygous, and homozygous variants, as well as the reasons for their exclusion.

In the GnomAD repository (up to around 250,000 alleles), there is no evidence of selection against EPHX1 loss of function variants in the general population. I counted 66 loss-of-function alleles (nonsense/frameshift/essential splice site) and a large number of missense variants, including at least one affecting a residue in the catalytic triad. It is implausible, to me, that this syndrome occurs in all these people, and this suggests that heterozygous EPHX1 loss-of-function mutations are likely only rarely associated with the syndrome described, either because of low penetrance, or because simple loss of function of one allele is insufficient. This gives circumstancial support for the notion that only certain mutations that produce dominant negative activity may be required for disease. This does not undermine the case made in the manuscript, but may be worthy of comment.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct with this comment, and we have better discussed this issue in the revised version of the manuscript (Pages 16-17) as follows: “The gnomAD database, which collects variants from the general population, reports several dozen predicted loss-of-function variants in <italic>EPHX1</italic>, including nonsense, frameshift and canonical splice site variants. […] Additional studies will be required to better understand EPHX1 activity when embedded in the microsomal ER membranes in endogenous conditions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Evidence for mechanism linking EPHX1 mutations to lipodystrophy:</p><p>6.

Nevertheless 3T3-L1 cells are derived from mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and it is notable that Ephx1 knockout mouse were reported to be phenotypically normal (J. Biol. Chem. 274: 23963-23968). This is worth discussing.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with Reviewer #3 that the fact that <italic>Ephx1</italic> knock-out mice are phenotypically normal is worth being discussed. This information has been discussed into the revised manuscript (Page 17) as follows: “Regarding available animal models, <italic>Ephx1</italic> knock-out mice have already been generated (80).

Although insulin signalling appears impaired, is this simply a consequence of impaired differentiation, when expression of the insulin receptor normally increases? What about insulin signalling in preadipocytes? Any reduction could also be an indirect consequence of senescence. Although the patients have systemic insulin resistance, this does NOT necessarily need to correspond to a cell autonomous defect in insulin action. Adipose dysfunction would suffice to explain the clinical derangement.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that impaired insulin signaling may be a simple consequence of impaired differentiation, we thus investigated insulin signaling in pre-adipocytes. These data have been included, together with a Figure 4—figure supplement 4, into the revised manuscript (Page 11) as follows: “In contrast, the <italic>Ephx1</italic> KO cells were resistant to insulin, both in pre-adipocytes and differentiated cells, as shown by the lack or strong decrease in the phosphorylation of these intermediates upon insulin stimulation (Figure 4F and Figure 4—figure supplement 4)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The evidence for a dominant negative mechanism of action of the mutant enzymes is circumstantial only, though very plausible. The aggregates seen in HEK293s may be relevant, but this is not clear in such overexpression studies. Nevertheless it would appear straightforward to conduct some further studies in this model, looking at the ability of co-expressed mutant to reduce activity of co-expressed wild type enzyme, as long as care is taken to include suitable controls.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by Reviewer #3, we have investigated the ability of co-expressed mutant EPHX1 isoforms to reduce the activity of the wild-type (WT) protein. We first transfected increasing amounts of plasmids encoding the WT and mutated forms of EPHX1 in HEK293 cells, and examined the ability of cell lysates to hydrolyze [<sup>3</sup>H]-cSO substrate, as described in the first version of the manuscript. The total amount of transfected plasmid was kept constant using an empty vector (2 μg). We could confirm that the two variants identified in patients completely abolish the enzyme activity, whereas the WT isoform catalyzes c-SO hydrolysis in a dose-dependent manner. However, we could not observe a dominant negative effect when we co-expressed WT and mutated isoforms. For example, the hydrolysis activity of lysates co-expressing WT EPHX1 (1μg) and one mutated isoform (1μg) was roughly the same as that of lysates transfected only with WT EPHX1 (1μg).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68445-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Of note, this cellular assay consisted of the hydrolysis of a radioactive synthetic substrate and was performed on protein lysates in overexpression studies. Thus, we cannot exclude that the mutants will exert a dominant negative effect on WT EPHX1 in vivo, since the dynamics of protein interaction in the endoplasmic reticulum under endogenous conditions might be different. In this regard, it has been proposed that EPHX1 might aggregate into oligomers (Zhou J, et al., Structure. 2000 Feb 15;8(2):111-22). Technical advances are needed to further investigate this dominant negative effect. For example, good antibodies and relevant assays to visualize hydrolysis activity in cells, such as Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer, need to be developed.The possibility that mutants may exert a dominant negative effect on the WT protein in vivo is better addressed in the revised manuscript (Pages 16-17) and a Figure 2—figure supplement 2 has been added: “The gnomAD database, which collects variants from the general population, reports several dozen predicted loss-of-function variants in <italic>EPHX1</italic>, including nonsense, frameshift and canonical splice site variants.

One of the challenges in studying primary dermal fibroblasts is that &quot;passage 1&quot; is often timed from establishment of outgrown cells in the lab, which in turn may take weeks from the time of tissue biospy. Could the authors clarify that the cells and controls used had roughly been through the same length of time and/or doubling times in culture?</p></disp-quote><p>We confirm that dermal fibroblasts from patients and controls spent roughly the same length of time in culture for the establishment of each cell culture. They were cryopreserved at passage 2. For the experiment presented in the manuscript, fibroblasts from controls were at passage 9 while those from patient 1 at passage 4. This is described in the Methods section (Page 22).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Was there evidence of increased DNA damage in affected cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Compelling evidence demonstrate that DNA damage is a common mediator for both replicative senescence, which is triggered by telomere shortening, and premature cellular senescence induced by various stressors such as oncogenic and oxidative stress (Chen J-H et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007 Dec;35(22):7417-28). Reviewer #3 is certainly right that DNA damage may occur in both fibroblasts of patient 1 and 3T3-L1 knock-out cells. However, we believe that DNA damage investigation may distract the reader from our main messages, and that these experiments should be part of a follow-up study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Speculation that loss of Ephx1 may alter generation of endogenous agonists (and maybe) antagonists of PPARG is interesting but untested.</p></disp-quote><p>As stressed by Reviewer #3, the link between the lack of EPHX1 activity, the adipogenesis defect and the deregulation of PPARγ signaling is an interesting perspective to this study. We have better discussed this possibility (Page 15) as follows: “What is the cellular link between the loss of EPHX1 activity and adipogenesis defect? EPHX1 substrates might play a key role since oxylipins, which are EPHXA substrates, target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) to modify adipocyte formation and function (67). […] Additional experiments will be required to precisely define the link between the loss of EPHX1 and adipogenesis alteration, which might involve the deregulation of endogenous PPARγ agonists or antagonists.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13.
