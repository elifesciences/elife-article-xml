The main tissue components are a stratified squamous epithelium and an underlying connective tissue layer, called the <italic>lamina propria,</italic> and both compartments undergo dynamic changes in response to disease. Oral mucosa also shows significant structural variation in distinct regions of the oral cavity, and three main types are recognised according to their primary function: masticatory mucosa, lining mucosa, and specialised mucosa. Despite its similarities to human skin, oral mucosa undergoes faster cellular turnover and shows limited scarring following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iglesias-Bartolome et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Masticatory mucosa or <italic>gingiva</italic> (tooth-associated mucosa) is the first structure to be affected by an oral chronic disease – periodontitis, which represents the 11th more prevalent worldwide disease and is highly correlated with the worsening of systemic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kinane et al., 2017</xref>). Recent studies from our lab and others have described the oral mucosa transcriptional profile demonstrating that it is a highly heterogeneous and complex tissue with dynamic recruitment and expansion and/or depletion of various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caetano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Williams et al., 2021</xref>); however, understanding their joint interaction and consequently their functionality <italic>in situ</italic> is not well understood. The isolation and characterisation of single cells at a high resolution is valuable, but it is still insufficient for understanding complex biological behaviours. These analyses still approach cells as isolated functional units, and while it may be reasonable that a response is determined by a single cell type in a particular state, an alternative hypothesis is that the interaction of multiple cells in diverse states is what drives response to disease or therapy.</p><p>Recent years have witnessed the advances in spatial transcriptomic and computational technologies. These tools enable untargeted and comprehensive capture of cellular transcriptomic profiles <italic>in situ</italic>, and therefore, can overcome limitations of <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (ISH), and allow discoveries of previously undetectable transcriptomic changes. The cellular architecture of tissues, where distinct cell types are organised in space, underlies cell–cell communication, organ function, and pathology as physical proximity often reflects relatedness. Thus, the spatial information of cell transcriptomes provides information about how cells coordinate to perform their biological functions in cell–cell signalling mechanisms.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to understand how oral mucosa tissue organisation (structure) is related to tissue physiology (function) by applying unbiased spatial transcriptomics methods and high-resolution microscopy. By studying spatial cellular interactions, we aimed to explain the variation observed within cell types in dissociation-based protocols. We characterise a rare immunogenic fibroblast population, which supports our and other studies on the emerging role of stromal cells in shaping tissue pathology by controlling local immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Croft et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davidson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kinchen et al., 2018</xref>). Understanding the spatial tissue context determining fibroblast–immune cell interactions is vital to identify location-specific signalling events shaping disease, whilst offering novel therapeutic avenues to patients with chronic infection and inflammation. In short, we exploit high-throughput spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq to create a large-scale tissue atlas of human oral mucosa in health and disease, charting changes across location and tissue compartments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Molecular spatial reconstruction of the human oral mucosa in health</title><p>The function of many biological systems depends on the spatial organisation of their cells; genes need to be properly regulated in space for a system to function. To systematically study the spatial patterns of gene expression of human oral mucosa that we previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caetano et al., 2021</xref>) and understand <italic>in situ</italic> tissue organisation, healthy human oral mucosa samples were analysed by spatial transcriptomics (ST) (10X Genomics Visium) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Two distinct anatomical locations were used in our analyses – buccal (anterior; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–F</xref>) and palatal (posterior; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) from three individuals. In each experiment, 10-µm-thick paraffin and 15-µm-thick cryosection slices from five individual healthy samples in total were analysed. We generated two technical replicates for two biological replicates to understand technical variability and no major differences were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). Sequencing data were processed and integrated to generate spatial transcriptomes of each section. Typically, this captured more than 40,000 mean reads under tissue per spot representing over 2000 genes per 55 µm spot. We then performed unsupervised clustering, and clusters were associated with tissue structure, followed by manual validation and annotation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spatial map of the human oral mucosa.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of study design for human oral mucosa.

To address this low resolution, we used a new computational tool to deconvolute each spot and predict the underlying composition of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). This method uses neighbour structure in spatial transcriptomic data to increase the resolution at a subspot level and infers from the existing literature for use of Bayesian statistics to achieve high-resolution images. Thus, we were able to improve our mapping that allowed us to predict gene expression at higher resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Transcriptional regions were annotated based on known epithelial and stromal transcriptional signatures and histological assessment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Most cluster regions were distributed in layers, highlighting that the largest determinant of transcriptional/cellular spatial variability corresponds to tissue depth as described in other barrier organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fawkner-Corbett et al., 2021</xref>). We further investigated each individual region and generated spatially variable features that we used to annotate each region. We found molecular patterns that mapped into known anatomical areas; for example, <italic>KRT1</italic> mapped into the suprabasal epithelial region, and <italic>KRT15</italic> into the basal epithelial layer. Within the less characterised lamina propria we observed transcriptionally distinct regions with possibly distinct cellular functions; for example, the subepithelial stromal region shows specific GO terms for epidermis development, stem cell differentiation, and morphogenesis of the epithelium, which follows recent research on subepithelial niche areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kinchen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shoshkes-Carmel et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, lower reticular regions show mostly ECM organisation terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These results follow the known compartmentalised of papillary and reticular fibroblasts in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Plikus et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, our analyses yield the first comprehensive molecular <italic>in situ</italic> description of the human oral mucosa in health, with the discovery of transcriptionally distinct regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Remodelling of the human oral mucosa structure in oral chronic inflammatory disease</title><p>To understand how tissue organisation is reshaped in disease, we investigated changes in tissue organisation and gene expression in patients with periodontal disease. We again undertook ST (10X Visium) on tissue from four different patient samples. Analyses of transcriptional signatures of ST spots identified between 5 and 10 spot clusters in each slide, which again mapped to discreet anatomical locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–E</xref>). We readily identified similar cluster regions as detected in healthy mucosa, and we observed hallmarks of a pro-inflammatory tissue microenvironment in disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). To validate the spatial transcriptomes that we obtained, we compared spatial expression patterns of top marker genes of oral mucosa tissue with known tissue markers. The spatial patterns of these transcripts matched well with those of immunohistochemistry (IHC) results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We also observed several disease-associated changes in the stromal compartment, exemplified by an overall upregulation of pro-inflammatory gene signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), and upregulation of genes involved in vascular transport (<italic>CXCL12</italic>) and blood vessel morphogenesis (<italic>CLDN5, TAGLN</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

To investigate how surrounding cells may shape signalling in the oral mucosa across health and disease, we used a cell–cell communication pipeline that considers spatial cellular colocalisation when mapping ligand–receptor pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dries et al., 2021</xref>).

This localised well-characterised cell types, such as proliferative epithelial cells mapped at the basal epithelial layer, and suprabasal keratinocytes in the suprabasal layer.

In brief, we examined the expression of cell type-specific marker genes at the spot level and after enhancement. We aggregated the expression of marker genes within each cell type from the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caetano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Williams et al., 2021</xref>) by summing their log-normalised expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Importantly, we observed a substantial increase in endothelial cell expression and distribution in the oral subepithelial and reticular stroma, which contradicts our scRNA-seq analysis alone emphasising the need to complement single-cell analyses with other data modalities. We then applied this method to understand immune cell composition, organisation, and abundance patterns.

Single-cell technologies have changed our ability to study the molecular properties of these cells; however, their positional specification remains limited due to difficulties in specifying them since they share many common markers.</p><p>To identify regionally enriched fibroblasts, we first annotated and spatially mapped five molecularly distinct fibroblast subtypes that were identified based on our scRNA-seq reference. In brief, we considered fibroblast 1–5 in our initial analysis. We then applied the ‘anchor’-based integration from Seurat to merge these cells across all seven Visium datasets to obtain prediction scores for each spot for each class of fibroblast. Only three of the five subtypes mapped into our spatial data; therefore, we used BayesSpace to map all subtypes using Seurat differential gene expression markers data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The extent of molecular heterogeneity across these subtypes (measured by the number of marker genes) is as expected lower than that across different broad cell types, demonstrating the transcriptionally fine-grained nature of these cell populations. We identified subtypes that were spatially enriched in the reticular (Fb1, Fb3), subepithelial (Fb2), and immune enriched regions (Fb4, Fb5). This mapping largely confirmed previous spatial predictions based on their individual transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Fibroblast 2 (<italic>GREM1<sup>+</sup>, SFRP1</italic><sup>+</sup>) showed an increased spatial enrichment in the subepithelial region compared to the other subtypes, and a substantial enrichment in the sulcular stroma, suggestive of a role in epithelial maintenance.

Profiling the human oral mucosa in space is essential to define cell states and signalling pathways in health and oral chronic inflammation. This cellular and tissue reference will improve our understanding of the molecular and cellular deviations occurring in one of the highest prevalent chronic conditions. Furthermore, due to a remarkable wound-healing capacity, understanding this tissue at such resolution might provide new approaches for tissue engineering therapies.</p><p>Previously, we provided the first description of the human oral mucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caetano et al., 2021</xref>) at a single-cell level, demonstrating that cellular remodelling in disease is highly heterogenous, occurring in a cell-specific manner, where populations involved in tissue maintenance are compromised and pro-inflammatory ones persist or expand. Subsequent similar studies were able to support these findings in a larger cohort of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Williams et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we present an integration of dissociated single-cell, spatial transcriptomics, and high-resolution quantitative multiplex imaging to achieve a high-throughput approach to map tissue cell types and cell signalling <italic>in situ</italic>. We asked whether diseased tissue structure drive changes in oral mucosa cell decisions, and whether there is a connection between immune composition and tissue architecture.</p><p>We found that the lamina propria can be divided in highly specialised spatial compartments distinctively involved in epithelial maintenance, ECM remodelling, and immune regulation. We discovered pro-inflammatory stromal features involved in neutrophil recruitment in the junctional epithelium region, and an angiogenic stromal signature in the sulcus. We were also able to provide the first molecular mapping of the three distinct epithelia that compose the masticatory mucosa, and how the underlying lamina propria seems to be specified to each epithelial compartment. Of these, the junctional epithelium attaches directly to the tooth surface and its destruction leads to inflammation and alveolar bone loss; thus, understanding how this compartment is maintained remains a goal in the field. Of interest, we found <italic>SOX9</italic> expression restricted to the junctional epithelium. Recent lineage-tracing studies have suggested the presence of Wnt-responsive stem cells contributing to tissue renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tanaka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yuan et al., 2021</xref>), but their identity remains unknown. <italic>SOX9</italic> is known to be expressed in stem cells/progenitors in the gut and skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jo et al., 2014</xref>); thus, we hypothesise that it may label similar populations in the human oral mucosa. Further lineage-tracing studies will be required to test this. Within the junctional epithelium, we were also able to identify a rare proliferative population that we previously identified in our reference dataset, expressing <italic>TOP2A</italic> and <italic>CENPF. TOP2A</italic> targets are largely transcribed in embryonic stem cells, and a study demonstrated a critical role in defining stem cell pluripotency and differentiation potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thakurela et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, we attempted to link disease susceptibility with phenotype by mapping known risk genes, and surprisingly, identified a restricted expression in the junctional epithelium for <italic>CDKN2B, IL1A, IL1B,</italic> and <italic>VAMP8,</italic> suggesting that junctional epithelium dysfunction underlies periodontitis pathogenesis.</p><p>We provided a candidate <italic>in situ</italic> cell–cell communication network showing the emergence of a stromal–immune–endothelial axis in disease, which also revealed an increase in WNT receptor expression in basal–subepithelial interactions. In the healthy mucosa, we detected increased interactions between basal and suprabasal epithelial cells governed by <italic>ADAM17</italic> and <italic>NOTCH1</italic>. The oral epithelium exhibits a remarkable epithelial turnover; however, our understanding of oral epithelial interactions and how epithelial differentiation is regulated is limited.</p><p>While recent studies have studied oral epithelial stem cell/progenitors’ heterogeneity and their role in tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byrd et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 2019</xref>), much less is known about mesenchymal cells’ heterogeneity and role in tissue maintenance. This is explained by a lack of robust markers and the difficulty of successful lineage tracing studies given that these cells are not maintained together. We previously identified five distinct fibroblast populations in the human oral mucosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caetano et al., 2021</xref>) however, we found a small number of transcriptional differences which conditioned a successful mapping of these cells with traditional <italic>in situ</italic> techniques.

CXCL8</italic> is a major activating chemotactic factor of human neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luster, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2012</xref>) and a potent angiogenic factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heidemann et al., 2003</xref>); <italic>CXCL10</italic> was initially identified as a chemokine secreted by several cell types in response to IFN-γ, regulating immune responses through the recruitment of leukocytes, including T cells and macrophages, and activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). More recently, it was found as a critical regulator of intestinal immunity in an enteric glia axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Progatzky et al., 2021</xref>). This pathogenic population also highly expresses <italic>ALOX5AP</italic>, which is known to control leukotriene production from arachidonic acid. Interestingly, it was recently found to also modulate formation of early blood progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ibarra-Soria et al., 2018</xref>). Periodontal lesions are associated with activation of pathological angiogenesis and a high number of newly formed blood vessels that facilitate local immune cell migration. It will be intriguing to decipher how the leukotriene pathway promotes the formation of blood progenitor cells in the oral mucosa; this pathway will be easier to exploit in a translational setting because of the ready availability of small-molecule agonists and antagonists. Collectively, our data suggest the emergence of a rare and spatially restricted pathogenic fibroblast population responsible for neutrophil and lymphocyte recruitment at pocket sites, and with angiogenic properties. We suggest that this population is responsible for irregular chemokine gradients, resulting in the capture and accumulation of inflammatory cells. Thus, we speculate that this fibroblast may help in the transition from innate to adaptive immunity and in the development of persistent inflammation characteristic of periodontitis, as suggested in other chronic inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davidson et al., 2021</xref>). Once fibroblasts are exposed to persistent inflammation, they sustain lymphocyte retention which may reflect their inability to return to a homeostatic state. In fact, these cells are resistant to apoptosis and retain pathogenic features in the absence of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Whitaker et al., 2013</xref>). Discreet pathogenic populations are also present in other chronic inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Croft et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kinchen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smillie et al., 2019</xref>), which are largely defined by their anatomical location. The relationship between tissue specificity and pathological cues in shaping fibroblast phenotype and heterogeneity in disease is still a source of much debate; however, given that fibroblasts are embedded in a network of immune, epithelial, and endothelial populations, they adopt properties and address codes to complex paracrine cues from surrounding cells. Thus, our integrative map of cellular profiles will serve as an essential reference for the study of mucosal homeostasis and chronic inflammatory disease, as well as a blueprint for tissue engineering approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Tissues underwent three 5 min washes in PBS at room temperature followed by dehydration washes in increasing ethanol concentrations. After dehydration, tissue was processed using a Leica ASP300 Tissue Processing for 1 hr. Tissues were then embedded in paraffin and stored at 4°C. For the frozen method, samples were collected immediately after clinical surgery (within 30 min), snap-frozen in O.C.T. compound using liquid nitrogen, and subsequently stored at –80°C in an air-tight container. Frozen blocks were tested for RNA quality with RIN &gt; 8 for frozen tissues (RNA pico, Agilent) and three tissue optimisation experiments (10X Genomics, Visium Spatial Tissue Optimisation, Rev A) were performed with imaging of fluorescence footprint on a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 microscope and image analysis performed in Fiji (ImageJ v2.0.0).

Frozen samples were cut in a pre-cooled cryostat at 15 µm thickness onto four 6.5 mm × 6.5 mm capture areas with 5000 oligo-barcoded spots. For some samples (patients 43 and 45), n = 2 technical replicates were performed. Slides then underwent fixation and H&amp;E staining with immediate imaging on Nanozoomer S60 (Hamamatsu) at ×40 magnification. Tissue underwent permeabilisation with proprietary enzyme (12 min), reverse transcription, and second-strand synthesis performed on the slide with cDNA quantification undertaken with qRT-PCR using KAPA SYBR FAST-qPCR kit (KAPA Systems) and analysed on the QuantStudio 7-Flex system (Thermo Fisher). FFPE samples were cut at the standardised 5 µm thickness onto four 6.5 mm × 6.5 mm capture areas. Slides then underwent deparaffinisation and H&amp;E staining according to the manufacturer’s instructions (10X Genomics, Visium Spatial) with immediate imaging on Nanozoomer S60 (Hamamatsu) at ×40 magnification.

Primary antibodies (anti-KRT14 ab7800; anti-KRT76 HPA019656) were diluted in blocking buffer with 1% of the respective blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4°C. The following day, slides were washed three times in PBST and incubated with the respective secondary antibodies diluted 1:500 in 1% blocking buffer for 1 hr at room temperature.

Cluster distributions were visualised in spatial context over H&amp;E images with spot size scaling factor of 2–3.5 used throughout. Our previous scRNA-seq dataset (GSE152042) was integrated via FindTransferAnchors and TransferData functions in Seurat to predict spot content for each slide. To further increase data resolution at a subspot level, we applied the BayesSpace package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, Visium datasets processed with Space Ranger were loaded directly via the readVisium function. In all datasets, raw gene expression counts were log transformed and normalised using the spatialPreprocess function and PCA was then performed on the top 2000 most highly variable genes. We used qTune and qPlot to determine the optimum number of principal components. Clustering was performed using a Bayesian model with a Markov random field. To enhance the resolution of this clustering map, we segmented each spot into subspots with the spatialEnhance function and again leveraged spatial information using the Potts model spatial prior; it segments each Visium spot into six subspots and computes enhanced resolution PC vectors using a regression algorithm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Marker gene detection and differential expression analyses</title><p>For all marker gene expression, we used R packages Seurat and BayesSpace.

The results of &quot;Molecular spatial reconstruction of the human oral mucosa in health&quot; (Figure 1) are suggested to be validated using FISH or IHC. In addition, the authors need to describe the sample size of the study more clearly. Figure 1A shows a sample size of 7, but the main text describes 5 healthy samples, and 4 periodontitis samples are included.</p><p>2. Figure 2E shows the markers for each tissue compartment, and which of these 41 markers need to be tagged as pro-inflammatory genes to corroborate the authors' conclusion that &quot;we also observed several disease-related changes in the stromal compartment. For example, the overall upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes.&quot;</p><p>3. The authors cited a reference (Nibali et al., 2019) to analyze the transcriptional defects that might drive the process of periodontitis, but no specific periodontitis-associated genes were given in this article. In addition, the &quot;21 known disease gene&quot; used in the article needs to be shown in the supplemental table. Since it is not known which 21 known disease genes were examined by the authors, it is not possible to determine &quot;In summary, our analysis suggests that dysfunctional junctional epithelium might be a major driver of periodontal disease pathogenesis.&quot;</p><p>4. In Figure 2E, the image that validates the spatial transcriptome results, the results of KTR76 do not seem to match</p><p>5. The authors concluded that &quot;KRT13 and KRT4 being restricted to the sulcular epithelium and KRT13 specific to the junctional epithelium&quot;, but the results showed that KRT13 was not specifically distributed in the epithelium. The same was observed for <italic>SOX9</italic>.</p><p>6. There are several errors in the Figures in the section &quot;Effect of tissue microenvironments on epithelial identity and dynamics&quot;. For example, Figure 3B does not provide the results of FOXP2 and NEFM expression and Figure 2G has no results related to the signaling pathway.</p><p>7. Microenvironments are not well characterized by only looking at gene expression levels in the section &quot;Effect of tissue microenvironments on epithelial identity and dynamics&quot;.</p><p>8. According to the legend of Figure 4A, the abundant interactions are depicted in red. However, the results labeled in red in the healthy samples are not epithelial and basal epithelial layers which are not consistent with the authors' description that &quot;in health we observed a major interaction between the epithelial and basal epithelial layers.&quot;</p><p>9. Is there any other explanation for &quot;we observed a substantial increase in endothelial cell expression and distribution in the oral subepithelial and reticular stroma, which contradicts our scRNA-seq analysis alone emphasizing the need to complement single-cell analyses with other data modalities.&quot;?</p><p>10. The markers of cells in Figures 5A and B are critical, but the authors do not provide this information.</p><p>11.

We don’t think that the lack of previous spatial transcriptome data of oral mucosa tissue affects the reliability of this method; however, as the technology matures our limitations will be overcome particularly regarding resolution. Understanding the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms of oral mucosa cellular remodelling processes in disease in their spatial context will be key to improve our current understanding of oral mucosa physiology. In contrast to single-cell RNA sequencing methods, we are not treating or digesting the tissue with enzymes or extracting cells from their local environment, therefore the impact on gene expression is substantially inferior compared to single-cell RNA sequencing. Because of this key difference, we expect differences between single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial data, which can preclude successful data integration. We were not successful in mapping all fibroblasts using one strategy (anchor-based integration) because this integration is performed on low resolution Visium datasets which is unable to uncover fine cell subtypes, such as fibroblasts. When we performed integration using a higher spatial resolution method, we could map these cells.</p><p>In our initial single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, some gingiva cells were indeed missing due to technical limitations; for example, neutrophils were not captured given their fragile nature and low RNA content. With the spatial data, we could detect these and other immune cell types that were originally undetected. In conclusion, for a robust and unbiased molecular characterisation of human oral mucosa, spatial transcriptome data is essential.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Although the authors did the identification of the captured tissues, the results seem to require more analysis. Take Figure 5A as an example, there is a clear overlap between endothelial cells and basal cells. In addition, it is suggested that the authors indicate the specific location of the 10 clusters of cells in Figures 1D and 2C.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. Endothelial cells in Figure 5A have a predominantly subepithelial location as shown; however, these also localise in interpapillary regions which can be confounded with basal areas given the current resolution. We highlight that these analyses are not single-cell resolution. We applied a deconvolution method to increase the original spatial data resolution (55 µm), but it is still not true single-cell resolution.</p><p>In Figure 1D and 2C we are not showing clusters of cells, but spatial/anatomical cluster regions; for example, epithelial and stromal regions. These regions contain, especially stromal areas, information of multiple cell types. We can map epithelial regions as these are generally well defined (Figure 2F), but validating stromal regions becomes more difficult. To address this, we mapped individual cell types (Figures 5 and 6) and focused on locating and validating our cell type of interest (Fibroblast 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Healthy gingival tissues were taken from seven individuals. It would be helpful to know whether there was significant individual variation in cell clusters among these samples. Furthermore, regarding gingival tissue collected from patients with periodontitis, were these tissue samples collected from similar anatomical regions/locations?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising the importance of individual variability. We did not detect differences in the anatomical location of canonical structural cell types (e.g., basal keratinocytes, suprabasal keratinocytes); however, stromal cell types with a less defined positional identity or without a fixed tissue position (e.g., migrating immune cells) differed across patient samples as expected. In common across disease samples, we found that there was generally a highly immunogenic area where lymphoid and myeloid cells are highly expressed (stromal reticular regions). We have now added gene lists and hierarchical clustering analyses for each patient sample. These samples were all collected from first and second molars, except for patient 41 where tissues were collected from a second lower premolar.</p><p>Spatial clusters (not cell type clusters) differed in number due to different sample sizes and interindividual structural variation; for example, patients 35, 41 and 7 have a considerably small tissue surface area, therefore the number of anatomical clusters analysed are reduced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In healthy gingiva, the authors identified dominant interactions between suprabasal and basal epithelial cells. The authors should comment on the biological significance of these interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestion. The oral epithelium exhibits a remarkable epithelial turnover, therefore understanding basal and suprabasal cell interactions is essential to understand tissue physiology. Furthermore, it has been reported that in the skin, stem cell renewal is induced by the differentiation of neighbouring cells (Mesa <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018, <italic>Cell Stem Cell</italic>), thus understanding the physiological factors that drive stem cell self-renewal will expand our knowledge of epidermal homeostasis and regeneration. Our high-resolution spatial mapping provides a remarkable new opportunity to address these questions. In our communication analyses, we detected high probability of interactions between ADAM17-NOTCH1. The roles of Notch signalling in proliferation and differentiation of stem/progenitor cells have been actively studied in various tissues, including the developing lung and intestine (Chiba, 2006; Tsao <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009; van der Flier and Clevers, 2009; Rock <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011). It is therefore possible that Notch signalling regulates both oral progenitor proliferation and differentiation. We have now added a comment in the Discussion section (Line 689).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Are those rare pro-inflammatory fibroblasts close to junctional epithelium?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, from the patient samples where we can have a clear tissue orientation this population localises next to the junctional epithelium as shown in Figure 7 and Figure 6 – supplement 1. We have now added better image annotations for landmark structures (Figure 2 A,B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The organization of the cell populations under healthy conditions and periodontitis is very different based on the data shown in Figure 1D and Figure 2C. The authors should compare these populations more clearly and explain the reason behind this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your suggestion. The clusters shown on Figure 1D and Figure 2C correspond to anatomical/spatial clusters, and not cell types. We agree that in an ideal experimental set up, patient samples would be collected with the exact same sampling; however, because each patient has distinct treatment needs, clinical samples will consequently have structural variation depending on the excision performed. The differences between 1D and 2C are essentially because in 2C the excision extended from buccal to interproximal and therefore we could profile oral, sulcular and junctional epithelium, whereas in 1D this distinction is not present. However, when we compare the same histomorphological regions (e.g., stromal oral subepithelial, 1G-2G), we observe similar features, such as terms enriched for ‘epidermis development’, suggesting that the function of specific anatomical landmarks are conserved across patients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. There are ten cell populations shown in Figure 1F and Figure 2D but the interactions highlighted in Figure 4 only have six groups. Could the authors explain this?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for highlighting this, and we should have made it clearer. The algorithm used for the communications analyses requires its own clustering step, and therefore the outcome is different from our high-resolution clustering analysis. We agree this is a major limitation and using a computational method that encompasses both analyses would provide more data cohesion. Despite the inferior clustering resolution of the ligand-receptor computational method, we could still detect critical regions of interest, such as basal-subepithelial and basal-suprabasal that provided novel insights into key signalling pathways <italic>in situ.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The heatmap including the differential gene expression profile needs to be shown for the fibroblasts annotated in Figure 6, in addition to the Dot plot. Moreover, the distribution of Fb1-Fb4 is quite similar under diseased conditions. What is the reason behind this?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion; a heatmap for all oral mucosa fibroblasts and DGE list can be found in Caetano <italic>et al.,</italic> 2022, therefore we did not include it in this publication – we have added a reference. We don’t know the answer to why in disease there is less spatial segregation between the different fibroblasts. We can only hypothesise that since these cells acquire a pro-inflammatory phenotype perhaps, they become functionally impaired in disease with loss of homeostatic positional information. Another reason could be derived from the fact that these subtypes show small transcriptional differences even in health, therefore when in a pro-inflammatory environment, these differences become less obvious as they become dysregulated. Nevertheless, we still observe some differences in disease; for example, Fb2 can still be seen around the subepithelial region, and Fb3 does not seem to localise in the most immunogenic region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The results of &quot;Molecular spatial reconstruction of the human oral mucosa in health&quot; (Figure 1) are suggested to be validated using FISH or IHC. In addition, the authors need to describe the sample size of the study more clearly. Figure 1A shows a sample size of 7, but the main text describes 5 healthy samples, and 4 periodontitis samples are included.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important comment. We used a total of 7 biological replicates plus 2 technical replicates (Patients 43 and 45; Figure 1 —figure supplement 2) in order to validate our method. In short, we used 3 healthy biological replicates and 2 healthy technical replicates, and 4 disease biological replicates, totalling 9 10X Visium samples. We have now made this distinction clearer in the main text (Lines 123, 124). In order to validate all spatial regions using FISH or IHC (specifically stromal regions) would require a significant amount of probes/antibodies analysed simultaneously as one spatial region is defined by multiple cell types; however, we did validate known spatial regions such as suprabasal and basal epithelial regions, and we also validated our main finding showing that fibroblast 5 co-localises with other immune cell types in Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 2E shows the markers for each tissue compartment, and which of these 41 markers need to be tagged as pro-inflammatory genes to corroborate the authors' conclusion that &quot;we also observed several disease-related changes in the stromal compartment. For example, the overall upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you – we agree there was not enough evidence to support these statements. We have now provided heatmaps of the top differential expressed genes for each region (Figure 1 – supplementary 1). To identify general tissue differences during disease remodelling, we compared the samples of distinct histomorphological regions and individuals at the molecular and compositional level. We observed common regions that we termed ‘immune-enriched’. Hierarchical clustering of the spatial transcriptomics clustering supports this finding; however, since the profile of each spatial transcriptomic dataset combines information of multiple cell types, we also assessed differences in cell composition determined by both spatial and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses (Figure 1—figure supplement 2; Figure 5—figure supplement 2). These immune-enriched regions in disease samples showed a larger proportion of lymphoid and myeloid cells (Figure 5; Figure 5—figure supplement 2, patient 35, patient 7), reflecting the expected role that immune cell interactions have in mucosal inflammation. In summary, these data enabled us to interindividual spatial differences, and to gain molecular insights of disease-specific spatial tissue remodelling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors cited a reference (Nibali et al., 2019) to analyze the transcriptional defects that might drive the process of periodontitis, but no specific periodontitis-associated genes were given in this article. In addition, the &quot;21 known disease gene&quot; used in the article needs to be shown in the supplemental table. Since it is not known which 21 known disease genes were examined by the authors, it is not possible to determine &quot;In summary, our analysis suggests that dysfunctional junctional epithelium might be a major driver of periodontal disease pathogenesis.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment – we agree that we should have provided the full list of the periodontitis risk genes analysed. We have included a new reference to our previous GWAS study whereby it’s clear which 21 genes were analysed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 2E, the image that validates the spatial transcriptome results, the results of KTR76 do not seem to match</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment; we agree that the immunostaining should have been from the same patient analysed in the spatial data shown on the left (Patient 30). However, both patient data show a clear matched suprabasal expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors concluded that &quot;KRT13 and KRT4 being restricted to the sulcular epithelium and KRT13 specific to the junctional epithelium&quot;, but the results showed that KRT13 was not specifically distributed in the epithelium. The same was observed for SOX9.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment; we agree that it is difficult to determine anatomical border zones with the data shown. We provided an H&amp;E staining in Figure 2 for clarity, where we can superimpose molecular and morphological data. We agree that KRT13 also shows marginal expression in the stromal regions, and we attributed this to the current low resolution of this method; however, we do see a higher expression in the sulcular region, and this is also supported by the top differentially expressed genes for this spatial region (now in supplementary data). <italic>SOX9</italic> shows a more restricted expression in the junctional epithelium (Figure 3A). We believe this is particularly an important finding since details of the molecular networks controlling human oral progenitor self-renewal remain unknown. Future studies, addressing the role of <italic>SOX9</italic> in the junctional epithelium will provide essential insights into oral tissue repair and remodelling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. There are several errors in the Figures in the section &quot;Effect of tissue microenvironments on epithelial identity and dynamics&quot;. For example, Figure 3B does not provide the results of FOXP2 and NEFM expression and Figure 2G has no results related to the signaling pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much – we have now corrected this and added FOXP2 and NEFM expression in Figure 3B. Do the reviewers mean Figure 1F instead of 2G? We added from line 299 a better explanation of these results by describing only Figure 3B in this section and not 1F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Microenvironments are not well characterized by only looking at gene expression levels in the section &quot;Effect of tissue microenvironments on epithelial identity and dynamics&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment – we have now changed the title of this section to ‘Oral epithelia regional heterogeneity’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. According to the legend of Figure 4A, the abundant interactions are depicted in red. However, the results labeled in red in the healthy samples are not epithelial and basal epithelial layers which are not consistent with the authors' description that &quot;in health we observed a major interaction between the epithelial and basal epithelial layers.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment; in figure 4A (health) enriched interactions are predominantly epithelial, suprabasal-basal and epithelial immune2-epithelial immune interactions. We have relabelled the group ‘suprabasal’ to ‘suprabasal epithelial’ to reduce ambiguity, as well as ‘basal’ to ‘basal epithelial’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Is there any other explanation for &quot;we observed a substantial increase in endothelial cell expression and distribution in the oral subepithelial and reticular stroma, which contradicts our scRNA-seq analysis alone emphasizing the need to complement single-cell analyses with other data modalities.&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this interesting finding – in our reference single-cell dataset, endothelial cells were found reduced in disease, however, in our spatial data the opposite is observed. It is likely because endothelial cells may be impacted by the enzymatic treatment needed to digest the tissue into a single cell suspension. Because spatial data does not suffer from this limitation, we can better capture an accurate <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue profile. The same happened for neutrophils whereby these could not be detected in the original single cell dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The markers of cells in Figures 5A and B are critical, but the authors do not provide this information.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much – we strongly agree with this suggestion. We combined expression of marker genes derived from our single-cell transcriptome analysis (Caetano <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021), but also from available oral mucosa single cell datasets (Williams <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021, Huang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021). We have now included in the text (line 367) these references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The raw spatial sequencing data obtained from patients used in this study is deposited under GSE206621. Are the results of the healthy control tissue also in this dataset?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, all patient samples used (healthy and disease) for spatial transcriptome analyses are deposited under GSE206621.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There are some specific questions that will need to be addressed before this manuscript is ready for publication.</p><p>1. Healthy gingival tissues were taken from seven individuals. It would be helpful to know whether there was significant individual variation in cell clusters among these samples. Furthermore, regarding gingival tissue collected from patients with periodontitis, were these tissue samples collected from similar anatomical regions/locations?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising the importance of individual variability. We did not detect differences in the anatomical location of canonical structural cell types (e.g., basal keratinocytes, suprabasal keratinocytes); however, cell types with less defined positional identity or without a fixed tissue position (e.g. migrating immune cells) differed across patient samples as expected. We found that in disease samples, there was generally a highly immunogenic area where various immune cells are highly expressed (stromal reticular regions). These samples were all collected from first and second molars, with the exception of patient 41 where tissues were collected from a second lower premolar.</p><p>Spatial clusters (not single cell clusters) differed in number due to different sample sizes; for example, patients 35, 41 and 7 have a considerably small tissue surface area, therefore the number of anatomical clusters analysed are reduced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In healthy gingiva, the authors identified dominant interactions between suprabasal and basal epithelial cells. The authors should comment on the biological significance of these interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the highly valuable suggestion. The oral epithelium exhibits a remarkable epithelial turnover, therefore understanding basal and suprabasal cell interactions is essential to understand tissue physiology. Furthermore, it has been reported that in the skin, stem cell renewal is induced by the differentiation of neighbouring cells (Mesa <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018, <italic>Cell Stem Cell</italic>), thus understanding the physiological factors that drive stem cell self-renewal will expand our knowledge of epidermal homeostasis and regeneration. Our high-resolution spatial mapping provides a remarkable new opportunity to address these questions. In our communication analyses, we detected high probability of interactions between ADAM17-NOTCH1. The roles of Notch signalling in proliferation and differentiation of stem/progenitor cells have been actively studied in various tissues, including the developing lung and intestine (Chiba, 2006; Tsao <italic>et al.,</italic> 2009; van der Flier and Clevers, 2009; Rock <italic>et al.,</italic> 2011). It is therefore possible that Notch signalling regulates both oral progenitor proliferation and differentiation. We have now added a comment in the Discussion section (Line 689), and we look forward to investigate this interesting finding in future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Are those rare pro-inflammatory fibroblasts close to junctional epithelium?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, from the patient samples where we can have a clear tissue orientation this population localises next to the junctional epithelium as shown in Figure 7 and Figure 6 – supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The organization of the cell populations under healthy conditions and periodontitis is very different based on the data shown in Figure 1D and Figure 2C. The authors should compare these populations more clearly and explain the reason behind this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your suggestion. The clusters shown on Figure 1D and Figure 2C correspond to anatomical/spatial clusters, and not cell types. We agree that in an ideal experimental set up, patient samples would be collected with the exact same sampling; however, because each patient has distinct treatment needs, clinical samples will consequently have structural variation depending on the excision performed. The differences between 1D and 2C are essentially because in 2C the excision extended from buccal to interproximal and therefore we could profile oral, sulcular and junctional epithelium, whereas in 1D this distinction is not present. However, when we compare the same identified regions (e.g. stromal oral subepithelial, 1G-2G), we observe similar features, such as ‘epidermis development’, suggesting that the function of specific anatomical regions are conserved across patients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. There are ten cell populations shown in Figure 1F and Figure 2D but the interactions highlighted in Figure 4 only have six groups. Could the authors explain this?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for highlighting this, and we should have made it clearer. The algorithm used for the communications analyses requires its own clustering step, and therefore the outcome is different from our high-resolution clustering analysis. We agree this is a major limitation and using a computational method that encompasses both analyses would provide more data cohesion. Despite the inferior clustering resolution of the ligand-receptor computational method, we could still detect critical regions of interest, such as basal-subepithelial and basal-suprabasal that provided novel insights into key signalling pathways <italic>in situ.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.
