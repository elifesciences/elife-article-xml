understand. Our ability to interpret this molecular fossil record is constrained by ignorance of the function of their molecular antecedents. To gain insight into the meaning of 2-methylhopanes, we quantified the dominant (des)methylated hopanoid species in the membranes of the model hopanoid-producing bacterium <italic>Rhodopseudomonas palustris</italic> TIE-1. Fluorescence polarization studies of small unilamellar vesicles revealed that hopanoid 2-methylation specifically renders native bacterial membranes more rigid at concentrations that are relevant in vivo. That hopanoids differentially modify native membrane rigidity as a function of their methylation state indicates that methylation itself promotes fitness under stress. Moreover, knowing the in vivo (2Me)-hopanoid concentration range in different cell membranes, and appreciating that (2Me)-hopanoids' biophysical effects are tuned by the lipid environment, permits the design of more relevant in vitro experiments to study their physiological functions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05663.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05663.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05663.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cell membrane that separates the inside of a cell from its outside environment is not a fixed structure. A cell can change the amount and type of different molecules in its membrane, which can alter the rigidity and permeability of the membrane and allow the cell to adapt to changing conditions.</p><p>The cell membranes of many bacteria contain molecules called hopanoids. Hopanes are the fossilized forms of these molecules and many hopanes are found extensively in sedimentary rocks. For example, 2-methylated hopanes—the fossilized forms of hopanoids that have a methyl group added to a particular carbon atom—have been found in ancient rocks that formed up to 1.6 billion years ago.</p><p>Many researchers have suggested that 2-methylated hopanes (and other molecular fossils) in sedimentary rocks could act as ‘biomarkers’ and be used to deduce what primitive life and ancient living conditions were like. Millions of years ago, several periods occurred where the Earth's oceans lost almost all of their oxygen; this likely placed all life on Earth under great stress. A greater proportion of the hopanes found in rocks formed during those periods are methylated than those seen in rocks from other time periods. However, it was difficult to interpret this observation about the fossil record, as the role of 2-methylated hopanoids in living bacterial cells was unknown.</p><p>Wu et al. have now investigated the role of 2-methylated hopanoids by performing experiments on bacterial membranes and found that 2-methylated hopanoids help the other molecules that make up the membrane to pack more tightly together. This makes the membrane more rigid, and the extent of this stiffening depends on the length of the 2-methylated hopanoid and on the other molecules that are present in the membrane. A more rigid membrane would protect the bacteria more in times of stress; therefore, rock layers containing an increased amount of 2-methylhopane are likely to indicate times when the bacteria living at that time were under a great deal of stress.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05663.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05663.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Rhodospeudomonas palustris</italic> TIE-1</kwd><kwd>2-methyl hopanoids</kwd><kwd>physiological function</kwd><kwd>biophysical properties</kwd><kwd>evolutionary interpretation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000104</institution-id><institution>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNX12AD93G</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Chia-Hung</given-names></name><name><surname>Bialecka-Fornal</surname><given-names>Maja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1224158</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Chia-Hung</given-names></name><name><surname>Bialecka-Fornal</surname><given-names>Maja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Chia-Hung</given-names></name><name><surname>Newman</surname><given-names>Dianne K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Methylation specifically enhances the ability of hopanoids to rigidify membranes under physiologically relevant conditions, which impacts the current interpretation of the 2-methylhopane fossil record.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lipids play essential roles in compartmentalizing cells for specific functions and creating barriers that are selectively permeable to the environment. The composition of lipids in cell membranes varies significantly and the basic biophysical properties of membranes, such as rigidity and permeability, can be adjusted based on growth conditions and environmental stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lipowsky and Sackmann, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Los and Murata, 2004</xref>; Neubauer et al., 2014). One well-studied example is cholesterol in eukaryotic membranes. This essential sterol plays diverse roles in maintaining membrane structural integrity, modifying membrane rigidity, serving as a biosynthetic precursor for steroid hormones, vitamin D, and bile acids, or acting as a protein modifier for signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hanukoglu, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gallet, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Song et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to their important biological functions, lipids are of interest because they are more geostable than other biomolecules. For example, hopanoid molecular fossils, ‘hopanes’, date back over a billion years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brocks et al., 2005</xref>) and are so abundant that the global stock of hopanoids that can be extracted from sedimentary rocks is estimated to be 10<sup>13</sup> or 10<sup>14</sup> tons, more than the estimated 10<sup>12</sup> tons of organic carbon in all living organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ourisson et al., 1984</xref>). In contrast to steroids, hopanoids are a less well studied but evolutionarily significant and chemically diverse class of lipids that are thought to be sterol surrogates in bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rohmer et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ourisson et al., 1987</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05663.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structures of selected hopanoids, cholesterol, and squalene.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05663.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05663.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05663-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>The rich record of ancient lipids, including fossil hopanoids, has long been recognized to hold clues into the early history of life and past environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ourisson et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Summons and Walter, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brocks and Pearson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knoll et al., 2007</xref>). But being able to confidently interpret the meaning of any ancient molecular fossil poses considerable challenges. First, we must be able to identify potential sources for these compounds, demanding unambiguous chemical parity between modern and ancient structures. Once this is achieved, understanding whether particular environmental conditions regulate the production of specific hopanoid variants becomes important. But arguably, the most critical goal in advancing our understanding of ancient lipids is being able to identify specific biological functions for their counterparts in cells today. Myriad hopanoid structures are known to exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ourisson et al., 1984</xref>), yet we only poorly understand the significance of this chemical diversity. For meaningful linkages to be made between modern compounds and ancient biomarkers, we must (1) study those hopanoids that leave a specific trace in sedimentary rocks (e.g., their chemical modifications are geostable), (2) identify their in vivo function(s), and (3) evaluate whether the roles played by these lipids in modern organisms have been conserved over the course of evolution.</p><p>Following the recognition in the early 1970s that hopanes are ubiquitous in sedimentary rocks, the occurrence of hopanoids in diverse organisms was documented, and insights were gained into their biosynthesis, biophysical properties, and cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ourisson et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ourisson and Rohmer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pearson, 2013</xref>). For example, studies using hopanoid-deficient mutants have shown that hopanoids promote resistance to antibiotics, detergents, extreme pH, and high osmolarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Welander et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sáenz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmerk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kulkarni et al., 2013</xref>). Biophysical studies using mixtures of hopanoids and model lipids have demonstrated that, like cholesterol, bacteriohopanetetrol cyclitol ether can condense membranes at high temperatures but fluidize membranes at low temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poralla et al., 1980</xref>). Similarly, bacteriohopanetetrol (BHT) and bacteriohopanemonol can condense model membranes, and diplopterol (Dip) can form liquid ordered microdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kannenberg et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nagumo et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ourisson and Rohmer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sáenz et al., 2012</xref>). A recent molecular modeling study pointed out different behaviors between Dip and BHT in their specific location within lipid bilayers and their capacity to condense membranes, suggesting complex roles of hopanoids due to their structural diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poger and Mark, 2013</xref>). These biophysical studies have provided insights into the physical capabilities of these hopanoids. However, whether hopanoids play the same roles in vivo has been unclear due to the differences in lipid composition and concentration between model and cellular membranes.</p><p>Among various hopanoid modifications, methylation of C-2 on the A-ring has drawn attention from Earth scientists because this modification is preserved episodically in ancient sedimentary rocks dating back to 1.6 billion years ago; accordingly, it has been suggested that 2-methylated hopanes (2Me-hopanes), the molecular fossils of 2Me-hopanoids, could potentially serve as biomarkers to interpret events in the early history of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brocks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rasmussen et al., 2008</xref>). For a time, it was thought that 2Me-hopanes were biomarkers of cyanobacteria, and hence the process of oxygenic photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Summons et al., 1999</xref>), but we now know this not to be the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Welander et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ricci et al., 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, spikes in the C<sub>30</sub> 2Me-hopane index (ratio of methylated short hopanes to total short hopanes) through geologic time are correlated with episodes of oceanic anoxic events (OAEs), which are thought to have imposed heightened stress on the biosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knoll et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Towards the goal of finding a robust interpretation for 2Me-hopanes, we have elucidated the biosynthetic pathway of 2Me-hopanoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Welander et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2012</xref>), linked 2Me-hopanoids to specific environments and producers through (meta)genomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ricci et al., 2014</xref>), and identified the stress-responsive pathway regulating transcription of the 2-methylase (<italic>hpnP</italic>) in the model hopanoid-producing bacterium <italic>Rhodospeudomonas palustris</italic> TIE-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kulkarni et al., 2013</xref>). A major challenge in understanding the function of 2Me-hopanoids has been the lack of a clear phenotype in vivo, despite dedicated attempts to find one for the <italic>hpnP</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kulkarni et al., 2013</xref>). Recent data suggest this phenotypic silence results from changes to the lipidome that compensate for the loss of 2Me-hopanoids (unpublished). To infer a specific in vivo function for 2Me-hopanoids, in vitro studies that mimic cellular composition are therefore necessary.</p><p>We hypothesized that methylation at C-2 would change hopanoids' packing with other lipids and proteins and affect membrane biophysical properties such as rigidity. Furthermore, we reasoned that such an effect would depend on the specific lipid composition of the membrane. To test these hypotheses, we took advantage of the existence of specific hopanoid-mutant strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Welander et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2012</xref>), and recently developed protocols allowing quantitative analysis and the purification of hopanoids and their 2-methylated species in large quantities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). This experimental foundation set the stage for what we now report: in vitro membrane studies to examine how 2Me-hopanoids affect membrane rigidity in the context of different lipid environments of relevance to the cell. Our finding that hopanoid methylation enhances membrane rigidity supports the interpretation that past intervals of heightened 2Me-hopane abundance record a history of stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Whole cell membrane fluidity</title><p>To test whether 2-methylation changes membrane rigidity, we measured the membrane rigidity of specific hopanoid biosynthetic mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Welander et al., 2012</xref>) using fluorescence polarization. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows the whole cell membrane rigidity measured at 25°C and 40°C. As expected, at higher temperature, the cell membrane became less rigid across all strains. At 25°C, the Δ<italic>shc</italic> mutant, which lacks all hopanoids, had the least rigid membrane. This could be caused by both the absence of hopanoids and the accumulation of the hopanoid biosynthetic precursor, squalene. The result is also consistent with the observation that in model lipid vesicles, hopanoids make the membrane more rigid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kannenberg et al., 1985</xref>). Interestingly, the production of only short-chain hopanoids (Δ<italic>hpnH</italic>) is sufficient to recover the rigidity level close to that of the WT. However, when an adenosine molecule is attached to short hopanoids and accumulates in the Δ<italic>hpnG</italic> mutant, rigidity decreases to Δ<italic>shc</italic> levels. Furthermore, in Δ<italic>hpnN</italic> where hopanoids are unable to be transported to the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Doughty et al., 2011</xref>), membrane rigidity is similar to Δ<italic>hpnG</italic>. These results have two implications. First, the hydrophobic reporter dye we used for fluorescence polarization measurements, diphenyl hexatriene (DPH), reflects mostly the rigidity of the outer membrane. Second, the types of hopanoids and their respective localization between the inner and outer membranes directly impact membrane rigidity.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05663.004</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Mutant strains used for the whole cell membrane rigidity measurements</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05663.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05663.004</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Gene</th><th>Function</th><th>Deletion effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><italic>shc (hpnF)</italic></td><td>Cyclization of squalene to form C30 hopanoids (diploptene and diplopterol)</td><td>No hopanoid production and accumulation of squalene</td></tr><tr><td><italic>hpnH</italic></td><td>Addition of adenosine to diploptene to generate adenosylhopane, a precursor for extended hopanoid production</td><td>No extended hopanoid production, accumulation of C30 hopanoids</td></tr><tr><td><italic>hpnG</italic></td><td>Removal of adenine from adenosyl hopane</td><td>No BHT and aminoBHT production, accumulation of adenosylhopane</td></tr><tr><td><italic>hpnN</italic></td><td>An IM transporter that transports hopanoids to the outer membrane</td><td>Absence of hopanoids in the OM and accumulation of hopanoids in the IM</td></tr><tr><td><italic>hpnO</italic></td><td>Production of aminoBHT</td><td>No aminoBHT production</td></tr><tr><td><italic>hpnP</italic></td><td>Methyl transfer to A ring at C-2</td><td>No hopanoid methylation</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>The function of the gene and the effect of its deletion are listed.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05663.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Whole cell membrane fluidity.</title><p>Error bars represent the standard deviation from three biological replicates (total 21–26 technical replicates).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05663.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05663.005</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05663-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p>Interestingly, no obvious impact on rigidity was found in the absence of either bacteriohopane aminotriol (Δ<italic>hpnO</italic>) or 2-methylhopanoid (Δ<italic>hpnP</italic>) or both (Δ<italic>hpnOP</italic>) compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This observation could have two possible explanations. One is that these specific hopanoids do not affect membrane rigidity in cells. The other explanation is that the cells might synthesize other lipids that compensate for their effects so that no phenotype is observed. We can distinguish between these two scenarios by measuring membrane rigidity using vesicles made of model lipids and purified hopanoids.

Such calibration was recently shown to be essential for accurate hopanoid quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Using this approach, the exact wt% of each hopanoid in TLE was obtained. However, to put the numbers in context and compare the value in mol%, we assumed the average molecular weight of the total lipids is 786 g/mol, the same as dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and <italic>E. coli</italic> polar lipid extract (PLE). Because we could only confidently quantify (2Me)-Dip and (2Me)-BHT, we focused our analyses on these four hopanoids. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows the hopanoid quantification results. In both WT and Δ<italic>hpnP</italic>, each type of hopanoid is enriched in the OM compared to the IM. The total of these four hopanoids in the IM is ∼2.6 mol% of TLE, whereas in the OM, the value can reach 8–11 mol%. For individual hopanoids in WT, the mol% in IM and OM are 1% and 2% for Dip, 1% and 2.4% for 2Me-Dip, 0.4% and 3.4% for BHT, and 0.1% and 0.3% for 2Me-BHT, respectively. In Δ<italic>hpnP</italic>, the IM and OM values are 2% and 7.5% for Dip, and 0.5% and 4.3% for BHT, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) are commonly used for such measurements because it is straightforward to control their lipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hope et al., 1985</xref>). We used fluorescence polarization to measure the fluorescence of DPH, a reporter dye, in the presence of model lipids and purified hopanoids. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows how the membrane rigidity of model lipids, DOPC and <italic>E. coli</italic> PLE, responds to the presence of cholesterol, squalene, (2Me)-Dip, and (2Me)-BHT. Because the total hopanoids in cell membranes are ∼10 mol% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we varied the concentration of hopanoids between 5 and 20 mol% in SUVs, which our quantification results suggest are physiologically relevant concentrations. Starting with the simplest single lipid background, DOPC, the addition of cholesterol increases membrane rigidity and the magnitude of change is proportional to the amounts of cholesterol added (black line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This observation is consistent with the literature and validates our technical approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vanblitterswijk et al., 1987</xref>). Interestingly, the addition of the hopanoid precursor, squalene, has the opposite effect as cholesterol and makes the membrane less rigid in a concentration-dependent fashion (magenta line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, when Dip is added, the membrane rigidity is unaffected (blue line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Surprisingly, given the structural similarity between cholesterol and Dip, Dip does not seem to rigidify DOPC as extensively as does cholesterol. However, when Dip is further processed by the cell to produce BHT, it rigidifies DOPC vesicles in the same manner as cholesterol (red line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05663.010</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Membrane rigidity measurements at 25°C using model lipids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and (<bold>B</bold>) <italic>E. coli</italic> polar lipid extract (PLE) were mixed with different mol% of cholesterol, squalene, and hopanoids.

Not only does 2-methylation increase DOPC membrane rigidity, but at 20 mol%, 2Me-Dip even outperforms cholesterol and BHT (cyan line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). 2Me-BHT also increases membrane rigidity similar to cholesterol, even though the difference from BHT is much smaller than that between Dip and 2Me-Dip (orange line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This result demonstrates methylation itself changes the biophysical properties of hopanoids, which directly impacts membrane fluidity. This observation reinforces the interpretation that the lack of phenotype in the Δ<italic>hpnP</italic> strain may be due to cells synthesizing other lipids that functionally complement the absence of 2Me-hopanoids, rather than due to a lack of an impact at the molecular level per se.</p><p>To determine whether the effects on membrane rigidity by these hopanoids hold in more physiologically relevant environments, we repeated the experiment using <italic>E. coli</italic> PLE as the main component to form SUVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> PLE from Avanti Polar Lipids consists of 67% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), 23.2% phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and 9.8% cardiolipin (CL) (in wt%) and has an average molecular weight identical to DOPC (786 g/mol). Compared to DOPC alone, the SUVs from <italic>E. coli</italic> PLE are more rigid, probably because the difference in fatty acid chain saturation (green square, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Even though <italic>E. coli</italic> PLE SUVs are more rigid than DOPC SUVs to start with, we observe the same trend, where adding cholesterol rigidifies the vesicles and squalene fluidizes them. However, the concentration dependence on the rigidity change is more dramatic for cholesterol compared to squalene (black line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Unlike in DOPC, Dip has a small rigidifying effect in the <italic>E. coli</italic> PLE background, yet similar to DOPC, no concentration dependence is observed (blue line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Addition of 2Me-Dip also rigidifies <italic>E. coli</italic> PLE, but in contrast to what was observed for DOPC, 2Me-Dip shows lower capacity to rigidify the membrane than cholesterol (cyan line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, the extended hopanoid, BHT, also rigidifies the membrane, but seemed to saturate at 10 mol% (red line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Surprisingly, in sharp contrast to the DOPC background, 2Me-BHT strongly rigidifies the <italic>E. coli</italic> PLE membranes and has a concentration dependence (orange line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This result shows that the impact of 2-methylation and hopanoid extension on a membrane biophysical property depends on the specific lipid environment. As expected, when these experiments were repeated at 40°C, membranes were less rigid overall.

However, 2Me-Dip rigidifies both IM and OM in a concentration-dependent manner, as seen in the model lipid SUVs. Interestingly, unlike the effects BHT exerts in model lipids, it does not rigidify either the IM or OM. While it is possible that BHT has no effect on native membrane rigidity, given that Δ<italic>hpnP</italic> membranes contain BHT, it seems more likely that endogenous BHT is saturating its membrane rigidifying capacity, similar to what we observed for <italic>E. coli</italic> PLE (red line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>When BHT is methylated, it rigidifies both the IM and OM. However, different trends can be seen between these membranes: in the IM, the more 2Me-BHT present, the higher the membrane rigidity, yet OM membrane rigidity appears to saturate by 5 mol% 2Me-BHT and remains constant between 5–20 mol% of 2Me-BHT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the reason less 2-methylation occurs for BHT than Dip in the OM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4, 5</xref>) is because less methylation of BHT is needed to significantly impact OM rigidity.</p><p>We repeated these experiments at 40°C and observed similar trends as seen at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, we had larger standard deviations than in our model lipid experiments, which could be due to higher heterogeneity in the samples extracted from IM and OM. Nevertheless, we find clear physiologically relevant distinctions in the rigidifying effects of both short and long 2Me-hopanoids on the IM and OM of <italic>R. palustris</italic> TIE-1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Until now, a specific role for 2Me-hopanoids in living cells has evaded experimental detection, yet its identification has been of great interest for interpreting the extensive 2Me-hopane fossil record (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Welander et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kulkarni et al., 2013</xref>). Our findings that 2Me-hopanoids rigidify membranes to different extents depending both on their specific structure (short or long) and lipid context not only provide a clear biological function for these compounds, but also help rationalize why previous efforts to identify such a function have been challenging. That methylation per se can contribute to rigidifying membranes may also help explain the association of methylated hopanoids in certain modern and ancient environments.</p><p>Under what circumstances would adding a methyl group at the 2′ position of hopanoids, which seems a rather small modification, be beneficial? Might there be a mechanistic explanation for the enrichment of 2Me-hopanes during stressful OAEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knoll et al., 2007</xref>)? Several independent lines of evidence bridge our biophysical findings with the abundance patterns in the rock record, together suggesting that 2-methylhopanoids confer stress resistance: (1) 2Me-hopanoids are enriched in the outer membrane of akinetes, survival cell types of the cyanobacterium <italic>Nostoc punctiforme</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doughty et al., 2009</xref>), (2) a stress-responsive pathway upregulates the HpnP methylase in <italic>R. palusris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kulkarni et al., 2013</xref>), (3) in modern environments, the capacity for 2Me-hopanoid production significantly correlates with organisms, metabolisms (e.g., nitrogen fixation), and environments that support plant–microbe interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ricci et al., 2014</xref>). This correlation, together with the observation that (2Me)-hopanoids promote symbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Silipo et al., 2014</xref>), tempt us to speculate that 2Me-hopanoids may indirectly facilitate nitrogen fixation by enhancing bacterial survival under the stressful conditions that accompany the establishment of symbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gibson et al., 2008</xref>). Going forward, it is worth critically examining this hypothesis; if correct, such an interpretation would indicate that spikes in the 2Me-hopane index may reflect episodes of particular environmental stresses favoring the growth of organisms capable of withstanding it using (2Me)-hopanoids.</p><p>How might the 2-methylation of hopanoids permit such an adventitious adaptation? Molecular dynamic simulations of 2Me-hopanoid within a relevant lipid context are required to understand the interactions on an atomic scale. However, we may speculate about the mechanism of rigidification through lessons learned from studies of cholesterol, in which the number of methyl groups control its optimal molecular packing to geometrically complement phospholipid chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bloch, 1979</xref>). The addition or removal of methyl groups over the evolution of the cholesterol lipid family is thought to have optimally tuned cholesterol's ability to order or condense phospholipid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rog et al., 2007</xref>). We suggest that when a methyl group is added onto the 2′ position of A-ring in hopanoid, the stearic hindrance between the 2-methyl group and the methyl groups at the 4′ and 10′ position of the A-ring could transform the ring from a chair to a twisted conformation. The two additional 1,3-diaxial interactions elicited by hopanoid 2-methylation could mimic the smoothing and/or tilting effect known for cholesterol, thus rationalizing how 2-methylation may improve the ability of hopanoids to rigidify membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rog et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The differences in (2Me)-hopanoid distribution between the IM and OM pose many interesting questions about their role in maintaining membrane integrity and homeostasis. Compared to (2Me)-Dip, the addition of a hydrophilic tail to form (2Me)-BHT or even BHT-glucosamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) may favor a stronger interaction with the outer leaflet of the OM, in which the lipid head group is heavily modified with hydrophilic molecules. The relative enrichment of (2Me)-BHT in the OM is consistent with such a scenario. The hydrophilic tail of 2Me-BHT could also affect the vertical position of the 2-methyl group in the membrane compared to 2Me-Dip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rog et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poger and Mark, 2013</xref>), which may explain the difference between 2Me-BHT and 2Me-Dip in rigidifying membranes with different compositions. Future research will illuminate whether there are additional interactions between hopanoids and other membrane constituents (e.g., proteins or cell wall components) that facilitate survival under stress.</p><p>Finally, it is important to keep in mind that (2Me)-hopanoids may act locally rather than globally with respect to influencing membrane biophysical properties. In our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, we did not observe a significant difference in membrane rigidity when less than 10 mol% of (2Me)-hopanoids were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This may be due to a critical concentration needed to trigger an effect, which is consistent with molecular dynamic simulations that demonstrate cholesterol starts to self-organize within membranes at concentration above 10 mol% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martinez-Seara et al., 2010</xref>). However, we hasten to point out that the mol% of (2Me)-hopanoids in the native membrane experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) are not directly comparable to those using model lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) due to the presence of endogenous hopanoids in <italic>ΔhpnP</italic> membranes. The existence of BHT in Δ<italic>hpnP</italic> may explain why the membrane rigidifying effect of exogenously added BHT is saturated at 10 mol% in the <italic>E. coli</italic> PLE but has no impact on <italic>R. palustris</italic> TIE-1 IM and OM. In this context, it is noteworthy that cardiolipin significantly increases in the absence of all hopanoids (unpublished). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, cardiolipin localizes to negatively curved regions of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Renner and Weibel, 2011</xref>). Looking beyond the function of methylation, it is possible that certain hopanoid types could fulfill the geometry requirements of curved membranes and facilitate cell division or vesicle formation, consistent with both the microdomain features observed in prior subcellular hopanoid localization studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doughty et al., 2014</xref>) and the strong cell division defect displayed by a mutant lacking the ability to transport hopanoids to the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doughty et al., 2014</xref>). Going forward, consideration of other roles for structurally diverse hopanoids, including the possibility that some might influence membrane protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Phillips et al., 2009</xref>), modify specific proteins or cell wall components through covalent linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jeong and McMahon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Silipo et al., 2014</xref>), or even play a role in signaling pathways in analogy to cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kuwabara and Labouesse, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aktas et al., 2010</xref>), will enhance our appreciation for this ancient lipid class.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and chemicals</title><p><italic>R. palustris</italic> TIE-1 wild type (WT) and mutant strains were grown as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Welander et al., 2012</xref>).

The sizes and stability of the SUVs was determined by dynamic light scattering (Wyatt (Santa Barbara, CA) DynaPro NanoStar. Instrument parameters: acquisition time 5 s, number of acquisition 10, laser wavelength 659 nm, laser power 10%, 25°C). The average size distribution of the SUVs was between 80 and 90 nm and remained stable for at least 4 hr at RT.</p><p>SUVs after extrusion were diluted 1:1 in buffer A to reach a final concentration of 0.5 mM (400 μl total volume). DPH (1.8 μl of 44.5 μM stock solution in ethanol) was added into the sample and vortexed immediately. The SUV-DPH samples were incubated in 25°C or 40°C water bath without light for at least 30 min before the fluorescence polarization was measured using the parameters described above. The concentration of the fluorescence reporter dye DPH and the instrument parameters were optimized to have a strong and linear signal output.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Membrane fluidity measurements using total lipid extract from inner and outer membranes of <italic>R. palustris</italic> TIE-1</title><p>Different amounts of purified hopanoids (5, 10, and 20 nmol) were added to 100 nmol of the inner or outer membrane extracts of Δ<italic>hpnP</italic> (assuming average molecular weight is 786 g/mol). The same procedures as described above were followed for the preparation of SUVs. Buffer A (600 μl) was used to suspend the dried lipids so that the final lipid concentrations before the addition of DPH were between 0.088 and 0.1 mM (400 μl sample volume). To measure fluorescence polarization, DPH (1.8 μl of 7.4 μM stock solution in ethanol) was used (the final concentration of DPH was 0.03 μM, which was ∼0.03 mol% of the total lipids in the sample). Controls of membranes from WT or Δ<italic>hpnP</italic> only without addition of hopanoids were included.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the members of the Newman lab for critical comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor) and 4 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>All the individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jon Clardy (Reviewing editor); Andrew Knoll (peer reviewer), Martin Burke (peer reviewer), and Alex Brown (peer reviewer).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers were uniformly enthusiastic about the suitability of a revised version of this study for <italic>eLife</italic>. The suggested areas for revision were:</p><p>1) The study makes a valuable contribution to the wide but sporadic distribution of 2Me-hopanes in sedimentary rocks. However, the jump from experimental results to geological explication is a bit abrupt, and the motivating issue of geological occurrence should be expanded. The discussion of nitrogen fixation by <italic>R. palustris</italic>, and possibly other bacteria, could also be expanded.</p><p>2) Lipid quantification forms an essential part of this study, and some parts need to be clarified. The citation in the Results section to an as yet unpublished manuscript (Neubauer et al., 2014) doesn't make clear what method was used, and a brief mention of ionization mode, chromatography conditions, and other relevant information should be added. In the same section, some comments on possible sources of error for low values are mentioned. In this regard, it is known that PC, PE, and PG have very different head groups and ionize very differently in MS; PG ionizes well in negative mode, PE ionizes well in both positive and negative, and PC ionizes better in positive mode. In addition, chain length and degree of unsaturation also affect ionization. Previous work in the area of lipid analysis using mass spectrometry should be included. In particular, the well documented effects on ion suppression should be mentioned (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brugger et al., 1997</xref>, in PNAS). General lipidomic methodologies and reviews on phospholipids (H. A. Brown), neutral lipids (Robert Murphy), and sterols (David Russell) might be useful.</p><p>3) The manuscript clearly establishes that the introduction of a methyl group at C–2 of the hopane skeleton has a dramatic effect on membrane rigidity. The speculation that the structural basis of the effect could arise from the twisting of the A–ring from chair to boat is fundamentally sound, and as the manuscript notes, forms a promising area for future work. The authors might want to mention that, although 1,3-diaxial interactions of the C4 and C6 methyl groups in sterols (e.g. lanosterol) do not appear to distort the A–ring, in the context of the hopane scaffold (lacking an equatorial C3 hydroxyl) these interactions themselves could be sufficient to distort the A–ring into a twist boat and/or the methyl at C–2 would alter packing by changing interactions in the plane of the hopane structure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05663.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The study makes a valuable contribution to the wide but sporadic distribution of 2Me-hopanes in sedimentary rocks.
