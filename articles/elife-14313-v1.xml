been difficult to visualize as functionally complete entities due to their combinatorial and structural complexity. We report here the structure of the intact functional assembly responsible for regulating and executing a site-specific DNA recombination reaction. The assembly is a 240-bp Holliday junction (HJ) bound specifically by 11 protein subunits. This higher-order complex is a key intermediate in the tightly regulated pathway for the excision of bacteriophage λ viral DNA out of the <italic>E. coli</italic> host chromosome, an extensively studied paradigmatic model system for the regulated rearrangement of DNA. Our results provide a structural basis for pre-existing data describing the excisive and integrative recombination pathways, and they help explain their regulation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14313.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14313.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14313.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Some viruses can remain dormant inside an infected cell and only become active when conditions are right to multiply and infect other cells. Bacteriophage λ is a much-studied model virus that adopts this lifecycle by inserting its genetic information into the chromosome of a bacterium called <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Certain signals can later trigger the viral DNA to be removed from the bacterial chromosome, often after many generations, so that it can replicate and make new copies of the virus. Specific sites on the viral and bacterial DNA earmark where the virus’s genetic information will insert and how it will be removed. Remarkably, each of these two site-specific reactions (i.e. insertion and removal) cannot be reversed once started, and their onset is precisely controlled.</p><p>These reactions involve a molecular machine or complex that consists of four enzymes that cut and reconnect the DNA strands and seven DNA-bending proteins that bring distant sites closer together. Despite decades of work by many laboratories, no one had provided a three-dimensional image of this complete molecular machine together with the DNA it acts upon.</p><p>Now, Laxmikanthan et al. reveal a three-dimensional structure of this machine with all its components by trapping and purifying the complex at the halfway point in the removal process, when the DNA forms a structure known as a “Holliday junction”. The structure was obtained using electron microscopy of complexes frozen in ice. The structure answers many of the long-standing questions about the removal and insertion reactions. For example, it shows how the DNA-bending proteins and enzymes assemble into a large complex to carry out the removal reaction, which is different from the complex that carries out the insertion reaction. It also shows that the removal and insertion reactions are each prevented from acting in the opposite direction because the two complexes have different requirements.</p><p>These new findings improve our understanding of how the insertion and removal reactions are precisely regulated. Laxmikanthan et al.’s results also serve as examples for thinking about the complicated regulatory machines that are widespread in biology.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14313.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14313.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>site-specific recombination</kwd><kwd>bacteriophage lambda</kwd><kwd>electron cryo-microscopy</kwd><kwd>viral excision</kwd><kwd>viral integration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM0627</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Landy</surname><given-names>Arthur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grigorieff</surname><given-names>Nikolaus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM033928</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Landy</surname><given-names>Arthur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM108751</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Van Duyne</surname><given-names>Gregory D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM62580</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grigorieff</surname><given-names>Nikolaus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of a multi-protein DNA recombination reaction intermediate reveals how regulation is achieved by protein-mediated DNA wrapping around a core enzyme-substrate complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The rearrangement of DNA, either by homologous or site-specific recombination and transposition, is a fundamental feature of evolution, genetic variation, and gene regulation; among such pathways, the integration and excision of bacteriophage λ into and out of the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome is one of the most thoroughly characterized. Nevertheless, even for this pathway, it has not been possible until now to visualize the entire functional structure of the recombinogenic complex, despite the wealth of genetic, biochemical, functional and structural information accumulated by many laboratories over the past 50 years.</p><p>The site-specific recombinase (Int) encoded by bacteriophage λ is the archetypical member of the tyrosine recombinase family, whose members carry out such diverse functions as chromosome segregation, chromosome copy number control, gene expression, conjugative transposition, gene dissemination, and viral integration and excision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Craig et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jayaram et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Landy, 2015</xref>). All tyrosine recombinases use the same isoenergetic phosphoryl transfer chemistry and sequential strand exchange mechanism to execute DNA rearrangements via the formation and resolution of a transient four-way DNA junction, or Holliday junction (HJ), recombination intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hsu and Landy, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kitts and Nash, 1988a</xref>). Although these junctions are common intermediates in many different pathways responsible for rearranging genetic material in evolution, heredity, and gene expression, they have been particularly well-studied in the tyrosine recombinase family of reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gopaul et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jayaram et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Van Duyne, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to two other well-studied and highly exploited family members, Cre and FLP, where the entire bidirectional recombination reaction is executed by a recombinase tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jayaram et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Van Duyne, 2015</xref>), Int carries out two opposing reactions that are both highly directional and tightly regulated. Each reaction requires the assembly of a unique 400 kDa multi-protein complex using accessory DNA-bending proteins and an overlapping ensemble of accessory binding sites. In response to a variety of physiological and environmental signals one complex is assembled to carry out unidirectional integrative recombination between “<italic>att</italic>” sites on the viral and bacterial chromosomes, while the other complex is formed to carry out unidirectional excisive recombination between <italic>att</italic> sites flanking the integrated viral chromosome ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tong et al., 2014</xref>]; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14313.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Integration and excision of the λ viral chromosome into and out of the bacterial host chromosome is highly directional and tightly regulated.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Formation of the integrated prophage. In those infected cells where the decision has been made not to replicate the viral DNA, the circularized supercoiled viral DNA (black lines) is inserted into the bacterial chromosome (curly red lines) at a specific site (called <italic>att</italic>B or BOB’) located between the gal and bio genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell, 1963</xref>). This insertion, integrative recombination, involves cutting the viral DNA at a specific site (called <italic>att</italic>P or P’C’OCP) and joining these cut ends to the cut ends of the bacterial chromosome in <italic>att</italic>B. The cutting, recombining, and resealing of viral and bacterial DNA generates new DNA sequences forming the junctions between bacterial and integrated viral DNA. These junction sequences, called <italic>att</italic>L (BOC’P’) and <italic>att</italic>R (PCOB’) on the left and right respectively, are themselves substrates for the cutting, recombining, and resealing reactions that will, sometime in the future, remove (excise) the viral DNA from the host chromosome and thereby regenerate the viral <italic>att</italic>P and bacterial <italic>att</italic>B sequences. The integrated provirus chromosome is stably inherited, with almost all of its genes repressed, for many bacterial generations. Upon instigation by the appropriate physiological signals, the viral chromosome is excised, replicated, and inserted into viral particles which are released into the environment. The integrative reaction requires the virally-encoded integrase protein (Int) and the bacterial accessory protein Integration Host Factor (IHF). The excisive reaction additionally requires the virally encoded accessory protein Xis (which also inhibits the integrative reactions). Both reactions are stimulated by the bacterial accessory protein Fis. (See Panel <bold>C</bold> for DNA binding sites of all the proteins and their respective roles in each reaction). Both reactions proceed through a four-way DNA junction called a Holliday junction (HJ) (see Panel <bold>B</bold> for details of these DNA strand exchanges) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Landy, 2015</xref>]). (<bold>B</bold>) The Holliday junction intermediate. Cutting, recombining, and resealing DNA during recombination proceeds by two pairs of sequential single-strand DNA exchanges that are staggered by seven base pairs that are identical in all four <italic>att</italic> sites; they are referred to as the 'overlap' region (O). The molecular details of this recombination are common to all reactions catalyzed by the large family of tyrosine recombinases (except for the size of the O regions and the order of strand exchanges), as first characterized for λ Int, Cre, Flp, and XerC/D (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Van Duyne, 2015</xref>]). It proceeds in the absence of exogenous energy via the formation of high-energy covalent 3’phospho-tyrosine intermediates in the active site of each Int protein. Illustrated here is the pathway for integrative recombination; it would be identical for the excisive reaction but the substrates (left panel) would be <italic>att</italic>L and <italic>att</italic>R, leading to <italic>att</italic>P and <italic>att</italic>B products (right panel). Viral and bacterial DNAs are denoted as in panel <bold>A</bold>. (i) The <italic>att</italic>P (C’OC) and <italic>att</italic>B (BOB’) sites are aligned anti-parallel with respect to their identical overlap sequences. (ii) The first pair of exchanges, always at the <bold>C</bold> (green) and <bold>B</bold> (blue) core sites, is initiated by formation of 3’ phospho-tyrosine linkages (with Tyr342) and 5’ OH termini. (iii) The 5’ OH terminus generated by the cleavage at C attacks the phospho-tyrosine linkage at B to regenerate a new <bold>B</bold>–<bold>C’</bold> strand (orange arrow head). Concomitantly, the 5’ OH from the cleavage at C attacks the phospho-tyrosine linkage at B to regenerate a new <bold>B'</bold>–<bold>C</bold> strand (orange arrow head). Together, this pair of single strand exchanges, at one boundary of the overlap region, forms the four-way DNA (HJ) intermediate. (iv) A similar pair of single strand cleavage, exchange, and resealing reactions is executed by the Ints at <bold>C’</bold> (brown) and <bold>B’</bold> (purple) on the other side of the overlap region. (v) As a result of the two sequential pairs of single-strand exchanges, all four DNA strands have new junction sequences and the HJ is resolved to recombinant products <italic>att</italic>L (C’OB) and <italic>att</italic>R (COB’). <bold>C</bold>) Additional complexity, in the P’ and P arms, confers regulation and directionality to the λ Int reaction. In contrast to the 'simple' Cre and Flp tyrosine recombinases, λ Int (and more than a thousand viral cousins in the public data bases) has two DNA binding domains, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The carboxy-terminal domain of Int (CTD) binds at the four sites of DNA cleavage (called core-type sites; blue boxes) and catalyzes the chemistry of DNA cleavage and rejoining; this domain and the core-type sites (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>B’</bold>, <bold>C’</bold> and <bold>C</bold>) are analogous, and very similar, to the Cre and Flp enzymes and their respective DNA targets sites (see panel <bold>B</bold>). In λ Int an additional small DNA binding domain at the amino terminus (NTD) binds with high affinity to a different family of DNA sequences (arm-type sites) (green boxes) distant from the sites of DNA cleavage and located in the P’ and P arms of viral DNA (adjacent to <bold>C’</bold> and <bold>C</bold>, respectively). To enable the ('hetero-bivalent') Int to bind simultaneously to both of its DNA targets the core- and arm-type DNA sites are interposed by binding sites for the accessory DNA bending proteins, IHF (yellow boxes, H1, H2, and H’), Xis (gold boxes, X1, X1.5, X2), and Fis (magenta). The DNA bending proteins bring the core- and arm-type sites into close proximity and also serve as essential elements in forming the large multi-protein recombination complexes. Two distinct but overlapping ensembles of binding sites are employed (solid boxes) to generate either the integrative or excisive recombinogenic complexes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Landy, 2015</xref>]).

It is joined via a flexible 10 residue linker region to the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) (light blue), which is composed of two smaller domains (the core-binding (CB) and catalytic domains) joined by a 12 residue linker. The CTD binds to core-type DNA sites (blue) via a C-clamp motif; the distal domain of the C-clamp contains the nucleophile Tyr-342 (red) and those residues comprising the catalytic site for DNA cleavage and ligation. The CTD is analogous, and very similar in structure and function, to the well-studied monovalent recombinases, Cre, Flp, and XerC/D.

We then used the EM density, known protein-DNA crystal and NMR structures, and the known Int-mediated arm-core bridges to build an atomic model of the intact functional complex. The experimental structure for the excisive complex then allowed us to construct a model for the integrative complex. The results provide a structural basis for understanding how these complex DNA recombination machines function and how they are so tightly regulated.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14313.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Isolation and single particle electron cryo-microscopy of the Holliday junction recombination intermediate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Native polyacrylamide gel electrophorograms of the recombination reactions prior to and after sucrose gradient purification.

Following visual inspection of the class averages, we selected 52 classes that showed clear features, such as DNA loops and crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and calculated initial maps using EMAN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang et al., 2007</xref>). The highest-scoring map was used to initialize particle alignment and three-dimensional (3D) classification in FREALIGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lyumkis et al., 2013</xref>). All particles were aligned against the EMAN2 map using data limited to 60 Å resolution. Starting with reconstructions calculated from six randomly selected subsets of the data, particles were 3D-classified into six classes and their alignments refined in 40 iterations in which the resolution limit was increased in regular steps to a final limit of 20 Å. The reconstruction with the highest average particle score was then used to initialize a second round of alignment and 3D classification, starting again with a resolution limit of 60 Å and increasing the limit in steps to a final 20 Å. Due to the substantial heterogeneity of the sample – only 17% of the particles ended up in the final reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) – we performed six such refinement/classification rounds, always initializing the next round with the reconstruction of the previous round that had the highest average particle score. The highest scoring reconstructions from each round, as well as the initial and final maps are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Lower-scoring reconstructions showed some of the features of the highest-scoring reconstruction but were missing density in the DNA loop and/or the Int tetramer regions. This suggests that the heterogeneity is the result of particle distortions and instabilities that often arise during the grid preparation procedure, for example when particles interact with the air/water interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>). For the final map, we performed an additional 50 iterations of refinement and 3D classification using a resolution limit of 18 Å. The last three iterations used data with an effective pixel size of 2.8 Å. The best reconstruction contained 10,956 particles and reached a resolution of about 11 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14313.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Electron cryo-microscopy refinement and 3D classification.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Different stages of refinement and classification using FREALIGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lyumkis et al., 2013</xref>).

This core complex was derived from a crystal structure of full-length integrase bound to HJ DNA and short oligonucleotides containing arm site sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biswas et al., 2005</xref>). The assembly fit well as a rigid body, indicating that the EM and crystal structures are similar in this region. Structural models for the protein-bound P and P' arms were assembled as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seah et al., 2014</xref>), except that the Fis dimer (which is not present in the purified HJ complex used here) was omitted from the P arm model. Details of the arm constructions are provided in Materials and methods. The pre-assembled P and P' arms were spliced onto the core Int-HJ complex while maintaining standard B-DNA twist and fit into the EM envelope by applying small DNA roll angles ( ± 1°) in the regions outside of the IHF, Xis, and Int-NTD footprints. Flexibility in the IHF-induced DNA bends at H' and H2 was also allowed by testing small in-plane and out of plane deviations from the IHF/H'-DNA crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rice et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Two regions in the resulting structure could not be confidently modeled based on existing crystal structures. The linkers connecting the NTD and CB domains of Int adopt distinct and partially extended conformations, a situation quite different from the compact and symmetric arrangement of linkers observed in the crystal structures of Int bound to short oligonucleotide DNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biswas et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, the central base-pairs of the HJ DNA were not well-defined in the Int-HJ crystal structure. To obtain low-energy conformations for these regions within the EM envelope and to regularize the stereochemistry of the DNA splice junctions and sites of bending, we performed molecular dynamics refinement using dynamic elastic network (DEN) restraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schröder et al., 2007</xref>). The protein•DNA sub-complexes derived from crystal structures were tightly restrained to adopt their experimental conformations, whereas the Int NTD-CB linkers and central HJ DNA base-pairs were allowed flexibility. To restrain flexible regions of the model to remain within the EM envelope, we included an energy term for agreement with the Fourier coefficients of the EM density. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the final structure agrees well with the EM envelope. There are no major features lacking density and only one small region of density that was not fit by the model (discussed below). The P and P' arm trajectories are particularly well defined by the EM envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), as is the core Int-HJ tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14313.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Model and reconstructed density for the λ excision complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) View from the 'top' of the complex, illustrating the IHF-mediated bends at H2 and H' and the close, parallel trajectory of the P and P' arms.

At the center of the excisive complex an integrase tetramer is bound to a core-site HJ, where strand exchange has taken place between the B half-site of <italic>att</italic>L and the C half-site of <italic>att</italic>R (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>).

The most striking features of the complex are the tight bends of the P and P' arms as they emerge from the C and C' core half-sites. IHF heterodimers bend the P arm at the H2 site and the P' arm at the H' site, in each case re-directing the DNA back towards the Int tetramer. For P', the IHF bend is sufficient for the P'1 and P'2 arm-binding sites to be engaged by the Int subunits bound at the C' and B core sites, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Rather than being directed towards the NTDs of Int, the H2 bend causes the P arm to run alongside the Int tetramer. Three Xis subunits provide a second change in direction of the P arm, directing it across the top of the Int tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As a result of the IHF and Xis-induced bends, the P2 site is positioned where it can be engaged by the Int subunit bound to the B' core site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>). The B'-P2 bridge is the third bivalent interaction required for excisive recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tong et al., 2014</xref>). Remarkably, the DNA bend observed in the Xis•DNA crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbani et al., 2007</xref>) fits well into the EM envelope, which has strong density for both the DNA and the Xis subunits. The P arm trajectory is also aided by an intrinsic A-tract sequence found in the Fis binding site. Fis was not present in the complexes analyzed by EM and as expected, there is no density corresponding to Fis at this site. We note, however that Fis can be readily accommodated by the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), which fits well with the proposed role for Fis as a non-essential enhancer of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ball and Johnson, 1991a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">1991b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Esposito and Gerard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thompson et al., 1987a</xref>).</p><p>The only component of the excisive HJ complex that is not accounted for by EM density is the NTD of Int-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). This domain has no known function in excisive recombination, since only three arm-binding sites are used in the reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Numrych et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thompson et al., 1987b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tong et al., 2014</xref>). One plausible location is near the Int-NTD bound at P2, where there is a small lobe of additional density present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). It is clear, however, that the Int-C NTD is not positioned directly above its connected CB domain, since the Xis molecule bound at the X1 site occupies this space. We did not fit the Int-C NTD into the P2-associated density because the domain's orientation and position could not be clearly established.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Agreement with FRET measurements</title><p>The EM structure described here provides an opportunity to re-examine the model and data recently reported in a FRET-based study of the λ excision HJ intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seah et al., 2014</xref>). In that work, 12 DNA sites were labeled with fluorophores and 28 inter-site distances were estimated using in-gel fluorescence measurements. These distances, combined with knowledge of the Int bridging interactions and crystal structures of the component sub-complexes, were used to construct a model of the excisive HJ complex. The overall architecture of our EM structure is in broad agreement with the FRET-based model. As might be expected from the small number of structural restraints available, the FRET model is largely schematic in nature. For example, the tight, parallel paths of the P and P' arms were not predicted in the FRET model, nor was the extensive Xis-Int interface that links the two arms together (see below). Indeed, the details that emerge from the EM structure provide important new insights that could not have been predicted based on distance measurements alone.</p><p>The EM structure also provides an opportunity to ask if the dye positions chosen for the FRET study were appropriate and to determine how well the EM structure agrees with the estimated distances (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Six of the locations appear to have been good choices, since they are largely free from steric interference that would compromise free rotation and/or the volumes accessible to the fluorophores. The EM structure is in good agreement with all of the distance estimates involving these sites. Two of the sites, <italic>att</italic>P<italic>-</italic> (-118) and <italic>att</italic>P<italic>-</italic> (+79), have serious steric conflicts based on the EM structure. The <italic>att</italic>P<italic>-</italic> (-118) dye on the P arm is directed into the path of the <italic>P' arm</italic>, possibly explaining why the arms diverge in the FRET model. The dye at <italic>att</italic>P<italic>-</italic> (+79) is on the P' arm and is directed into the Int-NTD bound at P2. Thus, the distances involving these sites are expected to be compromised and indeed, we see much poorer agreement with the EM structure for the distances involving these locations. The remaining four sites used for the FRET study are located on extensions of the P and P' arms that were not included in the constructs used for EM. Thus, there is excellent agreement between the EM structure and the FRET distance estimates for those dye positions that were correctly predicted to be free from steric interference.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14313.012</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>FRET vs. EM model distances in the λ excisive recombination complex.

Crystal structures of Int bound to core and a symmetrized mimic of arm DNA fragments suggested that the Int NTDs, along with their associated linkers, could play this role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biswas et al., 2005</xref>). However, earlier experiments with a Cre-Int chimeric recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Warren et al., 2008</xref>) and the present EM structure indicate that this is unlikely. The three Int NTDs in the excisive complex are arranged in a linear manner, where the NTD bound at P2 makes no contact with the NTDs bound at P'1 or P'2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Six of the eighteen missing residues are arginine or lysine, suggesting that the basic C-terminal tails of Xis could interact with P and/or P' arm DNA, further stabilizing a synaptic interface.

In the absence of structural models, it has been difficult to rationalize how the arms could accommodate, or perhaps even direct the changes in quaternary structure expected from a Cre-like isomerization. In contrast to Cre, however, the core HJ structure observed in the EM and crystal structures of the λ intermediate indicates that isomerization could occur with relatively little impact on the flanking DNA segments. We suggest that small changes in position and torsion of the C and C' core sites can be accommodated by the in-plane and out of plane bending modes of IHF, with little impact on the Xis•Int interface assembled between the P and P' arms as they cross the Int tetramer. In other words, the EM structure implies that isomerization of the HJ intermediate can occur in the absence of large changes in quaternary structure and therefore does not require coupling to large changes in the P and P' arm positions. This type of overall isosteric isomerization may be facilitated by the odd-numbered 7-bp crossover region that is found in essentially all tyrosine integrases, e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hakimi and Scocca, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kolot and Yagil, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peña et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williams, 2002</xref>).

Thus, the Xis switch functions at multiple levels involving both intramolecular (<italic>att</italic>R) and intermolecular (<italic>att</italic>L-<italic>att</italic>R) stabilization of intermediates in excisive recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Ea and Eb</xref>).</p><p>The structural models also account for why the prophage doesn't rapidly excise upon completion of integration and why the excision reaction is not run efficiently in reverse. The <italic>att</italic>R and <italic>att</italic>L products of integration have zero and one intramolecular Int bridges, respectively, and are therefore unlikely to be stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Id</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>att</italic>P complex formed at the end of excision has only a single Int bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Ec</xref>). The models also explain why the integrative reaction is inhibited in the presence of Xis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nash, 1975</xref>): Xis-induced bending of the P arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbani et al., 2007</xref>) prevents its upward trajectory in <italic>att</italic>P and thus defeats the proper positioning of the P1 site required for <italic>att</italic>B synapsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Ec</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9ia</xref>).</p><p>One of the especially interesting features suggested recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seah et al., 2014</xref>) and strengthened considerably by this work addresses the long-standing conundrum of how the large <italic>att</italic>P complex captures a naked <italic>att</italic>B site, whose core-type half-sites are arranged as imperfect inverted repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Richet et al., 1988</xref>). Because the openings of the two <italic>att</italic>P-bound Ints, positioned to bind <italic>att</italic>B, face in opposite directions they cannot dock <italic>att</italic>B by simple collision, i.e., the Int destined to bind the B core site must have the flexibility to wrap around the host chromosome from the opposite face. The integrative complex model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> has an inherently flexible P arm which we propose can transiently swing out along with Int bound at P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Ib</xref>). This would provide the dynamic binding required to embrace the bacterial chromosome and clasp onto a synapsed <italic>att</italic>B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Ic</xref>), a structural feature that is consistent with genetic and biochemical results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tong et al., 2014</xref>) and the especially high affinity of Int NTD for the P1 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sarkar et al., 2002</xref>). The structure and models are also consistent with the changes in topology that occur when integrative and excisive recombination reactions are carried out within the same circular DNA molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crisona et al., 1999</xref>) and with the requirement for negative supercoiling for efficient integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Richet et al., 1988</xref>).</p><p>The highly asymmetric arrangement of the NTDs in the structure and models reported here contrasts sharply with the tightly packed complexes seen in crystal structures of HJ-Int tetramers bound to truncated and symmetrized arm-type 'consensus' oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biswas et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, the asymmetry and inherent flexibility described here are critical elements in understanding the structural basis of the recombination mechanisms; they are both consistent with, and explanatory for, all of the extensive genetic, biochemical, and topological analyses of this recombination pathway. We suggest that, in addition to their significance for understanding regulated directionality in recombination, the results described here will also serve as exemplars for thinking about the complex regulatory machines so abundant in prokaryotic and eukaryotic biology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>The HJ complex was obtained through excisive recombination of <italic>att</italic>R and <italic>att</italic>L bubble substrates using the following conditions: 55 nM <italic>att</italic>R, 50 nM <italic>att</italic>L, 30 mM KCl, 60 mM NaCl, 0.005 mg/mL BSA, 25 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 150 nM IHF, 350 nM Xis and 350 nM Int were incubated at room temperature for 2 hr.

The mixture was concentrated using Amicon ultracell 50K filters (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA) to a volume of 100 μL and loaded onto a 2 mL sucrose gradient (22%–40% sucrose, 10 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 M Betaine) at 4°C. The gradient was run at 47,000 rpm using a TLS-55 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea CA) in a TL-100 tabletop ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) for 16 hr at 4°C. The gradient was fractionated into 100 μL slices which were examined on a 5% native PAGE to analyze the purity of the fractions.

We selected 52 good class averages to calculate initial maps with EMAN2 (e2initialmodel.py, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang et al., 2007</xref>]). The highest scoring map was used to initialize refinement and 3D classification in FREALIGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lyumkis et al., 2013</xref>), as described in the main text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.

For this estimate, the two 3D reconstructions obtained from half the data and used to calculate the FSC curve were masked with a tight mask that added a margin of about 15 Å around the reconstructed density of the Holliday junction complex. To assess how the mask affected the FSC curve, the 3D reconstructions were recalculated with particle images with randomized phases beyond 18 Å resolution and used to correct the FSC curve obtained from the masked reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).

The core complex consists of the catalytic and CB domains of Int (residues 75–356) and a 4-way DNA junction containing the C, C', B, and B' core half-sites. A P' arm complex containing IHF bound at H' and Int NTDs (residues 1–55) bound at P'1 and P'2 was constructed essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seah et al., 2014</xref>), except that the NTD•DNA segments were derived from the NMR structure of an NTD•P'2 DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fadeev et al., 2009</xref>). A P arm complex was also constructed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seah et al., 2014</xref>), except for the use of the NMR-based model for the NTD•P2 segment. The assembled P' arm was joined to the C' half-site and the P arm was joined to the C half-site to generate the initial excisive complex model. During all construction steps, DNA segments were joined by superimposing the flanking duplexes on an idealized B-DNA splint fragment, ensuring smooth continuity of DNA twist. DNA segments were extended by superposition of idealized B-DNA fragments of the appropriate length, using a similar overlap.</p><p>The initial complex was fit manually into EM density as a rigid body. Excellent agreement with the core complex was readily obtained, but the P and P' arms were not well-positioned in the envelope. The P and P' arms were fit into density by iterative testing of small ( ± 1°) roll angles in the protein-free regions and by varying the IHF-mediated DNA bends. Changes in bending and torsion of IHF•DNA complexes (&lt;10°) were made by rotating the DNA duplexes about the existing kinks (in-plane) or rotating the DNA arms about an axis connecting the two kink positions (torsion). The phosphate backbones of spliced, extended, and bent DNA segments were regularized to correct small deformations by highly restrained refinement in CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunger, 2007</xref>). To complete the model, the NTD-CB linker segments (residues 56–74) for the C', B, and B' subunits were fit into the EM envelope with essentially arbitrary conformations. The final model was refined with CNS using dynamic elastic network (DEN) restraints and torsion angle dynamics to obtain reasonable linker geometries and good overall stereochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schröder et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">2010</xref>). To restrain flexible regions of the model to remain within the EM envelope and to optimize the final model fit to density, we included an energy term for agreement with the Fourier coefficients of the EM density.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Construction of an integrative recombination model</title><p>An integrative HJ model was built from the excisive HJ complex based on the different bridging interactions that form during integrative recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tong et al., 2014</xref>). Binding of the C', C, and B' NTDs to the P' arm could be readily accommodated by changing the NTD-CB linker conformations; no change in the P' arm was required. A new P arm was assembled in the absence of Xis as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seah et al., 2014</xref>), using the NMR-based model for Int B-NTD binding to the P1 site. The initial model, lacking the phased bend induced by Xis, clearly indicated that the P arm must pass over P', with IHF bending at the H1 site responsible for re-directing the P1 site towards the Int tetramer. Small roll angle changes and bending at H1 and H2 (&lt; 10°) were used to obtain a P arm geometry that avoids steric clashes and positions the Int NTD bound at P1 close to the Int B CB domain. A small amount of bending of the P' site was found to better accommodate the P arm crossing. After insertion of CB-NTD linkers for each of the Int subunits (arbitrary conformations), the model was optimized using CNS to obtain reasonable linker geometries and good stereochemistry elsewhere.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Structural representations</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> were generated with UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">8</xref> were generated with Pymol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delano, 2002</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Mike Rigney for help with electron microscopy, and Christine Lank, Joanne Nelson, and Joan Boyles for help with complex preparation.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sjors Scheres as the Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andres Leschziner (peer reviewer) and Reid Johnson (peer reviewer).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The excisive intasome structure of the λ phage presented here represents the culmination of decades of biochemistry and structural biology (including some misleading X-ray structures) into an atomic model based on an 11 Å cryo-EM envelope. Lambda phage is one of the classic systems for understanding site-specific recombination-its enzymology, regulation and topology. Many structures have been reported for components of the system, as well as complexes between the integrase (Int) and shorter DNA fragments, but this is the first structure of the entire assembly and, as such, is a landmark for the field. This structure will be of interest to a broad audience, as generations of biologists grew up on the molecular biology of lambda, and one of the reviewers referred to the structure as an &quot;Ah moment&quot; for those in the site-specific recombination-transposition field. Therefore, there was general agreement that this paper would make an excellent contribution to <italic>eLife</italic>, and the suggestions for improvement below are all relatively minor.</p><p>Suggestions for revision:</p><p>As you can read in the detailed comments from the two original reviews that are copied for your information below, one of the reviewers wonders whether any previous data exists to address the additional postulated roles of Xis in promoting excision. This was further discussed online, and the conclusion was that it did not seem that the authors could clearly address their postulate with past data and new experiments to test this would be difficult. There was also a question regarding data behind the revision in the location of the P-P′ crossing in the integrative intasome model. However, in principal, none of the reviewers were against including this speculative model in the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #1 raises questions about the plausibility of the modeled conformation of the DNA, in particular within the IHF interfaces. Also this was discussed online, and the conclusion was that most likely this was caused by the relatively low-resolution of the map combined with either the manual building or the molecular dynamics procedure that was used to refine the final model. Given the relatively low-resolution of the map, reliable atomic model building is expected to be very difficult. Perhaps the authors could include a cautionary note in their revision, where the perhaps less structurally-inclined reader is warned against interpretations of the atomic model in too much detail? In addition, the limited resolution of the reconstruction probably stems from structural variability in the sample, probably in particular from flexibility in the DNA, so that the proposed model would at best be one out of many possible structures. Therefore, the addition of a local resolution map to inform about the most flexible parts of the structure was deemed informative.</p><p>In the online discussion, there were further comments on a perceived lack of clarity with which the cryo-EM image processing was described. So please take note of the suggestions by reviewer #2 to improve this. In addition, it would be insightful to include an FSC curve between the atomic model and the EM map.</p><p>Finally, reviewer #2 suggests improvements to some of the figures. Please take particular note of the suggestions to improve consistency of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and the chirality of the IHF arms in the model figures. Regarding the suggested changes to the movie and the cartoon: clearer figures and movies may indeed help to better convey the complicated organisation of your structure, but the extent to which you choose to modify the existing ones is left to your own judgement.</p><p>Detailed points by both reviewers:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Arguably, the most significant new aspect of the present cryo-EM based model is the close association of P and P' arm segments, suggesting an attractive additional function of Xis involving trans interactions with the P′ arm. (Note that in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Structural basis for regulated directionality of integrative and excisive recombination”, the sentence should be modified to say &quot;likely&quot; or &quot;are postulated to&quot; play an important role in facilitating synapsis). The authors discuss many other features of the model that explain biochemical properties of the reaction, particularly with respect to its directional regulation.</p><p>A more speculative model for the integrative intasome assembly is also presented that somewhat modifies the 2014 Seah et al. model, particularly with respect to the location of the P-P′ arm crossing. It is not clear to me what data is driving the revision. Although I don't believe we have learned that much new from the revised integrative intasome model, I am not opposed to including it here for the sake of completeness.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>There appears to be considerable modeling &quot;freedom&quot; in changing the path of DNA around the IHF dimers (especially H2) that seems to be necessary to generate the required writhe. The DNA paths deviate considerably from the 1IHF X-ray structure where the DNA is curved in a planar fashion as it follows along the basic sides of the protein. Is the DNA conformation within the IHF interfaces in the model structurally plausible?</p><p>In the subsection “Minimal structural changes link the two pairs of DNA strand exchange “– I am unclear on how the alternative HJ isomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) was modeled – what is the alternative HJ isomer structure specifically based on?</p><p>In the second paragraph of the subsection “Electron cryo-microscopy structure determination “– What is meant by 'randomly' assigned into 6 classes?</p><p>What is being referred to in the last sentence of the Abstract: &quot;…many excisive and integrative recombination pathways, and they help explain their regulation&quot;? I don't believe the various alternative pathways proposed for λ recombination are discussed (and don't need to be) here.</p><p>In the subsection heading 'An unexpected P' arm trajectory during excision', what is so unexpected? It seems very similar to earlier models and predicted from straightforward modeling without additional DNA bending-writhing.</p><p>In the sixth paragraph of the subsection “Structural basis for regulated directionality of integrative and excisive recombination”, what are the openings? The re-positioning of the Int-B subunit associated with the P1 site into a configuration competent to capture a naked attB seems like a very difficult step.</p><p>Would a color map displaying local resolution limits of the model be informative? Are the DNA loops as rigid as implied from the density maps?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>I have listed a few minor scientific comments below. My main concerns relate to how material is presented in the manuscript. Recombination is a rather impenetrable field for the non-cognoscenti and I feel the authors could have done a better job making their results accessible to the widest possible audience. I have a section below where I expand on these concerns.</p><p>Scientific points:</p><p>The authors speculate on the role of Xis in promoting recombination. They suggest that interactions between Xis and the Int-NTD stabilize the attL-attR complex. Is there any data supporting the role of this interaction? Are there known mutants in Xis that abolish or impair recombination whose general location agrees with the authors' model for their location in the excisive complex?</p><p>The authors also discuss the possible interaction between the highly basic (Arg, Lys) C-terminal tails of Xis and P/P' arm DNA and how this interaction could also stabilize the synapse. Have they (or anyone else) mutated these residues to test this idea?</p><p>The description of the EM data processing (&quot;Electron cryo-microscopy structure determination&quot;) will not be easy to follow for non-experts. The distinction between 2D and 3D class averages is not made very clear in the text and people with passing familiarity with EM data processing will likely think that &quot;particle alignment and classification&quot; refers to 2D processing. Also, the 3D reconstructions generated during the 3D classification processing are called &quot;classes&quot; in the text but &quot;reconstructions&quot; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. I think both are OK as long as they are used consistently. I would still recommend adding 2D and 3D when necessary to draw distinctions.</p><p>Presentation points:</p><p><xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>: This movie has the potential for being the centerpiece of this paper yet all it does is show the structure rotating around a single axis. We don't even get to see the Holliday junction down its pseudo four-fold axis. Given how complicated the structure is and that many readers (particularly those not familiar with the λ system or not that structurally inclined) will have a hard time translating the cartoons shown in the figures into 3D structures, this movie could be the one point where all these complexities can be made accessible. If nothing else, the structure should rotate around both the vertical and horizontal axes. But why not go further? After introducing the entire structure, the authors could strip all the proteins out to show the path of the DNA, then add each protein component one at a time, then remove it and go to the next. (For example, show the IHFs, remove them, show the different Int monomers, remove them, show the Xis's, etc. Proteins could also be shown in pairs to highlight their interactions.) It would further help if the structure rotated while those components are displayed. The movie could end by slowly adding, and keeping, the protein components, to build back the entire complex. It is true that readers could download the structure and do this themselves but the reality is that only people with a direct interest in λ recombination would do it.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>: This figure would benefit from a little better labeling of the protein components. The arrows inside the B/C/B'/C' boxes in panel A are very hard to see. I think the Integrative Holliday junction should be shown with as much detail as the Excisive one given that an important part of the paper is modeling the Integrative complex. It would be very useful for the reader to see the different location of the Int bridges in the two complexes. I found the color scheme in panel B confusing. Why do the Int ovals change colors between the top and middle cartoons?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: Although I realize this would take some work, a more geometrically realistic cartoon would help readers orient themselves better when looking at the structure. (For example, the IHF bound to H' is shown face-on in the cartoon while in the structure is appears edge-on, with the DNA in front.) Also, the handedness of the IHF is wrong in the cartoon in panel B (i.e. the wrong IHF arm is in front of the DNA). It would be useful if the putative density for the NTD of Int-C were indicated in this figure.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: It would help to add the axis of rotation relating the cartoons in A and B. It may not be obvious to everyone that the axis is perpendicular to the page, rather than parallel to it as it is the case for the structures. Also, the legend should specify that the structure in C corresponds to the cartoon viewed from the front.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: Every IHF in this figure has the wrong handedness (i.e. the wrong arm is in front of the DNA).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14313.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p> <italic>Arguably, the most significant new aspect of the present cryo-EM based model is the close association of P and P' arm segments, suggesting an attractive additional function of Xis involving trans interactions with the P′ arm.

Since the IHF bends at H' and H2 are crucial to establishing the initial trajectory of the P and P' arms, we felt that an updated model would benefit from knowing what those trajectories actually are (at the resolution of the model, of course). The result is that we are very confident of the P' arm trajectory and the general path of the P arm trajectory. There is obviously a lot of flexibility in the P arm, given the long stretch of naked DNA between H2 and H1, so the conformation we have modeled as it crosses over the complex is one of many possibilities that all look quite similar and lead to the same conclusions.</p><p><italic>Specific comments:</italic></p><p><italic>There appears to be considerable modeling &quot;freedom&quot; in changing the path of DNA around the IHF dimers (especially H2) that seems to be necessary to generate the required writhe.

We have intentionally restricted the IHF bending angles to prevent this. It is likely that the reviewer is seeing the bending that occurs outside of the H2 site, where the DNA has indeed been bent to follow the clear path outlined by the EM envelope. To measure the out-of-plane bending of DNA in the IHF-DNA modules, we calculate the A-B-C-D dihedral angle where A, B, C, and D refer to the centers of the i-15, i-3, i+3, i+15 base pairs, respectively, and the base pair centers are the midpoints of C1' atoms. The index i refers to the central base-pair in the site. For the IHF-DNA crystal structure, this angle is -30 degrees, corresponding to bending of each arm ~15 degrees out of the best plane through the DNA. This is similar to the small out of plane bending noted by Phoebe and Howard in their paper, where they pointed out that the sign of the angle is appropriate for negative supercoiled DNA. In the modeled H2 bend, the angle is -39 degrees. Thus, we have increased the out-of-plane component by ~4.5 degrees for each arm. For the H' bend, the angle is -25 degrees, where we have decreased each arm by ~2.5 degrees. These small changes appear to be easily accommodated by the IHF heterodimer. At 11 Å resolution, we of course cannot visualize what types of corresponding small changes might occur in the IHF protein in response.</p><p><italic>In the subsection “Minimal structural changes link the two pairs of DNA strand exchange “– I am unclear on how the alternative HJ isomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) was modeled – what is the alternative HJ isomer structure specifically based on?</italic></p><p>We assumed here that HJ isomerization is symmetric. This is the same assumption that was made for Cre recombinase isomerization. To generate the alternative isomer, the structure is rotated 90 degrees about the pseudo-fourfold symmetry of the HJ intermediate, and the protein subunits and DNA strands are then re-labeled accordingly. Top strand conformations become bottom strand conformations, active subunits become inactive subunits, etc. The finding that this could all be done within the central (core) confines of the excision complex with only minor adjustments required to connect to the fixed arms was what convinced us that the arms don't need to be active participants in the isomerization process that links the strand exchange steps during recombination.</p><p><italic>In the second paragraph of the subsection “Electron cryo-microscopy structure determination “– What is meant by 'randomly' assigned into 6 classes?</italic> </p><p>The goal of classification is to assign particles with common structural features to a class. If successful, different classes will represent different structures and reconstructions calculated from particles assigned to the same class will show distinctive features. If the assignment is not known a priori (as is the case here), particles are randomly assigned to different classes and, using an iterative procedure, these assignments are improved (refined) until convergence is reached, i.e. there is no further change in the assignments. To clarify the meaning of ‘randomly assigned’ the text was reworded to “Starting with reconstructions calculated from six randomly selected subsets of the data, particles were classified into six classes and their alignments refined in 40 iterations in which the resolution limit was increased in regular steps to a final limit of 20 Å.”</p><p><italic>What is being referred to in the last sentence of the Abstract: &quot;…many excisive and integrative recombination pathways, and they help explain their regulation&quot;? I don't believe the various alternative pathways proposed for λ recombination are discussed (and don't need to be) here.</italic></p><p>We were referring to the alternative reactions that λ int can catalyze, such as the 'bent-L pathway', but we agree that this is somewhat vague and is unlikely to be of value to the general readership. We have re-worded this.</p><p><italic>In the subsection heading 'An unexpected P' arm trajectory during excision', what is so unexpected? It seems very similar to earlier models and predicted from straightforward modeling without additional DNA bending-writhing.</italic></p><p>It was unexpected because it is relatively straight as it leaves the H' bend. This means that the P' arm cannot 'sit flat' on the Int tetramer as occurs in the Biswas et al. structure and model and in our previous FRET-based model. Additional bending is required to accomplish this. We agree that if one ignores previous models and structures, then the simplest thing is to just bend at H' and let the Int subunits bound at C' and B interact with unique linker conformations. But, to our knowledge, no one actually modeled that or suggested that it would occur like this.</p><p><italic>In the sixth paragraph of the subsection “Structural basis for regulated directionality of integrative and excisive recombination”, what are the openings? The re-positioning of the Int-B subunit associated with the P1 site into a configuration competent to capture a naked attB seems like a very difficult step.</italic></p><p>Agreed. But somehow, it has to happen. The NTD-P1 interaction is very tight. We don't know how tightly the Int catalytic domain interacts with the B' and C' catalytic domains in the absence of DNA; this could be quite weak. In this sense, the model we have proposed may be overemphasizing this interaction. In other words, the Int-B cat+cb domains may be so loosely associated that it is easier than it appears. Similarly, the Int-B' subunit could be loosely bound, so both subunits can search/wrap in a coordinated manner. We have also added a reference to the fact that Int binds the P1 site with higher affinity than all of the other arm sites, consistent with the suggested model for synapsis. We agree that this aspect of the model is speculative, but feel that the general nature of how integration must work in the context of a pre-formed attP complex is an important insight.</p><p><italic>Would a color map displaying local resolution limits of the model be informative? Are the DNA loops as rigid as implied from the density maps?</italic> </p><p>We have calculated a local resolution map, which is now included in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panel C. It shows that the resolution is fairly uniform. Nevertheless, the region with the lowest resolution occurs within the Int tetramer at the center of the structure. Presumably, this reflects some variability in this region, perhaps due to conformational variability. The local resolution map implies that the DNA loops are not significantly more flexible than other parts of the structure, as the reviewer suggests. A description of the local resolution map and its interpretation has been included in the figure legend.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p> <italic>I have listed a few minor scientific comments below. My main concerns relate to how material is presented in the manuscript. Recombination is a rather impenetrable field for the non-cognoscenti and I feel the authors could have done a better job making their results accessible to the widest possible audience. I have a section below where I expand on these concerns.</italic></p><p><italic>Scientific points:</italic></p><p><italic>The authors speculate on the role of Xis in promoting recombination. They suggest that interactions between Xis and the Int-NTD stabilize the attL-attR complex. Is there any data supporting the role of this interaction? Are there known mutants in Xis that abolish or impair recombination whose general location agrees with the authors' model for their location in the excisive complex?</italic></p><p>We looked for Xis mutants in the literature as soon as we realized what Xis was doing in the excision complex. Most of the focus on Xis has been on DNA binding/bending and cooperative binding of Int at P2. We were unable to find studies where other Xis residues had been targeted or characterized from screens. Our new excision complex structure paves the way for structure-function studies that were not possible in the past, including not only Xis, but the Int NTDs that are involved in trans NTD-arm interaction and NTD-Xis interactions.</p><p><italic>The authors also discuss the possible interaction between the highly basic (Arg, Lys) C-terminal tails of Xis and P/P' arm DNA and how this interaction could also stabilize the synapse. Have they (or anyone else) mutated these residues to test this idea?</italic> </p><p>To our knowledge, no. As noted above, these would be informative new experiments that can be done now that a structure model is available.</p><p> <italic>The description of the EM data processing (&quot;Electron cryo-microscopy structure determination&quot;) will not be easy to follow for non-experts. The distinction between 2D and 3D class averages is not made very clear in the text and people with passing familiarity with EM data processing will likely think that &quot;particle alignment and classification&quot; refers to 2D processing. Also, the 3D reconstructions generated during the 3D classification processing are called &quot;classes&quot; in the text but &quot;reconstructions&quot; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. I think both are OK as long as they are used consistently. I would still recommend adding 2D and 3D when necessary to draw distinctions.</italic> </p><p>Agreed. All references to density maps are now called 'reconstruction' and where classification is mentioned, it is clearly indicated whether it refers to 2D or 3D.</p><p><italic>Presentation points:</italic></p><p><italic><xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>: This movie has the potential for being the centerpiece of this paper yet all it does is show the structure rotating around a single axis. We don't even get to see the Holliday junction down its pseudo four-fold axis. Given how complicated the structure is and that many readers (particularly those not familiar with the λ system or not that structurally inclined) will have a hard time translating the cartoons shown in the figures into 3D structures, this movie could be the one point where all these complexities can be made accessible. If nothing else, the structure should rotate around both the vertical and horizontal axes. But why not go further? After introducing the entire structure, the authors could strip all the proteins out to show the path of the DNA, then add each protein component one at a time, then remove it and go to the next. (For example, show the IHFs, remove them, show the different Int monomers, remove them, show the Xis's, etc. Proteins could also be shown in pairs to highlight their interactions.) It would further help if the structure rotated while those components are displayed. The movie could end by slowly adding, and keeping, the protein components, to build back the entire complex. It is true that readers could download the structure and do this themselves but the reality is that only people with a direct interest in λ recombination would do it.</italic> </p><p>We agree with this suggestion and have put considerable effort into improving the video. Our new video shows several views (with rocking), adds subunits one at a time, and zooms in on the Xis-NTD and NTD-DNA interfaces that glue the P and P' arms together in the complex. We have added subtitles to annotate the structural transitions. In addition to providing 3D views that illustrate the points made in the manuscript, the video provides an independent summary of what is covered in the paper. Although it was a lot of work, we thank the reviewer for 'pushing' us to improve the video.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>: This figure would benefit from a little better labeling of the protein components. The arrows inside the B/C/B'/C' boxes in panel A are very hard to see. I think the Integrative Holliday junction should be shown with as much detail as the Excisive one given that an important part of the paper is modeling the Integrative complex. It would be very useful for the reader to see the different location of the Int bridges in the two complexes. I found the color scheme in panel B confusing. Why do the Int ovals change colors between the top and middle cartoons?</italic> </p><p>In order to make the suggested improvements, we split <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> into two new figures and re-numbered successive figures accordingly. One of the primary limitations on clarity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> was that we were trying to put the integrative pathway, the excisive pathway, and the HJ trapping strategy all into one figure. The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> is the introductory figure, illustrating the excisive and integrative pathways. The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> outlines the HJ trapping strategy. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (new number) we have more clearly distinguished the cleaving from inactive Ints by showing a Tyr342 symbol on the former.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: Although I realize this would take some work, a more geometrically realistic cartoon would help readers orient themselves better when looking at the structure. (For example, the IHF bound to H' is shown face-on in the cartoon while in the structure is appears edge-on, with the DNA in front.) Also, the handedness of the IHF is wrong in the cartoon in panel B (i.e. the wrong IHF arm is in front of the DNA). It would be useful if the putative density for the NTD of Int-C were indicated in this figure.</italic> </p><p>We have attempted to improve our schematics, but it is quite difficult to make them realistic and informative at the same time. This is particularly problematic for the edge-on views. We have changed our IHF schematic to avoid confusion with which subunit is 'on top' (discussed more below). The IHF handedness in panel B was fixed and we have included an arrow to indicate the extra density that could be NTD-C. Note: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: It would help to add the axis of rotation relating the cartoons in A and B. It may not be obvious to everyone that the axis is perpendicular to the page, rather than parallel to it as it is the case for the structures. Also, the legend should specify that the structure in C corresponds to the cartoon viewed from the front.</italic> </p><p>We have created new schematics for panels A and B, so the views of structures and cartoons are the same in each case. This was partly based on the suggestion above that we provide more realistic schematic models. Note: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: Every IHF in this figure has the wrong handedness (i.e. the wrong arm is in front of the DNA).</italic> </p><p>Thank you for noticing this. We have also modified the schematics in A &amp; B in a similar manner as for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), so they are more realistic. Note: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> is now Figure 10 in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
