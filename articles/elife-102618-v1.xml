The UBC population responds to brief burst activation of MFs with a continuum of temporal transformations, but it is not known how UBCs transform the diverse range of MF input patterns that occur in vivo. Here, we use cell-attached recordings from UBCs in acute cerebellar slices to examine responses to MF firing patterns that are based on in vivo recordings. We find that MFs evoke a continuum of responses in the UBC population, mediated by three different types of glutamate receptors that each convey a specialized component. AMPARs transmit timing information for single stimuli at up to 5 spikes/s, and for very brief bursts. A combination of mGluR2/3s (inhibitory) and mGluR1s (excitatory) mediates a continuum of delayed, and broadened responses to longer bursts, and to sustained high frequency activation. Variability in the mGluR2/3 component controls the time course of the onset of firing, and variability in the mGluR1 component controls the duration of prolonged firing. We conclude that the combination of glutamate receptor types allows each UBC to simultaneously convey different aspects of MF firing. These findings establish that UBCs are highly flexible circuit elements that provide diverse temporal transformations that are well suited to contribute to specialized processing in different regions of the cerebellar cortex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>unipolar brush cell</kwd><kwd>mGluR1</kwd><kwd>mGluR2</kwd><kwd>mossy fiber</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35NS097284</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Regehr</surname><given-names>Wade G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Different glutamate receptors have specialized roles that allow cerebellar unipolar brush cells to transform realistic mossy fiber input patterns into a continuum of temporal responses.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Unipolar brush cells (UBCs) are a specialized type of excitatory interneuron in the cerebellum and cerebellar-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altman and Bayer, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Floris et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mugnaini and Floris, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rossi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meek et al., 2008</xref>).

UBCs responses range from fast ‘ON’ cells that fire for hundreds of milliseconds with virtually no delay, to intermediate UBCs that initially pause before increasing firing for seconds, to ‘OFF’ UBCs that suppress firing for up to two seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huson et al., 2023</xref>).

Populations of UBCs exhibit a continuum of response durations and amplitudes, which is thought to reflect inverse expression profiles of the mGluR1 and mGluR2 signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kozareva et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Little is known about how UBCs transform MF activity patterns during behavior. This issue is complicated by regional differences in MF firing properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eccles et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lisberger and Fuchs, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Kan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garwicz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rancz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arenz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Witter and De Zeeuw, 2015</xref>). Even though UBCs are present throughout the cerebellar cortex, they are most abundant in regions involved in the control of eye position and in vestibular processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Floris et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diño et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takács et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Englund et al., 2006</xref>). MFs in these UBC-rich regions often fire in brief high-frequency bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eccles et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Kan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garwicz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rancz et al., 2007</xref>) that in some cases represent saccadic eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ohtsuka and Noda, 1992</xref>). MFs can also fire continuously for extended periods and change their firing rates dynamically to represent motor signals, and encode velocity, position, and direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lisberger and Fuchs, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Kan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arenz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barmack and Yakhnitsa, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lisberger, 2009</xref>). Brain slice experiments suggest that UBCs can perform useful computations that transform MF inputs. UBC responses to sinusoidal modulation of MF firing rates have been previously examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zampini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balmer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2021a</xref>). It was found that ‘OFF’ UBCs provide a phase reversed response in which the UBC fires out of phase with the MF, while AMPAR responses provide a variety of phase transformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zampini et al., 2016</xref>). Such temporal transformations are thought to provide granule cell activity patterns that can be used in combination with plasticity mechanisms to modify the phase of the Purkinje cell output. However, contributions from mGluR1 were not assessed in that study. The mGluR1 component is prone to washout, and non-invasive techniques are required for reliable long-lasting recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huson et al., 2023</xref>). As such, it is very difficult to predict how the complete UBC population will respond to the complex activity patterns observed in vivo, given the complex dynamics from differential activation of AMPARs, mGluR1s and mGluR2/3s.</p><p>Here, we characterize UBC firing evoked by MF input patterns that are based on in vivo recordings of MF firing during smooth pursuit eye movements. We recorded MF-evoked increases in UBC spiking using cell-attached recordings in brain slices and pharmacologically assessed the contributions of mGluR2/3s, AMPARs, and mGluR1s. AMPARs conveyed time-locked responses to single stimuli, brief bursts, and baseline stimulation at up to 5 spikes/s (spk/s). But for bursts of 20 stimuli, excitatory responses are primarily mediated by mGluR1. An interplay of mGluR2/3s and mGluR1s dominated UBC responses to bursts of 20 stimuli or more and prolonged increases in input, creating a continuum of temporally-filtered responses. In this way a combination of glutamate receptors allows single MF to UBC connections to simultaneously convey a spike-timing component and a temporally filtered component.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Diverse MF activity evokes wide ranging UBC responses</title><p>We set out to assess the UBC response to MF input patterns as observed in vivo in the vestibulocerebellum. For this purpose, we utilized in vivo recordings of MF activity during a smooth pursuit eye movement task from the floccular complex of rhesus macaques (provided by David J. Herzfeld and Stephen G. Lisberger) and reproduced the firing patterns observed there in acute cerebellar slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In their experiments, a head-fixed monkey was trained to track a smoothly moving visual target with minimal saccades while simultaneously recording single unit MF responses (see Methods). MF firing is comprised of sustained changes in firing that encode velocity and eye position, burst discharges that encode saccades, or a combination of both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lisberger and Fuchs, 1978</xref>). We selected 30 s periods of firing from two representative MFs recorded in separate sessions. One showed characteristic burst firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, green trace) and the other showed more sustained firing that increased or decreased in accordance with the smooth pursuit trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, green trace).

These stimuli evoked diverse long-lasting changes in firing, with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> depicting examples of a fast UBC with relatively brief increases in firing, a longer lasting mid-range UBC, a slow UBC with a long-lasting increase in firing, and a UBC that is spontaneously active and transiently stops firing (OFF). We then applied stimulation patterns from in vivo recordings to these same UBCs. The first representative in vivo MF displayed a series of bursts consisting of 2–23 spikes at very high frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, green trace) in line with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eccles et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rancz et al., 2007</xref>). Activating MF inputs to the UBCs with this stimulation pattern evoked a series of responses that were qualitatively consistent with those evoked by 20 stimuli at 100 spk/s bursts. However, in the slow UBC, repeated bursts resulted in what appeared to be an increase in steady-state firing, and burst stimulation primarily induced a pause in this firing. Generally, different MF bursts evoked responses of different magnitude, which was particularly evident in the OFF cell, where even small changes in the input evoked noticeable decreases in firing.</p><p>Next, we stimulated MF inputs to the same four UBCs using an in vivo MF firing pattern associated with smooth pursuit trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This firing pattern consists of mossy fiber firing at 10–20 spk/s that periodically increases to 40–80 spk/s. The three excitatory UBCs responded with firing patterns that were qualitatively similar to the mossy fiber input, with irregular firing at 10–50 spk/s periodically increasing by 20–60 spk/s in response to elevations in mossy fiber firing. However, UBC responses were delayed relative to mossy fiber inputs, peaking later and remaining elevated after the MF firing rates decreased. As such, the firing of the excitatory UBCs appeared to be a low-pass filtered version of the MF input, with the time course progressively slower and the extent of filtering more pronounced for the fast, mid-range and slow cells. The slow cell increased its firing only after the elevation in MF firing. The OFF UBC completely shut down during the increase in MF firing, and only fired in between increases in firing, or in response to decreases in firing, effectively inverting the MF firing pattern. Overall, the different UBCs provided diverse temporal transformations of the in vivo MF input patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The influence of MF burst duration on UBC responses</title><p>Given the diversity of spike numbers in MF bursts in vivo, we systematically examined the effects of MF burst duration on the UBC response.

There were large differences in the dependence of peak firing on burst duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Fast UBCs responded to all burst durations with consistently high peak responses that exceeded 100 spk/s, while intermediate and slow UBCs increased their peak response almost linearly with burst duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). As such, peak firing rates vary continuously across a wide range in response to 2 stimulus bursts, while in response to 20 stimulus bursts an apparent ceiling restricts the peak firing rates to a narrower range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). The number of spikes evoked by MF stimulation increased with burst duration in almost all cells, but increases were small in fast cells, and could grow more than 100-fold in slow cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). The half-widths of responses also increased with input duration for almost all UBCs, with the largest increases apparent when the number of stimuli increases from one to five (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these results indicate that UBCs can provide long-lasting responses to bursts with a wide range of input durations. After single stimuli and short bursts only fast UBCs respond with clear increases in firing, but these responses remain consistent as burst duration increases. This suggests that fast UBCs are suited to detecting the occurrence of a bust, regardless of burst duration. In contrast, slow UBCs are suited to detecting bursts of 5–20 MF spikes and scaling their responses proportionally to burst duration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Different glutamate receptors mediate distinct components of UBC responses</title><p>Many types of glutamate receptors are present at MF to UBC synapses, and it is not clear how each type contributes to responses evoked by MF bursts of different durations.

It is therefore surprising that AMPAR responses are so small or are not apparent in slower UBCs and OFF UBCs. Although mGluR2/3 inhibition obscured small AMPAR components in some cells (e.g. cell #10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), this was uncommon and did not account for the differences in AMPAR-mediated responses in the UBC population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). It is possible that differential expression of auxiliary proteins governs the amount of AMPAR current present in a UBC. TARP γ–2 controls the amplitude of slow AMPAR EPSCs in UBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2017</xref>), and it may be slightly elevated in UBCs that highly express mGluR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), which corresponds to fast excitatory UBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borges-Merjane and Trussell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kozareva et al., 2021</xref>). TARP γ–8 and TARP γ–7 have similar properties as TARP γ–2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jackson and Nicoll, 2011</xref>) and are also present in UBCs at low levels in UBCs. TARP γ–8 has an inverse expression pattern, and TARP γ–7 is expressed homogeneously, but their roles in regulating AMPARs in UBCs has not been examined. The expression of GSG1L, an AMPAR auxiliary subunit that is implicated in controlling AMPAR desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shanks et al., 2012</xref>), is of particular interest. GSG1L is expressed at high levels and shows a pronounced expression gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2c</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, each type of glutamate receptor makes a distinct contribution to responses to bursts. mGluR2/3s mediate pauses in firing for both short and long bursts in over half of the cells.

For some UBCs, each stimulus during 5 spk/s baseline input evoked brief increases in firing, and steps to higher firing rates evoked slower, more prolonged increased in firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, cell #4). Other fast UBCs did not respond to 5 spk/s stimulation, but steps to 10–60 spk/s evoked responses that began with a delay and persisted after the step ended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, cell #8). Along the sorted UBCs, 1 s steps evoked responses with increasingly delayed onset, and longer lasting increases in firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, cells #14 and #17). For slow cells, steps to 10–60 spk/s silenced firing during stimulation, and persistently elevated UBC firing after the step had ended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, cells #22 and #27).

These responses illustrate that UBCs provide both a temporal transformation of sustained changes in firing frequency, and discrete responses evoked by single stimuli. Single stimuli evoked changes in firing in a large percentage of cells for 5 spk/s stimulation, and responses were even larger for 1 spk/s and 2.5 spk/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>As the step change of the input rate increased, the UBC population showed an increasingly wider range of responses. The number of evoked spikes that occurred during the 1 s steps increased for fast and intermediate UBCs, while slower UBCs tended to reduce their firing; with 45% of UBCs (14/31) reducing firing during the 60 spk/s step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Step changes more consistently evoked increases in firing in the 3 s after the step, with 87% (27/31) of UBCs firing more spikes after a 60 spk/s step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), leaving only the slowest cells (#28–31) with net decreases in spiking. Some UBCs showed much larger responses for higher stimulus frequencies (e.g. cell #8 and #27, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), while others were strikingly consistent (e.g. cell #4 and #17, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). However, this property did not vary in alignment with the sorting of the UBCs by their half-width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e and f</xref>). In cells with clear increases in firing after step changes (cells #1–27), we estimated time to peak for the responses to 60 spk/s steps by fitting the instantaneous firing rates with a log-gaussian function (see Methods). We observed gradually more delayed peaks in line with the UBC sorting ranging from less than 20ms to almost 2 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Half-decay times of the step responses were also highly correlated with the half-widths of the responses to 20 stimuli at 100 spk/s bursts (for the 60 spk/s step: Spearman’s Rho = 0.873, p=1.40 × 10<sup>–6</sup>), and did not consistently change with firing frequency. Of the cells that showed increases in firing, 33% (9/27) took more than 1 s after the steps for their response amplitude to decay by half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>), causing increases in firing to gradually build during the protocol, such that the response to step to 20 spk/s late in the protocol was far larger than one early in the protocol (e.g. cell #22 and #27, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).</p><p>Overall, during smooth pursuit-like MF input, fast UBCs closely follow the input pattern, while slow UBCs produce strongly temporally filtered responses, in line with responses to 20 stimuli at 100 spk/s bursts. However, many UBCs additionally preserve timing information with discrete changes in firing time-locked to lower rate baseline stimuli. As such, multiple streams of information appear to be simultaneously encoded by the response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>mGluR1 is the main mediator of UBC responses to smooth pursuit-like input patterns</title><p>We used selective antagonists to determine the roles of different glutamate receptors in mediating responses evoked by the stimulus protocol in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>.

AMPARs primarily mediate responses to high frequency bursts of up to 5 stimuli, but as the burst duration increases their contribution diminishes and mGluR1s are the primary driver of increases in firing for most UBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). A large fraction of the UBC population fire in response to each stimulus during 1–5 spk/s MF stimulation, and these responses are driven almost entirely by AMPARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although brief compared to UBC responses mediated by mGluR1s following prolonged bursts, AMPAR responses still last up to 400ms, which is much longer than AMPA-mediated EPSCs observed at most synapses. This slow time course is consistent with the properties of AMPAR EPSCs at MF-UBC synapses that arise from the ultrastructure of UBC synapses, the resulting slow glutamate signal, and the distinctive properties of the AMPARs present in UBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rossi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kinney et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Dorp and De Zeeuw, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balmer et al., 2021</xref>). Several aspects of AMPAR-mediated spiking are readily explained by known properties of UBC synapses. The multiple phases of the AMPAR response evoked by 20 stimuli at 100 spk/s bursts likely reflect initial activation, desensitization during stimulation, and a large slow rebound current after stimulation as the prolonged presence of glutamate activates AMPARs as they recover from desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> cell #8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kinney et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Dorp and De Zeeuw, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balmer et al., 2021</xref>).The frequency-dependent decrease in AMPAR mediated burst magnitude (compare 1 and 5 spk/s <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) also likely arises from AMPAR desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Dorp and De Zeeuw, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Contributions of AMPARs to MF-evoked responses are most apparent in fast UBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), even though AMPAR subunits are expressed uniformly across the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kozareva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b</xref>). It is therefore surprising that AMPAR responses are so small or are not apparent in slower UBCs and OFF UBCs. It is possible that differential expression of auxiliary proteins such as TARPs or GSG1L governs the amplitude of AMPAR responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2c</xref>), but further experiments are required to determine if this is the case.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The roles of mGluR2/3s in MF-UBC responses</title><p>Suppression provided by mGluR2/3 receptors influences UBC responses in multiple ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). (1) It suppresses baseline firing after a MF burst in ‘OFF’ UBCs, a role that has been extensively described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knoflach and Kemp, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Russo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borges-Merjane and Trussell, 2015</xref>). (2) In most cells with a prominent pause in firing, suppression is followed by slow excitation mediated by mGluR1s. In these cells mGluR2/3s introduces a delay between the onset of MF stimulation and the response in the UBC. This is important for many UBCs that respond to 1 s MF activation with a delayed peak in firing that occurs long after the increase in MF firing rate. In this way mGluR2/3s crucially contribute to UBCs filtering of MF inputs by selectively influencing the slow rise of UBC spiking without influencing the time course of decay. (3) There is also an interplay between mGluR2/3 suppression and excitation by AMPARs and mGluR1s such that even in cells when suppression is not apparent, mGluR2/3s reduce the number of spikes evoked by stimulation. (4) In many UBCs, single stimuli lead to decreases that are mediated by mGluR2/3s.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The roles of mGluR1s in MF-UBC responses</title><p>mGluR1s mediate slow responses that gradually build during repetitive activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Single stimuli and brief bursts build up too little glutamate to effectively activate mGluR1 and drive excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batchelor et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tempia et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brasnjo and Otis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</xref>). mGluR1-mediated responses increase as the total number of spikes in the burst increases. In UBCs with prominent AMPAR responses, increasing the number of spikes in a high frequency burst leads to a transition from responses being primarily mediated by AMPARs to responses being mediated by mGluR1s. In these UBCs a combination of AMPARs and mGluR1s conveys relatively consistent increases in peak firing that could not be achieved by either receptor alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Such UBCs are highly effective at detecting the presence of a burst, but they are not suited to differentiating between bursts comprised of different numbers of MF spikes. In UBCs with a small AMPAR component and a prominent mGluR1 component, the UBC peak firing rate of the UBC response is strongly related to the number of spikes in the MF input burst. Similarly, increasing the firing rate of 1 s steps during prolonged MF input, as occurs during smooth pursuit eye movements, leads to increases in the magnitude of UBC responses. Additionally, mGluR1s also participate in temporally filtering MF input by mediating broad UBC responses of different durations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huson et al., 2023</xref>). However, during prolonged stimulation mGluR1s only play a crucial role in regulating the duration of UBC spiking following changes in the input rate, whereas the delay in the firing rate increase reflects the time course of mGluR2/3 suppression and is not limited by the time course of mGluR1 activation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Functional roles of MF transformations by the UBC population</title><p>Although the manner in which UBCs contribute to cerebellar-dependent behaviors has not been established, the properties of transformations at MF-UBC synapses provide insight into several possible functions. With regard to eye movements, the cerebellum is thought to aid in adaptation for real-time error correction during target tracking, and in learning to predict target trajectory both for saccades and smooth eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shadmehr, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soetedjo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lisberger, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Saccadic eye movements are represented in MF signaling by rapid bursts preceding the onset of movement. The peak firing rate of a MF burst can encode the saccade amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ohtsuka and Noda, 1992</xref>). In Purkinje cells, eye velocity during saccades is encoded in the average response of the population, with individual cells showing diverse firing patterns including increases and decreases that can outlast the saccade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herzfeld et al., 2015</xref>). Changes in the simple spike firing rate has been suggested to underly adaptation of saccadic eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soetedjo et al., 2019</xref>). UBC responses similarly consist of increases or decreases in firing that outlast the input, and as such, may contribute to the diversity in Purkinje cell firing rates, possibly providing a wider distribution of signals to support adaptation.</p><p>Visual feedback to the cerebellum lags eye movement by more than 100ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raymond and Lisberger, 1998</xref>). Therefore, to accurately track a target along its trajectory as during smooth pursuit, predictive eye movement signals are required. Temporal transformations by UBCs may be crucial to generating diverse signals to provide Purkinje cells with the appropriate substrate for learning, similar to how UBCs contribute to the diversity required for generating predictions of electrosensory feedback in weakly electric fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, mGluR2/3-generated delays in UBC responses are suited to encode timing, which is consistent with the hypothesis that timing rather than target position predicts the trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Medina et al., 2005</xref>). Generally, learning a target trajectory takes place over hundreds of trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Medina et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hall et al., 2018</xref>), but short-term plasticity is also exhibited when an instructive signal given in one trial biases eye movement in the next trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang and Lisberger, 2010</xref>). This bias persists for 4–10 s, which is comparable to the durations of mGluR1-mediated increases in firing in slow UBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huson et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This raises the possibility that UBCs may provide a short-term plasticity signal that could be used to bias motion.</p><p>MF signals encoding vestibular modulation are also likely transformed by UBCs to enable behavioral adaptation. Previous work has highlighted that during sinusoidal vestibular input MF signals mostly remain in-phase, while granule cells fire in a range of different phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arenz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barmack and Yakhnitsa, 2008</xref>). UBCs have been shown to phase shift sinusoidal inputs, enabling the cerebellum to learn to output signals at arbitrary shifts from the input which may enable learning of phase-shifted VOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zampini et al., 2016</xref>). That study focused on AMPAR and mGluR2/3 mediated changes in firing. The combination of delayed temporally-filtered responses mediated by mGluR2/3 and mGluR1, and the discrete changes in firing in response to single stimuli we describe here, enables the UBC population to provide transformations that are more complex than simple phase-shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and may be used for adaptations at longer time scales and to irregular input patterns.</p><p>Having separate response components also broadens the types of input UBCs can respond to, with AMPAR and mGluR2/3 responding to brief inputs, and mGluR1 and mGluR2/3 responding to long-lasting inputs. While UBCs are enriched in regions processing eye and vestibular signals, they are consistent circuit elements throughout the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Floris et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diño et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takács et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Englund et al., 2006</xref>).

UBCs are inhibited by Golgi cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rousseau et al., 2012</xref>), and a subset of UBCs are also inhibited by PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2021a</xref>). Although the potential influence of inhibition is of considerable interest, brain slice experiments are poorly suited to addressing this issue. Golgi cells are fragile and many do not survive in adult brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hull and Regehr, 2012</xref>), and many of the complex PC axon collaterals are severed before reaching UBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2021b</xref>). In addition, it is exceedingly difficult to activate the population of PCs and Golgi cells as would occur in vivo. In contrast to the simplicity of a single MF input exciting a UBC, Golgi cells are directly activated by many MFs, by MF → granule cell → Golgi cell synapses, and by MF→UBC→ granule cell→Golgi cell synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hull and Regehr, 2022</xref>), and PCs are activated by a great many MF → granule cell → PC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Witter et al., 2016</xref>), by MF→UBC→ granule cell→PC→synapses and granule cell→molecular layer interneuron synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hull and Regehr, 2022</xref>). As a result of these complexities, it will therefore be necessary to perform experiments in vivo to determine how Golgi cell and PC inhibition influences UBC transformations of MF inputs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:IMSR_CRL:027">IMSR_CRL:027</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NBQX disodium salt</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ab120046</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(R)-CPP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ab120159</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strychnine hydrochloride</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ab120416</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Picrotoxin</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tocris</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat.

We also showed that the responses were all-or-none: at low intensities no response was evoked, as the intensity of extracellular stimulation was increased a large response was suddenly evoked at a threshold intensity and further increases in intensity did not increase the amplitude of the response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2021b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In vivo mossy fiber firing patterns</title><p>In vivo mossy fiber recordings were provided by David J. Herzfeld and Stephen G. Lisberger. Recordings were made using either single tungsten microelectrodes (FHC,~1 MΩ) or 16-channel Plexon S-probes in the ventral paraflocculus of a head-fixed rhesus monkey during a smooth pursuit eye movement task. Complete experimental details have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Herzfeld et al., 2023</xref>). Spikes were sorted using Full-binary pursuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hall et al., 2021</xref>), and manually curated by David J. Herzfeld. The mossy fiber traces reproduced in slice in this work were continuous 30 s recordings while the monkey was engaging in smooth pursuit eye movement trials. Briefly, smooth pursuit eye movement trials required the monkey to track a dot as it moves across a monitor at a constant speed. In each trial, the dot would appear stationary in the center of the monitor for 400–800ms before moving at a constant speed in one of 4 cardinal directions for 650ms. The dot would then remain stationary in an eccentric position for another 200ms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Pharmacology</title><p>Sequential drug wash-ins were performed by switching the bath solution to the same solution with addition of the antagonist(s), taking care to keep the flow rate consistent throughout (2 ml / min). Wash-ins were only performed when UBCs showed stable responses for at least 7.5 minutes. Cells with significant shifts in firing independent of mossy fiber stimulation during wash-ins were excluded from analysis. mGluR2/3s were blocked using LY 341495 (1–5 µM, Tocris). AMPARs were blocked using NBQX (5 µM, Abcam). mGluR1s were blocked using JNJ 16259685 (1 µM, Tocris). NMDARs were blocked using R-CPP (5 µM, Abcam).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>UBC responses were characterized using instantaneous firing rates in response to 20 stimuli at 100 spk/s bursts averaged over 5–10 median filtered trials recorded before other stimulation paradigms. Baseline firing was estimated from this using the second preceding mossy fiber stimulation. Pause duration was calculated as the time between the end of the stimulation and the moment firing reached 5 spk/s or half the peak firing rate (whichever was smaller). The peak change in firing was calculated by subtracting the baseline firing rate from the peak firing rate after the end of MF stimulation. The half-width was calculated as the time between when the firing rate first exceeded and then decayed to half the peak amplitude (baseline corrected). UBCs were sorted by their half-width when the peak change in firing exceeded 8 spk/s (cell 1–61) or by their pause duration (cell 62–70).</p><p>Response parameters for different burst durations were calculated in a similar manner, with separate 20 stimuli at 100 spk/s trials recorded in proximity to other burst durations used for comparison. Additionally, the number of spikes evoked by MF stimulation was calculated by integrating the period from the start of stimulation till 2 times the UBCs half-width after the start of the response. The number of spikes was corrected for baseline firing. For smooth pursuit-like input patterns the number of spikes evoked by step changes in input were calculated in a similar manner but corrected for the average firing rate in the 1 s preceding the step change. To determine time to peak, responses to step changes were fit with a log-normal function, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the amplitude,  μ is the peak location, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the width in log time. The half-decay of the response to step changes was calculated by finding the first point where the firing rate decreased to half the peak response, using an interpolated trace where responses to individual stimuli had been removed. For experiments with constant input at 1, 2.5, and 5 spk/s peak firing rates and number of spikes were calculated based on the average of all responses excluding the first 5, without correcting for baseline firing. For wash-in experiments all parameters were estimated based on trials 2–2.5 min after the start of the application of the antagonist, when responses to 20 stimuli at 100 spk/s bursts had reached a steady state. Significant differences in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5f</xref> were determined using non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Correlation was determined using Spearman’s correlation coefficient. All analyses were done using MATLAB R2023b (MathWorks).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal procedures were carried out in accordance with the NIH and Animal Care and UseCommittee (IACUC) guidelines and protocols approved by the Harvard Medical Area StandingCommittee on Animals (protocol #IS00000124).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-102618-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data that support the findings in this study have been deposited in Harvard Dataverse at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EBL6C3">https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EBL6C3</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Huson</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Regehr</surname><given-names>WG</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2024">2024</year><data-title>Unipolar brush cell responses to realistic mossy fiber input</data-title><source>Harvard Dataverse</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7910/DVN/EBL6C3</pub-id></element-citation></p><p>The following previously published dataset was used:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="references" id="dataset2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kozareva</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Osorno</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Rudolph</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Vanderburg</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Nadaf</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Regev</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Regehr</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Macosko</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2021">2021</year><data-title>A transcriptomic atlas of mouse cerebellar cortex reveals novel cell types</data-title><source>Single Cell Portal</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP795/a-transcriptomic-atlas-of-the-mouse-cerebellum">SCP795</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Stephen G Lisberger and David J Herzfeld for providing in vivo mossy fiber recordings and for their comments and input on the project.

Commun., 2021).</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that the present study is a major advance. It builds on (Guo et al., Nat. Commun., 2021) in which we examined the effects of bursts of 20 stimuli at 100 spk/s. In that study we found that differential expression of mGluR1 and mGluR2 let to a continuum of temporal responses in UBCs, but AMPARs make a minimal contribution for such bursts. It was not known how UBCs transform realistic mossy fiber input patterns. Here we provide a comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of input patterns that include a range of bursts comprised of 1-20 stimuli, sustained stimulation with stimulation of 1 spk/s to 60 spk/s. This more thorough assessment of UBC transformations combined with a pharmacological assessment of the contributions of different glutamate receptor subtypes provided many new insights:</p><p>• We found that UBC transformations are comprised of two different components: a slow temporally filtered component controlled by an interplay of mGluR1 and mGluR2, and a second component mediated by AMPARs that can convey spike timing information. NMDARs do not make a major contribution to UBC firing. The finding that UBCs simultaneously convey two types of signals, a slow filtered response and responses to single stimuli, has important implications for the computational potential of UBCs and fundamentally changes the way we think about UBCs.</p><p>• We found that with regard to the slow filtered component mediated by mGluR1 and mGluR2, we could extend the concept of a continuum of responses evoked by 20 stimuli at 100 spk/s (Guo et al., Nat. Commun., 2021) to a wide range of stimuli. It was not a given that this would be the case.</p><p>• The contributions of AMPARs was surprising. Even though snRNAseq data did not reveal a gradient of AMPAR expression across the population of UBCs (Guo et al., Nat. Commun., 2021), we found that there was a gradient of AMPA-mediated responses, and that the AMPA component was also most prominent in cells with a large mGluR1 component. Our finding that AMPAR accessory proteins exhibit a gradient across the population, which could account for the gradient of AMPAR responses, will prompt additional studies to test their involvement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The MF activity used to mimic natural stimulation was previously collected in primates, while the recordings were conducted in mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Our first task was to determine the firing properties of mossy fibers under physiological conditions in UBC rich cerebellar regions. Previous studies have estimated this in anesthetized mice using whole cell granule cell recordings (Arenz et al., 2008; Witter &amp; De Zeeuw 2015). However, for assessing firing patterns during awake behavior, we felt that the most comprehensive data set available in a UBC rich cerebellar region was for mossy fibers involved in smooth pursuit in monkeys (David J. Herzfeld and Stephen G. Lisberger). This revealed the general features of mossy fiber firing that helped us design stimulus patterns to thoroughly probe the properties of MF to UBC transformations. The firing patterns are designed to investigate the transformations for a wide range of activity patterns and have important general implications for UBC transformations that are likely applicable to UBCs in different species that are activated in different ways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Inhibition was blocked throughout the study, reducing its physiological relevance.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly brings up the very important issue of inhibition in shaping UBC responses. It is well established that UBCs are inhibited by Golgi cells (Rousseau et al., 2012), and we recently showed that some UBCs are also inhibited by PCs (Guo et al., eLife, 2021). This will undoubtedly influence the firing of UBCs in vivo. We considered examining this issue, but felt that brain slice experiments are not well suited to this. In contrast to MF inputs that can be activated with a realistic activity pattern, it is exceedingly difficult to know how Golgi cells and Purkinje cells are activated under physiological conditions. Each UBC is activated by a single mossy fiber, but inhibition is provided by Golgi cells that are activated by many mossy fibers and granule cells, and PCs that are controlled by many granule cells and many other PCs. In addition, we found that many Golgi cells do not survive very well in slices, and the axons of many PCs are severed in brain slice. Although limitations of the slice preparation prevent us from determining the role of inhibition in shaping UBC responses, we have added a section to the discussion in which we address the important issue of inhibition and UBC responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>This study addresses the question of how UBCs transform synaptic input patterns into spiking output patterns and how different glutamate receptors contribute to their transformations. The first figure utilizes recorded patterns of mossy fiber firing during eye movements in the flocculus of rhesus monkeys obtained from another laboratory.

The remaining experiments stimulate mossy fiber inputs at different rates or burst durations, which is described as 'mossy-fiber like', although they are quite simpler than those recorded in vivo. As expected from previous work, AMPA mediates the fast responses, and mGluR1 and mGluR2/3 mediate the majority of longer-duration and delayed responses. The manuscript is well organized and the discussion contextualizes the results effectively.</p><p>The authors use extracellular recordings because the washout of intracellular molecules necessary for metabotropic signaling may occur during whole-cell recordings. These cell-attached recordings do not allow one to confirm that electrical stimulation produces a postsynaptic current on every stimulus. Moreover, it is not clear that the synaptic input is monosynaptic, as UBCs synapse on one another. This leaves open the possibility that delays in firing could be due to disynaptic stimulation. Additionally, the result that AMPAmediated responses were surprisingly small in many UBCs, despite apparent mRNA expression, suggests the possibility that spillover from other nearby synapses activated the higher affinity extrasynaptic mGluRs and that that main mossy fiber input to the UBC was not being stimulated. For these reasons, some whole-cell recordings (or perforated patch) would show that when stimulation is confirmed to be monosynaptic and reliable it can produce the same range of spiking responses seen extracellularly and that AMPA receptormediated currents are indeed small or absent in some UBCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concerns regarding the reliability of mossy fiber activation, the possibility of glutamate spillover from other synapses, and the possibility of disynaptic activation involving stimulation of MFàUBCàUBC connections. We examined these issues in a previous study (Guo et al., Nat. Commun., 2021). We did on-cell recordings and followed that up with whole cell voltage clamp recordings from the same cell (Guo et al., Nat. Commun., 2021, Fig. 5), and there was good agreement with the amplitude and timing of spiking and the time course and amplitudes of the synaptic currents. We also compared responses evoked by focal glutamate uncaging over the brush and MF stimulation (Guo et al., Nat. Commun., 2021, Fig. 4). We found that the time courses and amplitudes of the responses were remarkably similar. This strongly suggests that the responses we observe do not reflect disynaptic activation (MFàUBCàUBC connections). We also showed that the responses were all-or-none: at low intensities no response was evoked, as the intensity of extracellular stimulation was increased a large response was suddenly evoked at a threshold intensity and further increases in intensity did not increase the amplitude of the response (Guo et al., Nat. Commun., 2021, Extended data Fig. 1). We can be well above threshold and still excite the same response, and as a result we do not see stereotyped indications of an inability to stimulate during prolonged high frequency activation. We recognize the importance of these issues, so we have added a section dealing explicitly with these issues (pp. 15-16).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A discussion of whether the tested glutamate receptors affected the spontaneous firing rates of these cells would be informative as standing currents have been reported in UBCs. It is unclear whether the firing rate was normalized for each stimulation, each drug application, or each cell. It would also be informative to report whether UBCs characterized as responding with Fast, Mid-range, Slow, and OFF responses have different spontaneous firing rates or spontaneous firing patterns (regular vs irregular).</p></disp-quote><p>The spontaneous firing of UBCs is indeed an interesting issue that is deserving of further investigation. It is not currently known how spontaneous firing at rest is regulated in UBCs, however, in previous work we have shown that there is great diversity in the rates across the population of UBCs in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (Huson &amp; Regehr, JNeurosci, 2023, Fig. 4). Unfortunately, during the kind of sustained high-frequency stimulation protocols (as used in this study) spontaneous firing rates tend to increase. This is likely an effect of residual receptor activation. As such, our current dataset is not suitable to performing in depth analysis of the effects of the different glutamate receptors on spontaneous firing rates. As this study aims to explore UBC responses to MF inputs we feel that specific experiments to address the issue of spontaneous firing rates are outside of the scope.</p><p>As the reviewers points out there are indeed different ways the firing rates can be normalized for display in the heatmaps, and different normalizations have been used in different figures. We have made sure that the method for normalization is clearly indicated in the figure legends for each of the heatmaps on display, specifying the protocol and drug application used for normalization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 shows examples of how Fast, Mid-range, Slow, and OFF UBCs respond to in vivo MF firing patterns, but lacks a summary of how the input is transformed across a population of UBCs. In panel d, it looks as if the phase of firing becomes more delayed across the examples from Fast to OFF UBCs. Quantifying this input/output relationship more thoroughly would strengthen these results.</p></disp-quote><p>The UBC responses to in vivo MF firing patterns are intriguing and we agree that there appears to be increasing delays for slower UBCs visible in Figure 1. However, we feel that the true in vivo MF firing patterns are too complex and irregular for rigorous interpretation. Therefore, we only tested simplified burst and smooth pursuit-like input patterns on the full population of UBCs. Here we indeed do see increasingly delayed responses as UBCs get slower (Fig. 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Inhibition was pharmacologically blocked in these studies. Golgi cells and other inhibitory interneurons likely contribute to how UBCs transform input signals. Speculation of how GABAergic and glycinergic synaptic inhibition may contribute additional context to help readers understand how a circuit with intact inhibition may behave.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated in our response to reviewer 1, we have added a section discussing the very important issue of inhibition and UBC responses in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Including recordings without inhibition blocked would strengthen the study and provide a more comprehensive view of the transformations made by UBCs at the input stage of the cerebellar cortex.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to public comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors claim that a continuum of temporal responses was observed in UBCs, but they also distinguish between fast, mid-range, slow, and OFF UBCs. While some UBCs fire spontaneously, others are activated by MF inputs. A more thorough classification effort would clarify the various response profiles observed under specific MF stimulation regimes.

In our previous work we have shown that UBC population constitutes a continuum in terms of gene expression, and in terms of spontaneous and evoked firing patterns. While in order to answer some questions empirically it may still be useful to apply advanced algorithms to enforce separate groups to be compared, in this work we aimed to present the full range of UBC responses without introducing any additional biases that such methods would produce.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) A robust classification could assist in quantifying the temporal shifts observed during smooth pursuit-like MF stimulation, a critical outcome of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, we prefer to present an unbiased overview of the continuous nature of the UBC population, as we believe that this is fundamentally the most accurate representation. While it is true that this prevents us from providing a quantification in the different temporal shifts, we believe that the range of shifts across the population is sufficiently large and continuously varying the be convincing (see Figure 4d).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 5, contrary to what is described on page 10, Cells 10 and 11 (OFF UBCs) appear to behave differently, as mGluR1 does not seem to affect their firing rates. A specific case should be made for OFF UBCs.</p><p>Indeed, cells 10 and 11 do not show clear increases in firing and are not strongly affected by blocking of mGluR1. However, as discussed above and explored in our previous work, we feel that the range of UBC increases in firing is best described as a continuum, including the extreme where increases in firing are no longer clearly observable. As the aim in this work is to describe this continuum of responses for physiologically relevant inputs, we do not feel there is a benefit to creating a specific case for OFF UBCs here. It should be pointed out that the number of “pure” OFF UBCs completely lacking an mGluR1 component is very small.</p><p>(5) A summary diagram should be added at the end of the manuscript to highlight the key temporal features observed in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion and we have prepared such a summary diagram (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Page 3- &quot;Assed&quot; should be &quot;assessed&quot;</p><p>(2) Page 19- &quot;by integrating&quot; is repeated twice</p><p>(3) It was not noted whether the data would be made available.
