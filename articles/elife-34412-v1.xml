A key characteristic of a clinical trial is its statistical power. Here we investigate whether the statistical power of a trial is related to the gender of first and last authors on the paper reporting the results of the trial. Based on an analysis of 31,873 clinical trials published between 1974 and 2017, we find that adequate statistical power was most often present in clinical trials with a male first author and a female last author (20.6%, 95% confidence interval 19.4-21.8%), and that this figure was significantly higher than the percentage for other gender combinations (12.5-13.5%; P&lt;0.0001). The absolute number of female authors in clinical trials gradually increased over time, with the percentage of female last authors rising from 20.7% (1975-85) to 28.5% (after 2005). Our results demonstrate the importance of gender diversity in research collaborations and emphasize the need to increase the number of women in senior positions in medicine.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>statistical power</kwd><kwd>mixed sex collaborations</kwd><kwd>Cochrane meta-analysis</kwd><kwd>clinical study</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial (RCT)</kwd><kwd>meta research</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001826</institution-id><institution>ZonMw</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>445001002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Otte</surname><given-names>Willem M</given-names></name><name><surname>Tijdink</surname><given-names>Joeri K</given-names></name><name><surname>Lamberink</surname><given-names>Herm J</given-names></name><name><surname>Vinkers</surname><given-names>Christiaan H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>VENI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>016.168.038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Otte</surname><given-names>Willem M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An analysis of 31,873 clinical trials shows that adequate statistical power was most often present in trials with a male first author and a female last author.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is increasing awareness that many clinical trials have systematic methodological flaws and that their results may be biased, exaggerated, and difficult to reproduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ioannidis et al., 2014</xref>). Clinical trials are the result of complex group efforts. Male and female researchers differ in their collaborative strategies which depends on the level of their expertise and whether they have a junior or senior position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bozeman and Gaughan, 2011</xref>). There are indications that mixed gender teams may make the best use of personal knowledge and skills, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nielsen et al., 2017</xref>) an effect also reported in a scientific research context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Woolley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell et al., 2013</xref>). Even though this may in turn positively influence the quality of clinical research, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nielsen et al., 2017</xref>) no studies have systematically investigated whether collaborations between male and female researchers affect the quality of clinical trials. This topic is important in light of the existing diversity challenges that currently exist in the biomedical research field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Valantine and Collins, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we therefore aimed to quantify the effect of collaborations across gender combinations of junior and senior authors on the methodological quality of clinical trials. To this aim, we determined the percentage of adequately powered trials in 31,873 clinical trials published between 1974 and 2017 based on Cochrane meta-analyses. As statistical power reflects the chance of detecting a true effect, it is regarded as one of the key elements of responsible research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Button et al., 2013</xref>) and considered essential in reproducible clinical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Halpern et al., 2002</xref>). We found that the probability of having adequate statistical power for one combination - male first author, female last author - was significantly higher than that for the other three possible combinations. Moreover, this effect was present across countries and most medical fields.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Statistical power and gender combinations in all clinical trials (N=31,873)</title><p>In our 31,873 trials, the number of published clinical trials with adequate statistical power (&gt;80%) was generally low (12-13%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel). The exception was the set of trials with a male first author combined with a female last author with 20.6% of outcomes adequately powered (CI 19.4â21.8). This percentage was significantly higher in comparison to the three other combinations (highest odds ratio 2.08, CI 1.87â2.30, P&lt;0.0001). Cut-off values for adequate power set to either 70% or 90% yielded comparable results (P&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The percentage of adequately powered trials in which the gender combination was unknown was 13.8% (CI 13.6â14.1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Irrespective of the gender of the first author, clinical trials with female last authors had a higher statistical power compared to male last authors: 16.6% (CI 15.9â17.4) versus 12.9% (CI 12.6â13.3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The average statistical power of clinical trials with missing gender was comparable to those with known gender combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Slightly higher odds for adequately powered trials were also found in the author combination âboth malesâ and âfemale â male (last)â in comparison to the reference group âboth femalesâ: odds ratios 1.28 (CI 1.17â1.41, P&lt;0.0001) and 1.25 (CI 1.13â1.39, P&lt;0.0001), respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

This effect was robust as the effect was present across countries and most medical fields. Even though the average statistical power was generally low, the overall percentage of adequately powered trials slightly increased over the past four decades.</p><p>In line with recent literature, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">West et al., 2013</xref>) the absolute number of clinical trials published by female authors remained relatively low, even though it increased over time. The effects of equal representation of male and female scientists are not only important to better understand the success of collaborative efforts, but are also pressing in light of the persistent gender gap in medicine. Despite improvements, female scientists continue to face unequal pay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rimmer, 2017</xref>) and funding disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Shen, 2013</xref>), and to remain underrepresented in clinical medicine in terms of the clinical faculty positions and first author publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jagsi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Reed et al., 2011</xref>), even though gains in participation have been made over the last years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Filardo et al., 2016</xref>). Independent of gender, the overall percentage of adequately powered clinical trials was disappointingly low, notwithstanding the fact that the practice of conducting clinical trials with low statistical power has been denounced for a long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Halpern et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ioannidis, 2005</xref>). On a more positive note, the percentage of adequately powered trials did increase slightly over the past four decades. A possible reason for this increase may be the obligation to register clinical trials (i.e., on platforms like clinicaltrials.gov). This may have caused an increase in pre-registrations and research protocols with a higher quality and commitment to the original research plan and proposed sample size.</p><p>Our results support previous reports that gender differences exist and may influence the quality of clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nielsen et al., 2017</xref>). It may also be influenced by collaboration style patterns as differences exist between men and women in mixed-sex interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balliet et al., 2011</xref>). Firm evidence on the influence of collaborative styles is still lacking. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AraÃºjo et al., 2017</xref>) However, the impact of social behavior between clinical researchers on trial outcomes â particularly related to gender - is yet a rather unexplored area. It is important to note that not all studies have found convincing evidence for gender differences in science, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hyde, 2005</xref>) for example with regard to bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fanelli et al., 2017</xref>). From our results, it could be hypothesized that collaborations between male and female researchers are beneficial with respect to cross-fertilization, team productivity and research efficacy. However, our understanding ofÂ social and gender-related factors that underlie clinical trial quality is probably still limited, which is underlined by our finding that the statistical power of trials is relatively low when both first and last author are female.</p><p>Because our analyses are based on a comprehensive body of clinical trials published over a 40-year period, across medical fields, the results provide a representative picture of the relation between gender collaborations and statistical power. Nonetheless, there are several limitations. First, we only investigated one aspect of methodological rigor. Even though statistical power is an important sign of sound trial conduct, there are other domains, including pre-post registration mismatch and other sources of bias that determine methodological rigor. These parameters, however, are more difficult to quantify. Second, gender from the first and last author could not be determined for most included clinical trials (almost 70%, see flow diagram) as not all first name records were available. However, the statistical power of trials with missing gender data was not different from the clinical trials with known gender. Third, first and last authorships only provide a relative rough proxy for junior and senior positions. The actual hierarchical relations in a clinical trial may differ in a subset, for instance in some disciplinary fields authors are alphabetically positioned, or the persons in charge of the actual conduct of the clinical trial in daily practice are not last author on the resulting publication. Fourth, we only have included clinical trials and although these results can be extrapolated to other types of research, other research types and other academic disciplinary fields may have other unwritten rules how to determine the authorsâ positions on a paper. Fifth, we do not have the data of the gender of the authors between the first and last author which may influence collaboration patterns within and between research groups.</p><p>Even though adequate power in clinical trials is of vital importance, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ioannidis, 2014</xref>) future studies on gender collaborations should also take other methodological outcomes into account, such as the risk of bias and deviations from the pre-registered protocol. Also, to further determine how the gender of a researcher impacts on the scientific methodological quality, a more qualitative research design would be necessary to explore on a deeper level why methodological quality of clinical trials depends on the gender of researchers and clinicians. This would include interviews and observation studies of clinical trial teams with male and female leadership positions. Our findings demonstrate the importance of gender diversity in research collaborations and emphasize the need for more prominent positions for women at senior positions in medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nature, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MaterialsÂ andÂ methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Selection of clinical trials</title><p>The selection of trials for this analysis is shown in a flow chart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

We included only significant meta-analyses to exclude bias from interventions with no proven effects. In other words, if a confidence interval of a meta-analysis contains 0, the point estimate of the overall effect size is not reliable nor known and may not be used to estimate the individual power of studies included in that meta-analysis. Nevertheless, inclusion of non-significant meta-analyses did not impact on our findings (data not shown).</p><p>The power for an individual clinical trial was calculated based on the sample sizes in both trial arms, using a 5% Î± threshold using the meta-analytic estimate as approximation of the true effect size.

We considered the first author of clinical trial publication as a junior researcher and the last author as a senior. This assumption will most likely reflect the hierarchal relationship in the majority of the cases. The senior author having the last position in publications has long been practiced in medicine. Typically, the person conducting the practical research, analyzing the data, and drafting the first manuscript is often the first author, while the last author is the senior research responsible for the overall oversight.</p><p>For the gender of authors, first names were extracted for the first and the last author for all included clinical trials using the online interface PubReMiner (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hgserver2.amc.nl/cgi-bin/miner/miner2.cgi">http://hgserver2.amc.nl/cgi-bin/miner/miner2.cgi</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Slater, 2014</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Opposite sexes attract: male-female collaborations and the statistical power of 31,873 clinical trials&quot; to <italic>eLife</italic> for consideration as a Feature Article. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by myself as the <italic>eLife</italic> Features Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andreas Neef (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and I have drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study presented is an analysis of over 30,000 clinical trials to assess whether gender pairings of first and last authors are associated with sufficient statistical power. The study employs a large data set and uses the API Genderize to assign gender. The authors find that overall a relatively low number of studies had sufficient statistical power (12-13%). Similar to other studies looking at gender pairings, the authors find that most studies are comprised of male first-male last authors pairings. Over the forty years analyzed, the authors observed a gradual increase in the number of female first and last authors in clinical trials. When assessed for sufficient power, studies comprised of a first male author and female last author were significantly more prevalent compared to other gender pairings.</p><p>However, a number of concerns need to be addressed before the article can be accepted for publication. In particular, there is a need for more transparency with respect to data inclusion/exclusion, and the authors need to pay more careful attention to potential confounders and possible selection bias (see points 1-8 below). The Discussion section and the references cited also need extensive attention (points 9 and 10). The Title also needs to be revised (point 11)</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Confounders: I see three possible confounders that may bias the results of this study. Time, discipline-specific traditions and country variation. I will briefly touch upon each of these possible confounders below and suggest a suitable solution.</p><p>1) As mentioned by the authors, the underrepresentation of female authors in older trials may bias the results given the general increase in the percentage share of sufficiently powered trials over time. The authors account for this in Figure 1 (right panel) by dividing the results into periodical bins. But what about the possible variation within these ten-year periodical bins? A more refined approach could be to use publication year as a covariate in a binary logistic regression (I return to this).</p><p>2) Some medical disciplines may be more likely to conduct sufficiently powered trials than others, irrespective of author-gender composition. It is difficult infer whether this is the case from Figure 2. But four of the disciplines with the most pronounced higher statistical power for studies with female last authors (gynaecology, pregnancy and childbirth and tobacco and drugs and infectious diseases) also have generally good female author representation as presented in Figure 6. Consequently, the general difference detected in your study may possibly be explained by a higher general proportion of women authors in disciplines that are have relatively high general proportions of sufficiently powered studies. Or alternatively, the actual differences may possibly be larger than what you report, if the areas where women authors are well-represented are less likely to reach sufficient statistical power. Again, a more refined approach would be to do a binary logistic regression where you include covariates for the average proportion of female last authors and female authors per discipline.</p><p>3) Your study does not adjust for country-variations, which makes sense given your primary emphasis on descriptive statistics. My worry is that women's general representation as trial authors may be higher in countries that score relatively high with respect to proportion of sufficiently powered studies. If, for instance, North America (Canada and US) and Northern Europe have good numbers of women trial authors, while also being &quot;top-performers&quot; with respect to sufficiently powered studies, this may bias your results. Here you could also calculate a covariate adjusting for women's proportional participation as authors in a given geographic region (North America, North-Western Europe, South-East-Asia, Oceania etc.) and use this in a binary log reg.</p><p>To briefly summarize I suggest that you adjust for these possible confounders in a binary logistic regression with the outcome variable: 0=insufficiently powered 1= sufficiently powered. The regression could include your author-composition categories + the following covariates: publication year, proportion of women authors in the discipline, proportion of women last authors in the discipline, proportion of women authors in the geographical region where the trial took place, and proportion of women last authors in the geographical region where the trial took place.</p><p>4) Possible selection bias: In subsection âStatistical power of individual clinical trialsâ it is mentioned that you only included significant meta-analyses to exclude bias from interventions with no proven effects? I miss some sort of justification for this choice? Why would interventions with no proven effect bias your results? It would also be useful to know whether the gender composition of authors contributing to studies with no effects is similar to that of the analysed sample. Is female authors' representation higher in the sample with no proven effects relative to the sample used in the analysis?</p><p>5) Transparency with respect to data inclusion and exclusion: It would be helpful to have some sort of flow-diagram specifying the data exclusion steps. (1) How many trials did you start out with? (2) were you able to extract the necessary data from all eligible clinical trials identified in Cochrane? (3) How many studies were excluded due to statistical insignificance? (4) How many studies were excluded due to missing gender specification?</p><p>6) It would aid interpretation if the breakdown of numbers (studies excluded, numbers per category of pairing, those with sufficient statistical powerâ¦.) were provided in a Table or in a Figure (similar to how presented in Figure 7).</p><p>7) Please also ensure that the following information is available in the manuscript:</p><p>- information on the definition of confidence intervals (was bootstrap used?)</p><p>- information on the statistical test applied. chi^{2}-test is mentioned, to me it is unclear if multiple comparison correction was used and why the continuity correction has to be used when actually _numbers_ of studies are tested. Also unclear is whether the bimodal distribution of statistical power in studies (see Button et al., 2013) would still have us expect a normal distribution (or hypergeometric) of the number of cases in each class. Even more concerning is the potential internal structure in the dataset: how many different seniors carry the effect? etc.</p><p>So to address all this within one analysis: Why not use randomized gender label swapping?</p><p>8) A more elaborate description of the gender disambiguation would also strengthen the study. In subsection âGender extractionâ you mention that &quot;gender probabilities were dichotomized to obtain binary male/female labels&quot;. I presume this means that your gender algorithm provides numerical name-to-gender accuracy estimations? (please describe in more detail how the algorithm works). If yes, what threshold did you use? It would also strengthen the study if you could manually check a sub-sample of authors to verify the accuracy of the algorithm with the chosen threshold.</p><p>9) A number of reference (e.g., Helmer et al., 2017; Wuchty, Jones and Uzzi, 2007; Jones, Wuchty and Uzzi, 2008; Woolley et al., 2010 and Rhoten and Pfirman, 2007) are quoted out of context. Woolley et al., 2010 does not focus on research teams: rather, it finds that the collective intelligence of teams increase with women's representation, not with gender diversity. Rhoten and Pfirman, 2007 finds that women (not gender diverse teams) are more likely to do interdisciplinary research.</p><p>10) The Discussion section needs to be completely rewritten to focus on:i) how the results in the present manuscript relate to the existing literature (including possible explanations for the results).ii) the shortcomings and caveats associated with the present approach (e.g., just one type of article, just one area of science, just the first and last authors); and only first/last author). iii) open questions for future research.</p><p>As mentioned above, please ensure that any papers cited are directly relevant to the subject being discussed.</p><p>11) The Title needs to be revised to better reflect the content of the article.

A key characteristic of a clinical trial is its statistical power. Here we investigate whether the statistical power of a trial is related to the gender of first and last authors on the paper reporting the results of the trial. Based on an analysis of 31,873 clinical trials published between 1974 and 2017, we find that adequate statistical power was most often present in clinical trials with a male first author and a female last author (20.6%, 95% confidence interval 19.4-21.8%), and that the difference between this figure and the figure for other gender combinations was significant (12.5-13.5%; P &lt; 0.0001). The absolute number of female authors in clinical trials also increased gradually over time, with the percentage of female last authors rising from 20.7% (1975-85) to 28.5% (after 2005). Our results demonstrate the importance of gender diversity in research collaborations and emphasize the need to increase the number of women in senior positions in medicine.â</p><p>Introduction section</p><p>âClinical trials are complex projects that often involve collaborations between researchers who have different areas of expertise and different levels of seniority. The statistical power of a clinical trial reflects the chance of detecting a true effect, so adequate statistical power is regarded as one of the key elements of responsible research [8] and is considered essential in reproducible clinical research [9]. However, there is an increasing awareness that many clinical trials have systematic methodological flaws, including a lack of adequate statistical power, and that their results may be biased, exaggerated, and difficult to reproduce [1].</p><p>Male and female researchers differ in their collaborative strategies in ways that depend on their levels of expertise and whether they have a junior or senior position [4,5]. There are also indications that mixed gender research groups may make the best use of personal knowledge and skills [6,7], but possible relationships between the gender balance of collaborations and the quality of clinical trials â as measured by their statistical power â have not been investigated. In this study, we examined 31,873 clinical trials published between 1974 and 2017 to see if there was any relation between the gender of the first and last authors and statistical power. We found that the probability of having adequate statistical power for one combination â male first author, female last author â was significantly higher than that for the other three possible combinations. Moreover, this effect was present across countries and most medical fields.â</p><p>Please feel free to revise the Abstract and Introduction section further, but please try to avoid undue overlap between the two.

The study employs a large data set and uses the API Genderize to assign gender. The authors find that overall a relatively low number of studies had sufficient statistical power (12-13%). Similar to other studies looking at gender pairings, the authors find that most studies are comprised of male first-male last authors pairings. Over the forty years analyzed, the authors observed a gradual increase in the number of female first and last authors in clinical trials. When assessed for sufficient power, studies comprised of a first male author and female last author were significantly more prevalent compared to other gender pairings.</p><p>However, a number of concerns need to be addressed before the article can be accepted for publication. In particular, there is a need for more transparency with respect to data inclusion/exclusion, and the authors need to pay more careful attention to potential confounders and possible selection bias (see points 1-8 below). The Discussion section and the references cited also need extensive attention (points 9 and 10). The Title also needs to be revised (point 11).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editor and all reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback.

The area-under-the ROC curve â a general measure of predictiveness â for the genderize.io software is 0.927. The predicted power is thus excellent. Another study which validated the high validity of generize.io gender prediction is the work by Fell and KÃ¶nig, (2016). Yet another study, by Topaz et al., on gender predictions in mathematical sciences, report an accuracy of 97.5% of generize.io (Topaz and Sen, (2016)) The generize.io software provides a probability for a first name being male or female (summing to 1.0).
