transmitted bacterial symbionts that are ubiquitous among arthropods. They can hijack host reproduction in various ways, including male-killing (MK), where the sons of infected mothers are killed during development. The recent discovery of MK-associated <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genes, i.e., <italic>oscar</italic> in <italic>Ostrinia</italic> moths and <italic>wmk</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies, stimulates our interest in the diversity and commonality of MK mechanisms, which remain largely unclear. We recently discovered that a <italic>Wolbachia</italic> symbiont of the moth <italic>Homona magnanima</italic> carries an MK-associated prophage region encoding homologs of <italic>oscar</italic> (<italic>Hm-oscar</italic>) and <italic>wmk</italic> (<italic>wmk-</italic>1–4). Here, we investigated the effects of these genes in the native host. Upon transient overexpression, <italic>Hm-oscar</italic>, but not <italic>wmk</italic>, induced male lethality in <italic>H. magnanima</italic>, in contrast to our observations in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where the <italic>wmk</italic> homologs, but not <italic>Hm-oscar</italic>, killed the males. <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> disrupted sex determination in male embryos by inducing a female-type <italic>doublesex</italic> splicing and impaired dosage compensation, recapitulating the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> phenotype. Cell-based transfection assays confirmed that <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> suppressed the function of <italic>masculinizer</italic>, the primary male sex determinant involved in lepidopteran dosage compensation. Our study highlights the conserved roles of <italic>oscar</italic> homologs in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced lepidopteran MK and argues that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> have evolved multiple MK mechanisms in insects.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacteria, viruses and other microbes are often thought of as external threats – but some also live inside animals, where they can be passed from mother to offspring. These types of microbes are commonly carried by insects and have various strategies for manipulating reproduction so they can spread through a population more easily.</p><p>One striking example is male killing, in which microbes selectively kill the male offspring of infected mothers during development. This results in a predominately female population, which can continue transmitting the microbe to future generations. Here, Arai et al. investigate whether <italic>Wolbachia –</italic> a group of bacteria that infect more than half of all insect species – employ a universal male-killing strategy, or whether they have evolved different mechanisms tailored to specific hosts.</p><p>The team focused on a region of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genome that encodes multiple candidate genes involved in male killing. First, Arai et al. explored whether a <italic>Wolbachia</italic> gene called <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> is responsible for male killing in the moth <italic>Homona magnanima</italic>. They found that over activating <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> in embryos not infected with <italic>Wolbachia</italic> increased male mortality, reproducing the effects of male killing, leading to a female-biased sex ratio. Further experiments confirmed that <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> exerts this effect by inhibiting <italic>masculinizer</italic>, a key gene necessary for male development.</p><p>Next, Arai et al. tested another gene called <italic>wmk,</italic> which <italic>Wolbachia</italic> use to kill the male offspring of fruit flies. However, manipulating this gene in <italic>H. magnanima</italic> had no impact on male survival, suggesting that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> use different male-killing genes in different insect species.</p><p>Understanding how <italic>Wolbachia</italic> affect insect reproduction sheds light on how bacteria interact with different host species. This knowledge also has practical applications. For instance, male-killing strategies could be leveraged for pest control to reduce populations of harmful insects without using pesticides. Future research may uncover additional <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genes involved in reproductive manipulation and explore their potential use in managing insect populations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>symbiosis</kwd><kwd>Wolbachia</kwd><kwd>wmk</kwd><kwd>microinjection</kwd><kwd>Oscar</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19J13123</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arai</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21J00895</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arai</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22K14902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arai</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23H02229</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kageyama</surname><given-names>Daisuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24H02293</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kageyama</surname><given-names>Daisuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22H00366</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katsuma</surname><given-names>Susumu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>24H02289</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katsuma</surname><given-names>Susumu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21KK0105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arai</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name><name><surname>Inoue</surname><given-names>Maki N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Oscar homologs play a conserved role in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced male-killing in Lepidoptera but not in other insects, highlighting the evolution of diverse male-killing mechanisms induced by <italic>Wolbachia</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Arthropods commonly carry microbial symbionts that are passed from mother to offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hurst and Frost, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Werren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hurst, 2017</xref>). The maternally transmitted bacteria, belonging to the genus <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (Alphaproteobacteria), are estimated to be present in at least 40% of all insect species, making them one of the most widespread endosymbiont genera on the planet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Werren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zug and Hammerstein, 2012</xref>). <italic>Wolbachia</italic> have achieved evolutionary success by manipulating host reproduction through various means that enhance endosymbiont transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Werren et al., 2008</xref>). Such manipulation of the host’s reproduction includes cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), parthenogenesis, feminization, and MK, each of which affects the biological features, distribution, and evolution of the host. Among these strategies, MK directly skews the sex ratio of the host population toward females by killing male offspring of infected mothers during development. The lack of symbiont transmission through male hosts often leads to the evolution of MK. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> have been shown to induce MK in a wide range of insect taxa (e.g. dipterans, lepidopterans, and coleopterans) and other arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hurst et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kageyama and Traut, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hurst et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, various bacteria, viruses, and microsporidia induce MK phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kageyama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujita et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kageyama et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nagamine et al., 2023</xref>), and recent studies have postulated that these microbes have evolved their MK ability independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harumoto and Lemaitre, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kageyama et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nagamine et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arai et al., 2023b</xref>).</p><p>The evolution and molecular mechanisms underlying <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced MK, observed across diverse insect taxa, have attracted considerable attention for decades. MK mechanisms are hypothesized to be linked to sex determination cascades regulating male and female differentiation in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hornett et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, some MK-inducing <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains disrupt the sex-determination system in host moths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sugimoto and Ishikawa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sugimoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fukui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arai et al., 2023b</xref>). Lepidopteran insects (moths and butterflies) generally have a female heterogametic sex chromosome system (e.g. WZ in females, ZZ in males) and employ dosage compensation, which equalizes the Z-chromosome-linked gene dose between sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kiuchi et al., 2014</xref>). Dosage compensation is regulated by the <italic>masculinizer</italic> gene (<italic>masc</italic>), which is critical for male development. The lepidopteran sex determination system consists of multiple transcriptional regulators, some of which exhibit sex-linked expression and/or splicing isoforms. The primary male sex determinant, <italic>masc,</italic> also regulates the downstream master sex determination gene, <italic>doublesex</italic> (<italic>dsx</italic>), which exhibits sex-dependent splicing isoforms (<italic>dsxF</italic> in females and <italic>dsxM</italic> in males) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kiuchi et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>Ostrinia</italic> and <italic>Homona</italic> male moths, MK-inducing <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains impair dosage compensation by disrupting the expression of <italic>masc</italic>. Furthermore, they disrupt sex determination in male moths by inducing the ‘female’ isoform of <italic>dsx</italic> (<italic>dsxF</italic>), leading to a ‘mismatch’ between genetic sex (male: ZZ sex chromosome constitution) and phenotypic sex (female: based on <italic>dsxF</italic>), ultimately resulting in male death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arai et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fukui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sugimoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sugimoto and Ishikawa, 2012</xref>).</p><p>More recently, a <italic>Wolbachia</italic> protein named Oscar (<underline>Os</underline>ugoroshi protein containing <underline>C</underline>ifB C-terminus-like domain and many <underline>A</underline>nkyrin <underline>R</underline>epeats; Osugoroshi translates to male-killing in Japanese) was shown to recapitulate the <italic>Wolbachia w</italic>Fur-induced MK phenotype in the native host moth <italic>Ostrinia furnacalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katsuma et al., 2022</xref>). The Oscar protein interacts with and degrades Masc protein, leading to the failure of dosage compensation and the production of female-type <italic>dsx</italic> isoforms in <italic>Ostrinia</italic> male moths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fukui et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katsuma et al., 2022</xref>). Although <italic>oscar</italic> homologs are common in MK <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains from Lepidoptera, MK strains from Diptera (<italic>Drosophila</italic>) and from several lepidopteran hosts lacked the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arai et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arai et al., 2024a</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>oscar</italic> homologs are evolutionarily dynamic, with highly variable sequences and structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arai et al., 2024a</xref>), making it difficult to assess their functional relevance. In addition to <italic>oscar</italic>, the helix-turn-helix domain-containing putative transcriptional regulator <italic>wmk</italic> is widely conserved among <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains and induces various toxicities in <italic>Drosophila</italic> flies, ranging from no effect, weak male lethality (30% mortality), strong male lethality (90–100% mortality), or complete lethality of both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Perlmutter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Perlmutter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Perlmutter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arai et al., 2023a</xref>). Although the mechanisms underlying the <italic>wmk</italic>-induced toxicities and their connection to sex determination systems remain unclear, these findings suggest that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains carry multiple factors that cause male lethality. However, the diversity and commonality of these functions in insects remain largely unknown, partly due to the technical challenges in validating gene functions in non-model insects.</p><p>We recently discovered a prophage region responsible for a <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced MK by comparing closely related non-MK <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (<italic>w</italic>Hm-c) and MK <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (<italic>w</italic>Hm-t) in the tea tortrix moth <italic>Homona magnanima</italic> (Tortricidae) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arai et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arai et al., 2024b</xref>). The MK-associated prophage element encodes potential MK causative genes–four <italic>wmk</italic> homologs (<italic>wmk</italic>-1 to <italic>wmk</italic>-4) as well as an <italic>oscar</italic> homolog (<italic>Hm-oscar</italic>, encoding 1181 aa protein), which differs significantly in sequence length and structure from the <italic>w</italic>Fur-encoded <italic>oscar</italic> (encoding 1830 aa protein) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). When these MK candidate genes are transgenically overexpressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>wmk-1</italic> and <italic>wmk</italic>-3 have a lethality of almost 100%, while <italic>wmk-2</italic>, <italic>wmk-4</italic>, and <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> induce no lethal effects when singly overexpressed.

Although the full mechanisms remain unclear, unbalanced Z-linked gene expression mediated by improper dosage compensation—resulting in Z-linked gene expression levels twice as high as those in normal males—appear to be lethal for lepidopteran males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kiuchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fukui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Visser et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-encoded <italic>oscar</italic> homologs identified so far show diversity in sequence length and are classified as type I, II, and III based on their amino acid sequence homologies. Type I and II Oscar proteins, derived from MK-inducing <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, contain many ankyrin repeats and a proteinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arai et al., 2024a</xref>). Although long ankyrin repeat sequences are postulated to be critical for the function of <italic>w</italic>Fur-encoded Oscar protein (1830 aa, type I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katsuma et al., 2022</xref>), our study revealed that the functions of Hm-Oscar protein (1181 aa, type II), which encodes fewer ankyrin repeats, were comparable with those of Oscar protein carried by <italic>w</italic>Fur. Interestingly, type II <italic>oscar</italic> gene is also present in the feminizing <italic>Wolbachia w</italic>Fem in <italic>Eurema</italic> butterflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arai et al., 2024a</xref>). <italic>oscar</italic> homologs, which inhibit the masculinizing function and induce female sex determination, may have a conserved function in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced MK and feminization in Lepidoptera.</p><p>In contrast to the results of this study, we have previously demonstrated that the phage-encoded <italic>wmk</italic>, but not <italic>Hm-oscar</italic>, induces male lethality in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arai et al., 2023b</xref>). Although the means of expression are different (i.e. transient in <italic>Homona</italic> and transgenic in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), this finding highlighted the differences in the mode/range of action of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genes between insect species. It has been hypothesized that microbes induce MK in insects by targeting molecular mechanisms involved in sex determination and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hornett et al., 2022</xref>). Sex determination systems in insects are diverse; for example, Lepidoptera (including <italic>H. magnanima</italic>) and Diptera (including <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>) do not share any known sex-determining genes other than <italic>dsx</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Suzuki, 2018</xref>). The different outcomes in <italic>Homona</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> are probably due to their different sex determination systems. Because <italic>oscar</italic> interacts with and suppresses <italic>masc</italic>, <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> could induce mortality in <italic>Homona</italic> males that possess <italic>masc</italic>, but not in <italic>Drosophila</italic> males that lack it. Considering that <italic>oscar</italic> homologs are not present in known MK <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains in dipteran insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arai et al., 2024c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katsuma et al., 2022</xref>), the mechanisms (i.e. causative genes) of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced MK probably differ between insect taxa (e.g. between Lepidoptera and Diptera). While the mechanisms underlying <italic>wmk</italic>-induced lethality remain unclear, the distinct effects associated with this gene between <italic>Homona</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> may also reflect their genetic backgrounds, such as the presence or absence of host factor(s) that interact with <italic>wmk</italic>. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katsuma et al., 2022</xref> reported that the <italic>wmk</italic> homologs encoded by <italic>w</italic>Fur did not affect the masculinizing function of <italic>masc</italic> in vitro, indicating that <italic>wmk</italic> likely targets factors other than <italic>masc</italic>. Whilst we cannot rule out the possibility that <italic>wmk</italic> may work synergistically or interactively with <italic>oscar</italic> in vivo—potentially acting downstream of <italic>oscar</italic>’s impact—our results strongly suggested that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains have acquired multiple MK genes through evolution.</p><p><italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced phenotypes are known to be influenced by the genetic backgrounds of hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hornett et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sasaki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Veneti et al., 2012</xref>). Our study showed that the <italic>w</italic>Hm-t-encoded <italic>Hm-oscar</italic> suppresses the function of <italic>masc</italic> in <italic>H. magnanima</italic> more efficiently than the <italic>w</italic>Fur-encoded <italic>oscar</italic>, suggesting that this <italic>Wolbachia</italic> factor has undergone evolutionary tuning to adapt to its natural host. However, the mere presence of <italic>oscar</italic> and <italic>wmk</italic> homologs does not ensure MK expression. For example, <italic>w</italic>CauA, bearing type I <italic>oscar</italic>, did not induce MK in <italic>Ephestia</italic> (<italic>Cadra</italic>) <italic>cautella</italic> collected around 2000, although it did induce MK when transferred to the closely related host <italic>Ephestia kuehniella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sasaki et al., 2002</xref>). An MK phenotype, presumably induced by <italic>w</italic>CauA, was also recorded in <italic>E. cautella</italic> around the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Takahashi and Kuwahara, 1970</xref>). These findings suggest a suppressor evolution against <italic>w</italic>CauA-induced MK in <italic>E. cautella</italic>. In addition, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> typically encode a number of <italic>wmk</italic> homologs in their genomes, but their effects differ among insects and are not apparent in some species such as <italic>Homona,</italic> possibly due to the diversity in sex determination system or the evolution of suppressors. Nonetheless, given the high copy number of <italic>wmk</italic> homologs in <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genomes, they may still contribute to <italic>Wolbachia</italic> biology as transcriptional regulators and potential virulence factors. Virulence genes often undergo duplication and substitution under strong selective pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hill et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>). An intense evolutionary arms race between <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and their hosts could have increased and diversified the MK-associated <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genes. Conversely, natural selection favors the rescue of males by suppressing the <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced reproductive manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hornett et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hornett et al., 2014</xref>), which may involve changes in the sex determination system because <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains frequently hijack host reproduction systems. In this context, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and other MK-inducing microbes may be a hidden driver for the diversification of complex insect sex determination systems.</p><p>In this study, we clarified the conserved roles of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-encoded <italic>oscar</italic> homologs in Lepidoptera and demonstrated that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> have evolved distinct MK mechanisms (through causative genes) in insect taxa. The diversification of phenotype/virulence-associated genes and the rampant horizontal transmission of phages carrying virulence genes between <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains may have contributed to the outstanding success of this bacterial genus. In addition to <italic>oscar</italic> and <italic>wmk, Wolbachia</italic> may retain other uncharacterized genes that induce male lethality, and further studies on diverse <italic>Wolbachia</italic>–host systems are highly warranted. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary relationships between endosymbionts and their hosts, which may also contribute to the design of pest management strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title><italic>Homona magnanima</italic></title><p>A laboratory-maintained <italic>H. magnanima</italic> line with a normal sex ratio (NSR) that was negative for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and other endosymbionts, was used in our experiments.

A number of these microbes have independently evolved the ability to kill the sons of infected females very early in their development; this male killing strategy has evolved because males are transmission dead-ends for the microbe. A major question in the field has been to identify the genes that cause male killing and to understand how they work. This has been especially challenging because most male-killing microbes cannot be genetically manipulated. This study focuses on a male-killing bacterium called <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Different <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains kill male embryos in beetles, flies, moths, and other arthropods. This is remarkable because how sex is determined differs widely in these hosts. Two <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genes have been previously implicated in male-killing by <italic>Wolbachia</italic>: oscar (in moth male-killing) and wmk (in fly male-killing). The genomes of some male-killing <italic>Wolbachia</italic> contain both of these genes, so it is a challenge to disentangle the two.</p><p>This paper provides strong evidence that oscar is responsible for male-killing in moths. Here, the authors study a strain of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> that kills males in a pest of tea, Homona magnanima. Overexpressing oscar, but not wmk, kills male moth embryos. This is because oscar interferes with masculinizer, the master gene that controls sex determination in moths and butterflies. Interfering with the masculinizer gene in this way leads the (male) embryo down a path of female development, which causes problems in regulating the expression of genes that are found on the sex chromosomes.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors use a broad number of approaches to implicate oscar, and to dissect its mechanism of male lethality. These approaches include: (a) overexpressing oscar (and wmk) by injecting RNA into moth eggs, (b) determining the sex of embryos by staining female sex chromosomes, (c) determining the consequences of oscar expression by assaying sex-specific splice variants of doublesex, a key sex determination gene, and by quantifying gene expression and dosage of sex chromosomes, using RNASeq, and (d) expressing oscar along with masculinizer from various moth and butterfly species, in a silkmoth cell line. This extends recently published studies implicating oscar in male-killing by <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in Ostrinia corn borer moths, although the Homona and Ostrinia oscar proteins are quite divergent.

The authors aim to determine how five previously identified male-killing genes (encoded in the prophage region of the wHm <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain) impact the native host, Homona magnanima moths. This work builds on the authors' previous studies in which</p><p>(1) they tested the impact of these same wHm genes via heterologous expression in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic></p><p>(2) also examined the activity of other male-killing genes (e.g., from the wFur <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain in its native host: Ostrinia furnacalis moths).</p><p>Advances here include identifying which wHm gene most strongly recapitulates the male-killing phenotype in the native host (rather than in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), and the finding that the Hm-Oscar protein has the potential for male-killing in a diverse set of lepidopterans, as inferred by the cell-culture assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank you for evaluating our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>Strengths of the manuscript include the reverse genetics approaches to dissect the impact of specific male-killing loci, and use of a &quot;masculinization&quot; assay in Lepidopteran cell lines to determine the impact of interactions between specific masc and oscar homologs.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank you for evaluating our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>It is clear from Figure 1 that the combinations of wmk homologs do not cause male killing on their own here. While I largely agree with the author's conclusions that oscar is the primary MK factor in this system, I don't think we can yet rule out that wmk(s) may work synergistically or interactively with oscar in vivo. This might be worth a small note in the discussion. (eg at line 294 'indicating that wmk likely targets factors other than masc.&quot; - this could be downstream of the impacts of oscar; perhaps dependent on oscar-mediated impacts on masc first).</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate your suggestion. Whilst wmk genes themselves did not exhibit apparent lethal effects on the native host, as you noted, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that wmk may be involved in male-killing actions, either directly or indirectly assisting the function of Hb-oscar. Following your suggestion, we have added a brief note in the discussion section regarding the interpretation of wmk functions.</p><p>“In addition, Katsuma et al. (2022) reported that the wmk homologs encoded by wFur did not affect the masculinizing function of masc in vitro, indicating that wmk likely targets factors other than masc. Whilst we cannot rule out the possibility that wmk may work synergistically or interactively with oscar in vivo—potentially acting downstream of oscar’s impact—our results strongly suggested that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains have acquired multiple MK genes through evolution.” (lines 287-292)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the perceived male-bias in Figure 2a: I think readers might be interpreting &quot;unhatched&quot; as &quot;total before hatching&quot;. You could eliminate ambiguity by perhaps splitting the bars into male and female, and then within a bar, coloring by hatched versus unhatched. But this is a minor point, and I think the updated text helps clarify this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have accordingly revised the figure 2a. In addition, we have included more detailed information in the first sentence of the section Males are killed mainly at the embryonic stage.</p><p>“The sex of hatched larvae (neonates) and the remaining unhatched embryos was determined by the presence or absence of W chromatin, a condensed structure of the female-specific W chromosome observed during interphase.” (lines 171-173)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The new Figure 4b looks to be largely redundant with the oscar information in Figure 1a.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have removed Figure 4b due to its overlap with Figure 1a and have incorporated relevant figure legends into the Figure 1a legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Updated statistical comparisons for the RNA-seq analysis are helpful. However these analyses are based on single libraries (albeit each a pool of many individuals), so this is still a weaker aspect of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. As you noted, the use of single libraries (due to the limited number of available individuals, though each includes approximately 50 males and females) may be a potential limitation of this study. However, as demonstrated in the qPCR assay for the Z-linked gene provided in the previous revision, we believe that our data and conclusion—that <italic>Wolbachia</italic>/ Hb-oscar disrupts dosage compensation by causing the overexpression of Z-linked genes—are well-supported and robust.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The new information on masc similarity is useful (Fig 4d) - if the authors could please include a heatmap legend for the colors, that would be helpful.
