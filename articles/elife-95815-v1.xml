However, the precise molecular mechanisms through which signaling pathways regulate key transcription factors controlling erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis remain partially understood. Herein, we identified heat shock cognate B (HSCB), which is well known for its iron–sulfur cluster delivery function, as an indispensable protein for friend of GATA 1 (FOG1) nuclear translocation during erythropoiesis of K562 human erythroleukemia cells and cord-blood-derived human CD34+CD90+hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), as well as during megakaryopoiesis of the CD34+CD90+HSCs. Mechanistically, HSCB could be phosphorylated by phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) to bind with and mediate the proteasomal degradation of transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 3 (TACC3), which otherwise detained FOG1 in the cytoplasm, thereby facilitating FOG1 nuclear translocation. Given that PI3K is activated during both erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis, and that FOG1 is a key transcription factor for these processes, our findings elucidate an important, previously unrecognized iron–sulfur cluster delivery independent function of HSCB in erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HSCB</kwd><kwd>FOG1 nuclear translocation</kwd><kwd>PI3K</kwd><kwd>erythropoiesis</kwd><kwd>megakaryopoiesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013061</institution-id><institution>Jilin Provincial Scientific and Technological Development Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20220508072RC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Gang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012898</institution-id><institution>Northeast Normal University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Gang</given-names></name><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Xiumei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>135113022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Gang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>135113009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Xiumei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>HSCB could be activated by PI3K signaling to facilitate FOG1 nuclear translocation to promote human erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis, highlighting an important, previously unrecognized iron–sulfur cluster delivery independent function of HSCB.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis, respectively, refer to the processes through which hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) differentiate into mature red blood cells (RBCs) and megakaryocytes/platelets. Given the physiological significance of RBCs, megakaryocytes, and platelets, it is not surprising that erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis are tightly regulated by a myriad of molecular mechanisms. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a fundamental cytokine promoting erythropoiesis via binding with erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuhrt and Wojchowski, 2015</xref>). Converging evidence indicates that the EPO/EPOR signaling is crucial for the proliferation and survival of colony-forming unit erythroid cells (CFU-Es) in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nandakumar et al., 2016</xref>). Although the EPO/EPOR signaling was dispensable for in vivo production of early committed erythroid progenitors, <italic>Epo</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>EpoR</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited embryonic death due to deficient definitive erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 1995</xref>). These studies highlight the indispensability of EPO/EPOR signaling during erythropoiesis. Thrombopoietin (TPO) and its receptor myeloproliferative leukemia protein (MPL) constitute the primary regulator of megakaryopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hitchcock et al., 2021</xref>). Studies indicated that TPO alone could induce the production of megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-MKs), while addition of other cytokines including stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin 3 (IL3), and IL11 markedly increased the size, but not the number, of these colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaushansky et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaushansky et al., 1994</xref>). The biological significance of TPO/MPL signaling pathway was also evidenced by the development of thrombocytopenia in Mpl-deficient mice as well as in human subjects carrying <italic>MPL</italic> and <italic>THPO</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gurney et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Noris and Pecci, 2017</xref>). Both EPOR and MPL belong to the type-I family of cytokine receptors. They do not possess kinase activity per se, but can transphosphorylate Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (JAK2), which in turn activates several downstream signaling cascades, including the JAK2/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and rat sarcoma (RAS)/RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eggold and Rankin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hitchcock et al., 2021</xref>), all of which contribute more or less to both erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis.</p><p>The essence of differentiation is the generation of cells with specific functions, which is realized by the differentiation stage-dependent transcriptional activation and suppression of innumerable genes. This is why there is a generally accepted notion that transcription factors (TFs) are the main drivers of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lambert et al., 2018</xref>). Each of the differentiation processes of erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis is controlled by a combination of key TFs, including GATA1, friend of GATA1 (FOG1), KLF1, TAL1, MEIS1, etc., for the erythroid lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doré and Crispino, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kwon et al., 2021</xref>), and GATA1, FOG1, TAL1, MEIS1, FLI1, etc., for the megakaryocytic lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doré and Crispino, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kwon et al., 2021</xref>). Since cell signaling is the dominant way by which erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitors (or their common progenitors) sense differentiation signals, it is crucial to understand how these key erythroid and megakaryocytic TFs are regulated by signaling pathways, especially those downstream of EPO/EPOR and TPO/MPL signaling. However, to date, research on this topic remains scarce. A study deepened our understanding about this issue by demonstrating that the PI3K–AKT pathway can phosphorylate GATA1 at serine 310 in erythroid cells, thereby augmenting its transcription activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>). However, given that the proper functioning of GATA1 in regulating target gene expression relies on its binding with a specific cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gutiérrez et al., 2020</xref>), how EPO/EPOR and TPO/MPL signaling pathways regulate the activity of GATA1-binding partners, such as FOG1, warrants further investigation.</p><p>Heat shock cognate B (HSCB or HSC20) is widely known for its function during the delivery of nascent iron–sulfur clusters (ISCs) to recipient proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maio et al., 2014</xref>). The biogenesis of ISCs starts with the assembly of nascent ISCs on a multi-protein complex composed of iron–sulfur cluster assembly enzyme (ISCU), nitrogen fixation 1 homolog (NFS1), LYR motif containing 4 (LYRM4 or ISD11), and acyl carrier protein (ACP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maio et al., 2020</xref>). After the ISCs are synthesized, ISCU binds with an ISC delivery chaperone/cochaperone complex comprising HSCB and HSPA9 to transfer the nascent ISCs to target Fe–S proteins or secondary ISC carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maio et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crispin et al., 2020</xref> described a female patient who suffered from congenital sideroblastic anemia (CSA) due to heterozygous variations that resulted in decreased expression of HSCB. In addition to the anemic phenotype, the proband also developed moderate thrombocytopenia and mild neutropenia. Consistent with the proband’s clinical presentations, <italic>Hscb<sup>fl/−</sup></italic> mice with a <italic>Vav1-Cre</italic> transgene also exhibited reduced RBC and platelet counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crispin et al., 2020</xref>). Based on these findings, we speculated that HSCB may be implicated with hematopoiesis, especially erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. To test this hypothesis, herein we explored the function of HSCB during erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Our findings indicated that HSCB can be phosphorylated by PI3K to promote FOG1 nuclear translocation during human erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. This study describes a previously unrecognized iron–sulfur cluster delivery independent function of HSCB, thereby providing new insights into human erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HSCB exerted an ISC delivery independent function during erythropoiesis of HSCs</title><p>First, we investigated if HSCB is implicated in erythropoiesis by inhibiting its expression in CD34+CD90+HSCs via a mixture of shRNAs. We also knocked down the expression of human <italic>ISCU</italic> and <italic>NFS1</italic> genes in these cells to determine the impact of ISC biogenesis deficiency on erythropoiesis. The high-purity CD34+CD90+HSC population was first obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and divided into five groups of Control, shNC, shHSCB, shISCU, and shNFS1. HSCs in the Control group were untransfected, whereas those in the other four groups were transfected with the corresponding shRNA plasmids. The HSCs in these groups were induced for erythropoiesis for 17 days to yield erythrocytes at day 17 of differentiation (Ery 17 days) and collected for analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> demonstrates the efficiency of shRNA knockdown maintained throughout the experimental period. The activities of aconitase and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which depend on intact ISC biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cameron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castro et al., 2019</xref>), decreased significantly in the shHSCB, shISCU, and shNFS1 groups compared with the shNC group (all p values were less than 0.05 or 0.01 in Student’s <italic>t</italic> test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>), demonstrating that ISC biogenesis was strongly inhibited in these groups. Since heme biosynthesis is regulated by ISC biogenesis at several nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), we further explored whether heme biosynthesis was also inhibited in the shHSCB, shISCU, and shNFS1 groups. Indeed, these three groups exhibited significantly lower heme contents (all p values were less than 0.05 or 0.01 in Student’s <italic>t</italic> test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and paler cell pellets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) than the shNC group. Surprisingly, among the groups subjected to shRNA plasmids transfection, only the shHSCB group displayed significantly inhibited erythropoiesis, as evidenced by the reduced proportion of CD71+CD235a+progenitors (p &lt; 0.001, Student’s <italic>t</italic> test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>) and the decreased mRNA expression levels of erythroid marker genes <italic>HBB</italic>, <italic>ALAS2</italic>, and <italic>GYPC</italic> (all p values were less than 0.01 or 0.001 in Student’s <italic>t</italic> test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We then purified the CD71−CD235a− subpopulation from the shHSCB group of Ery 17 days via cell sorting and characterized the differential status of these cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, the majority of CD71−CD235a− cells from the shHSCB group were CD34+CD38+CD45RA−IL3RA−, exhibiting a surface marker expression pattern (CD34+CD38+CD45RA−IL3RA−CD71−CD235a−) resembling that observed on CD34+CD90+HSCs induced for erythropoiesis for 2 days (E 2-day HSCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref> and Figure 5C). These findings revealed that HSCB knockdown detained the erythropoiesis of HSCs at an early stage and that HSCB might be involved in key events regulating early erythropoiesis at this specific stage. Therefore, E 2-day HSCs were characterized in following experiments to explore the molecular mechanisms through which HSCB deficiency impeded HSCs erythropoiesis. Altogether, these data indicated that HSCB knockdown impaired both heme biosynthesis and erythropoiesis in erythroid progenitors, while knockdown of ISC assembly proteins markedly reduced heme production but did not significantly affect erythropoiesis, suggesting an ISC delivery independent function of HSCB during early erythropoiesis of CD34+CD90+HSCs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Heat shock cognate B (HSCB) played an important iron–sulfur cluster (ISC) delivery independent function during erythropoiesis of CD34+CD90+hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blotting analyses on Ery 17 days verified the efficacy of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown maintained throughout the experimental period.

We overexpressed human FOG1 protein in the EPO+CRISPR HSCB K562 cells and the shHSCB CD34+CD90+HSCs to, respectively, establish the EPO+CRISPR HSCB+FOG1 OE and shHSCB+FOG1 OE groups. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–E</xref>, FOG1 overexpression counteracted the inhibitory effects of HSCB silencing on the erythropoiesis of K562 cells and CD34+CD90+HSCs because, except for the heme contents, the EPO+CRISPR HSCB+FOG1 OE and shHSCB+FOG1 OE groups exhibited comparable levels of all the parameters evaluated relative to their corresponding control groups. Interestingly, the total protein level of GATA1 was not significantly affected by HSCB deficiency or FOG1 overexpression in EPO-induced K562 cells and CD34+CD90+HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

To gain more insights into the molecular mechanisms by which HSCB deficiency decreased FOG1 nuclear abundance, we also measured cytoplasmic FOG1 protein levels in EPO+CRISPR HSCB K562 cells and the shHSCB group of E 2-day HSCs.

Therefore, to further explain how HSCB deficiency prohibited FOG1 nuclear translocation, we next sought to identify differential binding proteins (DBPs, see the Materials and methods section for the definition) through affinity purification-MS analyses. We identified two DBPs, namely MYO1E and TACC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Their binding affinities with FOG1 increased significantly after HSCB expression was silenced (p values were less than 0.05 in Student’s <italic>t</italic> test).

We first performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments to test whether FOG1 indeed exhibited increased binding affinities with TACC3 in EPO-induced K562 cells and E 2-day HSCs after HSCB silencing. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>, the interaction between FOG1 and TACC3 was only detectable in HSCB-deficient cells, confirming that HSCB deficiency promoted the interaction between FOG1 and TACC3. KHS101, a TACC3 inhibitor, can both reduce the activity of TACC3 and decrease its protein abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Polson et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether KHS101 treatment could decrease the protein level of TACC3 in these cells and thereby alleviate the inhibitory effect of HSCB deficiency on their erythropoiesis. Indeed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–H</xref>, KHS101 treatment enhanced FOG1 nuclear translocation [as reflected by the significantly increased relative nuclear FOG1 (N-FOG1) to cytoplasmic FOG1 (C-FOG1) ratios in the KHS101 treatment groups (p values were less than 0.05 or 0.01 in Student’s <italic>t</italic> test)] and restored erythropoiesis in EPO+CRISPR HSCB K562 cells and shHSCB HSCs. Altogether, these data exhibited that HSCB deficiency prohibited FOG1 nuclear translocation by promoting its interaction with TACC3, and that reducing TACC3 abundance by KHS101 treatment alleviated the inhibitory effect of HSCB deficiency on the erythropoiesis of K562 cells and CD34+CD90+HSCs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Deficiency of heat shock cognate B (HSCB) blocked FOG1 nuclear translocation by enhancing its interaction with transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 3 (TACC3).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A histogram showing the two differential binding proteins (DBPs) of FOG1 between the EPO+CRISPR NC and EPO+CRISPR HSCB groups.

HSCB overexpression further decreased the protein level of TACC3 and enhanced FOG1 nuclear abundance. However, after the EPO+HSCB OE K562 cells were treated with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, the protein level of TACC3 and the nuclear abundance of FOG1 returned to those in untreated K562 cells.

A previous study suggested that FOG1 was needed for the formation of megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitors (MEPs), while GATA1 was required for the development of committed erythroid progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mancini et al., 2012</xref>). Given the biological significance of FOG1, it is crucial to understand how FOG1 is regulated by erythroid and megakaryocytic signals to ensure its timely activation or expression during erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Herein, we have established a PI3K–HSCB signaling axis that facilitated FOG1 nuclear translocation upon activation of the EPO/EPOR and TPO/MPL signaling pathways during human erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).</p><p>Although heme biosynthesis depends on an intact ISC assembly machinery, deficiencies in proteins of the ISC assembly complex, namely ISCU, NFS1, and LYRM4 have not been associated with erythropoietic consequences in both human subjects and cell models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ye and Rouault, 2010</xref>). In contrast, however, deficiencies in proteins responsible for ISC transfer, such as GLRX5, HSPA9, and HSCB, have been tightly linked with sideroblastic anemia phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ducamp and Fleming, 2019</xref>). This could be due to that ISC biogenesis deficiencies are tolerable in erythrocytes, while the proteins responsible for ISC transfer possess moonlighting functions during erythropoiesis. Our research was initially inspired by the findings that a CSA proband carrying heterozygous HSCB mutations developed moderate thrombocytopenia and mild neutropenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crispin et al., 2020</xref>). It is not surprising that mutations in proteins responsible for ISC transfer can cause anemia because two of the eight enzymes catalyzing heme biosynthesis, namely aminolevulinate dehydratase and ferrochelatase, were identified to be iron–sulfur proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dailey et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). However, it was not clear why the HSCB-deficient proband also exhibited moderately reduced numbers of platelets. Therefore, we tested whether HSCB is implicated with erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis of human CD34+CD90+HSCs. Our results indicated that HSCB knockdown detained the erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis of HSCs at early stages because most of the resultant progenitors were CD34+CD38+CD45RA−IL3RA−CD71−CD235a− or CD34+CD38+CD45RA−IL3RA−CD41a−CD42b−, corresponding to common myeloid progenitors or MEPs as per previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edvardsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kwon et al., 2021</xref>). Further analysis of the underlying mechanisms revealed that HSCB deficiency mainly impaired FOG1 nuclear translocation. The only known function of HSCB is to deliver nascent ISCs to recipient proteins. Interestingly, knockdown of proteins responsible for ISC assembly did not significantly affect erythropoiesis of HSCs, thus highlighting an ISC delivery independent function of HSCB during erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. HSCB is a chaperone expressed in both mitochondria and cytosol. In this study, we were able to detect two bands for HSCB with WB, among which the upper and lower bands, respectively, represent cytosolic and mitochondrial HSCB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). As revealed by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, the subcellular distribution of HSCB was neither significantly altered during erythropoiesis of CD34+CD90+HSCs nor significantly affected by ruxolitinib and wortmannin treatments in K562 cells. Therefore, it seems that the subcellular localization of HSCB does not change during erythropoiesis or correlate with its phosphorylation status. However, whether the phosphorylation status of HSCB affects its ISC delivery function warrants further investigation. Additionally, since HSCB can bind with a wide array of intracellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maio et al., 2017</xref>), we speculate that the protein may be involved in many biological processes other than nascent ISC delivery. In this context, we hope our study may inspire more research efforts on ISC delivery independent functions of HSCB.</p><p>TACC3 belongs to a family of TACC-domain-containing proteins associated with mitotic spindles and centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2017</xref>). The protein participates in cell division by regulating the organization of spindle and microtubule nucleation during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, TACC3 has attracted increasing research interest because it was found aberrantly expressed in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saatci et al., 2023</xref>). In addition to its association with tumorigenesis, TACC3 has also been implicated with erythropoiesis. According to a previous study, TACC3 could inhibit FOG1 nuclear translocation to suppress the erythropoiesis of mouse MEL and G1ER cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garriga-Canut and Orkin, 2004</xref>). Herein we found that TACC3 exerted a similar function in human erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitor cells because, in the absence of HSCB, the protein could bind with and prevent the nuclear translocation of FOG1. Then we observed that treatment with KHS101, a small-molecule inhibitor that could decrease the activity and protein abundance of TACC3, alleviated the inhibitory effect of TACC3 on erythropoiesis upon HSCB deficiency. These data clarified the mechanism through which HSCB deficiency inhibited FOG1 nuclear translocation and consequently impaired erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. In sight of the functions of TACC3 during cell division and erythropoiesis/megakaryopoiesis, it is possible that TACC3 plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation, which of course warrants further investigation. Furthermore, given that KHS101 could decrease TACC3 protein level to facilitate FOG1 nuclear translocation, this small-molecule reagent may have the potential to treat diseases caused by reduced activity or protein level of FOG1.</p><p>The precise mechanisms through which EPO/EPOR and TPO/MPL signaling pathways regulate lineage-specific transcription events during erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis remain incompletely understood. In a previous research, expression of a constitutively activated Stat5a mutant in Jak2<sup>−/−</sup> and EpoR<sup>−/−</sup> mouse fetal liver cells was found to rescue their proliferation defects independently of EPO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grebien et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, the authors also observed that transplantation of Jak2<sup>−/−</sup> fetal liver cells expressing the Stat5a mutant into irradiated mice was able to maintain erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis of the mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grebien et al., 2008</xref>). These data verified the important function of Stat5a as a downstream effector of the Epo/EpoR signaling pathway during murine erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis. However, since STAT5 possesses a variety of target genes, why the protein is specifically required for erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis warrants further investigation. Another early study demonstrated that wortmannin could impede EPO-induced K562 cell erythropoiesis but did not inhibit erythropoiesis of the cells triggered by hemin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kubota et al., 1996</xref>). Since wortmannin is an inhibitor for PI3K, this study revealed that PI3K plays a large part in EPO-induced erythropoiesis of K562 cells. Later, it was demonstrated that the PI3K–AKT signaling cascade could directly activate GATA1 to stimulate erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, we confirmed the importance of PI3K activity during erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis and established a novel molecular mechanism. Our data indicated that PI3K could bind with and phosphorylate HSCB to promote its interaction with TACC3 to induce TACC3 degradation, thereby facilitating FOG1 nuclear translocation during erythropoiesis of K562 human erythroleukemia cells and HSCs, as well as during megakaryopoiesis of HSCs. Interestingly, the nuclear and cytoplasmic GATA1 expression levels were not regulated by this PI3K–HSCB axis, as revealed by the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, as well as the TMT-MS counts provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>. These new findings explain how EPO/EPOR and TPO/MPL signaling pathways simultaneously activate GATA1 and FOG1 to ensure that this duo can function in a concerted and timely manner during human erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. In addition to the EPO/EPOR and TPO/MPL signaling pathways, PI3K is also activated by the SCF–c-KIT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lennartsson and Rönnstrand, 2012</xref>). Since the c-KIT and MRL receptors are expressed early on HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lennartsson and Rönnstrand, 2012</xref>), it is conceivable that the timely activation of GATA1 and FOG1 during erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis also requires the participation of other differentiation stage-specific mechanisms regulating the abundance of these proteins. This idea can be supported by our findings on HSCs induced for erythropoiesis for different periods of time. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, while the levels of cytoplasmic TACC3 and FOG1 exhibited no significant changes from days 2 to 4 of erythropoiesis, the level of N-FOG1 increased by more than three folds during the same period, suggesting that the functionalization of FOG1 is determined not only by the activation of the PI3K–HSCB axis, but also by the overall expression level of this protein. Additionally, although we failed to detect nuclear FOG1 in uninduced CD34+CD90+HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), we did detect a faint band of FOG1 in the cytoplasmic fraction. Given that HSCB was already expressed in uninduced CD34+CD90+HSCs, why the SCF–c-KIT–PI3K pathway failed to promote FOG1 nuclear translocation in these cells warrants further investigation.</p><p>In addition to the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages, the interaction between FOG1 and GATA1 can also regulate the development of mast cells. According to a previous study, GATA1 could exert its functions in a FOG-1-independent manner in the mast cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cantor et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, FOG1 was found to impede the commitment of HSCs to the mast cell lineage, and its overexpression could redirect committed mast cell progenitors into granulocytic, erythroid, and megakaryocytic lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cantor et al., 2008</xref>). A subsequent study delved into the mechanisms by which FOG1 inhibits mast cell lineage development by utilizing a GATA1 mutant that could not bind with FOG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chlon et al., 2012</xref>). The study revealed that FOG1 could affect the chromatin occupancy of GATA1 to regulate the expression of lineage-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chlon et al., 2012</xref>). Since our findings demonstrated that inhibition of cytosolic HSCB phosphorylation could retain FOG1 in the cytoplasm, it will be interesting to investigate whether these GATA1-expressing myeloid progenitors in which FOG1 is kept cytoplasmic could be driven toward the mast cell fate. Additionally, whether and how HSCB is implicated with the mast cell lineage-specifying events warrant further investigation.</p><p>This study has some limitations that should be acknowledged. First, we utilized the K562 cell line as one of the cell models in this study because it has the potential to differentiate into erythroid, megakaryocyte, and macrophage lineages and thus represents a useful tool in studying the molecular mechanisms underlying early-stage erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nandakumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sutherland et al., 1986</xref>). However, although K562 cells have been widely utilized to study erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cao et al., 2020</xref>), and the capability of EPO to induce K562 erythropoiesis has been demonstrated by this study and previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoffman et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kubota et al., 1996</xref>), this human erythroleukemia cell line might not faithfully represent the normal physiological processes of erythropoiesis. Fortunately, all our major conclusions can be successfully recapitulated in primary cells. A second limitation is that we did not focus on LYAR in this study because the difference in nuclear abundance of this protein between the shNC and shHSCB groups of E 2-day HSCs did not reach a statistically significant level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). However, given the established function of LYAR during late erythropoiesis, it will be intriguing to explore whether this protein is also implicated with HSCB functionalization during human erythropoiesis. A third limitation is that we did not clarify the detailed mechanisms through which HSCB promotes TACC3 degradation, which warrant further exploration. Finally, since we did not have access to biological samples from the patient harboring the <italic>HSCB</italic> mutation and that HSCB conditional knockout mice had almost no erythroid cells in their bone marrow, we were not able to further validate our findings in in vivo models.</p><p>In spite of these limitations, our study established a PI3K–HSCB axis that acted downstream of the EPO/EPOR and TPO/MPL signaling pathways to induce proteasomal degradation of TACC3, which otherwise detained FOG1 in the cytoplasm, in K562 cells and HSCs. This work elucidates an essential iron–sulfur cluster delivery independent function of HSCB in translating differentiation signals into downstream transcriptional events during human erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Culturing and treatment of K562 cell line and HSCs</title><p>Human K562 erythroleukemia cells were purchased from Procell Life Science&amp;Technology Co, Ltd (China).

For nuclear proteomics analysis, 500 μg of nuclear extracts were subjected to TMT-MS performed by CapitalBio Technology, China to characterize nuclear proteomic changes. Nuclear extracts of equal protein amounts were first subjected to proteolysis with trypsin (V5113, Promega) at 37°C for 16 hr. The resulting peptide fragments were then desalted with C18 Cartridge columns (WAT023590, Waters), freeze-dried, and reconstituted in a 40 μl 0.1% formic acid solution. Equal amounts of peptide fragments from each experimental group were then labeled utilizing the TMTpro 16plex Isobaric Label Reagent (A44520, Thermo Fisher) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The labeled fragments were fractionated through high-performance liquid chromatography with the C18 Cartridge columns and analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) assays using a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher).

They utilized a human primary cell model of hematopoietic differentiation to identify a novel mechanism whereby HSCB is necessary for activation of erythroid and megakaryocytic gene expression through regulation of the nuclear localization of FOG-1, a essential transcription co-regulator of the GATA transcription factors. Their work establishes this novel regulatory axis as a mechanism by which cytokine signaling through EPO-R and MPL drives the lineage-specification of hematopoietic progenitors to erythrocytes and megakaryocytes, respectively.</p><p>Impact:</p><p>The major impact of this work is in a greater understanding of how cytokine signaling through EPO/TPO function to promote lineage specification of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. While the major kinase cascades downstream of the EPO/TPO receptors have been elucidated, how those cascades effect gene expression to promote a specific differentiation program is poorly understood. For this work, we now understand that nuclear localization of FOG is a critical regulatory node by which EPO/TPO signaling is required to launch FOG-dependent gene expression. However, these cytokine receptors have many overlapping and redundant targets, so it still remains to be elucidated how signaling through the different receptors promotes divergent gene expression programs. Perhaps similar regulatory mechanisms exist for other lineage-specifying transcription factors.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors use two different cellular models of erythroid differentiation (K562 and human primary CD34+ cells) to elucidate the multi-factorial mechanism controlling FOG-1 nuclear localization. The studies are well-controlled and rigorously establish their mechanism through complementary approaches. The differentiation effects are established through cell surface marker expression, protein expression, and gene expression analyses. Novel protein interactions discovered by proteomics analyses were validated through bi-directional co-IP experiments in multiple experimental systems. Protein cellular localization findings are supported by both immunofluorescence and cell fractionation immunoblot analyses. The robustness of their experimental findings gives great confidence for the likelihood that the methods and findings can be reproduced in future work based on their conclusions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The one unexplained step in this intricately described mechanism is how HSCB functions to promote TACC3 degradation. It appears that the proteasome is involved since MG-132 reverses the effect of HSCB deficiency, but no other details are provided. Does HSCB target TACC3 for ubiquitination somehow? Future studies will be required to understand this portion of the mechanism.</p><p>One weakness of the study design is that no in vivo experiments are conducted. The authors comment that the HSCB mouse phenotype is too dramatic to permit studies of erythropoiesis in vivo; however, a conditional approach could have been pursued.</p><p>It should also be noted that a previous study had already shown that TACC3 regulates the nuclear localization of FOG-1, so this portion of the mechanism is not entirely novel. However, the role of HSCB and the proteasomal degradation of TACC3 is entirely novel to my knowledge.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95815.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Liu et al. identified an important pathway regulating the nuclear translocation of the key transcriptional factor FOG1 during human hematopoiesis. The authors show that heat shock cognate B (HSCB) can interact with and promote the proteasomal degradation of TACC3, and this function is independent of its role in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis. TACC3 represses the activity of FOG1 by sequestering it in the cytoplasm. Therefore, HSCB can promote the nuclear translocation of FOG1 through down-regulating TACC3. The authors further show that the phosphorylation of HSCB by PI3K downstream of the EPO signaling pathway is important for its role in regulating the nuclear translocation of FOG1. The data are solid and the manuscript is overall well written. The findings of this manuscript provide important new knowledge to the fields of hematopoiesis and cell biology.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) This study uses a multi-pronged approach that combines techniques from a number of fields to convincingly demonstrate the pathway regulating the nuclear translocation of FOG1 during hematopoiesis. The proposed role of each component in the pathway is well supported by solid data.</p><p>(2) This work provides important new insights into the function of HSCB, which was known to be an iron-sulfur cluster assembly protein. This study identifies a new role of HSCB and shows that HSCB can regulate the stability of the TACC3 protein, and this cytoplasmic function of HSCB is regulated by protein phosphorylation by PI3K.</p><p>(3) The findings of this work open up new directions for research in hematopoiesis and related fields. For example, are there any other TACC3-binding proteins whose subcellular localization are regulated by the presence or absence of TACC3? What is the E3 ligase responsible for the degradation of TACC3? Does this identified mechanism contribute to the sideroblastic anemias observed in HSCB human patients and animal models?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95815.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Gang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northeast Normal University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Changchun</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hou</surname><given-names>Yunxuan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northeast Normal University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Changchun</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Key Laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of the Ministry of Education (MOE), Northeast Normal University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Changchun</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yixue</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northeast Normal University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Changchun</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Chaoyue</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northeast Normal University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Changchun</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Chengquan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northeast Normal University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Changchun</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ren</surname><given-names>Yujie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northeast Normal University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Changchun</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Jianmin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northeast Normal University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Changchun</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiuli</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northeast Normal University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Changchun</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Xiumei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northeast Normal University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Changchun</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>General responses to the weaknesses of this work:</bold></p><p>The two reviewers mentioned two major weaknesses of this work:</p><p>(1) The one unexplained step in this intricately described mechanism is how HSCB functions to promote TACC3 degradation.

We tried to find the ubiquitin ligases involved in this regulatory process but could not identify such a key protein so far. We also investigated whether HSCB itself is a ubiquitin ligase but found that the protein does not possess this activity. We therefore consider this weakness another limitation of this research and have added one sentence to the penultimate paragraph of the Discussion section to address this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) This study only uses cell models. The significance of this work may be broadened by further studies using animal models.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree that in vivo models should be adopted to validate the major findings of this study. As we stated in the penultimate paragraph of the Discussion section, we did not have access to biological samples from the patient harboring the HSCB mutation. Additionally, HSCB constitutive knockout mice died during the embryonic stage, while conditional knockout did not cause embryonic death but resulted in almost no erythroid cells in the bone marrow. Therefore, we were not able to further validate our findings in in vivo models.</p><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Figure 3A - Should include FOG1 on the total cell lysate blots to show if total FOG1 is changing or only the cytoplasmic/nuclear ratio.

We initially tried to knock down TACC3 expression through siRNAs to confirm its role in the cytoplasmic retention of FOG1. However, we found that siRNAs that worked well in untreated K562 and erythroid progenitor cells as well as several other cell lines had poor efficiency of knocking down gene expression upon HSCB deficiency. This happened not only to siRNAs targeting TACC3, but also to those targeting several other genes. Interestingly, gene overexpression plasmids worked especially well in HSCB-deficient cells. We were not able to explain these phenomena and chose to use an inhibitor of TACC3 to study its functional implications in this research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Text should be added to discuss the implications of this work for the lineage-specifying function of GATA-1. There are papers by John Crispino and Alan Cantor/Stu Orkin using the FOG-binding mutant of GATA-1 that implicate FOG1-dependent GATA-1 activity as Meg/Ery specifying, whereas FOG1-independent GATA-1 activity promotes mast cell or eosinophil fate. This work suggests that GATA1-expressing myeloid progenitors where FOG1 is kept cytoplasmic (no EPO signaling) would be driven towards the mast cell fate.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestion.

However based on the data provided in Figure 6B and other figures, it seems that their interactions are more likely to be mutually exclusive. Is there a possibility that, besides inducing the degradation of TACC3, the binding of HSCB can inhibit the interaction between TACC3 and FOG1?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the insightful comment. According to the data presented in the updated Figure 5F, TACC3 can simultaneously bind with HSCB and FOG1 in E 2-day HSCs. That is why we depict the simultaneous binding pattern in the model provided in Figure 7H. However, we agree that there is a possibility that the binding of HSCB can inhibit the interaction between TACC3 and FOG1 and have mentioned this possibility in the “Phosphorylation of HSCB by PI3K was necessary for its functionalization during human erythropoiesis” subsection of the “Results” section in the updated manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Whether the decreased TACC3 protein abundance (Figure 5D) during erythroblast differentiation is mainly due to the effect of HSCB. Can silencing of HSCB block this reduction?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the great question. We have analyzed the protein abundance of TACC3 in HSCB-deficient hematopoietic stem cells induced for erythropoiesis for 0, 2 and 4 days and summarized the results as a new Figure 5E. According to the results, TACC3 protein abundance in HSCB-deficient hematopoietic stem cells exhibited no obvious change when the cells were induced for erythropoiesis for 0, 2 and 4 days. These results suggest that the decreased TACC3 protein abundance during early erythroblast differentiation was indeed due to the effect of HSCB. We only investigated the effect of HSCB on TACC3 abundance in early erythroid progenitors because, as shown in Figure 1, HSCB-deficient hematopoietic stem cells stopped differentiation at an early phase of their erythropoiesis. We have also mentioned these data in the “HSCB facilitated FOG1 nuclear translocation by binding with and mediating the proteasomal degradation of TACC3 upon activation of the EPO/EPOR signaling” subsection of the “Results” section in the updated manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) This study shows that HSCB can be phosphorylated by PI3K, and this modification is important for its role in regulating FOG1 distribution. Does the phosphorylation of HSCB also affect its function in ISC biogenesis?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the instructive question. We have analyzed the mitochondrial and cytosolic aconitase activities in wortmannin-treated K562 and E 2-day HSCs and their respective controls. The results have been summarized as a new Figure S5. According to the results, wortmannin treatment did not significantly affect mitochondrial and cytosolic aconitase activities. Therefore, it seems that HSCB phosphorylation does not affect its function in ISC biogenesis. We have also mentioned these data in the “Phosphorylation of HSCB by PI3K was necessary for its functionalization during human erythropoiesis” subsection of the “Results” section in the updated manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The method of isolation of nuclear fraction needs to be provided in the &quot;Materials and Methods&quot; section.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the thoughtful suggestion.
