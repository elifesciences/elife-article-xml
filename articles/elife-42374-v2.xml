Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) allow for direct inter-species comparisons of the gene regulatory response to CVD-relevant perturbations such as oxygen deprivation, a consequence of ischemia. To gain insight into the evolution of disease susceptibility, we characterized gene expression levels in iPSC-CMs in humans and chimpanzees, before and after hypoxia and re-oxygenation. The transcriptional response to hypoxia is generally conserved across species, yet we were able to identify hundreds of species-specific regulatory responses including in genes previously associated with CVD. The 1,920 genes that respond to hypoxia in both species are enriched for loss-of-function intolerant genes; but are depleted for expression quantitative trait loci and cardiovascular-related genes. Our results indicate that response to hypoxic stress is highly conserved in humans and chimpanzees.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42374.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Understanding why some people get heart disease and others do not could help scientists find better ways to treat or prevent the condition.

One common approach to investigate the regulatory mechanisms that underlie inter-individual disease susceptibility differences is to combine disease association studies with investigations of genetic variants that associate with molecular-level phenotypes using a quantitative trait locus (QTL) framework. However, one of the limitations of a QTL-based approach is that it is not clear what proportion of loci have actual functional consequences. A complementary approach to gaining insight into human susceptibility to disease is to investigate the genetic, molecular, and cellular differences between humans and our closest evolutionary relatives, the great apes. The challenge of a comparative approach is that it can be difficult to determine the specific basis of inter-species phenotypic differences, such as disease, because many observations are often correlated with each other across the species. The limitations and challenges of these approaches may be addressed by a combined analysis of comparative and QTL data, which can help us better understand the functional role of regulatory QTLs, by focusing on QTLs that impact genes whose regulation is either conserved or correlated with inter-species phenotypic differences.</p><p>The framework for our comparative study begins with the observed inter-species difference in cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD is responsible for about a third of both human and captive chimpanzee deaths (WHO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Varki et al., 2009</xref>). The anatomy of the healthy human and chimpanzee heart is similar; however CVD pathology differs. Chimpanzee disease is often associated with interstitial myocardial fibrosis, while human heart disease predominantly results from coronary artery artherosclerosis, leading to ischemic damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lammey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Varki et al., 2009</xref>). The interstitial fibrosis etiology prevalent in chimpanzees is also the most frequently diagnosed form of CVD in captive bonobos, gorillas and orangutans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lowenstine et al., 2016</xref>). It is unclear whether these apparent differences in susceptibility between species are due to genetic or environmental factors.</p><p>A consequence of myocardial ischemia, the reduction of blood flow to the heart tissue, is oxygen deprivation. Oxygen sensing and response is an essential process across species. If the balance between anti-oxidants and pro-oxidants, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), is decoupled, redox signaling is disrupted, and oxidative stress ensues. The heart is the most oxygen-demanding tissue in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Giordano, 2005</xref>). Maintenance of oxygen homeostasis is essential for cardiac function as imbalance of ROS can result in myocardial infarction and heart failure. Indeed, 20–40 min of oxygen deprivation results in irreparable damage to the human heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bretschneider et al., 1975</xref>).</p><p>It is well appreciated that CVD is a complex disease with many contributing genetic and environmental factors. These effects are difficult to distinguish in in vivo studies within and between species because, in order to establish clear causal relationships and mechanism, directed perturbation is required. This is infeasible in humans and other apes due to practical and ethical considerations. More tractable model organisms such as mice are not optimal models of CVD given the differences in relative heart size and heart rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Doevendans et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Milani-Nejad and Janssen, 2014</xref>). In addition to genome-level differences between humans and mice, the electrophysiology of mouse cardiomyocytes differs substantially from that of human cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moretti et al., 2013</xref>). To understand intrinsic gene regulatory processes in cell types relevant to human disease, one might have to study human cells. Primary human cardiac cells are not easy to access, and have a limited lifespan in cell culture. The advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology now allows us to access disease-relevant cell types across human individuals and other primates, control the extracellular environment of these cells in culture, and test the effects of perturbation. We have recently established a panel of human and chimpanzee iPSC lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gallego Romero et al., 2015</xref>), and we have shown that cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-CMs) can effectively model gene regulation in hearts from humans and chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pavlovic et al., 2018</xref>). iPSC-CMs can be used to study CVD phenotypes including channelopathies such as long QT syndrome, and dilated cardiomyopathies such as Barth syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tanaka et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Cardiomyocytes make up 70–85% of the heart volume, 30–40% of the total cellular composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pinto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhou and Pu, 2016</xref>), and are susceptible to ischemia following coronary artery occlusion. In order to gain insight into human gene regulatory adaptation in the heart, and the evolution of disease susceptibility and resistance, we developed a model of hypoxia and re-oxygenation in human and chimpanzee iPSC-CMs. This cell culture-based system enables an in-depth characterization of the inter-species response to, and recovery from, hypoxic stress. We can now determine intrinsic inter-species regulatory differences in response to a universal cellular stress, which could provide insight into the observed phenotypic differences in the manifestation of CVD between species.</p><p>Hypoxia induces a transcriptional response following stabilization of the HIF transcription factors under conditions of low oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Samanta and Semenza, 2017</xref>). We therefore determined both the global transcriptional response to hypoxia and re-oxygenation by RNA-seq, and the cellular response by measuring features of oxidative damage including lipid peroxidation and DNA damage, cytotoxicity, and cytokine release, in both species. While an iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte-based system has been previously used to study the effects of hypoxia in a single human and a single rhesus macaque individual, here we use a panel of human and chimpanzee individuals to identify a set of conserved and species-specific response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). The identification of inter-species gene regulatory differences allowed us to develop hypotheses about molecular mechanisms that might explain phenotypic differences between species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We differentiated cardiomyocytes from iPSCs of eight human and seven chimpanzee individuals, including replicate differentiations from a subset of the lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Importantly, there is no difference in the median purity of the cardiomyocyte cultures between humans and chimpanzees (median purity in both species: 78%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Though we only measured purity by flow cytometry analysis once, we note that <italic>TNNT2</italic> mRNA expression levels, a proxy for purity, do not change during the course of the experiment.</p><p>In order to mimic in vivo physiological oxygen levels experienced by cardiomyocytes in the heart, we cultured our cells at 10% oxygen, starting on the 25<sup>th</sup> day of differentiation. Peri-cellular oxygen levels were measured non-invasively using an oxygen sensor applied to the inside sidewall of the cardiomyocyte cultures. Transferring the cardiomyocytes from atmospheric oxygen levels (21% O<sub>2</sub>) to 10% O<sub>2</sub> did not seem to induce stress in the cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). In what follows, we consider 10% O<sub>2</sub> to be the baseline normoxia condition (designated as condition A). In order to determine the response of the cultures to hypoxia and subsequent recovery to normoxia, we subjected the cardiomyocyte cultures to the following conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for a schematic of the study design): We first lowered the O<sub>2</sub> levels to 1% for 6 hr (condition B), we then re-oxygenated to 10% O<sub>2</sub> for 6 hr of recovery in normoxic conditions (condition C), and 24 hr of recovery (condition D). Oxygen levels were monitored and recorded for each experimental batch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The same differentiation culture was used across conditions for each individual.</p><p>To confirm that perturbing the peri-cellular oxygen level affected cardiomyocytes from both species, we measured two phenotypes associated with oxidative damage. First, we determined whether damage to DNA is induced following hypoxic stress. Guanine is the nucleotide most prone to oxidation, and in general undergoes base excision repair. The repair products of the oxidative DNA lesions are subsequently released as 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). The amount of 8-OHdG released therefore reflects both the amount of oxidative damage to DNA, and the efficiency of base excision repair. We observed an increase in the level of 8-OHdG following hypoxia and re-oxygenation in both species (B<sub>Mean</sub> = 0.09 vs. C<sub>Mean</sub> = 1.32; t-test; p=0.002 in chimpanzees, and B<sub>Mean</sub> = −0.21 vs. C<sub>Mean</sub> = 1.42; p=0.01 in humans; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Within a condition, there is no difference in the amount of 8-OHdG released between species (human D<sub>Mean</sub> = 1.19, chimpanzee D<sub>Mean</sub> = 1.34). Second, we determined the extent of lipid peroxidation by measuring the release of the isoprostane 8-iso-Prostaglandin F2α (8-iso-PGF2α), which is induced following ROS-mediated damage to cellular membrane phospholipids. We found an increase in 8-iso-PGF2α release in chimpanzees following hypoxia (A<sub>Mean</sub> = 0 vs. B<sub>Mean</sub> = 35.65; p=0.006), and a further increase following long-term re-oxygenation (D<sub>Mean</sub> = 77.28; p=0.03; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>). While there is no difference in 8-iso-PGF2α release between species within any condition, we do not find a significant increase in 8-iso-PGF2α release following hypoxia in humans (A<sub>Mean</sub> = 0 vs. B<sub>Mean</sub> = 13.25; p=0.2). This pattern may be explained by incomplete power to detect differences in 8-iso-PGF2α release either between time points or between species. Nevertheless, our observations are intriguing because 8-iso-PGF2α is known to be elevated in heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mallat et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wolfram et al., 2005</xref>), and is a risk marker for coronary heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schwedhelm et al., 2004</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterizing the regulatory response to hypoxia in cardiomyocytes</title><p>We used RNA sequencing to characterize gene expression levels in all conditions, and study the regulatory response to hypoxia in the human and chimpanzee cardiomyocytes (see Materials and methods). We processed the samples using a study design that was balanced with respect to a number of recorded potential technical confounders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-Table S1). Following sequencing of the RNA, we mapped reads to primate orthologous exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and filtered lowly-expressed genes to yield a final data set with expression measurements for 11,974 genes (see Materials and methods).

After accounting for unwanted variation, samples cluster by species and then by individual or condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). We note that one technical factor, the presence or absence of episomal reprogramming vectors (three human samples tested positive; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>), remains a partial confounder with species.

For this analysis, we randomly selected one of each of the samples we had replicate data for. We were first interested in classifying genes into the following four categories within each species independently: genes that respond to hypoxia, genes that respond to short-term (6 hr) re-oxygenation following hypoxia, genes that respond to long-term (24 hr) re-oxygenation following hypoxia, and genes that differ between long-term re-oxygenation and baseline normoxia. Of 11,974 expressed genes, we identified ~4,000 genes that respond to hypoxia at 10% FDR in each species, and a slightly higher number of genes whose expression has changed upon re-oxygenation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; the results of all tests are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>-Table S3A).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42374.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Hypoxia induces a gene expression response in humans and chimpanzees.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Volcano plots representing genes that are differentially expressed (DE; 10% FDR) in pairwise comparisons across conditions in each species independently.

That said, considering the more stringent set of species-by-condition interaction genes, we found enrichment of lincRNAs compared to all expressed genes (4/147 interaction genes; Fisher’s exact test, p=0.007).

In the non-response gene category, there is a significant enrichment in KEGG pathways related to the heart (e.g. dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythymogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, 10% FDR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the conserved response category, various signaling pathways related to sensing the external environment, and responding to oxygen are significantly enriched including HIF1α, MAPK and FOXO1. There are no significantly enriched pathways in the species-specific gene response categories. Given the apparent enrichment of cardiovascular genes in the non-response category, we explicitly tested the contribution of a set of cardiovascular-associated genes to the response to hypoxia (see Materials and methods). Indeed, we found that there is a depletion of genes implicated in cardiovascular development and disease amongst the genes that respond to hypoxia in both species (Chi-squared test; p=8.3×10<sup>−6</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Associating genetic variation with hypoxic response genes</title><p>It has been suggested that genetic variants that associate with gene expression levels (eQTLs), may mediate disease phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Emilsson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert and Kruglyak, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">GTEx Consortium et al., 2018</xref>). In order to test the contribution of eQTLs to the response to stress, a phenotype that is likely to provide insight into disease, we overlapped our four response gene categories with genes whose expression level is associated with genetic variants in human heart tissues (eGenes; see Materials and methods). We observe a depletion of eGenes in the conserved response category, when compared to all expressed genes within each category, using data from the heart left ventricle (Chi-squared test; p=0.01), heart right atrial appendage (p=1.4×10<sup>−5</sup>), and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (p=6.4×10<sup>−5</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes consist mainly of ventricular-like cells. We therefore focused on eQTLs identified in the heart left ventricle. The depletion of eGenes corresponds to a difference in the contribution of eGenes to the non-response and conserved response categories (p&lt;10<sup>−15</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This observation is further supported by the fact that the absolute effect size of eQTLs, measured by allelic fold change, is significantly lower in the conserved response category compared to the non-response category (p=0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We confirmed that there is no correlation between the eQTL effect size, and gene expression level in either response category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The pattern of depletion of eGenes among conserved response genes is also observed across 12 other tested tissues; however the magnitudes of the effect differ between tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We found that human-specific response genes are also depleted of eGenes when we considered all eGenes identified in at least 1 of the 14 tested tissues (p=7.1×10<sup>−5</sup>), while chimpanzee-specific response genes are neither enriched nor depleted. Conversely, when we compare heart left ventricle eGenes to all expressed genes, we find that eGenes are depleted for conserved response genes (p=0.02). We next considered human gene expression response effect sizes, independent of response classification, in eGenes and non-eGenes. In accordance with the aforementioned findings, there is a lower absolute log fold change in expression in response to hypoxia in eGenes compared to non-eGenes (p&lt;0.002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42374.025</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>eGenes in heart tissue are depleted in conserved hypoxic response genes, while loss-of-function intolerant genes are enriched.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The proportion of heart left ventricle eGenes (GTEx Consortium) in each response category, relative to the proportion of all genes in each category.

A hallmark of cellular toxicity is the permeabilisation of the outer cellular membrane resulting in the release of intracellular components into the surrounding milieu. The activity of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme, which interconverts pyruvate and lactate, can be measured in the cell culture media as a proxy of this process. We observed a marginal yet significant increase in LDH activity following hypoxia in humans, and a significant increase following short-term re-oxygenation in both species (Student’s t-test; p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

In order to understand human adaptation and susceptibility to oxygen deprivation in the heart, we developed a cell-culture model to study the response to, and recovery from, hypoxia in iPSC-CMs from humans and chimpanzees. Using this system we were able to control exposure to changing oxygen levels in both species and study the ensuing in vitro response.</p><p>We found that, in humans and chimpanzees, the expression of ~4,000 genes (about a third of all expressed genes) is altered following six hours of hypoxic stress. Many of these genes return to baseline expression levels within 24 hr of re-oxygenation. The response to hypoxia is highly conserved in the two species with 1,920 genes responding similarly in humans and chimpanzees (75% of all genes that respond in at least one species). There have not been many comparative studies of functional perturbations in primates to provide us with broad context, but the conservation in response to hypoxia in our study is much greater than the conservation in immune response to infection between humans and chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barreiro et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests that the response to oxygen is a fundamentally conserved process across species, unlike the rapidly-evolving response to pathogens.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Considering our observations in a broader context results in better functional insight</title><p>Conserved hypoxic response genes correspond to signaling pathways related to oxidative stress and hypoxia including the FOXO1 and HIF1 signaling pathways. However, genes responding to hypoxia are significantly depleted for known cardiovascular-associated genes, suggesting that hypoxic stress response genes are expressed, and active in multiple tissues. This is supported by the fact that we observe that conserved response genes are depleted for eGenes identified in the heart as well as in other tissues. These results suggest that there is less tolerance for genetic variability that results in variation in the expression of genes that are necessary for eliciting a response to stress. Indeed, while eGenes are depleted in conserved response genes, genes identified to be intolerant to loss of function, are enriched in conserved response genes. GWAS-associated genes, likely to have individually small effects on a trait, and therefore more tolerance to mutation, are neither enriched nor depleted in conserved response genes. Cellular stress, including oxidative stress, can contribute to cellular damage and lead to disease pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Giordano, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sack et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A common notion is that genetic variants that modulate gene expression levels (eQTLs) are important in mediating disease phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Emilsson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert and Kruglyak, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">GTEx Consortium et al., 2018</xref>). Thousands of genetic variants that associate with various phenotypes, including disease presentation, have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Given that most of these variants are located within non-coding regions of the genome, it is thought that integrating GWAS data with eQTL data will help to identify genes that are relevant to the phenotype of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hormozdiari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). The observation that up to half of GWAS-identified variants are also eQTLs in at least one tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Battle et al., 2017</xref>), provided some measure of support for this notion. However, there are several lines of evidence, which indicate that the relationship between eQTLs and complex disease may be relevant mainly to diseases that manifest late in life, and are therefore unlikely to have an effect on fitness: (i) Highly constrained genes with missense and protein-truncating variants, that might be expected to contribute to disease, are depleted for eQTLs but enriched for GWAS variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lek et al., 2016</xref>). (ii) Most eQTLs are shared across a large number of tissues and are expected to have broad functional effects, which are therefore unlikely to be highly deleterious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Battle et al., 2017</xref>). (iii) eQTLs identified in other primates are often also eQTLs in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jasinska et al., 2017</xref>) suggesting that, across species, eGenes can tolerate the accumulation of associated mutations, which perturb their regulation. Together, these findings suggest that most eQTLs may be neutral. In this study, we performed perturbation experiments to determine the consequences on gene expression across species. Our results, which show a depletion of eQTLs in genes that respond to hypoxic stress in cardiomyocytes across species, suggest that eQTLs alone may not give immediate insight into stress phenotypes associated with cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Genetic variants that modulate gene expression levels only in response to direct perturbation (response QTLs) are more likely to be informative in disease. Indeed, the association between GWAS variants is more pronounced in response QTLs than naïve QTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barreiro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alasoo et al., 2018</xref>). There are currently a limited number of data sets that allow for a systematic investigation of this association. However, using an available data set of heart tissue from CVD patients, we again observed a depletion of eQTLs in stress response genes. Our results suggest that eQTLs correspond to a set of genes that are largely distinct from genes, which respond to stress, or which are relevant to disease. Indeed, genes that are differentially expressed between pre- and post-ischemia samples show the opposite pattern to that of eQTLs in our data that is they are enriched in genes that respond to stress across species. While many eQTLs act in <italic>cis</italic>, it has been suggested that <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs are more likely to associate with complex traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Westra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Battle et al., 2017</xref>). However, we are currently underpowered to confidently identify these variants and determine their relevance to stress and disease.</p><p>In addition to quantifying gene expression levels in response to hypoxia, we measured cellular stress phenotypes in our comparative cardiomyocyte system. The baseline level of DNA oxidation damage is similar in humans and chimpanzees, and increases following recovery from hypoxia in both species. The baseline level of lipid peroxidation is also similar in humans and chimpanzees, and shows a trend towards increased levels during the course of the experiment in both species; however this increase is only significant in chimpanzees. These findings are in line with a study of oxidative stress markers in blood from ten male humans and ten male chimpanzees, which showed that there is no significant difference in the levels of 8-OHdG between species, but there is significantly elevated 8-iso-PGF2α levels in chimpanzees compared to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Videan et al., 2009</xref>). Cytoxicity and cytokine release also increase during the course of the experiment in both species. Another comparative study on the effects of hypoxia in human and rhesus macaque cardiomyocytes demonstrates that the secreted metabolome is highly correlated between species after 24 hr of hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting an additional layer of regulatory conservation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Inter-species differences in response to oxygen perturbation</title><p>Although the overall correlation in the response to hypoxia is high between humans and chimpanzees, a stringent interaction analysis identified 147 genes with species-specific expression in the hypoxic condition.</p><p>The most significant species-specific response gene is <italic>RASD1,</italic> which is similarly expressed in humans and chimpanzees in normoxic conditions but is significantly up-regulated after hypoxia only in humans. <italic>RASD1</italic> was found to be up-regulated in samples from patients with ischemic disease compared to patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (heart damage despite normal blood flow), and non-failing hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).

It is unclear what pathway, related to the CAD phenotype, is affected by the <italic>RASD1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khera and Kathiresan, 2017</xref>), and further experimentation specifically focused on this gene is beyond the scope of the current study. That said, several previous observations are also consistent with the notion of a relationship between <italic>RASD1</italic> expression and the response to oxygen. The SNP in the <italic>RASD1-PEMT-RAI</italic> locus that is associated with CAD is not associated with various vascular-related traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schunkert et al., 2011</xref>); yet it is associated with ischemic stroke, with the same direction of effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dichgans et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting a potential role for oxygen deprivation. It was also previously reported that many CAD case participants in GWAS studies have suffered from myocardial infarction, which results in myocardial ischemia and hypoxia, and that there is evidence for the SNP-GWAS association in the myocardial infarction sub-phenotype of CAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schunkert et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, the SNP is an eQTL for <italic>RASD1</italic> expression in monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Emilsson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schunkert et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that it has the potential to influence <italic>RASD1</italic> expression in the right context.

In addition to <italic>RASD1</italic>, there are four other CAD-associated genes (<italic>MRPS6, SWAP70, SNF8</italic> and <italic>TRIB1</italic>) that respond to hypoxia in a species-specific manner. <italic>MRPS6</italic>, another human-specific response gene, encodes a mitochondrial ribosomal protein likely important in the translation of mitochondrial mRNAs necessary for oxidative phosphorylation.</p><p>RASD1 is an activator of G-protein signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cismowski et al., 2000</xref>), and is thought to contribute to the stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sato and Ishikawa, 2010</xref>).

For example, multiple genes (<italic>ACVR2A, SNIP1, JUNB, SMAD4, TGFBR2, SMAD6, FGF9</italic>) are related to TGF-β signaling. TGF-β is induced following myocardial infarction, and mediates the development of fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bujak and Frangogiannis, 2007</xref>). While we did not observe differences in the secretion of TGFβ−1, it is tempting to speculate that differences in the expression of these genes under oxygen stress, could contribute to the fibrotic heart phenotype observed in chimpanzees. Several of these genes have been implicated in heart physiology and disease suggesting that they could be relevant to the phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Galvin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alfonso-Jaume et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tseng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Itoh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dogra et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Many species-specific response genes are involved in post-transcriptional layers of the gene regulatory cascade including RNA modifications (<italic>METTL14</italic>), RNA folding (<italic>DDX20</italic>), splicing (<italic>CCDC49</italic>), nuclear-cytoplasmic transport (<italic>NUP214</italic>), and protein degradation (<italic>CBLL1, UBQLN4, TRIM13, DNAJB2</italic>).

Alternative splicing is another mechanism for inter-species differences between humans and chimpanzees, and, interestingly, one gene that undergoes differential splicing between species is the <italic>GSTO2</italic> gene, which is protective against oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Calarco et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Genes that respond to oxygen deprivation in a species-specific manner could have phenotypic consequences as rapid changes in gene expression in response to stress can lead to evolutionary adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">López-Maury et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Nadal et al., 2011</xref>). This mechanism has been implicated in mediating inter-species differences in epithelial cancer incidence as coordinated gene expression differences between humans and chimpanzees have been observed in fibroblasts subjected to serum starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pizzollo et al., 2018</xref>). Conversely, it has been suggested that species-specific gene responses to stress across divergent yeast species may be adaptive, or, more likely, compensated by the response of related genes, or reflective of biological noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tirosh et al., 2011</xref>). The latter could explain the overall inter-species similarity in the cellular and transcriptional response, and the fact that genes peripherally related to similar pathways show species-specific differences.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Potential limitations of our model</title><p>We performed our experiments using an in vitro iPSC-CM model. To characterize the potential relevance of our observations to in vivo systems, we considered the results of Pavlovic <italic>et al</italic>., who characterized regulatory differences between primary heart tissues and iPSC-CMs in humans and chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pavlovic et al., 2018</xref>). Out of 2,459 genes that respond to hypoxia in one or both species based on our data, only 371 (16%) were found to be differentially expressed between hearts and iPSC-CMs in Pavlovic <italic>et al</italic>. Similarly, 34 of the 147 species-by-condition interaction genes in our data (23%) were found to be differentially expressed between hearts and iPSC-CMs. In addition, we find that there is no significant difference in the proportions of conserved response genes and non-response genes in the overlap with genes that are differentially expressed between heart tissue and iPSC-CMs. Similarly, there is no significant difference in the proportion of conserved response and species-specific response genes that overlap with genes differentially expressed between heart tissue and iPSC-CMs. Put together, this analysis suggests that there is no systematic bias in our cell culture system.</p><p>It is important to note that following myocardial infarction and ischemia, highly metabolically active cardiomyocytes undergo rapid cell death thereby initiating a cascade of events including an inflammatory response by immune cells, cardiac fibroblast activation, and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Frangogiannis, 2014</xref>). Our study was designed to measure the primary response to oxygen deprivation in the heart at the level of cardiomyocytes. Given the high mitochondrial content of cardiomyocytes, these cells are likely to be more susceptible to oxidative stress than other cell types. Indeed, cardiomyocytes are more sensitive to superoxide radicals than cardiac fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 1999</xref>). However, our system was not able to capture secondary effects on extracellular matrix remodeling and fibroblast proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ugolini et al., 2017</xref>), which may differ between species and also contribute to the different disease phenotypes. We attempted to measure secondary disease processes by assaying TGFβ−1 secretion by cardiomyocytes, but did not find a significant difference in the release of this factor by cardiomyocytes between species.</p><p>In summary, to date there have been few well-powered studies investigating the evolution of the stress response in primates. Here we measured the genome-wide transcriptional response to a universal cellular stress, oxygen deprivation, across species in a CVD-relevant cell type. We find that the cellular and transcriptional response is largely similar across species; however there are hundreds of genes that respond in a species-specific manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(H.sapiens, Female)</td><td valign="top">H20682 iPSC</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ward et al., 2018</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(H.sapiens, Male)</td><td valign="top">H20961 iPSC</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burrows et al., 2016</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(H.sapiens, Female)</td><td valign="top">H21792 iPSC</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ward et al., 2018</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(H.sapiens, Female)</td><td valign="top">H22422 iPSC</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Age 19, Caucasian, fibroblast origin</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(H.sapiens, Female)</td><td valign="top">H24280 iPSC</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pavlovic et al., 2018</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(H.sapiens, Female)</td><td valign="top">H25237 iPSC</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Age unknown, Caucasian, fibroblast origin</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(H.sapiens, Male)</td><td valign="top">H28126 iPSC</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burrows et al., 2016</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(H.sapiens, Male)</td><td valign="top">H28815 iPSC</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ward et al., 2018</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(P.troglodytes, <break/>Female)</td><td valign="top">C3647 iPSC</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gallego Romero et al., 2015</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(P.troglodytes, Male)</td><td valign="top">C3649 iPSC</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gallego Romero et al., 2015</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(P.troglodytes, Female)</td><td valign="top">C40210 iPSC</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gallego Romero et al., 2015</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(P.troglodytes, Female)</td><td valign="top">C40280 iPSC</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gallego Romero et al., 2015</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(P.troglodytes, Female)</td><td valign="top">C40300 iPSC</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pavlovic et al., 2018</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(P.troglodytes, Male)</td><td valign="top">C4955 iPSC</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gallego Romero et al., 2015</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(P.troglodytes, Male)</td><td valign="top">C8861 iPSC</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gallego Romero et al., 2015</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Samples</title><p>We used eight biological replicates (individuals) from human, and seven from chimpanzee.

Cells were passaged every 3–4 days with dissociation reagent (0.5 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaCl in PBS), and seeded with ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (ab12019, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). iPSC-CM differentiations were largely performed based on the protocol described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burridge et al.

Importantly, the same differentiation protocol was used in both species. iPSCs cultured for 10–50 passages were seeded in 4 × 10 cm Matrigel-coated culture dishes until 70–100% confluent (Days −4/–3). The optimum cell density for efficient differentiation depended on the individual iPSC line. On Day 0, 6 μM of the GSK3 inhibitor, CHIR99021 trihydrochloride (4953, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) was added to the cultures in 12 ml Cardiomyocyte Differentiation Media [500 mL RPMI1640 (15–040 CM ThermoFisher Scientific), 10 mL B-27 Minus Insulin (A1895601, ThermoFisher Scientific), 5 mL Glutamax (35050–061, ThermoFisher Scientific), and 5 mL Penicillin/Streptomycin)], and a 1:100 dilution of Matrigel. 24 hr later, on Day 1, fresh Cardiomyocyte Differentiation Media, supplemented with 6 μM CHIR99021 was added to the cultures. Chimpanzee iPSCs, in general, were more sensitive to the addition of CHIR99021 hence the reduction from the optimal 12 μM CHIR99021 for 24 hr as described in Burridge <italic>et al</italic>., to 6 μM for 48 hr.

In order to have a comparable set of genes from which to identify gene expression differences, we quantified gene expression levels at orthologous meta-exons from 30,030 Ensembl genes from hg19, panTro3 and rheMac3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blekhman et al., 2010</xref>) using featureCounts within subread (version 1.4.6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liao et al., 2014</xref>). In order to compare gene expression profiles equivalently across individuals regardless of sex, genes were filtered to only include those on the autosomes. Log<sub>2</sub>-transformed counts per million were calculated using edgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>).

As we have two replicate samples from six of the individuals (three in each species), the RUVs function for estimating the factors of unwanted variation using replicate samples was used. This approach takes advantage of the fact that replicate samples have constant covariates of interest. We tested different numbers of unwanted factors of variation (k values) until the data clustered best by our biological factors of interest that is species, individual and condition. Four factors of unwanted variation were thus selected.</p><p>To assess data quality we performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the RUVs-normalised log<sub>2</sub> cpm expression values.

Cormotif fits correlation motifs to multiple pairs of tests to identify differential expression patterns. To identify gene expression trajectories (correlation motifs), TMM-normalised cpm values for each gene were compared across three pairs of conditions within each species (6 pairs of tests in total; 1: human A vs. B, 2: human B vs. C, 3: human B vs. D, 4: chimpanzee A vs. B, 5: chimpanzee B vs. C, 6: chimpanzee B vs. D). In order to select the best model to fit the data, we varied the number of correlation motifs (1 through 15). The best fit was determined using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and Akaike information criterion (AIC). The BIC and AIC were minimized when four correlation motifs were modeled. Cormotif calculates the posterior probability of differential expression for each gene, in each of the six pairwise tests. These values are plotted in the heatmap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. We used a threshold posterior probability of 0.5 to classify genes into each of the four correlation motifs as suggested by the authors.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Aviv Regev as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Charles G Danko (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, the authors perform a comparative study of transcriptional and physiological responses of iPSC derived cardiomyocytes to hypoxia (oxygen deprivation) in human and chimpanzees. Because oxygen deprivation is a major feature of myocardial ischemia, the authors focus on dynamic oxygen response. By performing a comparative analysis of how humans and chimpanzees respond to hypoxia one can gain insight into the susceptibility of humans to different cardiovascular diseases. They measure physiological as well as transcriptional responses in both species under normal oxygen, oxygen deprivation, reoxygenation and perform a careful comparative analysis of the gene expression differences and similarities between the two species.</p><p>This is well designed and executed study and manuscript is very well written and clear. The overall conclusions of the paper is that response to hypoxia is generally conserved across species and might be less tolerant for genetic variation. Genes that respond to hypoxia are less tolerant of genetic changes as they are depleted for eQTLs associated with heart and enriched for genes intolerant for loss of function. The study also finds several key genes that are species-specific (e.g., 147 genes, or 199 in human and 433 in chimpanzee depending on the analysis), including RASD1, which is also upregulated in patients post-ischemia and falls in a locus associated with ischemic stroke.</p><p>Overall, this is a very interesting study which has important implications for the stress response field. However, there are some aspects of the manuscript and analysis performed that need improvements to (a) make the connection to the eQTL analysis earlier on in the paper and (b) to increase the depth and scope of this study to gain more insight into the species-specific differences.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Introduction focuses on applying a comparative approach to study species-specific heart disease vulnerabilities, which is an important question that can be tackled by the authors' innovative strategy. The Introduction should be expanded to further explain whether the species differences in heart disease susceptibility are thought to be genetic or environmental, and which species is thought to have the derived disease risk change. Fleshing these points out further would help to clarify how gene expression and genome sequence differences could inform species disease predisposition.</p><p>2) Despite the Introduction focused on comparative vulnerabilities, the Results and Discussion provide equal or greater emphasis on the point that eQTL genes are depleted from the stress response. This finding seems to play into a larger debate (introduced in the Discussion) about whether eQTLs represent disease associated variation or are more likely to reflect neutral genetic variants, but the significance of this debate is not introduced in advance. If the properties of genes with conserved responses to oxygen deprivation is to be a major focus of the paper, then the Introduction should build out more of the significance of this problem and the logic of why the comparative strategy can help address this question. Could the same question have been asked without comparative data, or is the filter for conserved genes necessary?</p><p>3) Although the responses to hypoxia are conserved, additional work is needed to increase the scope of the paper and in particular examine the species-specific differences. In particular, the authors identify a set of species specific genes which already include good candidates (e.g., RASD1 in human, TGFbeta genes in chimp) that may relate to disease vulnerabilities, but the authors do not pursue this analysis further. Can the authors validate by Western blot that RASD1 (or other candidates) are indeed up-regulated only in the response of human cells (in a subset of individuals)? Some form of validation would be important if not a functional analysis of top candidates.</p><p>4) Alternatively, to further explore the species specific differences the authors could leverage published or newly collected datasets measuring the binding profile of the key transcription factors on the regulatory regions of the responsive genes and see if there are differences at the level of regulation. The transcription factors driving hypoxia (e.g., HIF1 and FOXO1) have been previously characterized at the level of either ChIP-seq or binding motifs. The authors could use published ChIP-seq datasets and ask whether peaks near conserved response genes show greater sequence conservation than peaks near human-specific response genes. This would indicate a potential evolutionary mechanism for divergent response patterns. Similarly, for high priority candidates like RASD1, the authors could directly analyze whether humans have gained HIF1 or FOXO1 binding motifs.</p><p>5) Previous work from the same lab (Pavlovic et al., 2018) showed strong correspondence between in vitro derived cardiomyocotyes and human heart tissue. However, one of the major differences reported between iPSC-CMs and heart tissue related to oxidation-reduction processes. How representative is the in vitro response likely to be given these differences? Clearly, the authors still observe major hypoxia responses (and formulated low glucose media conditions to enable this), but can the authors clarify any limitations based on their past observation?</p><p>6) The analysis seems to be restricted to one-to-one orthologs. Could more interesting and interpretable differences be identified if one was to take the gene duplications into account? The depth of the study could also be increased by examining annotated lincRNAs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42374.046</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Introduction focuses on applying a comparative approach to study species-specific heart disease vulnerabilities, which is an important question that can be tackled by the authors' innovative strategy.

Once we identified clusters of genes responding in a conserved versus species-specific manner, we realized that we had the opportunity to investigate different properties associated with the response. One property of interest was to consider genes whose expression level is variable across individuals i.e. eQTLs. Our conclusions with respect to eQTLs would have been the same even if we only had the human data. This, however, may not be true for responses to other treatments because in our study most genes respond to hypoxia in both species (1,920 conserved response genes and 630 species-specific response genes). It is not clear if this is a general property that would extend to other stress responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Although the responses to hypoxia are conserved, additional work is needed to increase the scope of the paper and in particular examine the species-specific differences. In particular, the authors identify a set of species specific genes which already include good candidates (e.g., RASD1 in human, TGFbeta genes in chimp) that may relate to disease vulnerabilities, but the authors do not pursue this analysis further. Can the authors validate by Western blot that RASD1 (or other candidates) are indeed up-regulated only in the response of human cells (in a subset of individuals)? Some form of validation would be important if not a functional analysis of top candidates.</p></disp-quote><p>It is important for us to note that testing for different levels of responses should not be considered ‘validation’ of the observation at the RNA level. Protein levels, for example, can and often will show patterns that are not consistent with the RNA level. We prefer the terminology of testing whether the RNA response we observed extends to other levels as well.</p><p>Along these lines, we have now performed several additional experiments in order to increase the scope of the paper. We first considered cellular phenotypes that are likely to be impacted by hypoxic stress, and may show a difference between species based on inter-species differences in the disease phenotype. We determined sensitivity to oxygen deprivation by measuring the level of cytotoxicity during the course of the experiment. A hallmark of cellular toxicity is the permeabilisation of the outer cellular membrane resulting in the release of intracellular components into the surrounding milieu. The activity of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme, which interconverts pyruvate and lactate, can be measured in the cell culture media as a proxy of this process. We observed a marginal yet significant increase in LDH activity following hypoxia in humans, and a significant increase following short-term re-oxygenation in both species. Despite these apparent differences in response to hypoxia, there is no significant difference in LDH activity between species within a condition. We have included these results as Figure 8A, and described them in the first paragraph of the subsection “Cellular responses to hypoxia”.</p><p>We then asked whether oxygen deprivation experienced by cardiomyocytes could have downstream consequences on other cell types in the heart such as cardiac fibroblasts by secretion of cytokine signaling molecules. The TGFβ-1 cytokine is known to mediate the development of fibrosis following stress in the heart (Liu et al., 2017). We measured secreted TGFβ-1 protein levels by ELISA for four individuals in each species. We found that TGFβ-1 release was significantly increased following re-oxygenation after hypoxic stress in both species; however there is no difference between species under any condition. We have included these results as Figure 8B, and added a description of these results in the last paragraph of the subsection “Cellular responses to hypoxia”.</p><p>As the additional assays we performed to measure cellular phenotypes in response to hypoxic stress again show conservation across species, we have reworded the title to more accurately reflect the fact that while we have identified over 100 species-specific response genes through a stringent interaction analysis, the response is largely conserved across species.</p><p>In order to further explore species-specific differences, we attempted to measure protein expression of four species-specific response genes identified through our stringent species-by-condition interaction approach. Given the small number of cells remaining from the experiment, we were unable to detect protein expression for three antibodies we tested: RASD1, JUNB and BCKDK using 8 or 12 μg protein, and two antibody conditions. We were able to detect SNIP1 protein expression in two individuals of each species, but we question whether we detected the correct isoform.</p><p>Unfortunately, our study was not designed to measure protein expression, and all optimization to determine the media conditions and timepoints in the study was assessed using mRNA expression. It is not practical at this time repeat the entire experiment in order to collect more protein data. We provide the western blot analysis in our response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), but we decided not to include this in the manuscript, as we don’t believe that these results add meaningfully to the narrative.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42374.035</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-42374-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Finally, we attempted to assess the functional consequences of the RASD1 GTPase, and other G-protein related species-specific response genes by measuring the level of cAMP secretion, a downstream effector of G-protein signaling, via an ELISA assay. In our hands we did not find the assay to be sensitive enough to consistently detect cAMP levels across a test set of samples, and therefore did not perform this experiment on our full set of samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Alternatively, to further explore the species specific differences the authors could leverage published or newly collected datasets measuring the binding profile of the key transcription factors on the regulatory regions of the responsive genes and see if there are differences at the level of regulation. The transcription factors driving hypoxia (e.g., HIF1 and FOXO1) have been previously characterized at the level of either ChIP-seq or binding motifs. The authors could use published ChIP-seq datasets and ask whether peaks near conserved response genes show greater sequence conservation than peaks near human-specific response genes. This would indicate a potential evolutionary mechanism for divergent response patterns. Similarly, for high priority candidates like RASD1, the authors could directly analyze whether humans have gained HIF1 or FOXO1 binding motifs.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good idea. Thank you. We obtained published human ChIP-seq data sets for HIF1α (356 sites), HIF2α (301 sites) (Schodel et al., 2011), and FOXO3 (934 sites) (Eijkelenboom et al., 2013). HIF1/2α binding was measured in a breast cancer cell line following HIF stabilization with dimethyloxaloylglycine. FOXO3 binding was measured in a colon cancer cell line with a Tamoxifen-inducible FOXO3A3-ER fusion protein. We performed combined analysis of these data with our gene expression data, and we believe that the results do add a bit of insight into potential mechanisms that underlie the observed response. These results are now reported in the second and third paragraphs of the subsection “Properties of hypoxic response genes” and in Figures 6A-B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Previous work from the same lab (Pavlovic et al., 2018) showed strong correspondence between in vitro derived cardiomyocotyes and human heart tissue. However, one of the major differences reported between iPSC-CMs and heart tissue related to oxidation-reduction processes. How representative is the in vitro response likely to be given these differences? Clearly, the authors still observe major hypoxia responses (and formulated low glucose media conditions to enable this), but can the authors clarify any limitations based on their past observation?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we should have obviously done that. Thank you for pointing this out.</p><p>We overlapped our four response gene categories with the set of genes that Pavlovic <italic>et al.</italic> found to be differentially expressed between heart tissue and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes at differentiation Day 27. Out of 2,459 genes that respond to hypoxia in one or both species, only 371 are differentially expressed between hearts and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (16%). 34 of the 147 species-by-condition interaction genes (23%) are differentially expressed between hearts and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. This suggests that the majority of response genes are not differentially expressed between hearts and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, and that iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes are a useful model for studying in vivo processes. We have included this description in the first paragraph of the Discussion subsection “Potential limitations of our model”.</p><p>We also now also note in the Discussion (second paragraph), that the heart is a complex tissue consisting of multiple cell types and these other cell types, with alternative metabolic profiles, will contribute to the signal in heart tissue, which will be absent from the in vitro derived cardiomyocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The analysis seems to be restricted to one-to-one orthologs. Could more interesting and interpretable differences be identified if one was to take the gene duplications into account? The depth of the study could also be increased by examining annotated lincRNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added an analysis of non-coding transcripts. We found that antisense transcripts are enriched in conserved response genes compared to non-response genes; however, species-specific response genes are no more likely to be antisense transcripts than conserved response genes. When we focused on the more stringent set of species-by-condition interaction genes, we found an enrichment of lincRNAs. These lincRNAs are <italic>APTR, NEAT1, RNF139-AS1</italic> and <italic>LINC02615</italic>. We have included these results as Figure 6C, and they are described in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Properties of hypoxic response genes”.</p><p>With respect to orthology, we chose to focus on one-to-one orthologs in order to have a comparable set of genes from which to identify gene expression differences. It is not entirely clear to us how to analyze comparative gene expression data if it can be mapped to only a single species. We have specified the rationale behind our chosen approach in the first paragraph of the subsection “RNA-seq data processing”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
