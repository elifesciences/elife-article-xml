affecting millions of sepsis survivors annually. Survivors report chronic skeletal muscle weakness and development of new functional limitations that persist for years. To delineate mechanisms of sepsis-induced chronic weakness, we first surpassed a critical barrier by establishing a murine model of sepsis with ICU-like interventions that allows for the study of survivors. We show that sepsis survivors have profound weakness for at least 1 month, even after recovery of muscle mass. Abnormal mitochondrial ultrastructure, impaired respiration and electron transport chain activities, and persistent protein oxidative damage were evident in the muscle of survivors. Our data suggest that sustained mitochondrial dysfunction, rather than atrophy alone, underlies chronic sepsis-induced muscle weakness. This study emphasizes that conventional efforts that aim to recover muscle quantity will likely remain ineffective for regaining strength and improving quality of life after sepsis until deficiencies in muscle quality are addressed.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49920.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when a local infection spreads to the bloodstream and the body responds in such an exaggerated way that organs become damaged. Patients often require longs stays in intensive care units, and upon discharge experience chronic physical weakness and fatigue for several years. However, it was difficult to understand how sepsis can create these long-term problems because there was no way to study these issues in animals.</p><p>To fill this knowledge gap, Owen et al. developed a protocol where they triggered sepsis in adult mice and then used therapeutic treatments similar to the ones found in intensive care units; as a result, most of the animals survived, with many then exhibiting chronic muscle weakness. Further observations in surviving mice revealed that muscle mass recovered after sepsis, so this weakness was not due to a drop in muscle mass: instead, the quality of the muscle fibers had worsened. More specifically, there were striking abnormalities in mitochondria, structures whose role is to power cells. The muscles also showed signs of persistent oxidative damage, a process in which toxic molecules produced by life processes accumulate and end up harming cells.</p><p>Overall, these data suggest that reduced muscle quality contributes to chronic weakness after sepsis. While current programs for sepsis survivors aim to increase muscle quantity, the results by Owen et al. suggest that improving muscle quality, for example using antioxidant therapies, could be a new avenue of treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sepsis</kwd><kwd>muscle</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>post-intensive care syndrome</kwd><kwd>chronic critical illness</kwd><kwd>critical illness myopathy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 GM117868</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Owen</surname><given-names>Allison M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM126181</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saito</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG055359</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saito</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG390732</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saito</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM129532</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Starr</surname><given-names>Marlene E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM117298</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaneki</surname><given-names>Masao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM115552</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaneki</surname><given-names>Masao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011781</institution-id><institution>Shriners Hospitals for Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>85600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaneki</surname><given-names>Masao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sepsis-induced long-term muscle weakness was reproduced using a refined murine model, which was accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction in the absence of sustained atrophy, suggesting the promise of mitochondria-targeted post-sepsis therapies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sepsis is a common life-threatening condition caused by a deregulated host response to infection. This syndrome is characterized by profound systemic inflammation and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which often lead to multiple organ failure (MOF) and subsequent mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Singer et al., 2016</xref>). The incidence of sepsis has risen by 9% to 13% annually, largely due to an expansion of the elderly population, more frequent invasive surgical procedures, and increased antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaieski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angus and Wax, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Starr and Saito, 2014</xref>). However, advances in critical care medicine and campaigns promoting early identification and treatment of sepsis have led to improved survival rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angus and Wax, 2001</xref>). Consequently, nearly 1.5 million sepsis survivors are discharged annually from U.S. hospitals, approximately 14 million globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elixhauser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Prescott and Angus, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fleischmann et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>As the population of survivors grows, post-sepsis physical dysfunction, which exceeds that of intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICUAW) alone, has become a clear clinical problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Prescott and Angus, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Callahan and Supinski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iwashyna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schefold et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Contrin et al., 2013</xref>). Sepsis survivors rarely return to baseline functional status after discharge from the ICU. Post-sepsis muscle weakness causes nearly half of previously functionally independent individuals to be discharged either to nursing care facilities or home with home care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Odden et al., 2013</xref>). Nearly a third of patients which were previously independent and had no prior comorbidities had problems with mobility one year after discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yende et al., 2016</xref>). Further, survivors continue to develop functional limitations for at least 5 years following discharge, a trend that appears to be sepsis-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iwashyna et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, less than half of previously employed individuals are able to return to work within one year after discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poulsen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pettilä et al., 2000</xref>). Together these studies illustrate the dramatic impact of chronic post-sepsis weakness.</p><p>Although post-sepsis muscle weakness is now widely recognized as a serious medical issue, the lack of an appropriate animal model has greatly impeded the identification of mechanisms that contribute to <italic>long-term</italic> dysfunction. Current animal models of sepsis are either too severe, causing early death of most animals without recovery from sepsis, or too mild thus not triggering long-term chronic dysfunction. To overcome this issue, we recently refined a non-surgical murine model of polymicrobial sepsis whereby infection is initiated by injection of cecal slurry (CS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Starr et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Starr et al., 2016</xref>). Therapeutic intervention with a broad-spectrum antibiotic and fluids is provided, but initiated after bacteremia is evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steele et al., 2017</xref>). This delayed ICU-like resuscitation protocol allows for the development of sepsis with organ damage, yet rescues the majority of mice from an otherwise completely lethal condition, thereby allowing the study of survivors. To further optimize our animal model for the current study, careful attention was also given to age, as the large majority of sepsis patients are late middle-age and older, and aging is an established risk factor for sepsis incidence, severity, and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angus and Wax, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Starr and Saito, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elixhauser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dombrovskiy et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to establish that chronic muscle weakness, similar to the clinical condition among sepsis survivors, can be modeled in age-appropriate mice using our CS protocol with delayed ICU-like intervention. We then aimed to delineate underlying mechanisms responsible for post-sepsis muscle dysfunction. We show that sepsis survivors have significant skeletal muscle weakness for at least one month which cannot be attributed to muscle atrophy, but rather is associated with impaired mitochondrial activity and persistent protein oxidative damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mice exhibit chronic muscle weakness after sepsis induced by a severe model</title><p>We adapted our recently reported ICU-like model of sepsis to late middle-aged C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steele et al., 2017</xref>) (16 months; equivalent to ~50-year-old human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flurkey K et al., 2007</xref>]).

Therefore, we also performed a series of histochemical stains on tibialis anterior muscle sections as an alternative method to evaluate specific mitochondrial complex enzyme activity in whole tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Quantification of stain intensities was conducted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) which showed that complex I activity (measured by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (NADH), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>top row</italic>) was 22.2% lower at day 4% and 40.8% lower at 2 weeks compared to NSC, although statistical significance was not achieved. Complex II activity (measured by succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>middle row</italic>) was 19.8% lower at day 4% and 38.1% lower at 2 weeks (p=0.015). Overall mitochondrial respiration activity was assessed by cytochrome c oxidase staining (COX; complex IV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>bottom row</italic>) which was 43.7% lower at day 4 (p&lt;0.001) and 48.6% lower at 2 weeks (p&lt;0.001). Interestingly, 2 weeks after sepsis some myofibers had areas devoid of staining which was consistent among serial sections for the different mitochondrial enzyme activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <italic>right column, yellow arrows</italic>). Using hematoxylin and eosin stained serial sections we confirmed that the areas devoid of mitochondrial enzyme activity were not devoid of tissue. We hypothesize that the areas devoid of histochemical staining in the myofibers of sepsis survivors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>right column</italic>) are likely the areas that house ‘empty’ or highly ‘aberrant’ mitochondria as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> by TEM analysis.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49920.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Mitochondrial enzyme activities are progressively reduced over time in sepsis survivors.</title><p>Tibialis anterior specimens were utilized for histochemical staining of oxidative phosphorylation enzyme activities in non-sepsis controls (<italic>n</italic> = 5), and after sepsis at 4d (<italic>n</italic> = 4–5) and 2wk (<italic>n</italic> = 4).

To investigate oxidative damage as a potential contributor to muscle weakness in the post-sepsis condition, whole protein was extracted from the tibialis anterior of control and post-sepsis animals (both at 2 weeks and 1 month), and markers of irreversible oxidative damage were assessed by Western blot.

Here, we describe our refinements to a murine model of sepsis, which enabled us to induce severe pathogenesis (i.e. with multi-organ damage and high risk of mortality), yet rescue the majority of mice to obtain survivors in which long-term muscle function could be assessed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate skeletal muscle dysfunction long after recovery from experimental sepsis. We show that murine sepsis survivors have prolonged muscle weakness, independent of muscle atrophy, that is associated with ongoing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage.</p><p>In the refinement of our model, we addressed four specific areas that were overlooked in prior research: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Singer et al., 2016</xref>) age of animals, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin et al., 2003</xref>) sepsis severity, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaieski et al., 2013</xref>) inclusion of muscle strength analysis, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angus and Wax, 2001</xref>) avoiding artificial effects of sepsis model. <italic>First</italic>, in addition to being more likely to develop sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Starr and Saito, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elixhauser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dombrovskiy et al., 2007</xref>), patients at late middle-age more frequently suffer from post-sepsis dysfunction due to confounding issues such as preexisting comorbidities, reduced muscle mass, and lower protein intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Contrin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rahman et al., 2014</xref>). Further, these patients are most vulnerable to economic repercussions since post-sepsis functional limitations often prevent them from returning to work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iwashyna et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hofhuis et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Second</italic>, in order to observe long-term muscle weakness, considerably <italic>severe</italic> sepsis needed to be induced. Battle and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Battle et al., 2014</xref>) reported that patients who survived septic shock had reduced physical functioning and general health compared to patients who survived uncomplicated sepsis or sterile (i.e. non-infectious) systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Likewise, this suggests that animal models of sepsis with mild or modest severity (i.e. no to little mortality in the absence of resuscitation) have little clinical relevance. In order to model the morbidities with which sepsis survivors present clinically, experimental sepsis should be severe enough to cause chronic dysfunction, as we demonstrate in the present study. <italic>Third</italic>, the limited research that has been conducted at later time-points after experimental sepsis did not include muscle function assessment in parallel with molecular analyses, thus actual muscle weakness was not confirmed. One exception, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rocheteau et al. (2015)</xref> assessed muscle force (specific tension) in mice 21 days after injury induced by a combination of myotoxin injection and sepsis (cecal ligation and puncture; CLP); however, it is unclear whether sepsis itself had any effect on muscle force and no comparison was made with non-sepsis controls. <italic>Fourth</italic>, many sepsis studies use the CLP animal model; however, in this model surgical complications may influence recovery. Further, differences in cecum shape and size among older mice lead to inconsistency in ligation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Starr et al., 2014</xref>), and in mice kept long-term, the ligated cecum may result in unresolved necrosis, and sustained inflammation.</p><p>In an effort to better model the clinical course of sepsis by addressing the above four factors, we induced sepsis by CS injection in late middle-aged mice, and used our ICU-like severe model of sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steele et al., 2017</xref>) which resulted in ~75% survival after an otherwise lethal insult. In the current study, using ex vivo force analysis, we found that middle-aged sepsis surviving mice exhibit a ~ 20% reduction of muscle force compared to non-sepsis controls up to 1 month after sepsis. This ex vivo muscle strength assessment circumvents potential confounding variables, such as behavioral, sensory, and operational factors, which are introduced by the commonly-used grip strength measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maurissen et al., 2003</xref>). We then provide clear evidence that long-term muscle weakness cannot be explained by loss of muscle mass, but rather reduced muscle quality. We show that specific force, which is normalized to unit area (i.e. muscle size), is significantly reduced in murine sepsis survivors. These data imply that differences in muscle size among control and sepsis surviving animals did not account for differences in muscle strength. We additionally provide body composition analysis, wet weights of skeletal muscles, and myofiber cross-sectional area which collectively demonstrate that animals indeed have atrophy during sepsis, but that muscle mass largely recovers. Thus, this model mimics the clinical situation since aged subjects are most at risk for sepsis incidence, morbidity, and mortality. Further, it models non-surgical sepsis, and development of severe infection and inflammation prior to therapeutic intervention, similar to the typical clinical scenario. Additionally, this long-term model replicates the clinical presentation of post sepsis syndrome, or the broader issue of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), in which the patient survives but remains physically weak, even in the absence of muscle wasting.</p><p>This differentiation between quality vs quantity is highly important, as prevention of muscle wasting is a large clinical focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>). Muscle wasting is a major concern for sepsis patients in the ICU. Numerous factors, most notably muscle unloading during bedrest, insufficient nutrition, pharmacologic exposures, and imbalanced protein catabolism and synthesis, have been shown to contribute to sepsis-mediated atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schefold et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schreiber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eikermann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spranger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dres et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vary and Kimball, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Puthucheary et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouglé et al., 2016</xref>). However, clinical interventions with early mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denehy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morris et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tipping et al., 2017</xref>) and nutritional support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goossens et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hermans et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ogilvie and Larsson, 2014</xref>) have not improved long-term outcomes, and some studies even show negative effects of high protein delivery on muscle wasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Puthucheary et al., 2013</xref>). Beyond this key issue, muscle weakness is not always accompanied by muscle wasting: they are separate entities that should not be considered synonymously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schefold et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reid and Moylan, 2011</xref>). However, in future studies it would be of interest to expand our experimental model to include other factors that are common for patients in the ICU, such as corticosteroid treatment, immobilization, and mechanical ventilation, which may further impact recovery and potentially reproduce the phenomenon of long-term muscle wasting post-sepsis. Nonetheless, taken together our data suggest therapeutic targets beyond muscle wasting are more likely to improve post-sepsis muscle weakness.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that mitochondrial damage may be a key driver of chronic muscle weakness in murine sepsis survivors. Healthy mitochondria are critical for efficient muscle function, an ATP-dependent process. Skeletal muscles are mitochondrial dense and heavy oxygen consumers and thus greatly susceptible to damage during hypoxic conditions, including sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Using transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrate that mitochondria in sepsis survivors have striking morphological abnormalities, including absent or fragmented cristae, enlarged matrix spaces, vacuolar/compartmentalized structures, and concentric ‘onion-like’ swirling cristae. Notably, the IMF mitochondria, which are primarily responsible for ATP production for muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hood, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Timpani et al., 2015</xref>), are more significantly damaged than SS mitochondria. As has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vincent et al., 2016</xref>), mitochondrial structure and function are tightly linked; thus, derangements are associated with profound physiological implications. The loss of inner mitochondrial membrane (where oxidative phosphorylation occurs), as well as the abnormal presence of concentric/swirling cristae likely cause reduced bioenergetics in the post-sepsis condition.</p><p>Indeed we demonstrate that mitochondrial bioenergetics are impaired in murine sepsis survivors long after sepsis itself is resolved as shown using respiration analysis on isolated mitochondria and complex enzyme activity analyses on whole tissue. We also unexpectedly found that in some myofibers there are areas devoid of any functional mitochondrial enzyme activity, where mitochondria are not capable of converting energy substrates to detectable levels. Measuring glycolytic rates and TCA cycle flux may increase our understanding of mitochondrial bioenergetics in the post-sepsis condition which may be assessed using a metabolomics approach in future studies. As muscle contraction is dependent on ATP for cross-bridge cycling, one can conclude that such mitochondrial impairments would contribute to reduced muscle contraction. It is important to note that accumulation of such grossly damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria in middle-aged sepsis survivors is likely perpetuated by the fact that mitophagy decreases during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jang et al., 2018</xref>). We are currently investigating mitophagy and mitochondrial turnover in murine sepsis survivors to observe if reduced mitophagy and/or biogenesis contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><p>Damaged mitochondria not only result in reduced ATP synthesis, but also in increased oxidative stress. As a byproduct of oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria generate superoxide anions and nitric oxide. Mitochondrial damage, especially to complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castello et al., 2006</xref>), triggers persistent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balaban et al., 2005</xref>). Previous studies have shown that sarcomeric proteins, including tropomyosin, actin, and creatine kinase, scavenge free radicals during oxidative stress which causes post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fedorova et al., 2009</xref>). We observed significant oxidative and nitro-oxidative damage in the muscle homogenates from sepsis survivors. Importantly, these oxidative modifications are irreversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai and Yan, 2013</xref>) and require protein turnover for elimination. As oxidative stress has been shown to directly cause muscle fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shindoh et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reid, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stasko et al., 2013</xref>), our data suggest that persistent oxidative stress in the post-sepsis condition likely contributes to chronic muscle weakness. Moreover, the ROS and RNS secreted as a result of sepsis-induced mitochondrial damage then likely propagate mitochondrial dysfunction and energy failure through inhibition of the electron transport chain, thus acting as a vicious cycle of damage and functional decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harman, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandt et al., 2017</xref>). Future proteomic analyses would allow us to further elucidate mechanisms of mitochondrial and sarcomeric protein damage, as well as uncover many other pathways of interest that may underlie chronic muscle weakness after critical illness. This is likely multiphasic due to different mechanisms during the acute and chronic state, and influenced by age, and thus requires careful investigation.</p><p>In summary, the present study demonstrates that profound weakness is present in the skeletal muscle of murine sepsis survivors and that such muscle weakness is not attributed to loss of muscle quantity alone, but rather is characterized by impaired quality on the mitochondrial and myofibrillar levels. Significant mitochondrial damage and dysfunction, as well as marked oxidative damage to skeletal muscle proteins, together likely contribute to chronic muscle weakness in sepsis survivors. We propose that mitochondrial dysfunction is central to other altered muscle physiology in the post-sepsis state, such as redox balance, calcium homeostasis, repressed autophagy, and mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, altogether largely contributing to post-sepsis muscle weakness. This work provides strong evidence that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring mitochondrial health, in addition to restoring muscle mass, will likely allow survivors to regain strength and improve quality of life after sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic Reagent (<italic>M. musculus;

Fat and lean mass were also monitored using EchoMRI Body Composition Analyzer (EchoMRI LLC, Houston, TX, USA) in a select group. Sepsis survivors were euthanized as previously described on days 4, 2 weeks (days 14–15), and 1 month (days 28–31) following CS injection along with non-sepsis controls as follows. Animals were anesthetized by inhalation of 5% isoflurane, and were maintained under 2.5% as a laparotomy was performed and blood was collected from the inferior vena cava (IVC) with a syringe containing 10% vol of 0.1M sodium citrate, and the IVC was cut to ensure exsanguination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Pair-feeding</title><p>Mice were singly housed and baseline food consumption was monitored daily at the same time of day for 5 days, and for 2 weeks after cecal slurry injection.

In another experiment, systemic inflammation was assessed by measuring IL-6 in plasma samples obtained from animals sacrificed on day 4 and 2 weeks alongside non-sepsis controls using a high sensitivity ELISA kit (eBIOSCIENCE, Vienna, Austria). TNFα and IL-10 were assessed in non-sepsis controls and animals with sepsis on day 4 and 2 weeks (in the same mice) using Meso Scale Discovery (Rockville, Maryland) customized V-PLEX multiplex assay.

The concentration of the RNA was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm using a NanoDrop ONE microvolume spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE), and integrity was confirmed through visualization of 18S and 28S RNA bands using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Equivalent amounts of RNA were reverse transcribed into complementary DNA using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. TaqMan assays were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific and the quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed on a QuantStudio 3 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Target gene expression was normalized to hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) expression as an endogenous control, and fold change was calculated as 2-(ΔΔCT), using the mean ΔCT of the Control group as a calibrator. TaqMan assays used were Mm00446190_m1, Mm00443258_m1, Mm01288386_m1, and Mm03024075_m1 for IL-6.

The muscle bath was continuously oxygenated while the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) was dissected using a microscope, and tethers were placed on the proximal and distal tendons using braided silk suture (4-0). The muscle was freed from the leg, and mounted by attaching the tether at the distal end to a fixed hook and the proximal end to the lever arm of an ASI 300C‐LR Aurora Scientific transducer system (Aurora, Ontario, Canada). The muscle was positioned between platinum electrodes and suspended in a temperature-controlled (25°C) chamber containing the Krebs-Ringer solution which was continually oxygenated, and allowed to acclimate for 5 min. Using an Aurora stimulator (model 701C), the muscle was subjected to electrical field stimulation, and resulting force output was recorded using ASI 610A Dynamic Muscle Control software. The optimum length (Lo) was found by adjusting the EDL length to maximum twitch force (1 Hz stimulation), which was measured using digital calipers. Maintaining the muscle at Lo, the force-frequency relationship was elucidated using stimulus frequencies of 1, 15, 30, 50, 80, 150, and 250 Hz (note that 250 Hz stimulations were most appropriate for maximum force production for the middle aged mice used in these studies, whereas 300 Hz stimulations are commonly used when using young animals). When the protocol was complete, the muscle was transferred from the apparatus to a muscle bath where the suture tethers where carefully removed, then the muscle was weighed. The tissue length and weight were then used to calculate the physiological cross-sectional area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brooks and Faulkner, 1988</xref>) which was used to normalize force outputs (specific force).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunohistochemistry and histochemistry</title><p>Upon euthanasia, hind-limb muscles were carefully dissected, embedded in a thin layer of optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium, pinned at resting length to cork board, and immersed in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane.

Secondary antibody incubation included 1:250 anti-mouse IgG2b conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 (#A21242), 1:500 anti-mouse IgG1 conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (#A21121), and 1:250 anti-mouse IgM conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 (#A21426), all from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA), for 1 hr at room temperature. Sections were post-fixed with methanol (5 min), and mounted with vector shield mounting media (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA). Entire muscle cross-sections were imaged using the tiles feature within Zeiss Zen Blue software interfaced with an AxioImager M1 upright fluorescent microscope (Göttingen, Germany) which is semi-automated. Fibers were assigned as type I, IIa, and IIb depending on intensity within the Cy5, FITC, or Texas Red channels, respectively, and unstained fibers were assumed as type IIx fibers. Cross-sectional area was analyzed on whole cross-sections (medial head of the gastrocnemius and soleus) using an interactive semi-automated analysis program using blue ZEN software (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). Representative images (20X magnification) are shown.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Histochemical stains</title><p>The standard NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) histochemical staining protocol was followed. Briefly, thawed skeletal muscle cross-sections were incubated in 2.4 mM NADH and nitro-blue tetrazolium (NBT) in 0.5 M Tris buffer for 30 min at 37°C. Tissues were fixed using 10% phosphate buffered formalin, washed with a series of acetone solutions, and cover-slipped using aqueous mounting medium (Vecta Mount AQ). Similarly, the SDH (succinate dehydrogenase) staining protocol was followed in which sections were incubated in 100 mM sodium succinate salt and 1.2 mM NBT in 0.2 M phosphate buffer for 1 hr at 37°C. The sections were fixed, rinsed, washed with acetone solutions, and cover-slipped as the NADH staining procedure. The COX (Cytochrome c oxidase) staining protocol was performed in which sections were incubated with cytochrome c (1.1 mM; Sigma C-2506), 342 mM sucrose, 4.3 mM catalase, and DAB (Dako) in 0.05 M phosphate buffer for 1 hr at 37°C.

The muscle was minced in trypsin (0.25 mg/ml) before homogenizing on ice in 3 rounds of 5 s intervals (total of 15 s; motor-driven Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer), and a protease inhibitor cocktail was added to the tissue homogenates. Mitochondrial pellets were obtained through differential centrifugation steps at 4°C. The pellet was suspended in isolation buffer and subjected to protein estimation was performed (BCA protein assay kit, Thermo Scientific). It was previously shown that this method yields pure mitochondria being that the resulting fraction does not express transaminase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patel et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondrial respiration was assessed in terms of mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) using Seahorse Bioscience XF<sup>e</sup>24 extracellular flux analyzer, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gollihue et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sauerbeck et al., 2011</xref>).

Protein isolation buffer was comprised of 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, in 50 mM Tris base, and a protease inhibitor cocktail was added (Sigma). The muscle samples were homogenized using dounce homogenizers in approximately 20 volumes (w/v) of isolation buffer. The homogenates were transferred to Eppendorf tubes, and heated (80°C water bath for five minutes), centrifuged (12,000 g for 10 min at room temperature), and the resulting supernatant was collected. The protein concentration of the samples was evaluated using the Bio-Rad <italic>RC DC</italic> assay (Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.</p><p>The control and post-sepsis skeletal muscle protein isolates (20 µg loading protein) were resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (Bio-Rad Mini Protean Tetra Cell system) using TGX stain-free gradient (4–20%) gels, total protein was visualized using stain-free technology (ChemiDoc MP imaging system), and proteins were electrophoretically transferred (Bio-Rad Trans-blot Turbo Transfer System) to polyvinylidene difluoride (pvdf) membranes. Protein carbonyls were evaluated using the OxyBlot kit (EMD Millipore Corp, Billerica, MA, USA) by following the standard protocol with the minor adjustment of incubating in the primary antibody overnight (4°C). For 3-nitrotyrosine, the membranes were blocked for 1 hr in 5% milk at room temperature, and incubated in 1:3,000 3-nitrotyrosine primary antibody (Abcam #ab61392 in 5% milk) overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibody incubation (1:10,000 Santa Cruz #SC2005) was conducted for 1 hr at room temperature, and detected by chemiluminesce (Bio-Rad Clarity Western ECL Substrate).

This was not always achieved due to variation in sepsis survival rates. Due to feasibility, <italic>n</italic> = 3 per group were used for transmission electron microscopy observation. Although underpowered, differences were still observed after post-hoc and small sample size corrections were performed, where appropriate, as detailed above.</p><p>Throughout the study, a <italic>p</italic>-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.

significant advance in understanding the longer term effects of sepsis on muscle weakness and points to changes in muscle mitochondrial structure and function as a residual effect of a major acute insult. The previous challenge in modeling mouse models for chronic sepsis has been the issue of long term survival. Your cecal slurry and antibiotics model insures longer term survival of mice and allows a clearer delineation of muscle structure after muscle mass restoration. In your paper, your group clearly demonstrate altered mitochondrial structure, electron chain dysfunction, impaired respiration and oxidative damage in muscle despite restoration of muscle mass. Importantly, you are able to demonstrate these changes are not nutritionally mediated with paired feeding. As such these data have translational implications for understanding muscle weakness, and long term morbidity, after serious acute ICU-illnesses. This paper should open the door to more comprehensive studies for our understanding of mitochondrial dysfunction after major stress. As such there are important translational implications.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Chronic muscle weakness and mitochondrial dysfunction in the absence of sustained atrophy in a preclinical sepsis model&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Clifford Rosen as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Edward Sherwood (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Overall there is general agreement that the sepsis model developed in your manuscript provides new insights into sepsis related mitochondrial dysfunction. The experiments are well done and the conclusions appropriate. However there are several concerns which limit enthusiasm and must be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Food intake was not reported among the mice, yet might be a critical factor in the changes related to mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><p>2) The underlying mechanism(s) are not clarified and an unbiased approach using RNAseq or proteomics might provide clues and we would request more information.</p><p>3) The mitochondrial bioenergetics are lacking some critical data – what about glycolytic rates? Were flux studies performed? These need to be included.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The paper by Owen and colleagues examines muscle function and energetics in septic mice. The authors created a clinically relevant model of sepsis survival using intraperitoneal cecal slurry injection and resuscitation with fluids and antibiotics. The authors report that surviving mice had significant weakness and muscle dysfunction associated with impaired mitochondrial function. This is a well done experimental study that addresses a clinically important problem and provides mechanistic insight.</p><p>Overall, this is a nicely done study that provides evidence of muscle mitochondrial dysfunction in sepsis survivors. The paper left me wanting more information about glucose uptake, glycolytic rate and TCA cycle flux. It also leaves me wondering about the mechanisms of mitochondrial injury and the level of mitophagy. Nevertheless, this is a well done preliminary study that the authors will hopefully build upon in future work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Owen et al. addresses a clinically significant problem of reduced function and high morbidity in patients who survive sepsis. This problem is understudied relative to the disease burden. This manuscript is an excellent, foundational study that documents the muscle phenotype in a mouse model of sepsis. The strengths of the study include the use of a reproducible model of sepsis survival, the use of appropriate controls, the use of adult mice (16 months), the characterization of both males and females, and the use of gold standard analytical procedures to measure muscle endpoints. The manuscript is well-written, the methods are well-described, and the authors are to be commended on an important contribution to the literature.</p><p>In their investigation, the authors find reduction of muscle force, but not muscle mass at 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of sepsis. They demonstrate reduced mitochondrial respiration, ultra-structural defects, reduced mitochondrial enzymatic activity, and evidence of oxidative damage. This suggests the proximal cause of muscle weakness is mitochondrial dysfunction. All of this is a reasonable explanation for the sustained muscle dysfunction. There are no interventions or specific molecular mechanisms that are tested and implicated in this process, although sustained infection/inflammation is ruled out.</p><p>Some concerns and missed opportunities that could be addressed in the Discussion:</p><p>1) Reproducibility of the model in others' laboratories. Given that the microbiome can influence multiple endpoints and that this can be animal-facility specific, one wonders if a distant lab would be able to find the same survival curves and subsequent effects. Some discussion of this would be welcome.</p><p>2) While the model is a welcome addition to the literature and displays strengths as enumerated, the authors do not describe a plausible clinical scenario that it is intended to mimic, limiting significance.</p><p>3) The model does not reproduce the muscle wasting observed in post-sepsis/ICU patients. This might be useful experimentally but is a limitation.</p><p>4) The use of the term &quot;sepsis survivors&quot; in the Discussion elicits thoughts of patients. However, there are no human samples in the study; thus, the mechanism is still not generalizable to the experience of patients. This limitation should be addressed.</p><p>5) There are no data on pair feeding or food intake in these mice. It is formally possible that the effects on muscle are due to a period of starvation. This limitation should be addressed experimentally, if possible.</p><p>This is a suggestion and a hope:</p><p>6) An -omics approach of any sort – shotgun or targeted proteomics, RNAseq, etc. – could point to possible specific mechanisms dysregulating the mitochondria, would strengthen the impact and, if reported and deposited to GEO, would be a substantial contribution to the field. Such a contribution likely would enable others to query pathways of interest and thus would spark additional research using this model specifically and also more generally in the arena of sepsis-related muscle weakness/wasting.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49920.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Food intake was not reported among the mice, yet might be a critical factor in the changes related to mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><p>2) The underlying mechanism(s) are not clarified and an unbiased approach using RNAseq or proteomics might provide clues and we would request more information.</p><p>3) The mitochondrial bioenergetics are lacking some critical data – what about glycolytic rates?

Although it is important to investigate, these measurements require whole cells. A limitation of our study, we conducted seahorse measurements on isolated mitochondria from muscle tissue since isolation and use of whole muscle cells (i.e. myofibers) introduce several technical concerns (length of myofibers relative to the diameter of the assay well, obtaining a single cell suspension of cells of varying myofiber length, normalization challenges etc.). Using isolated mitochondria, we were not able to measure the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), as the reviewer is pointing towards. Important to note, we understand that assessing oxidative phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria does not fully reflect the physiological situation due to being outside of the natural cellular environment; thus, we also assessed mitochondrial enzyme activities in whole tissue using histochemical stains. With respect to assessments of glycolysis in the post-sepsis, we plan to conduct a metabolomics study and assess flux in tissue after feeding C13 labeled glucose. However due to the laborious nature of the experiments and large amounts of data to be produced, we were not able to include these data for the resubmission within the given period of time. We have included comments as such in the Discussion (sixth paragraph), and look forward to making this contribution to the field in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It also leaves me wondering about the mechanisms of mitochondrial injury and the level of mitophagy.</p></disp-quote><p>Likewise, we are interested in exploring the mechanisms of mitochondrial injury and investigating mitochondrial dynamics in terms of mitophagy and turnover. Although we have begun pilot experiments concerning these matters, these studies are rather complex due to (1) the multi-phasic nature of mitochondrial injury during the acute and chronic phases of sepsis pathogenesis, and (2) the added complication of using aged animals, which have impaired mitochondrial turnover. Thus, these issues will take a significant amount of time and resources to explore accurately. We are currently working on these experiments and aim to report on the mechanisms of mitochondrial injury and mitophagy as we build on the current work, to which we remark upon in the Discussion (sixth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Some concerns and missed opportunities that could be addressed in the Discussion:</p><p>1) Reproducibility of the model in others' laboratories. Given that the microbiome can influence multiple endpoints and that this can be animal-facility specific, one wonders if a distant lab would be able to find the same survival curves and subsequent effects. Some discussion of this would be welcome.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point, and we thank the reviewer for giving us the opportunity to remark upon the reproducibility of our animal model of sepsis with ICU-like resuscitation. We would first like to point out that the issue of reproducibility is not unique to our sepsis model, as it is likewise a concern for the commonly used CLP surgical model. In fact, one of the strong advantages of the cecal slurry model of sepsis is the reduction of the potential influence of microbiomes in the cases where different kinds of mice are studied (i.e. transgenic mice vs. wild type, different ages, different diets, or disease states) since one batch of cecal slurry is prepared and used among all experimental animals. However, to address the reviewer’s important point more specifically: we are currently aware of at least two labs at different institutions who have successfully made their own cecal slurry stocks, conducted dose response experiments, and compared survival between animals with and without intervention. One research laboratory at the University of California San Francisco achieved a strikingly similar ~75% survival rate with the therapeutic intervention strategy described. Further, they confirmed bacteremia in all mice at 12-hours (before therapeutic intervention), and similar rates of bacterial clearance during the resuscitation period. Likewise, a group at Vanderbilt University Medical Center adopted the model which they adapted to earlier therapeutic intervention windows (3- and 6h) to address their research question, which resulted in 100% and 80% survival, respectively. These findings are encouraging that this model is reproducible in other hands, and are hopeful that many labs will be able to adopt our model to address their research questions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the model is a welcome addition to the literature and displays strengths as enumerated, the authors do not describe a plausible clinical scenario that it is intended to mimic, limiting significance.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their kind remarks regarding our model, and apologize for not providing clarity regarding the clinical scenario that it is intended to mimic. We provide further explanation to this end in the revision, which can be found in the third paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The model does not reproduce the muscle wasting observed in post-sepsis/ICU patients. This might be useful experimentally but is a limitation.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, our model does not reproduce <italic>long-term</italic> muscle wasting as observed commonly in post-sepsis/ICU patients. It is first important to highlight that not all muscle weakness after hospital discharge is accompanied by muscle wasting, and these are separate issues that we suggest be considered independently. However, we recognize that atrophy is a common issue and primary concern in the post-ICU condition. We presume that a key reason this phenomenon is not reproduced in our model is the robustness of murine subjects, which become highly active very quickly even after serious illness, thus the state of bedrest is not incorporated in our model. Also, many sepsis patients are mechanically ventilated, preventing physical activity even further. It is our interest to expand our model further in the future to incorporate experimental procedures to further mimic the clinical setting, such as corticosteroid treatment, immobilization, and mechanical ventilation, and determine if this replicates the muscle wasting phenotype observed commonly in sepsis survivors. We have added remarks on this matter to the Discussion (fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The use of the term &quot;sepsis survivors&quot; in the Discussion elicits thoughts of patients. However, there are no human samples in the study; thus, the mechanism is still not generalizable to the experience of patients. This limitation should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for using the term “sepsis survivors” in the Discussion, implying the use of patient samples. Thank you for bringing this to our attention, we have edited the text to more accurately reflect the scope of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There are no data on pair feeding or food intake in these mice. It is formally possible that the effects on muscle are due to a period of starvation. This limitation should be addressed experimentally, if possible.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted an experiment to address this logical concern. First, we monitored daily food consumption of middle-aged mice (<italic>n</italic>=9) before and after inducing sepsis via our cecal slurry and resuscitation model. Five of the nine mice survived for 14-days, from which we averaged the daily food intake. Food consumption was dramatically reduced on the day of infection (11.08% of pre-sepsis food intake), which steadily increased to 75.51% by day 4, and returned to comparable consumption thereafter. Next, we restricted food intake of middle-aged non sepsis animals (n=5) to match the daily food consumption by the sepsis animals. Freely-fed non sepsis mice served as controls during the same period (<italic>n</italic>=5). Non-sepsis pair-fed mice unsurprisingly lost substantial body weight. After 14-days of pair-feeding, skeletal muscle tissue (<italic>tibialis anterior</italic>) was harvested, mitochondria was isolated, and mitochondrial respiration capacity was evaluated. The results show that oxygen consumption rate was similar among pair-fed and freely-fed control mice (new figure added: Figure 5—figure supplement 1). From these data, we confirmed that reduced food intake and weight loss during sepsis is not the underlying cause of long-term mitochondrial dysfunction in the murine sepsis survivors at this late time point (2 weeks).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is a suggestion and a hope:</p><p>6) An -omics approach of any sort – shotgun or targeted proteomics, RNAseq, etc. – could point to possible specific mechanisms dysregulating the mitochondria, would strengthen the impact and, if reported and deposited to GEO, would be a substantial contribution to the field. Such a contribution likely would enable others to query pathways of interest and thus would spark additional research using this model specifically and also more generally in the arena of sepsis-related muscle weakness/wasting.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that an -omics approach would provide many insights to the innumerable pathways which are sure to be affected in the murine sepsis survivors. However, with limited aged mice available to our lab during this revision period, and with two experiments required to address the above concern in point #1, we could not perform this set of studies this time. We have included this point in our future direction plan, which we remark upon in the Discussion (fourth paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
