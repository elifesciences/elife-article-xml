action that might lead to a better, or worse outcome. The sub-cortical nuclei that make up the basal ganglia have been proposed as a neural circuit that may contribute to resolving this explore-exploit ‘dilemma’. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of neuromodulating the basal ganglia’s output nucleus, the globus pallidus interna, in patients who had undergone deep brain stimulation (DBS) for isolated dystonia. Neuromodulation enhanced the number of exploratory choices to the lower value option in a two-armed bandit probabilistic reversal-learning task. Enhanced exploration was explained by a reduction in the rate of evidence accumulation (drift rate) in a reinforcement learning drift diffusion model. We estimated the functional connectivity profile between the stimulating DBS electrode and the rest of the brain using a normative functional connectome derived from heathy controls. Variation in the extent of neuromodulation induced exploration between patients was associated with functional connectivity from the stimulation electrode site to a distributed brain functional network. We conclude that the basal ganglia’s output nucleus, the globus pallidus interna, can adaptively modify decision choice when faced with the dilemma to explore or exploit.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>basal ganglia</kwd><kwd>deep brain stimulation</kwd><kwd>neuromodulation</kwd><kwd>globus pallidus interna</kwd><kwd>explore-exploit</kwd><kwd>drift diffusion model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000589</institution-id><institution>Chief Scientist Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilbertson</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NHS Tayside Movement disorders research Endowment Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilbertson</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013865</institution-id><institution>Stiftung Charité</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de A Marcelino</surname><given-names>Ana Luisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) exhibit that the excitability of the basal ganglia can govern the trade off between exploiting available resources or exploring alternative courses of action.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Flexible adaption of choice behaviour is crucial for decision-making when facing uncertainty. The balance between exploiting familiar options and exploring alternatives with potentially less favorable outcomes, represents a fundamental challenge of adaptive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mehlhorn et al., 2015</xref>). The neural basis of how humans resolve this dilemma has been advanced significantly over the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chakroun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>), but the specific contribution from sub-cortical nuclei that make up the basal ganglia (BG) remains poorly defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sheth et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To investigate how humans solve this conflict in reinforcement learning, so-called ‘bandit tasks’ have been used, where subjects choose between several options associated with different reward probabilities to maximise reward payoff. In a ‘reversal-learning’ paradigm, the reward probabilities change (i.e. reverse), thus subjects need to constantly evaluate whether choice feedback represents a reversal false alarm (i.e. a lower than expected outcome from the option with the highest reward probability) or a true reversal in the reward probabilities. Even in reversal-learning tasks with low levels of payout uncertainty, human participants make a significant number of choices to the lower value option, rather than the choice with the higher expected value. This leads to the observation of probability matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Herrnstein, 1970</xref>), where humans fail to maximise their payoff and adopt a sub-optimal policy which matches their response probabilities to that of the payoff probability. ‘Non-greedy’ choices, are by definition exploratory, as they are made to the option with the lower expected value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Daw et al., 2006</xref>). Conversely, ‘greedy’ choices are made to the option with the highest value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Findling and Wyart, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Costa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Izquierdo et al., 2017</xref>) and can be considered to exploit current knowledge of the values of the actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sutton and Barto, 2018</xref>). One possibility is that exploration represents a cognitive strategy for active information seeking, to reaffirm existing beliefs in the relative value of the choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Izquierdo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sutton and Barto, 2018</xref>). Alternatively, it may represent random choice perturbations caused by limitations in the brain’s implementation of the decision process leading to decision noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Findling et al., 2019</xref>). Either way, the strategies adopted by human participants performing bandit tasks, including reversal-learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Costa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Costa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Costa et al., 2014</xref>), rely on exploiting stability whilst at the same time adapting to volatility by exploring alternative courses of action.</p><p>Several observations support a role of the BG circuit in explore-exploit decisions. Computational circuit models of the BG predict that its principal function is action selection – the process where by one action (or decision) is selected over other competing alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gurney et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bogacz and Gurney, 2007</xref>). An extension of this action selection function is the proposal that it’s precision (i.e. how selective the circuit is) can be influenced by the overall excitability of the BG circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Suryanarayana et al., 2019</xref>). In the context of the explore-exploit dilemma, this means the BG may implement a neural ‘decision filter’, with the bandwidth of this filter being adjusted by neuromodulators, such as dopamine, which influence BG excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gilbertson and Steele, 2021</xref>). The same models also predict that the excitability of the basal ganglia’s principle output nucleus, the globus pallidus interna (GPI) should be a read-out of whether the BG are supporting an exploratory or exploitative decision strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Humphries et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chakravarthy et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with this prediction, the firing rate of GPI neurons in non-human primates encodes the transition from exploratory to exploitative decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sheth et al., 2011</xref>). Transient decreases in GPI firing observed during learning have been proposed as a potential source of decision variability and could therefore represent a neurophysiological correlate of exploratory (non-greedy) choices observed in bandit tasks.</p><p>At a cortical level, functional imaging (fMRI) supports a role for distinct pre-frontal cortical regions in reversal-learning including the orbito-frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hampshire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Remijnse et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cools et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ghahremani et al., 2010</xref>), ventromedial prefrontal (vmPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate (ACC) cortices. The same pre-frontal regions are also implicated in explore-exploit choices using (so-called ‘restless’) bandit tasks with high between-trial outcome volatility and associated choice uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chakroun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Daw et al., 2006</xref>). Analysis of brain activation patterns in these tasks support distinct cortical regions are involved in the different types of decisions. Consistent with their role within a valuation network, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chakroun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Daw et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Findling et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tomov et al., 2020</xref>) are activated during exploitative choices. In contrast, exploratory choices activate frontopolar cortex (FPC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex, commensurate with their proposed functions in the encoding of uncertainty, behavioural switching and cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rushworth and Behrens, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boorman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartolo and Averbeck, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hayden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shenhav et al., 2016</xref>). The striatum, as the BG input nucleus, receives afferents from these same pre-frontal cortical regions forming segregated cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits which respect the functional anatomy of distinct cortical circuits for explore-exploit decision making, thus serving as a point of convergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Draganski et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>To date, no study has directly addressed the hypothesised role of the GPI in the human approaches to resolving explore-exploit decisions during reversal-learning. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the GPI is routinely performed as a treatment for isolated generalised dystonia and also in patients with focal and segmental dystonia if botulinum toxin treatment fails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Volkmann et al., 2014</xref>). Dystonia is a movement disorder characterised by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal postures. In focal dystonia, it is restricted toone region such as the head or neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhatia et al., 2018</xref>). Patients with dystonia have normal levels of striatal dopamine, intact reward prediction error (RPE) signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gilbertson et al., 2019</xref>), and exhibit subtle cognitive biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Romano et al., 2014</xref>). These include abnormalities of reinforcement learning (RL) such as increased risk taking and delayed flexibility to changes in reward contingency reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gilbertson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arkadir et al., 2016</xref>). With the caveat of these disease specific RL abnormalities in mind, dystonia patients with chronically implanted DBS-GPI electrodes represent a unique opportunity to test the influence of the GPI and, in turn, as its principle output nucleus, the basal ganglia’s role in explore-exploit decision making in humans.</p><p>Our working hypothesis was that neuromodulation of the excitability of GPI neurons would modify explore-exploit decisions in a reversal-learning task. As DBS suppresses firing rates in human GPI neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cleary et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">LafreniereRoula et al., 2010</xref>), we hypothesised that DBS-mediated reduced GPI excitability should drive greater proportion of exploratory choices consistent with previous findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sheth et al., 2011</xref>. To test this hypothesis, we examined choice behaviour in patients with chronically implanted DBS electrodes in both ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ stimulation whilst they executed a two-armed bandit reversal-learning task. Given the more recognised role of the BG in habitual learning of stimulus-response associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Piron et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Redgrave et al., 2010</xref>), we purposely chose a low volatility probabilistic reversal-learning task to engage cortico-sub-cortical circuits in ‘model-free’ learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Daw et al., 2011</xref>). Our choice of this task was also aimed at isolating the specific contribution of the GPI to random exploration. This form of exploration is more closely aligned with the sub-optimal, non-greedy choices identified during pauses in GPI firing in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sheth et al., 2011</xref>). Exploration can also be ‘directed’ to the option which strategically aims to minimise uncertainty about a choice that a decision maker has least familiarity with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chakroun et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, directed exploration relies upon brain regions that encode working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boorman et al., 2009</xref>) and circuits including the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) which contribute to active information seeking to resolve uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">White et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>By fitting a model of the decision-making process (Reinforcement Learning Drift Diffusion Model: RLDDM), we aimed to test further mechanistic hypotheses regarding latent cognitive effects of DBS neuromodulation on GPI choice arbitration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>). The RLDDM incorporates both decision choices and decision time (DT) information, thus affording a richer interpretation of the mechanisms underlying choice compared to more traditional reinforcement learning models.</p><p>We further hypothesised that the influence of GPI-DBS neuromodulation in decision-making should be dependent on the connectivity of the stimulated site with cortical areas implicated in explore–exploit choice behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Eighteen patients with isolated dystonia (for clinical details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) who had chronically implanted DBS electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) targeted at the globus pallidus interna (GPI) performed a reversal-learning task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B&amp;C</xref>). The patients were instructed to try and win as many ‘vouchers’ as possible throughout the duration of the task by choosing one of two options presented to them on a computer screen. Patients were tested with their DBS device turned ‘ON’ or ‘OFF’ in a randomised order between the two task blocks. Each block consisted of three, 40-trial sessions where the probability associated with winning a ‘voucher’ switched from 80%:20% to 20%:80% midway through the second session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Participants performed two versions of this task separated by an interval of 20 min after the initially randomised DBS condition (ON or OFF) had been inverted. The patient’s performance was compared with a group of 18 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) performing task block 1. The two blocks differed only by the fractals presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Weighted-sum of overlap between the heat-map and the GPI is 1556.5, while that with the GPe is 376.5. The weighted-sum GPi/GPe ratio of overlap is 4.13, which means that GPi is being stimulated ~4 times more frequently than GPe in our cohort. The maximal overlap value in the heat-map is 10 which is less than patients’ number (n=14). This is because of the fact that the heat-map distribution is governed by spatial heterogeneity of the stimulation volumes and their geometrical configuration.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79642-fig1-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><sec id="s2-1"><title>GPI DBS enhances exploratory choices without affecting task performance</title><p>A fixed effects analysis of performance (number of vouchers won) was conducted, using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with stimulation state (ON-DBS versus OFF-DBS) and task session as fixed factors.

This categorisation relies on estimates of the expected values of the available two options for low-value, exploratory choices to be defined. To identify these, we fitted the patients’ choices and DT’s using the RLDDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>). This model represents a fusion of two traditionally separate models which combine the process of iterative updating the value of expectations (Q-value <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) using the delta learning rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rescorla, 1972</xref>) with a choice rule (substituted for the traditional softmax) based on the sequential sampling mechanism of the Drift Diffusion Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ratcliff, 1978</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Reinforcement Learning Drift Diffusion Model (RLDDM).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The accumulation of evidence begins at a starting point at 0.

A fixed effects analysis of P(Explore), was performed using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with stimulation state (ON-DBS versus OFF-DBS) and task session as fixed factors. This demonstrated main effects of session (F(2,34) = 3.14, p=0.04) and DBS state (F(1,34) = 4.64, p=0.03) but no interaction between DBS state and the session of the task on the degree of exploration F(2,34) = 0.77, p=0.46.

To address this, we re-analysed the P(Explore) across twelve 10-trial bins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). A fixed effects analysis of P(Explore) was performed using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with stimulation state (ON-DBS versus OFF-DBS) and task bin as fixed factors. This demonstrated main effect of bin (F(11, 187)=5.26, p&lt;0.001), consistent with increased P(Explore) as an effect of contingency reversal and enhanced P(Explore) values in the ON-DBS state (F(1,187) = 9.84, p=0.001). Despite this, there was no interaction between DBS state and a specific bin of the task on the degree of exploration (F(11,187) = 0.51, p=0.89). In view of the marked increase in P(Explore) in the post-reversal bins 7–12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we also analysed the binned P(Explore) values with a fixed effect of reversal, allowing comparison of the P(Explore) values within pre-reversal bins (1-6) with those post-reversal (7-12). This demonstrated a main effect of reversal on the P(Explore) values (F(1,187) = 27.4, p&lt;0.001), a main effect of DBS state (F(1,187) = 9.35, p=0.002), but no interaction between DBS state and reversal (F(1,187) = 2.54, p=0.11). The mean P(Explore) value in each 10 trial bin in the ON-DBS state was 0.2±0.04 and 0.14±0.05 in the OFF-DBS condition.</p><p>We defined the probability of a reward, P(Reward), as the number of rewards obtained in a 10-trial bin divided by the number of responses, to assess the performance in the task on a finer time scale. This was used rather than the absolute number of rewards (as used in the analysis of session performance above) as it was a more accurate measure of performance in a small trial bin as missed trials were accounted for. Using P(Reward) for each subject at each bin, we found no main effect of DBS (F(1,187) = 1.88, p=0.17), or interaction between the DBS and the task bin (F(11,187) = 0.74, p=0.7). Again, this analysis confirmed that enhanced exploratory choices in the ON-DBS state were not associated with degradation in the ability of the patients to aquire rewards during the task (mean P(Reward) values ON-DBS were 0.63±0.04 and 0.65±0.04 OFF-DBS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To place the effects of DBS in our patients into the context of known abnormal reinforcement learning behaviour in isolated dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gilbertson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gilbertson et al., 2020</xref>), we compared the binned P(Explore) values of the HC group, to those of the patients in the OFF-DBS condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The probability of the HC group making an exploratory choice was greater than the patients in the OFF-DBS condition (mean HC P(Explore)=0.19 ± 0.05), confirmed by a main effect of group (F(1,341) = 7.34, p=0.005). By contrast, there was no difference in the HC P(Explore) values when these where compared to the ON-DBS (F(1,385) = 1.1, p=0.3) and no effect of dystonia on the overall performance of the task, as P(reward) values in the HC group were the similar (HC; mean P(Reward)=0.63 ± 0.03) to those of the patients in the OFF-DBS condition (F(1,341) = 2.48,=0.2). Overall, this analysis supported that GPI-DBS enhances exploratory choices in dystonia patients from a disease related baseline level of exploitation that is higher than age matched controls.</p><p>Finally, to ensure that the order of the two reversal tasks performed OFF and ON-DBS did not contribute in any way to this result, we ran a fixed effects analysis of P(Explore) across the three sessions with stimulation state (ON-DBS versus OFF-DBS) and task order as fixed factors. No main effect of task order on P(Explore) was evident from this analysis F(1,34) = 0.02, p=0.87, therefore, the enhanced exploration ON-DBS was unrelated to whether the first of the two reversal tasks were performed with DBS stimulator switched ON or OFF.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cortical functional connectivity correlates of the effect of DBS on exploration</title><p>When the DBS enhancing effects on exploratory choices on an individual subject level was investigated, this varied from a maximum within session increase of P(Explore) of 0.34, equating to 14 additional exploratory choices out of 40 in one subject, to no influence of DBS on exploration in any session in another. We leveraged the known influence of DBS on brain networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Horn et al., 2017</xref>) to test the hypothesis that this variance could be explained by individual differences in connectivity of the DBS electrode with cortical regions which correlated strongly with exploratory decisions.</p><p>The connectivity analysis was performed based on established methodology previously introduced to assess brain networks affected by distributed lesions or stimulation effects in neurological and psychiatric conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Corp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Almeida Marcelino et al., 2019</xref>).

This aimed to minimise the effect of averaging this behaviour across the task as a whole, whilst allowing for individual differences in the effect of DBS across different sessions of the task not evident at a group level from the analysis of P(Explore).

In turn, this meant that in both the HC group and in the patients in the ON-DBS condition, the decision to choose one of the two options in each trial was much less influenced by encoding of their value. Accordingly, choices were influenced proportionately more by noise intrinsic to the decision process, resulting in greater proportion of random, exploratory, (and accordingly less greedy, exploitative) choices.

Motor cortex activity correlates negatively with decision value during explore-exploit decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tomov et al., 2020</xref>). This means that within a sequential sampling decision mechanism, increased motor cortex activity correlates with small differences in the value of the two choices and corresponding higher decision uncertainty and choice exploration. This was indeed the effect predicted by the RLDDM in the ON-DBS state. A reduction in the drift-rate scaling parameter (m) has a corresponding effect on decision value as this parameter multiplies the difference in expected value in the two choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>). The exploratory influence of pallidal DBS could therefore be explained by thalamocortical disinhibition, increased motor cortex excitability and its activity inversely encoding decision value.</p><p>Alternatively, rather than an influence on a downstream cortical decision mechanism, GPI-DBS may have influenced implementation of this process <italic>within</italic> the BG circuit.

We found that GPI-DBS reduced the drift rate scaling parameter during the post-reversal phase of the task. As this parameter determines the rate of evidence accumulation, our results would be consistent with this predicted function of the direct pathway being neuromodulated by pallidal DBS. However, because the GPI sits anatomically at the point of convergence of both direct and indirect pathways, we cannot distinguish this mechanism from a downstream influence on thalamo-cortical excitability. Future studies examining neuromodulation of a basal ganglia nucleus that lies within the indirect pathway, such as the subthalamic nucleus (STN), could be used to delineate this mechanism further, as this might be predicted to selectively influence the RLDDM boundary separation parameter which determines the decision threshold.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The basal ganglia’s role in reinforcement learning (information seeking vs. uncertainty)</title><p>During the early stages of learning, firing rates of GPI neurons show transient inhibitory pauses in firing rate which encode exploratory choices. These are replaced with higher firing rates as choices become habitual and stimulus response mapping is obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sheth et al., 2011</xref>). These findings are consistent with physiological changes in the direct and indirect pathways during different stages of learning. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yin et al., 2009</xref>) identified increased excitability in the striato-nigral (D1R-expressing) direct pathway early in learning with corresponding inhibition of the GPI. With subsequent consolidation of learning and habituation of the stimulus response relationship, D2R dependent increases in striato-pallidal excitability would dis-inhibit the GPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kravitz et al., 2010</xref>), increasing its excitability and promoting exploitation. Recent data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lee and Sabatini, 2021</xref> would however contradict this interpretation as they found exploration increased in optogenetically stimulated indirect pathway striato-pallidal neurons. This discrepancy might be explained by careful distinction between basal ganglia contributions to actively promoting exploratory choices during learning, versus active inhibition of choices from negative outcomes, that may be more relevant to choice extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tecuapetla et al., 2016</xref>) and shifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kravitz et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>An alternative explanation (to the idea of active exploratory information seeking) is that enhanced non-greedy choices ON-DBS represent increased random variability in the update of action values due to computational noise inherent to the learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Findling and Wyart, 2021</xref>). Examining the effects of GPI-DBS in a non-stationary ‘restless’ bandit task could delineate the contribution of decision noise as these models that take noise into account of the decision process have been successfully fitted to such tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Findling et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The basal ganglia’s role in reinforcement learning (learning from previous outcomes)</title><p>We found no effect of DBS on the learning rate to either positive or negative outcomes in the task. This is surprising given evidence from Local Field Potential (LFP) recordings from GPI-DBS electrodes which demonstrate that these encode choice outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Eisinger et al., 2022</xref>). Reward Prediction Error (RPE) encoding in LFP’s from GPI electrodes have also been identified and are most marked during exploratory decisions and absent when choices are exploitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schroll et al., 2015</xref>). Pallidal error-related activity has been identified from LFP recordings. This proceeds the cortical error-related negativity (ERN), which is, in turn, closely related to the negative prediction error signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Herrojo Ruiz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Holroyd et al., 2003</xref>). A plausible a priori mechanism for increased exploration would be DBS induced blunting of these learning signals. The absence of any effect of DBS on the RLDDM learning rate parameters results would suggest that outcome signalling including RPE-like and ERN signals in the GPI are relatively unaffected by DBS. Therefore, rather than modify intrinsic encoding of RPE-like signals or through distal connections with other brainstem structures, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hong and Hikosaka, 2008</xref>) DBS enhanced exploration appears to be mediated by a neuromodulation of the decision process, consistent with theoretical accounts proposing the basal ganglia’s excitability as an arbitrator of action selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gilbertson and Steele, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Humphries et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dunovan et al., 2019</xref>).An equally parsimonious explanation for the absence of any impact of DBS on the learning rate, is that by targeting of the (dorsal) motor segment of GPI, there was no effect on the excitability of the ventrally located GPI – lateral habenula pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hong and Hikosaka, 2008</xref>) which facilitates negative prediction error signalling in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Integrating the results in a network perspective</title><p>The postero-lateral portion of the GPI targeted in the group of patients studied here is chosen in routine clinical practice because of its position within the sensorimotor loop of the basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 1986</xref>) to relieve motor symptoms of dystonia. It is noteworthy that despite evidence for anatomically segmented regions of the GPI (based on white matter connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Draganski et al., 2008</xref>) stimulating the sensorimotor pallidum in this study could alter decision-making and therefore modify ‘cognitive’ function. At first glance, this result might appear incongruous with its established role in motor control. However, our functional connectivity analysis supports the conclusion that sensorimotor GPI function extends beyond that traditionally attributed to it on the basis of anatomical connections. The finding of a neuromodulatory influence of sensorimotor pallidum on decision-making is consistent with fMRI activation of pre-and post-central gyri, during exploratory choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chakroun et al., 2020</xref>) and the encoding of decision value by motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hare et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our connectivity analysis is noteworthy for the extent of the connectivity pattern across much of the brain. The largest within session effect of DBS was seen in patients where the electrode stimulation volume shared connectivity with brain regions which would be considered functionally relevant to our task (e.g. pre-frontal regions). Equally, this connectivity profile included regions with little to no recognised functional role in reward-reversal learning. Therefore, caution is required in interpreting the anatomical detail of this network given the limitations of using imaging data with no individualised anatomical specificity. On a more general level, this analysis provides support to the idea that discrete functions in local brain networks (in our case the GPI), are integrated into a broader scale whole-brain network. This leads to co-variation in neural activity between regions which are not conventionally attributed a functional role in a specific motor or sensory act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kauvar et al., 2020</xref>) and might explain how DBS exerts influence on remote areas beyond the stimulation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Horn et al., 2017</xref>).

In the ON-DBS state, heightened exploratory choices observed in our data would lead to poorer encoding of the difference in value of decisions and incentivise only actions which lead to large differences in expected outcomes. This assumes that the mechanism of DBSinduced apathy is analogous to apathy acquired from lesions of the bilateral globus pallidus, where the basal ganglias output is nullified, and a decrease in the signal to noise ratio that encodes value to incentivise action has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Levy and Dubois, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Study limitations</title><p>Patients with primary forms of dystonia who have not undergone DBS exhibit abnormal reinforcement learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gilbertson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arkadir et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gilbertson et al., 2020</xref>).

It seems likely that the observed enhancement of exploration by pallidal neuromodulation of GPI is from a high level of exploitaiton that is intrinsic to an imbalanced basal ganglia circuit related to the disease process in dystonia patients. We therefore cannot discount the possibility that DBS enhanced exploration was a consequence of neuromodulating a pathologically biased decision making circuit.

The task was presented on a laptop screen using Psychtoolbox v3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brainard and Vision, 1997</xref>) running on MATLAB (R2019, The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The laptop was positioned in front of the patient so that responses could be made on the keyboard. Participants were instructed to try to win as many ‘vouchers’ as possible. Printed screen text was in German. At the beginning of each trial, a fixation cross presented at the centre of the screen indicated that a new trial had begun. A pair of fractal images were presented and subjects were expected to indicate their choice by a keyboard button press. The order of the fractals was randomly assigned to either the right or left of the fixation cross. In the event that they did not make a response within 3 s the fixation cross was re-presented and a new trial began. A choice was highlighted for 0.5 s by a red circle around the chosen fractal. The choice screen was followed by feedback screen for a further 1 s. Feedback consisted of either – ‘you win’ or a neutral feedback condition with a screen with the words ‘nothing’. Patients performed three sessions of 40 trials with 3–4 min breaks between sessions to improve task compliance. The visual stimuli were associated with a fixed probability of rewarding outcome of 80:20%. Reward contingencies were reversed after 60 trial presentations (i.e. the image associated with a 80% reward probability in the first 60 trials was associated with 20% reward probability in the last 60 trials and vice-versa). Participants were not informed about the existence of a contingency reversal. A short training session of 10 trials with a novel pair of fractals was performed before formal testing began to familiarise the patients with the task.</p><p>The initial DBS condition was randomised. Patients repeated the same task OFF-DBS in the opposite DBS state after a 20 min break. The fractal images differed between both task versions to avoid learning effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Reinforcement learning drift diffusion model</title><p>The RLDDM model consists of a hybrid of the sequential sampling model choice rule based on the DDM with the drift rate, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> modified by the difference in the expected values of the two choices.

Stimulation volume modelling was informed by DBS parameters used to control patients’ symptoms during behavioural task (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Then, voxel-wise correlations of individual connectivity to DBS-induced changes in the probability of exploring the lower value choice ‘P(Explore)’ were calculated and visualised as R-maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) after thresholding R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Horn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Almeida Marcelino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Neumann et al., 2018</xref>). The DBS induced change in P(Explore) was defined as the maximum increase in P(Explore) ON-DBS minus P(Explore) OFF-DBS in one of the three sessions. The similarity between the ‘ideal’ connectivity profile of this R-map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and the connectivity profile of each individual patient was mathematically assessed by calculating spatial correlation coefficients between the R-map and the individual non-behavioural connectivity maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Horn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">AlFatly et al., 2019</xref>).

A permutation distribution was constructed from the same analysis performed 1000 times and the correlation coefficient re-estimated with the P(Explore) values for each subject randomly re-ordered.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Generating a heat-map of stimulation volumes</title><p>This section describes a method to highlight the subcortical cluster stimulated by most of stimulation volumes in our cohort and its relation to GPi/GPe nuclei (extracted from the DISTAL atlas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ewert et al., 2018</xref>). This is important to explore the extent of stimulation and possible differential modulation of the basal ganglia nuclei in the vicinity of the stimulated area. The DISTAL atlas is a probabilistic atlas (which means it offers voxel-wise probability that a voxel is belonging to a specific structure). Therefore, we first thresholded bilateral GPi and GPe images to include only voxels with 50% probability of belonging to the GPi or the GPe and extracted binary masks of them. Later, stimulation volumes were extracted and saved as binary Nifty images as has been described in the main manuscript method section. We then overlapped all binary stimulation volumes (n=14) to extract a total stimulation volume representative of the full cohort. The latter has been explored and depicted as a 3D volume in relation to the GPi/GPe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) to visualise the extent of overlap with each of these structures. Next, we summed up the number of stimulation volumes contributing to each voxel in the total stimulation volume. This helped extracting an n-map (or heat-map) which can illustrate the frequency with which each voxel is being stimulated by stimulation volumes in the cohort. As a final step, we have calculated the extent of overlap between the heat-map and the GPi or GPe nuclei as the weighted sum of overlapping voxels. This means that we summed the values of the heat-map intersecting voxels with the binary mask of each of GPi or GPe nucleus. The latter method ensures that the voxel-wise frequency information would not be lost compared to simple binary sum of the overlap of total stimulation volume with GPi/GPe binary masks. All analyses mentioned in this section were performed in a grid of 0.5×0.5 × 0.5 mm resolution using bihemispheric information in respect of GPi/GPe or stimulation volumes (since all patients have been bilaterally stimulated).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavioural data analysis</title><p>Prior to statistical analyses, trials without responses (errors of omission) were excluded ON-DBS mean 1.06±2.26 (range 0–8) trials, OFF-DBS 1.78±2.5 (range 0–7 trials).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Generalizability:</p><p>Studying dystonia patients gives the unique opportunity to study the effects of electrical pallidal stimulation on decision-making in humans and given that dystonia primarily affects movements rather than cognition/decision-making this might also well be representative of healthy people. This (i.e. the similarity between task performance of patients and healthy people) is, however, not demonstrated in this study. In the introduction, the authors state that reward prediction error is intact in dystonic patients, but the paper that they cite for this (ref 34) is titled '… abnormal reward learning in cervical dystonia'. Furthermore, albeit clearly less pronounced than movement symptoms cognitive problems are present in dystonia patients (see Jahanshahi 2017 Movement Disorders). I would therefore recommend enrolling a healthy control group allowing to compare DBS ON and DBS OFF to healthy people.</p><p>2) Statistics:</p><p>I understand that Bayesian statistics cannot always directly be compared to non-Bayesian frequentist statistics. However, to me, the frequentist and Bayesian statistics are not consistent in this study. ANOVAs, etc are applied on subject-averages data using a p-value of 0.05 to distinguish between significant vs. non-significant results. In the Bayesian modelling analysis, the 95% HDI is computed. While this number is arbitrary (just as a p-value of 0.05) it still has a rationale to it given that in the scientific community 95% is also used for frequentist confidence intervals. Therefore, I think that 95% would be the most consistent choice here. However, none of the model parameters differ between ON vs. OFF regarding the 95% HDIs, since they overlap with 0 (see 'Contrast' in table 1). Especially the decision threshold and drift rate scaling parameter HDIs have a large overlap with 0, but they are still interpreted as significant based on the Bayes factor. The Bayes factor, however, is not used for the behavioral analyses. For example, there are no effects of DBS on decision times, but at the computational level, several parameters (which predict the decision time) are affected. I think for the sake of consistency of analyses within the paper the statistics of the Bayesian analyses should rely on the 95% HDI.</p><p>3) Connectome correlation analysis:</p><p>If I understand it correctly, the connectome analysis relates behavioral effects of stimulation to whole-brain networks rather than just local effects in the pallidum by testing whether patients who showed stronger effects of stimulation have electrodes that are closer to connections with different brain areas. In the abstract, the results of this analysis are reported as &quot;… was predicted by the degree of functional connectivity between the stimulating electrode and prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices&quot;. In the discussion, it is stated that &quot;…DBS-induced enhanced exploration correlated with the functional connectivity of the stimulation volume in the GPI to frontal cortical regions identified previously in functional imaging studies of explore-exploit decision making … The exploration-enhancing effects of GPI-DBS in our study were predicted by functional connectivity to brain regions whose neurons encode uncertainty [27] and predict behavioural switching[430 29, 30]&quot;. However, figure 4 essentially shows that almost the whole brain correlates with inter-individual differences in behavior reaching correlation coefficients as strong as -0.7 e.g. lower brain stem, cerebellum, and occipital cortex, none of which are mentioned in the paper. To me, it seems that there are correlations with very large and very distributed cortical areas rather than with specific areas in the prefrontal and sensorimotor cortex as stated in the paper.</p><p>Related to this point: The variable used for the connectomic correlation analysis is not the same variable that was affected by DBS in the statistical analysis. The statistical analysis found that P(explore) differed between DBS ON vs OFF irrespective of the session. Instead the &quot;maximum within-session increase in P(Explore) DBS-ON – P(Explore ) DBS-OFF&quot; was used.</p><p>4) In general, could you please explain this analysis in more detail? If I understand it correctly each voxel had a value for 'connectivity' to the stimulation field and a value for 'behavioral effect' and across patients, this then gave an R-map. How was figure 4 thresholded (only the maximum positive and negative Rs are given in the color bar)? Then p-values are listed. One is 0.04 and another one is 0.009. What is the difference between the two? These values seem to reflect the correlation of similarity between the individual map with the group map and the behavioral variable, but was the correlation with the behavioral variable not already used for creating the R-map? Describing the analysis in more detail might help make it more understandable to the audience not familiar with the analysis (including me).</p><p>5) It is my understanding that high exploration (e.g. P(Explore) of 0.2) should be related to poorer task performance since the optimal strategy would always use the high-value option and only switch rarely to identify the reversal(s). Why is it then that DBS can affect exploration but not the sum of rewards if the two are related? Should DBS not affect the sum of rewards if it for example was more pronounced in its effect on P(explore)?</p><p>6) Would the authors have predicted different effects for subthalamic deep brain stimulation? The DBS effects on the GPi are mainly interpreted in terms of reduced firing rate/activity. Since the STN exerts glutamatergic innervation of the GPi, should STN suppression lead to similar results? Conversely, GPe exerts GABAergic innervation of the STN. Should GPe suppression lead to the opposite behavioral effect? Were some of the electrodes localized within or close to the GPe rather than GPi and if so, did these patients show different behavioral effects?</p><p>7) Was the OFF vs ON DBS order counterbalanced? 3 patients did not complete the task OFF, and the ON dataset was not available in another patient. Did the authors check if the DBS order was relevant for the DBS effect on P(explore)?</p><p>8) The fact that a decrease in exploration behaviour isn't correlated with a modification of reward pay-off is at odds with the original theory of exploration/exploitation balance. This should at least have been discussed in order to convince the reader of the robustness of the effect observed on the P(Explore).</p><p>9) Alternative hypotheses concerning the role of the BG on the exploration/exploitation trade-off can be proposed (habits vs goal-directed behaviour, reward-driven vs automatism, etc.). They are not ruled out by the experimental results (even if we take them for granted despite (i).</p><p>10) It seems the decrease in exploration did not lead to a decrease in overall reward-but was the learning slower in the OFF condition? Figure 5 red and blue learning curves look similar, but the model fits in Figure 6 suggest a difference in positive learning rate.</p><p>If there truly is no difference in the acquisition, I'm surprised a significant reduction in exploration didn't slow learning at all either at the beginning or post-reversal… Does this imply exploration is not necessary to perform this task accurately?</p><p>11) The authors touch briefly on the differences between directed exploration (e.g. info-seeking) and random decision noise in the Discussion section; however, it might be worth mentioning earlier that current existing work on GPi (as far as I'm aware) largely links it to overall decision noise rather than information-seeking. (Whereas potentially other areas of the pallidum, e.g. GPe, have been implicated in explicit information-seeking exploration, as per White et al., 2019 Nature Comm). Clarifying this random/directed exploration difference early in the manuscript rather than later might be helpful.</p><p>12) P.3, l.108-109 (&quot;Previously, studies of the explore-exploit dilemma have utilised bandit tasks with high pay-out volatility and/or multiple-choice options…&quot;) implies the use of the reversal learning task is novel in the context of explore-exploit. However, two-choice, simple-reversal tasks + RL models have been used before in this context: see Zhukovsky et al. 2019 Nature, Barnes et al. 2022 BP for rodent work, Oberwelland Weiss et al. 2020 FiNs for human work. None of those studies explicitly examine the role of GPi or use RLDDM, so the novelty of the present work remains, but the implication that previous studies haven't used reversal learning is perhaps misleading and might be best rephrased.</p><p>Similarly, the claim in the introduction (p2, l45) that the neural bases of the explore/exploit tradeoff remain poorly understood is perhaps outdated. The reference is from 15 years ago, and much work has been dedicated in the interim to the neural underpinnings of explore/exploit. While certainly there is not one clear, complete circuit agreed upon for calibrating the trade-off and not one single model that's more right than all others, it could be argued that the neural mechanisms behind explore-exploit are not more poorly understood than those behind most cognitive processes.</p><p>13) Would help to briefly explain and contextualize dystonia, for a broader audience who may be unfamiliar with it.</p><p>14) I am not sure why, in the connectivity analysis, DBS stimulation volume was linked to the maximum within-session ON-OFF p(Explore) difference … why separate by session in this analysis, when p(Explore) in panel A of the same figure, and in several of the other analyses + model fits, is calculated over all three sessions? Why is the within-session difference relevant here and nowhere else?</p><p>Relatedly, I'm not sure I understand what it means for the spatial similarity measure in Figure 4A to have a value less than 0… I'm not familiar with this type of analysis so I might just not be understanding it, but if the R-Map is built from an (?) average of individual patients' connectivity maps (as per l.224-226), how is it possible that 11/14 individuals have negative spatial similarity to the R-Map?</p><p>15) To my understanding, previous neural models and accounts of the GPi activity modulating exploration were within-task (e.g. in early trials all options are available for exploration, in later trials once one option emerged as best, GPi suppressed others); whereas in the present data, the manipulation happens across tasks. Thus we're seeing differences in an overall level of exploration rather than GPi-driven fluctuations in within-task behavior-which, while still in line with previous findings, warrants some additional questions. For instance:</p><p>– Does the within-task modulation of exploration differ in the OFF and ON states? Visual inspection of Figure 3D suggests no, but hard to tell visually.</p><p>– Would a finer p(Explore) window (say, per every 10 trials rather than every 40) indicate some interesting differences in the patterns of exploratory choices between the OFF and ON states, that might not be visible with averaging?</p><p>16) It might be worth clarifying explicitly in the text that the m parameter for scaling takes the place, in some sense, of the softmax function for RL in terms of calibrating explore/exploit behavior. This is not immediately obvious to readers unfamiliar with the RLDDM, but it's a relevant detail for interpreting modelling results in terms of exploration behavior.</p><p>17) In a similar vein, perhaps also state explicitly that the m parameter and the learning rate were previously found to be negatively correlated, and what that means. This will give the reader a bit of extra context to interpret and understand figure 7.</p><p>18) It might also help to explain why the learning rates can go outside of the usual [0; 1] interval (and they're on quite a larger scale as seen in the original RLDDM paper, though I suspect that's just a consequence of using a different dataset).</p><p>19) The present model can't capture potential fluctuations m across the session. (For instance, corresponding to increased exploration tendencies in the beginning, or right after the reversal.) Pedersen et al. present an alternative to the stable-scaling model, in which parameter m, rather than remain fixed, changes through the session; this does not fit as well with the data they used, but the difference in fit was small. When comparing the best RLDDM models to use, was a non-constant scaling model also tested? (The proposed power-law function might not necessarily reflect the intuitive exploration fluctuations in a reversal-learning task, which we might expect to differ from the PST in the original RLDDM paper, so the function might require some tweaks).</p><p>20) I am not certain this is feasible within the number of trials, but would fitting the RLDDM separately to each task version to pre- and post-reversal find any differences in how parameters change in the OFF and ON states?</p><p>Not sure we would expect any differences or what they would be under the present hypothesis on GPi function; however, having a finer measure for fluctuations in exploration (either through a model-free moving window of p-Explore, as suggested earlier, or through a dynamic scaling model, or by fitting pre- and post-reversal) could provide extra insight into how exploration is affected by the DBS manipulation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The robustness of the effect observed on P(explore) should be discussed.</p><p>Alternative hypotheses should be discussed also.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Conceptual Comments</p><p>1) It seems the decrease in exploration did not lead to a decrease in overall reward-but was the learning slower in the OFF condition?

Thus we're seeing differences in an overall level of exploration rather than GPi-driven fluctuations in within-task behavior-which, while still in line with previous findings, warrants some additional questions. For instance:</p><p>– Does the within-task modulation of exploration differ in the OFF and ON states?

(For instance, corresponding to increased exploration tendencies in the beginning, or right after the reversal.) Pedersen et al. present an alternative to the stable-scaling model, in which parameter m, rather than remain fixed, changes through the session; this does not fit as well with the data they used, but the difference in fit was small. When comparing the best RLDDM models to use, was a non-constant scaling model also tested? (The proposed power-law function might not necessarily reflect the intuitive exploration fluctuations in a reversal-learning task, which we might expect to differ from the PST in the original RLDDM paper, so the function might require some tweaks).</p><p>5) I am not certain this is feasible within the number of trials, but would fitting the RLDDM separately to each task version to pre- and post-reversal find any differences in how parameters change in the OFF and ON states?</p><p>Not sure we would expect any differences or what they would be under the present hypothesis on GPi function; however, having a finer measure for fluctuations in exploration (either through a model-free moving window of p-Explore, as suggested earlier, or through a dynamic scaling model, or by fitting pre- and post-reversal) could provide extra insight into how exploration is affected by the DBS manipulation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79642.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Generalizability:</p><p>Studying dystonia patients gives the unique opportunity to study the effects of electrical pallidal stimulation on decision-making in humans and given that dystonia primarily affects movements rather than cognition/decision-making this might also well be representative of healthy people. This (i.e. the similarity between task performance of patients and healthy people) is, however, not demonstrated in this study. In the introduction, the authors state that reward prediction error is intact in dystonic patients, but the paper that they cite for this (ref 34) is titled '… abnormal reward learning in cervical dystonia'. Furthermore, albeit clearly less pronounced than movement symptoms cognitive problems are present in dystonia patients (see Jahanshahi 2017 Movement Disorders). I would therefore recommend enrolling a healthy control group allowing to compare DBS ON and DBS OFF to healthy people.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer is correct in asserting the idea that RL learning is not normal in patients with focal dystonia (e.g. Gilbertson et al., 2019[1]). In the Discussion section, “study limitations” (p24 l624-635), of the original manuscript we emphasised this as an interpretational limitation of studying a patient group with pre-existing RL learning abnormalities. Nevertheless, for comparative purposes we have included results of testing a group (n=18) of age and sex matched controls performing the first block of the reward-reversal learning task. We found P(Explore) values were higher in the HC group when compared to the dystonia patients in the DBS-OFF condition (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2A). These results replicate those of Gilbertson et al. (2019)[1] where a similar patient group (without chronic DBS implanted) used a more exploitative decision-making strategy in the same task. RLDDM fitting to the HC data confirmed lower drift diffusion scaling parameter in the HC group compared with OFF-DBS, which explained this difference in exploration (plotted in additional Figure 6 —figure supplement 2 and Table 1 – Table Supplement 2). As we found that the same effect of DBS on this model parameter explained a similar behavioural change in the patients (See point 20 and Figure 6 —figure supplement 1), we argue that the exploration enhancement by DBS is likely to reflect a normalisation of this behaviour from a pathological, disease related heightened exploitative state. This interpretational limitation has been reinforced and expanded upon in the main revised results (page 11 l 295-305) and main discussion (p24 l624-635) sections. Figure 5 has also been modified to include overlaid HC model fitting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Statistics:</p><p>I understand that Bayesian statistics cannot always directly be compared to non-Bayesian frequentist statistics. However, to me, the frequentist and Bayesian statistics are not consistent in this study. ANOVAs, etc are applied on subject-averages data using a p-value of 0.05 to distinguish between significant vs. non-significant results. In the Bayesian modelling analysis, the 95% HDI is computed. While this number is arbitrary (just as a p-value of 0.05) it still has a rationale to it given that in the scientific community 95% is also used for frequentist confidence intervals. Therefore, I think that 95% would be the most consistent choice here. However, none of the model parameters differ between ON vs. OFF regarding the 95% HDIs, since they overlap with 0 (see 'Contrast' in table 1). Especially the decision threshold and drift rate scaling parameter HDIs have a large overlap with 0, but they are still interpreted as significant based on the Bayes factor. The Bayes factor, however, is not used for the behavioral analyses. For example, there are no effects of DBS on decision times, but at the computational level, several parameters (which predict the decision time) are affected. I think for the sake of consistency of analyses within the paper the statistics of the Bayesian analyses should rely on the 95% HDI.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point, thus for the sake of consistency the RLDDM parameter estimates are expressed using the 95% HDI rather than BF in the revised manuscript. Allowing for this different interpretational framework, we did not find any significant differences in the RLDDM parameters at a group level in the ON and OFF- DBS states fitted to the task as a whole. However, allowing for the recommendation to fit the RLDDM separately to pre- and post-reversal trials (response to point 20), we did find group level differences in the parameter values using the 95% HDI cut off criteria. Unsurprisingly, given both this reappraisal of the Bayesian statistics and the refitting of the model to the behavioural data, the methods, results (page 16-19, l417-465; Table 1) and Discussion sections pertaining to RLDDM have been significantly altered from the original manuscript (including an additional Figure 6 —figure supplement 1 and Table Supplement -2 pertainting to control parameter estimates ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Connectome correlation analysis:</p><p>If I understand it correctly, the connectome analysis relates behavioral effects of stimulation to whole-brain networks rather than just local effects in the pallidum by testing whether patients who showed stronger effects of stimulation have electrodes that are closer to connections with different brain areas. In the abstract, the results of this analysis are reported as &quot;… was predicted by the degree of functional connectivity between the stimulating electrode and prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices&quot;. In the discussion, it is stated that &quot;…DBS-induced enhanced exploration correlated with the functional connectivity of the stimulation volume in the GPI to frontal cortical regions identified previously in functional imaging studies of explore-exploit decision making … The exploration-enhancing effects of GPI-DBS in our study were predicted by functional connectivity to brain regions whose neurons encode uncertainty [27] and predict behavioural switching[430 29, 30]&quot;. However, figure 4 essentially shows that almost the whole brain correlates with inter-individual differences in behavior reaching correlation coefficients as strong as -0.7 e.g. lower brain stem, cerebellum, and occipital cortex, none of which are mentioned in the paper. To me, it seems that there are correlations with very large and very distributed cortical areas rather than with specific areas in the prefrontal and sensorimotor cortex as stated in the paper.</p><p>Related to this point: The variable used for the connectomic correlation analysis is not the same variable that was affected by DBS in the statistical analysis. The statistical analysis found that P(explore) differed between DBS ON vs OFF irrespective of the session. Instead the &quot;maximum within-session increase in P(Explore) DBS-ON – P(Explore ) DBS-OFF&quot; was used.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the R-map method is intended to extract a whole-brain network model that is informed by a DBS-modulated output variable, in our case P(Explore) DBS-ON – P(Explore) DBS-OFF. This model is estimated using a statistical test (Pearson correlation) that capture the voxel-wise relationship between the output variable and the seed-based connectivity strength of each voxel across the participants. Voxels can therefore receive positive or negative R values indicating the strength of the aforementioned correlation. This said, positive voxels (depicted as red-yellow in the surface projection in Figure 4) are the ones to be connected to the stimulation volume in order for the latter to implicate a greater performance in P(Explore) in DBS-ON state when compared to DBS-OFF state. On the contrary, connectivity of the stimulation volume to voxels with negative R values (blue-green) would indicate worse performance in relation to P(Explore) compared between DBS states. We therefore believe that every voxel in this statistical model (map) should be taken into consideration when trying to explain covariance of stimulation associated connectivity and DBS-related changes in P(Explore) regardless of the sign of voxel-wise R. We have adapted the following paragraphs in the discussion accordingly to moderate the interpretational value of this analysis (page 23 line 600-610).</p><p><bold>“</bold>Equally, this connectivity profile included regions with little to no recognised functional role in reward-reversal learning. Therefore, caution is required in interpreting the anatomical detail of this network given the limitations of using imaging data with no individualised anatomical specificity. On a more general level, this analysis provides support to the idea that discrete functions in local brain networks (in our case the GPI), are integrated into a broader scale whole-brain network. This leads to co-variation in neural activity between regions which are not conventionally attributed a functional role in a specific motor or sensory act [2] and might explain how DBS exerts influence on remote areas beyond the stimulation site [3].<bold>”</bold></p><p>Additionally, we reasoned that as DBS did not increase exploration in any one specific experimental session, that it was reasonable to select the experimental session with the largest effect of DBS in any one individual. We subtracted the difference ON-OFF P(Explore) in order to reduce the between subject variation in the P(Explore) values and isolate the additional effect of DBS on enhancing exploration. This rationale has been detailed further in the Results section (page 12 l 328-345) as this approach is similar to that used previously [3, 4].</p><p>As an additional analytical check, we have also included an R-map analysis which uses the mean change in P(Explore) ON-OFF as the behavioural regressor (page 12, l 338-344, and Figure 4 —figure supplement 1). As would be expected from averaging the P(Explore) values across the whole task (rather than taking the session with the largest difference) the range of values is smaller. Crucially, the connectivity profile remained similar to the main analysis using maximal change in P(Explore) (Supplementary Figure 1). Furthermore, the relationship between the spatial similarity and the mean change in P(Explore) survived the permutation testing (R = 0.41, p(per) = 0.004).</p><p>With respect to the comment regarding “correlations with very large and very distributed cortical areas rather than with specific areas in the prefrontal and sensorimotor cortex as stated in the paper”; we agree that the interpretational value of this connectivity analysis has limited anatomical specificity. This has been acknowledge in the revised discussion (p23 l 600-610).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In general, could you please explain this analysis in more detail? If I understand it correctly each voxel had a value for 'connectivity' to the stimulation field and a value for 'behavioral effect' and across patients, this then gave an R-map. How was figure 4 thresholded (only the maximum positive and negative Rs are given in the color bar)? Then p-values are listed. One is 0.04 and another one is 0.009. What is the difference between the two? These values seem to reflect the correlation of similarity between the individual map with the group map and the behavioral variable, but was the correlation with the behavioral variable not already used for creating the R-map? Describing the analysis in more detail might help make it more understandable to the audience not familiar with the analysis (including me).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has understood correctly that the connectome analysis relates stimulation-induced change in behavioral performance with functional connectivity from stimulation site to whole-brain networks and emphasizes the network effect of DBS [5]. This analysis builds on established methods previously published [4, 6, 7]. First, based on a normative connectome, functional connectivity from active contact localization to the whole brain is calculated for each patient individually (result = one functional connectivity map for each patient). Then, for each voxel in the brain, a correlation is calculated between the individual connectivity to that voxel and the behavioural parameter (result = one R value for each voxel in the brain). The R-Map depicted in figure 4B is the result of thresholding R and visualizing it into a standard brain. It represents the “optimal” functional connectivity map from the stimulation volumes to the whole brain that allows for the greatest increase in P(Explore) based on our cohort and behavioral results. The thresholds defined for the visualization of the R-Map in Figure 4B have now been added to the figure.</p><p>In the last step, we calculate the similarity from each individual connectivity map (step 1) to the R-Map (step 2), referred to as “spatial similarity”. Figure 4A shows that increased spatial similarity to the calculated R-Map is correlated with increased p(explore) and this is statistically significant (R<sup>2</sup>=0.28, P=0.04). Further plotting the R value distribution derived from 1000 repermuted correlations between the behavioral effect of DBS and the R-map, we show that the probability of seeing the same correlation by chance is p &lt; 0.009 (Figure 4C). To further test the predictive value of these results, a further cross-validation analysis would be necessary. We refrained from this analysis due to the small sample size of our cohort and the strictly complementary role of this analysis. Thus, we agree with the reviewer that the statements in the introduction and abstract referring to “prediction” should be restated. Furthermore, we have rephrased the discussion of the connectivity results (see above) and have added clarity to the results and methods parts regarding the connectivity analyses (pages 11-14, l312-364).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is my understanding that high exploration (e.g. P(Explore) of 0.2) should be related to poorer task performance since the optimal strategy would always use the high-value option and only switch rarely to identify the reversal(s). Why is it then that DBS can affect exploration but not the sum of rewards if the two are related? Should DBS not affect the sum of rewards if it for example was more pronounced in its effect on P(explore)?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that intuitively, with greater levels of P(Explore), the number of rewards should be correspondingly lower. However, this is only absolutely true when a deterministic payout (ie 100:0%) contingency being employed or when there is a very slow learning rate. For example asymptotic performance is achieved in 100 trials in the GPI lesion study in non-human primates by Piron et al., (2016[8]). By comparison both our patients and Healthy controls achieve this in less than 10 trials. The inverse relationship between P(Explore) and performance (here we index the probability of winning a reward as a performance metric) is likely to be less robust under probabilistic reversal conditions and a high learning rate. In order to illustrate this point, and to reassure the reader of the robustness of the main results of the paper, Figure 1 demonstrates the results of plotting the relationship between performance (reward probability) and P(Explore) both from experimental (A) and simulated RLDDM data (B).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Relationship between task performance P(Reward) and probability of exploratory choices in a session.</title><p>(A) Probability of making an exploratory choice in a session plotted against the probability of obtaining a rewarding outcome – P (Reward) – experimental data. (B) Simulated data. Each data point is derived from simulated data choices of the RLDDM performing the reward-reversal learning task (n=50). The dashed line represents the linear fit of this relationship between P(explore) and P(Reward). The dotted line represents a perfect negative linear relationship with slope of -1. The average experimental change in P(Explore) ON-DBS and OFF-DBS is superimposed in red and blue dotted vertical lines with the corresponding change in P(Reward) predicted from this linear fit by the horizontal equivalent line.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79642-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>For the experimental data, this confirmed the expected negative relationship (rho = -0.7 p &lt;0.001). However, fitting a linear model to this relationship confirmed that the slope was less than -1 (-0.46) meaning that for every unit increase in P(explore) the probability of winning a reward was only marginally affected. We also ran the same analysis on the 50, simulated experimental runs (Figure 1B) of the RLDDM model data choices which replicated this relationship (rho = -0.52, p&lt;0.001). The slope of a linear model that fitted this simulated data was -0.51. Accordingly, this predicted a reduction in P(reward) from 0.79 OFF-DBS to 0.75 using the experimentally observed changes in P(Explore). From this analysis, it is possible to see that allowing for the non-deterministic reward outcomes in our task, DBS induced increase exploration by 35% leads to corresponding 6% reduction in winning a reward. This example illustrates why task performance remains relatively unaffected by the DBS despite this robustly driving greater exploratory choice through the task.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Would the authors have predicted different effects for subthalamic deep brain stimulation? The DBS effects on the GPi are mainly interpreted in terms of reduced firing rate/activity. Since the STN exerts glutamatergic innervation of the GPi, should STN suppression lead to similar results? Conversely, GPe exerts GABAergic innervation of the STN. Should GPe suppression lead to the opposite behavioral effect? Were some of the electrodes localized within or close to the GPe rather than GPi and if so, did these patients show different behavioral effects?</p></disp-quote><p>Our main rational for considering a rate coding effect on GPI firing is the established finding of GPI firing reductions during exploratory choices in primates by Sheth et al. (2011)[9]. It would seem reasonable to suggest that a similar effect may be seen with STN DBS. We think that a more straightforward prediction of this study (which gets around the difficulties of predicting exactly what the mechanism of DBS on rate coding in the STN, something which is notoriously difficult) would be that STN stimulation may interfere with the decision boundary. This has been predicted from theoretical work by Dunovan et al. (2019)[10] and experimental work with PD patients undergoing DBS by Herz and colleagues (2018)[10]. Our modelling results showing a reduction in the drift rate scaling parameter ON-DBS are experimental support for the Dunovan model of direct pathway encoding the rate of evidence accumulation.</p><p>DBS programming had been performed in all patients prior to the study and was stable at inclusion for this study. Programming had been performed in a clinical setting with the aim to achieve best possible improvement in dystonic symptoms. We have redone figure 1A to highlight the active contacts. Interestingly, active contacts localization showed a spatial distribution that agrees with the “sweet spots” for best clinical effect described in literature (ventrolateral GPi as in Schönecker et al., (2015)[11] and subpallidal white matter as in Reich et al., (2019)[12] ). Only 2 active contacts were localized in the GPe (Patient #6 and #9, see Figure 1A). Needless to say, that mere active contacts location cannot capture the extent with which GPi or GPe is being stimulated. Hence, we have added a supplementary figure (Supplementary figure 1) showing the total volume of stimulation averaged for all patients (Supplementary Figure 1A) and a heat map to visualize how many individual stimulation volumes are overlapping in each voxel of the total stimulation volume (Supplementary Figure 1B). The figure illustrates that the GPi is the focus of electrical stimulation in our cohort. We have additionally added a supplementary method section to describe how we have extracted the latter information and created the supplementary figure (page 27, l 750-770).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Was the OFF vs ON DBS order counterbalanced? 3 patients did not complete the task OFF, and the ON dataset was not available in another patient.

We also analysed the effect of the DBS stimulation order on the P(Explore) values. We did not find any significant effect of the order of DBS stimulation on this behavioural variable.

These are important questions but were outside of the immediate scope of this experiment’s hypothesis which was to provide experimental evidence to support the longer standing theoretical proposal of the BG in explore-exploit decision-making in a more general sense.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) It seems the decrease in exploration did not lead to a decrease in overall reward-but was the learning slower in the OFF condition? Figure 5 red and blue learning curves look similar, but the model fits in Figure 6 suggest a difference in positive learning rate.</p><p>If there truly is no difference in the acquisition, I'm surprised a significant reduction in exploration didn't slow learning at all either at the beginning or post-reversal… Does this imply exploration is not necessary to perform this task accurately?</p></disp-quote><p>Using the HDI values rather than BF as per the original draft, we no longer found a statistically significant difference in the RLDDM learning rates in the ON- and OFF-DBS states. However, re-analysing the pre- and post- reversal trials, as suggested (see point 20) does confirm that in the OFF DBS state, lower levels of exploration are associated with lower learning rates. This is best represented in the individual parameter estimates in Figure 6 —figure supplement 1 row E for the +ve and -ve learning rate values. In the ON-DBS state the expected increase in both learning rates is notably absent when compared to the OFF-DBS condition. This once again is in the absence of any clear performance degradation; but does support the need for exploration post-reversal in the task, as the ON-DBS behaviour appears to be closer to the physiological performance of this task in the HC group. We have not formally analysed or included this in the revised manuscript, as we felt it adds another level of interpretation complexity which is outside of the scope of the original hypothesis. We would be happy to do so if it was felt that his enhanced the revised version of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The authors touch briefly on the differences between directed exploration (e.g. info-seeking) and random decision noise in the Discussion section; however, it might be worth mentioning earlier that current existing work on GPi (as far as I'm aware) largely links it to overall decision noise rather than information-seeking. (Whereas potentially other areas of the pallidum, e.g. GPe, have been implicated in explicit information-seeking exploration, as per White et al., 2019 Nature Comm).

These are included in the revised manuscript results (p10-11, l 269-294) with additional Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 (ON-DBS versus OFF-DBS) and Figure 3 —figure supplement 2 (HC versus OFF-DBS). Re-analysing the P(Explore) values ON- and OFF -DBS across twelve 10-trial bins reveals the expected increase in P(Explore) values post reversal in contingencies and an across task effect of DBS to enhance P(Explore). This analysis replicates the same effect of DBS applied to the three experimental sessions, but again we found no specific bin post reversal at which DBS clearly exerted a greater effect. We cannot discount the possibility that this reflects the small study sample size, but equally, the pan-task effect of DBS on P(Explore) may simply reflect a short task where exploration is still prominent in the pre-reversal trials as these only become overly familiar and over-learnt towards the beginning of session 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) It might be worth clarifying explicitly in the text that the m parameter for scaling takes the place, in some sense, of the softmax function for RL in terms of calibrating explore/exploit behavior. This is not immediately obvious to readers unfamiliar with the RLDDM, but it's a relevant detail for interpreting modelling results in terms of exploration behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included this clarification in the Results section regarding the <italic>m</italic> parameter on page 8 (l 223-225).</p><p>“It is analogous to and closely related to the β parameter (inverse temperature function) which governs the explore-exploit trade-off in a softmax choice rule.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) In a similar vein, perhaps also state explicitly that the m parameter and the learning rate were previously found to be negatively correlated, and what that means. This will give the reader a bit of extra context to interpret and understand figure 7.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the interpretational changes to the modelling result that have arisen from point [2] and point[20] we have not explicitly stated the negative relationship between learning rate and the m parameter, in part, because this is less relevant to the main modelling results (there was no group level difference in the learning rates ON-DBS). Figure 7 was originally conceived in the context of interpreting the model parameter posterior differences using BF’s. This suggested differences in three parameters of the model which figure 7 was aimed at aiding the readers interpretation of interations between these parameters on P(Explore). Given the changes to the paper from points 2 and 20, and the simpler effect of DBS on a single model parameter (drift rate scaling parameter) this figure seemed superfluous to the revised manuscript and so has been removed from this version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) It might also help to explain why the learning rates can go outside of the usual [0; 1] interval (and they're on quite a larger scale as seen in the original RLDDM paper, though I suspect that's just a consequence of using a different dataset).</p></disp-quote><p>The reason for these values not being within the usual [0,1] interval is that the learning rates are estimated in MCMC sampling process as a gaussian; we have retained this in the posterior distribution plots and tables. To transform them back into the [0,1] interval they have to be passed through an inverse logit function eg exp(x)/1+exp(x).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) The present model can't capture potential fluctuations m across the session. (For instance, corresponding to increased exploration tendencies in the beginning, or right after the reversal.) Pedersen et al. present an alternative to the stable-scaling model, in which parameter m, rather than remain fixed, changes through the session; this does not fit as well with the data they used, but the difference in fit was small. When comparing the best RLDDM models to use, was a non-constant scaling model also tested? (The proposed power-law function might not necessarily reflect the intuitive exploration fluctuations in a reversal-learning task, which we might expect to differ from the PST in the original RLDDM paper, so the function might require some tweaks).</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware of the additional model variations in the original RLDDM paper by Pederson et al.[15], including the variable (rather than fixed) a and m(v scale) versions. To our knowledge, the current version of the RLDDM toolbox, which is open source, does not allow you to implement these versions (https://nbviewer.org/github/hddm-devs/hddm). However, we have re-fitted the fixed m/ v scale model to the pre- and post-reversal trials separately, as suggested in point 20. We think these revised results provide a more nuanced understanding of the mechanism underlying our DBS effect, which gets around this implementation problem.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) I am not certain this is feasible within the number of trials, but would fitting the RLDDM separately to each task version to pre- and post-reversal find any differences in how parameters change in the OFF and ON states?</p><p>Not sure we would expect any differences or what they would be under the present hypothesis on GPi function; however, having a finer measure for fluctuations in exploration (either through a model-free moving window of p-Explore, as suggested earlier, or through a dynamic scaling model, or by fitting pre- and post-reversal) could provide extra insight into how exploration is affected by the DBS manipulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this additional analysis suggestion. We have managed to re-fit the data to the pre-and post-reversal trials (illustrated in Figure 6 —figure supplement 1 and Table 1 – Table Supplement 1). Despite the smaller number of trials the model convergedand a significant difference in the posterior distribution in m, the drift rate scaling parameter, was identified, which was reduced in the post-reversal trials in the ON-DBS condition. This was statistically significant using the 95% HDI criteria recommended in point [2]. We think this is consistent with the observed increase in P(Explore), as a reduction in, m, reduces the influence of the difference in the Q values between the choices. Allowing for this result and the different statistical interpretation of the model posterior distributions, we have had to change the discussion accordingly (p21).</p><p>References:</p><p>1.
