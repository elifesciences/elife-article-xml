inhibitors (TKIs) as treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a paradigm in molecularly targeted cancer therapy. Nonetheless, TKI-insensitive leukemia stem cells (LSCs) persist in most patients even after years of treatment and are imperative for disease progression as well as recurrence during treatment-free remission (TFR). Here, we have generated high-resolution single-cell multiomics maps from CML patients at diagnosis, retrospectively stratified by BCR::ABL1<sup>IS</sup> (%) following 12 months of TKI therapy. Simultaneous measurement of global gene expression profiles together with &gt;40 surface markers from the same cells revealed that each patient harbored a unique composition of stem and progenitor cells at diagnosis. The patients with treatment failure after 12 months of therapy had a markedly higher abundance of molecularly defined primitive cells at diagnosis compared to the optimal responders. The multiomic feature landscape enabled visualization of the primitive fraction as a mixture of molecularly distinct BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs and BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup>hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in variable ratio across patients, and guided their prospective isolation by a combination of CD26 and CD35 cell surface markers. We for the first time show that BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs and BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> HSCs can be distinctly separated as CD26<sup>+</sup>CD35<sup>-</sup> and CD26<sup>-</sup>CD35<sup>+</sup>, respectively. In addition, we found the ratio of LSC/HSC to be higher in patients with prospective treatment failure compared to optimal responders, at diagnosis as well as following 3 months of TKI therapy. Collectively, this data builds a framework for understanding therapy response and adapting treatment by devising strategies to extinguish or suppress TKI-insensitive LSCs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>leukemic stem cell</kwd><kwd>CITE-Seq</kwd><kwd>CML</kwd><kwd>CD26</kwd><kwd>CD35</kwd><kwd>BCR-ABL1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012538</institution-id><institution>Swedish Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karlsson</surname><given-names>Göran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007459</institution-id><institution>Ragnar Söderbergs stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karlsson</surname><given-names>Göran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karlsson</surname><given-names>Göran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karlsson</surname><given-names>Göran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006313</institution-id><institution>Barncancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karlsson</surname><given-names>Göran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017655</institution-id><institution>Incyte Biosciences Nordic AB</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Warfvinge</surname><given-names>Rebecca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell analysis of CML patients bone marrow at diagnosis reveals coexistence of CD26<sup>-</sup>CD35<sup>+</sup> healthy stem cells and CD26<sup>+</sup>CD35<sup>-</sup> CML stem cells, and how the ratio between these impacts TKI response.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The persistence, burden, and evolvability of LSCs during therapy provide common threads to address the major challenges remaining in CML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cortes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Michor et al., 2005</xref>). For example, the acquisition of the BCR::ABL1 kinase domain (KD), and additional somatic mutations within LSCs could either necessitate a switch to another TKI or precipitate a blast crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolton-Gillespie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giustacchini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nieborowska-Skorska et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O’Hare et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sorel et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, even in the absence of KD mutations, the LSC burden at diagnosis is linked to cytogenetic and molecular response in the chronic phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khorashad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mustjoki et al., 2013</xref>), and their presence is associated with recurrence during TFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pagani et al., 2020</xref>), thus compelling life-long treatment in the majority of patients.</p><p>The de facto standard for disease monitoring, BCR::ABL1 transcript/gDNA quantification using qPCR, Sanger, and/or Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), however, predictably only captures cells positive for BCR::ABL1 expression and translocation and does not inform the number and identity of fully leukemogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Radich et al., 2019</xref>). This is pertinent given that a combination of cell sorting and BCR::ABL1 quantification suggested that the presence of BCR::ABL1 signal in the stem cell compartment rather than the lymphocytes correlates with TFR loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kinstrie et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pagani et al., 2020</xref>). Using HSC specific markers, however, is confounded by the observations that in remission, patients in chronic phase restore Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph<sup>-</sup>) hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergamaschi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carella et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claxton et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coulombel et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deininger, 2003</xref>), implying the co-existence of BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> HSCs and BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs. However, because their proportion varies across individuals and treatment stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mustjoki et al., 2013</xref>), and both LSCs and HSCs reside within similar immunophenotypic compartments (Lin<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-/low</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eisterer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Petzer et al., 1996</xref>), discrimination between these populations – and thereby reliably estimating LSCs – remains difficult. As a result, understanding CML LSC identity, heterogeneity, and vulnerability to TKI therapy remain outstanding challenges in CML.</p><p>We recently implemented BCR::ABL1 targeted single-cell RT-qPCR in combination with index sorting for surface markers to dissect the LSC compartment at diagnosis and following 3 months of TKI therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Warfvinge et al., 2017</xref>). This demonstrated that at diagnosis, Lin<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-/low</sup> BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> cells could be divided into seven molecularly distinct subpopulations, each reflecting unique lineage and cell state signatures. Importantly, the proportions of BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSC subpopulations changed dynamically upon therapy and only a few surface markers efficiently discriminated between BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> vs. BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> cells. Of these, despite being generally reduced in BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> cells upon therapy, CD26 was more frequently detected in the subpopulation most persistent during TKI treatment. The substantial treatment-induced changes observed within the stem cell population suggested that BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs are themselves heterogeneous in terms of sensitivity to TKIs allowing us to define BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-/low</sup>CD45RA<sup>-</sup>cKIT<sup>-</sup>CD26<sup>+</sup> as the most TKI-insensitive cells. Apart from being detected at diagnosis, these cells are strikingly enriched after TKI therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Warfvinge et al., 2017</xref>), a finding since confirmed in a transgenic mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shah et al., 2023</xref>), and in clinical observations documenting the long-term persistence of CD26<sup>+</sup> cells in CML patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pacelli et al., 2023</xref>). Together, these findings argue that functional heterogeneity within LSCs cannot be predicted solely by surface markers but is intimately linked to their cell state and gene expression signature, thereby motivating a strategy to simultaneously capture their lineage potency/affiliation, BCR::ABL1 status, and molecular program in addition to the surface markers.</p><p>Although recent single-cell omics studies have begun to explore the cellular landscape in CML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giustacchini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krishnan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Patel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), these have largely been limited to measuring single modalities at a time, and thus, multiomic investigation of BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs and BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> stem cells from the same patient are currently lacking. Therefore, we used <underline>c</underline>ellular <underline>i</underline>ndexing of <underline>t</underline>ranscriptomes and <underline>e</underline>pitopes by <underline>seq</underline>uencing (CITE-seq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stoeckius et al., 2017</xref>) to quantify the global gene expression program, and highly multiplexed cell-surface protein profile simultaneously within the same cells from nine CML patients. The single-cell multiomics maps enabled us to visualize the cellular heterogeneity of each patient by delineating the abundance of molecularly defined leukemic stem versus lineage progenitors, and link cell composition at diagnosis to TKI therapy response. Moreover, the maps highlighted the co-existence of molecularly distinct BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> vs. BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> stem cells, guiding their prospective isolation by novel combinations of CD26 and CD35 markers, dissection of imbued molecular programs, division kinetics and changes in heterogeneity following TKI therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell multiomic CITE-seq analysis defines the heterogeneity of CML stem cell fractions</title><p>To characterize the multimodal heterogeneity within the Lin<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> and Lin<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-/low</sup> CML bone marrow (BM) compartment at diagnosis and estimate how the heterogeneity contributes to therapy response, we applied CITE-seq on nine patients retrospectively stratified according to molecular response following 12 months of treatment.

UMAP is a non-linear algorithm for dimensionality reduction and preserves the global data structure and enables visualization of the dataset in two dimensions.

The primitive cluster was marked by expression of stem-like gene expression e.g., CRHBP, HLF as well as a CD90<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-/low</sup> surface profile. Closest to the primitive cluster were MPP1 and 2 without frank manifestation of lineage-specific markers. The MPP1 cluster, in turn, was connected to the clusters with gain of myeloid-like, and lymphoid-like gene expression programs. This included myelo/lymphoid (My/Ly), myeloid (My: MPO, CD33), and lymphoid/dendritic/monocyte (Ly/pDc/mono) clusters (Ly86, CD135). The MPP2 cluster, in comparison, was connected to the megakaryocyte and erythroid lineage progenitors such as megakaryocyte-erythroid (MEP), megakaryocyte (MkP: ITGA2B, CD41), erythroid progenitors (ErP: HBA1, CD71, CD105) and basophil/mast cell clusters (Baso/mc: HDC, MS4A2-3, ITGB7).</p><p>Following CITE-seq of 14,274 Lin<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from nine CML patients, the cells were projected onto the nBM reference and annotated by label-transfer.

Moreover, and unlike the findings from overall comparison, myeloid cells were also found to be statistically enriched within responders (∼2.5 fold higher <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Although MPP2 and MkP clusters showed increased abundance in non-responders and responders, respectively, the difference did not reach statistical significance. Notably, the primitive cells were rarely detected in peripheral blood in contrast to the bone marrow, confirming the notion that cell type fractions differ in different tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and the bone marrow is predictably a more reliable and abundant source of true primitive cells in CML.

When we queried each cluster for enrichment of either LSC or HSC-like gene signatures the analysis clearly demonstrated that the primitive cells from CML samples could be divided based on the presence of BCR:ABL1, where CML cluster 3 displayed an evident enrichment of BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSC specific signatures as compared to CML cluster 2 consisting of BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> non-leukemic stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). Interestingly, both CML clusters were also found to share gene characteristics with normal stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Accordingly, we annotated Lin<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-/low</sup> primitive cells from individual patients as either BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> or BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> and could observe that the distribution varied across patients, suggesting a variable load of leukemic stem and normal stem-like cells within the primitive fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, subsequent matching of BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> and BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> cell IDs to the primitive cells in the joint Lin<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> and Lin<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-/low</sup> UMAPs (indicated by red and black cell color, respectively), indeed revealed that BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs and BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> HSCs were distinctly and consistently separated in the UMAP for each patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs in all patients were positioned immediately juxtaposing the downstream progenitor populations forming a continuum of differentiation hierarchy characteristically observed in single-cell analysis of HSPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pellin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Safi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Velten et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> HSCs formed an isolated and distinct cluster clearly detached from the rest of the cells in the majority of patients, indicating that during the chronic phase of CML, active hematopoiesis is dominated by the BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs while BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> HSCs reside in the bone marrow albeit in an inactive state with reduced contribution to hematopoiesis as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coulombel et al., 1983</xref>). Moreover, using the ADT data we could validate the molecularly defined BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs also by surface expression, with CD26, CD25, and CD93 displaying a 2–8 fold elevated expression in BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> primitive cells as compared to BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup>. A noteworthy patient-specific variability in surface protein expression on the most primitive cells was also established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>To gain an understanding of the nature of molecular program of BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> vs. BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> primitive cells, we analyzed differentially expressed genes between the pooled primitive BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> and BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> populations from all CML patients. This identified 244 genes specifically upregulated in BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> and 180 genes upregulated in BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Interestingly, among genes up-regulated in BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> primitive cells included the expression of established CML markers; IL2RA (CD25), DPP4 (CD26), and IL1RAP as well as LEPR (CD295) a receptor recently described as a novel marker for Lin<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-/low</sup> LSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Landberg et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> cells displayed an up-regulated expression of the stem cell-related gene CRHBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barbieri et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2005</xref>) as well as CXCR4 important for homing and maintenance of normal HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sugiyama et al., 2006</xref>).

This is especially relevant as the Lin<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> fraction contains a higher proportion of lineage progenitors but a smaller fraction of primitive cells making their identification challenging. Taken together, this multistep analysis approach generated unique detailed UMAPs allowing for inspection of BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs and BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> HSCs, their relation to other progenitor cells, as well as further validate BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs identity by surface protein expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>A unique combination of CD26 and CD35 surface markers captures molecularly defined BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs and BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> HSCs</title><p>A long-sought aim in CML research has been to generate protocols for effective discrimination and isolation of CML LSCs from residual HSCs within individual patient bone marrow.

We found 28 unique markers to be significantly up-regulated for either BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> or BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> cells (black or red colored bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Of these 28 markers, 17 ADTs marked BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs and were detected in at least one patient. However, only CD26, and CD25 were explicit and consistent throughout the entire cohort. CD93 was present on BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs in 7/8 patients and other previously suggested LSC markers like CD33 and CD56 specifically labeled BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> primitive cells in only a fraction of the patients. The documented CML LSC marker IL1RAP was not in the ADT panel and hence could not be probed. In contrast, 11 ADTs were specifically detected in BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> primitive cells from at least one patient. Interestingly, CD35 with ~fourfold elevated expression as compared to BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs was the only marker found to be consistently specific for the BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> HSC population across all patients. CD62L and CD10 were specifically present on BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> HSCs in 6/8 and 5/8 patients, respectively. Intriguingly, we recently showed that CD35 captures all HSCs in healthy human hematopoiesis and that stem cell activity as measured by xenotransplantation assays and epigenetic profiling is restricted to CD35<sup>+</sup> HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sommarin et al., 2021</xref>).

In addition, we observed that our previously described surface marker CD117, whose absence characterized LSCs persisting 3 months of TKI therapy, displayed a highly variably expression at diagnosis both marking a proportion of LSCs and HSCs across patients.

Interestingly, CD35 expression divided the CD26<sup>-</sup>, BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> primitive cells in one CD35 +and one CD35- fraction.

Thus, this shows the importance of positive, HSC-specific markers for efficient isolation of CML LSCs, and detection of residual HSCs in leukemia.

The stem cell compartment of optimal responders was dominated by healthy HSCs at three months following treatment.

The ensuing treatment-emergent adverse events, and financial toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cortes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lipton et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zafar, 2016</xref>) motivate a search for organizing principles to predict therapy response, dampen disease progression, and achieve durable TFR in a larger fraction of CML patients. One recent development has been to invoke the presence of somatic mutations other than BCR::ABL1 to explain primary resistance to TKIs, and disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Branford et al., 2019</xref>). A complementary perspective is to consider leukemic cell state and heterogeneity as a fundamental determinant of response to TKI to augment the mutational foundation, as has been recently demonstrated in AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zeng et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Our single-cell multiomics maps show clear differences in overall cell composition within stem and progenitor compartments in leukemia patients at diagnosis versus nBM. Importantly, treatment failures and optimal responders displayed distinctive enrichment of specific cell clusters. Using our 11-molecularly defined clusters as anchors, we deconvoluted the bulk gene expression profiles from n=59 CML patients to infer constituent cell populations and found that a more profound stemness/primitive signature in the BM was consistently associated with inferior therapy response. Indeed, there is growing recognition of the burden of primitive cells, and the ratio of BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> vs. BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> within the primitive compartment as potentially clinically relevant features such as hemoglobin, blast count, overall survival, progression-free survival, and therapy response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fathy El-Metwaly et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krishnan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mustjoki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thielen et al., 2016</xref>). Apart from the differential burden, the primitive cells from optimal and sub-optimal responders could also be qualitatively different e.g., in terms of gene expression profile as suggested recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krishnan et al., 2023</xref>). The relevance of BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSC burden to first and second generation TKI therapy outcome stands in contrast to the leukemic progenitors (Ph<sup>+</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup>) which did not show such a correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mustjoki et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, longstanding observations have revealed that CML patients at diagnosis contain both BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs vs. BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> HSC within the Lin<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-/low</sup> immunophenotypic compartment, and BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs suppress residual normal HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coulombel et al., 1983</xref>). Predictably, a lower fraction of BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> normal stem cells at diagnosis and during therapy relates to hematological toxicity with delayed or compromised restoration of Ph<sup>neg</sup> hematopoiesis upon successful response to TKIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Janssen et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we for the first time present an effective means to separate CML LSCs from HSCs within the stem cell compartment of patients. Prospective optimal responders to TKI treatment had a higher content of BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup>CD26<sup>-</sup>CD35<sup>+</sup> cells at diagnosis, and 3 months following therapy versus the treatment failures. We have recently demonstrated that Lin<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-/low</sup>CD45RA<sup>-</sup>CD35<sup>+</sup> cells are at the top of human hematopoietic hierarchy and display chromatin accessibility and transcriptional enhancers in line with their multilineage long-term reconstitution ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sommarin et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>With the high-throughput and resolution now provided by single-cell methods, BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> cells can be distinguished from BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> cells residing within the same immunophenotypic compartment as described above, and importantly, heterogeneity within BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSC subpopulations in terms of cell surface markers, molecular signature, and TKI response can be measured. The use of CITE-seq enabled the generation of patient-specific maps providing a panoramic yet exquisitely detailed view of cellular heterogeneity. Intriguingly, one of the emerging principles from the single-cell studies has been that not all LSC subpopulations are equally sensitive to BCR::ABL1 inhibition; while a majority of the LSCs are depleted, at least a fraction survives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giustacchini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Warfvinge et al., 2017</xref>). This is corroborated by an overall reduction in BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> Lin<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-/low</sup> cells but a striking enrichment of cKIT<sup>-</sup>CD26<sup>+</sup> subpopulation displaying primitive and quiescent molecular program upon commencing TKI therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Warfvinge et al., 2017</xref>). Using CITE-seq, we confirmed the existence of these cells already at diagnosis and showed that BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> vs. BCR::ABL1<sup>-</sup> can be efficiently discriminated as CD26<sup>+</sup>CD35<sup>-</sup> and CD26<sup>-</sup>CD35<sup>+</sup>, respectively within the Lin<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-/low</sup> fraction, and thus facilitating improved assessment of LSC burden.</p><p>The inspection of single-cell maps raises questions both regarding the origin of the interpatient heterogeneity in LSC burden as well as how these cells differentially manage to survive TKI therapy. Given the heterogeneity within normal HSCs with respect to lineage bias and clonal output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haas et al., 2018</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that stem/progenitor cell acquiring the BCR::ABL1 oncogenic hit perhaps might be different across CML patients ensuring disparity in LSC load and characteristics. An equally plausible alternative is variability in the bone marrow niche that might favor differential abundance of stem/lineage-biased progenitors in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baryawno et al., 2017</xref>). Once established, at least a subset of the LSCs is likely to be independent of BCR::ABL1 kinase signaling for their survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhatia et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamilton et al., 2012</xref>). However, whether their self-sustenance involves switching to non-kinase activity of BCR::ABL1 protein, or achieving total BCR::ABL1 independence, and whether such mechanisms are inherently active in treatment naïve cells or become active only after exposure to TKIs is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao and Deininger, 2020</xref>).</p><p>We foresee future investigations to provide several key insights. First, accurate and direct detection of fusion transcripts such as BCR::ABL1 in single cells as part of scRNA-seq remains a major constraint, however, new approaches should allow direct measurement of BCR::ABL1 on a massive scale. Second, CITE-seq, a single-cell multiome approach, like any other high-throughput single-cell method comes with methodological, technical, and biological challenges. Cell sample handling, library preparation, sequencing quality and depth, drop-out of lowly expressed genes, and taking a molecular ‘snapshot’ of cells in time are all merely some factors that could introduce variability and noise to the data. A simpler, faster, and cheaper FACS panel detecting CD26<sup>+</sup> and CD35<sup>+</sup> surface markers can possibly work as an applicable clinical tool to quantify leukemic and non-leukemic stem cells in CML patients. Future prospective studies of this FACS panel coupled to clinical trials in large patient cohorts will establish the diagnostic and prognostic value of the relative abundance of these populations. It will be importance to evaluate if CD26<sup>-</sup>CD35<sup>+</sup> cells are critical for restoring normal hematopoiesis once the TKI therapy diminishes the leukemic load, and whether patients with low counts of CD26<sup>-</sup>CD35<sup>+</sup> cells at diagnosis have a relatively higher risk of developing hematologic toxicity such as cytopenia during therapy. The relative levels of CD26<sup>-</sup> and CD35<sup>+</sup> stem cells for TFR will also be an important area of investigation.</p><p>Third, joint longitudinal analysis of leukemic as well as immune compartments is likely to be informative, especially for TFR. The observations that patients with activated immune signature at diagnosis are more likely to optimally respond to TKIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Radich et al., 2023</xref>) serve as apt reminder for collective analyses. Fourth, our capacity to generate single-cell datasets, ironically outpaces our ability to extract information. Development of tools that allow biologists and clinicians to analyze large-scale datasets without requiring dedicated bioinformatics infrastructure can overcome the challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dhapola et al., 2022</xref>). Finally, the clonal relationships and lineage output of candidate BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSC subpopulations remain unknown. By coupling sc-multiomics with barcoding analysis and lineage tracing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wagner and Klein, 2020</xref>), it should be possible to evaluate, for instance, whether the BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup>CD26<sup>+</sup> cells detected in patients in TFR are a sub-clone that persists from diagnosis through therapy, and whether it is responsible for recurrence in TFR.</p><p>The notion of LSCs has been invoked for a long time in the genetically defined and molecularly targeted paradigm of CML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holyoake and Vetrie, 2017</xref>). Still, these entities remain essentially peripheral to the disease management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao and Deininger, 2021</xref>). We posit that the heterogeneity of LSCs is a barrier towards their efficient measurement and safe purging. Our high-resolution single-cell multiomics maps suggest how to probe and deconstruct heterogeneity of CML, thereby permitting inference of leukemic vs. non-leukemic cells, estimation of BCR::ABL1<sup>+</sup> LSCs, enumeration of their molecular features, and prospective isolation. Understanding how the cellular heterogeneity and plasticity emerges in the absence of extensive genetic variability would inform if the fully leukemogenic residual cells could either be safely eliminated pharmacologically or kept perpetually suppressed by an empowered immune system to avoid recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsieh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhao and Deininger, 2023</xref>). Alternatively, longitudinal sampling and sc-omics combined with barcoding may also reveal if the stem cell subpopulations and states are interconvertible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lenaerts et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marjanovic et al., 2013</xref>), and, therefore, appear as potentially inexhaustible pool that can only be slowly eroded by several years of TKI treatment in a subset of patients. A more formidable barrier is the unstated but still presumed equivalence of immunophenotype and function. Rather than describing LSCs solely by surface markers, we propose that treating leukemic cellular clones as the fundamental units of selection and evolution during therapy would have a more meaningful impact in predicting response to existing therapy and switch to another TKI. The next line of advances will require assessing LSCs as pool of clones defined by their ability to contribute to primary and secondary resistance in patients on therapy, and recurrence in TFR without recourse to animal models.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patient samples</title><p>The bone marrow was obtained from patients enrolled in either BosuPeg clinical trial (NCT03831776), NordCML006 (NCT00852566), BFORE (NCT02130557), or from Skåne University Hospital, Lund after informed consent and processed according to the guidelines approved by regional research ethics committees of sites involved in the trial.

Cells were sorted directly into 200 μl Stem Span Serum-Free Expansion Medium (SFEM, StemCell Technologies), supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Hyclone) and the following cytokines from PeproTech: SCF (100 ng/ml), Flt3L (100 ng/ml), TPO (50 ng/ml), and IL7 (10 ng/ml). Cells were visualized and counted in each well thrice a day using an inverted microscope for &gt;140 hr. Dead cells as well as cells that did not divide during this period were excluded from the analysis. The Curve fit-sigmoid approach in GraphPad Prism was used to analyze the data.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group

This provides important insight into why some CML patients are &quot;optimal responders&quot; to TKI therapy while others experience treatment failure. CITE-seq in CML patients revealed several important findings. First, substantial cellular heterogeneity was observed at diagnosis, suggesting that this is a hallmark of CML. Further, patients who experienced treatment failure demonstrated increased numbers of primitive cells at diagnosis compared to optimal responders. This finding was validated in a bulk gene expression dataset from 59 CML patients, in which it was shown that the proportion of primitive cells versus lineage-primed cells correlates to treatment outcome. Even more importantly, because CITE-seq quantifies cell surface protein in addition to gene expression data, the authors were able to identify the BCR/ABL+ and BCR/ABL- CML stem cells express distinct cell surface markers (CD26+/CD35- and CD26-/CD35+, respectively). In optimal responders, BCR/ABL- CD26-/CD35+ CML stem cells were predominant, while the opposite was true in patients with treatment failure. Together, these findings represent a critical step forward for the CML field and may allow more informed development of CML therapies, as well as the ability to predict patient outcomes prior to treatment.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is an important, beautifully written, well-referenced study that represents a fundamental advance in the CML field. The data are clean and compelling, demonstrating convincingly that optimal responders and patients with treatment failure display significant differences in the proportion of primitive cells at diagnosis, and the ratio of BCR-ABL+ versus negative LSCs. The finding that BCR/ABL+ versus negative LSCs display distinct surface markers is also key and will allow for more detailed interrogation of these cell populations at a molecular level.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>CITE-seq was performed in only 9 CML patient samples and 2 healthy donors. Additional samples would greatly strengthen the very interesting and notable findings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92074.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Warfvinge</surname><given-names>Rebecca</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Lund university</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lund</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Geironson Ulfsson</surname><given-names>Linda</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lund</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dhapola</surname><given-names>Parashar</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lund</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Safi</surname><given-names>Fatemeh</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lund</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sommarin</surname><given-names>Mikael</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lund</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Soneji</surname><given-names>Shamit</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Lund University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lund</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hjorth-Hansen</surname><given-names>Henrik</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>St Olavs Hospital, Norwegian University of Science and Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Trondheim</named-content></addr-line><country>Norway</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mustjoki</surname><given-names>Satu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Helsinki</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Helsinki</named-content></addr-line><country>Finland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Richter</surname><given-names>Johan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lund</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Thakur</surname><given-names>Ram Krishna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lund</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Karlsson</surname><given-names>Göran</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lund</named-content></addr-line><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This study, utilizing CITE-Seq to explore CML, is considered a useful contribution to our understanding of treatment response.

In view of the comments of the three reviewers, we have increased the number of CML patient samples analyzed to confirm all the major findings included in the manuscript. In total, more than 80 patient samples across different approaches have now been analyzed and incorporated in the revised manuscript.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first single cell multiomics report in CML and differs substantially from the recent single cell omics-based reports where single modalities were measured one at a time (Krishnan et al., 2023; Patel et al., 2022). Thus, the sc-multiomic investigation of LSCs and HSCs from the same patient addresses a major gap in the field towards managing efficacy and toxicity of TKI treatment by enumerating CD26+CD35- LSCs and CD26-CD35+ HSCs burden and their ratio at diagnosis vs. 3 months of therapy. The findings suggest design of a simpler and cheaper FACS assay to simultaneously stratify CML patients for TKI efficacy as well as hematologic toxicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1:</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Warfvinge et al. reports the results of CITE-seq to generate singlecell multi-omics maps from BM CD34+ and CD34+CD38- cells from nine CML patients at diagnosis.

Although the authors discuss the potential heterogeneity of primitive stem, they do not directly address the heterogeneity of hematopoietic potential or response to TKI treatment in the results presented. Another limitation is that the BCR-ABL + versus BCR-ABL- status of cells was not confirmed by direct sequencing for BCR-ABL. The BCR-ABL status of cells sorted based on CD26 and CD35 was evaluated in only two samples. We also note that the surface markers identified were previously reported by the same authors using different single-cell approaches, which limits the novelty of the findings. It will be important to determine whether the GEP and surface markers identified here are able to distinguish BCR-ABL+ and BCR-ABL- primitive stem cells later in the course of TKI treatment. Finally, although the authors do describe differential gene expression between CML and normal, BCR:ABL+ and BCR:ABL-, primitive stem cells they have not as yet taken the opportunity to use these findings to address questions regarding biological mechanisms related to CML LSC that impact on TKI response and outcomes.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor comment: Fig 4 legend -E and F should be C and D.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for positive assessment of our work.

To confirm our findings in a larger cohort we have therefore adopted a computational deconvolution approach, CIBERSORT to analyze a larger number of independent samples (n=59). This reflects a growing, sustainable trend to study larger number of patients in face of still prohibitively expensive but potentially insightful scomics approaches (For example, please see Zeng et al, A cellular hierarchy framework for understanding heterogeneity and predicting drug response in acute myeloid leukemia, Nature Medicine, 2022).</p><p>However, in view of the comment, we have now substantially increased the number of analyzed patients in the revised manuscript. These include increased number of patient samples to investigate the ratio between CD35 and CD26 marked populations at diagnosis, and 3 months of TKI therapy (from n=8 to n=12 with now 6 optimal responders and 5 treatment failure at diagnosis and after TKI therapy), qPCR for BCR::ABL1 expression status at diagnosis (from n=3 to n=9) , and followed up the BCR::ABL1 expression in three additional samples after TKI therapy. Moreover, we examined the CD26 and CD35 marked populations for expression of GAS2, one of our top candidate LSC signature genes in three additional samples at diagnosis and at 3m follow up. Thus, &gt;80 patient samples across different approaches have been analyzed to strengthen all major conclusions of the study.</p><p>We emphasize that we were cautious in generalizing the observation obtained from any one approach and sought to confirm any major finding using at least one complementary method. As an example, although CITE-seq (n=9) showed altered frequency of all cell clusters between optimal and poor responders (Fig. 3B), we refrained from generalizing because our independent large-scale computational deconvolution analysis (n=59) only substantiated the altered proportion of primitive and myeloid cell clusters (Fig. 3E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the authors discuss the potential heterogeneity of primitive stem, they do not directly address the heterogeneity of hematopoietic potential or response to TKI treatment in the results presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for noting the discussion on heterogeneity of the primitive stem cells. As described in the original manuscript, the figure 6 D-E showed a relationship between heterogeneity and TKI therapy response. The results showed that CD35+/CD26+ ratio within the HSC fraction associated with this therapy response. We have now increased the number of patient samples analyzed and present the updated results in the revised manuscript (now figure 6 C-D). These observations set the stage for assessing whether long term therapy outcome can also be influenced by heterogeneity at diagnosis.</p><p>We have shown the hematopoietic potential of HSCs marked by CD35 expression in an independent parallel study and therefore only mentioned it concisely in the current manuscript. A combination of scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and cell surface proteomics showed CD35+ cells at the apex of healthy human hematopoiesis, containing an HSCspecific epigenetic signature and molecular program, as well as possessing self-renewal capacity and multilineage reconstitution in vivo and vitro. The preprint is available as Sommarin et al. ‘Single-cell multiomics reveals distinct cell states at the top of the human hematopoietic hierarchy’, Biorxiv;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.01.437998v2.full</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We also note that the surface markers identified were previously reported by the same authors using different single-cell approaches, which limits the novelty of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Our current manuscript is indeed a continuation of and builds onto our previous paper (Warfvinge R et al. Blood, 2017). In contrast to our previous report which was limited to examination of only 96 genes per cell, CITE-seq allowed us to examine the molecular program of cells using unbiased global gene expression profiling. Finally, although CD26 appears, once again as a reliable marker of BCR::ABL1+ primitive cells, CD35 emerges as a novel and previously undescribed marker of BCR::ABL1- residual stem cells. A combination of CD35 and CD26 allowed us to efficiently distinguish between the two populations housed within the Lin-34+38/low stem cell immunophenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another limitation is that the BCR-ABL + versus BCR-ABL- status of cells was not confirmed by direct sequencing for BCR-ABL. The BCR-ABL status of cells sorted based on CD26 and CD35 was evaluated in only two samples</p></disp-quote><p>Single cell detection of fusion transcripts is challenging with low detection sensitivity in single cell RNA-seq as has been noted previously (Krishnan et al. Blood, 2023, Giustacchini et al. Nature Medicine, 2017, Rodriguez-Meira et al. Molecular Cell, 2019). However, this is likely to change with the inclusion of targetspecific probes in scRNA-seq library preparation protocols. Nonetheless, in view of the comment, we have included more patient samples from the previous n=3 to current n=10 (including TKI treated samples) for direct assessment of BCR-ABL1 status by qPCR analysis; the updated results are included in the revised manuscript (Figure 6A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It will be important to determine whether the GEP and surface markers identified here are able to distinguish BCR-ABL+ and BCR-ABL- primitive stem cells later in the course of TKI treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed qPCR to check for BCR::ABL1 status, and the level of GAS2, one of the top genes expressed in CML cells within CD26+ and CD35+ cells at diagnosis and following 3 months of TKI therapy. The results showed that while CD26+ are BCR::ABL1+, the CD35+ cells are BCR::ABL1- at both time points.Moreover, the expression of LSC-specific gene, GAS2 was specific to BCR::ABL1+ CD26+ cells at both diagnosis as well as following 3 months of TKI therapy. The new results are presented in figure 6B in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, although the authors do describe differential gene expression between CML and normal, BCR:ABL+ and BCR:ABL-, primitive stem cells they have not as yet taken the opportunity to use these findings to address questions regarding biological mechanisms related to CML LSC that impact on TKI response and outcomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our major focus here was to characterize the cellular heterogeneity coupled to treatment outcome and therefore we did not delve deep into the molecular mechanisms underlying TKI response. However, in response to this comment, as mentioned above, we noted that one of the top genes in BCR::ABL1 cells (Fig. 4 C; right; in red), GAS2 (Growth Specific Arrest 2) was expressed at both diagnosis and TKI therapy within CD26+ cells relative to CD35+ cells (updated figure 6B). Interestingly, GAS2 was also detected in CML LSCs in a recent scRNA-seq study (Krishnan et al. Blood, 2023) suggesting GAS2 upregulation could be a consistent molecular feature of CML cells. GAS2 has been previously noted as deregulated in CML (Janssen JJ et al. Leukemia, 2005, Radich J et al, PNAS, 2006), control of cell cycle, apoptosis, and response to Imatinib (Zhou et al. PLoS One, 2014). Future investigations are warranted to assess whether GAS2 could play a role in the outcome of long-term TKI therapy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors use single-cell &quot;multi-comics&quot; to study clonal heterogeneity in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and its impact on treatment response and resistance.

As described above in response to the comments from reviewer 1, multiomic CITE-seq allows extraction of two modalities in comparison to a typical scRNA-seq, however, this also makes it even more limited in the number of samples processed in a sustainable way. This was one of the motivations to analyze a larger number of independent samples (n=59) while benefiting from the insights gained from CITE-seq (n=9). Furthermore, by analyzing CD34+ cells from bone marrow and peripheral blood of CML patients, including both responders and non-responders after one year of Imatinib therapy, we were able to significantly diversity the patient pool, which was lacking in our CITE-seq patient pool. As mentioned above, this reflects a growing trend to analyze larger number of patients while anchoring the analysis on prohibitively expensive but potentially insightful sc-omics approaches (For example, please see Zeng et al, A cellular hierarchy framework for understanding heterogeneity and predicting drug response in acute myeloid leukemia, Nature Medicine, 2022).</p><p>As emphasized above, we frequently sought to confirm the findings from one approach using a complementary method and independent samples.

Therefore, we have updated the discussion as recommended by the reviewer (paragraph 5 in the discussion).</p><p>We also note that CITE-seq, in contrast to scRNA-seq alone provides dual features: surface marker/protein as well as RNA for annotating the same cluster. In our manuscript, for example, cell clusters in UMAP for normal BM; Fig 1B were described using both surface markers (Fig. 1C) and RNA (Fig. 1D) making the cluster identity robust. To further elaborate this approach, a new supplementary figure 1C shows annotations of clusters using both RNA and surface markers.</p><p>To potentially address the issue of stability of clusters and gene expression, we compared the marker genes for major clusters from nBM from this study (supplementary table 4, Warfvinge et al.) with those described recently in a scRNA-seq study by Krishnan et al. supplementary table 8, Blood, 2023 using Cell Radar, a tool that identifies and visualizes which hematopoietic cell types are enriched within a given gene set (description: https://github.com/KarlssonG/cellradar; Direct link: https://karlssong.github.io/cellradar/). To compare, we used our in-house gene list for the major clusters as well as mapped the same number of top marker genes based on log2FC from corresponding cluster from Krishnan et al. as inputs to Cell Radar.

We anticipate that future investigations, clinical studies might examine whether CD26CD35+ cells could be plausible candidates for restoring normal hematopoiesis once the TKI therapy diminishes the leukemic load, and whether patients with low counts of CD35+ cells at diagnosis have a relatively higher chance of developing hematologic toxicity such as cytopenia during therapy.</p><p>We briefly mentioned this possibility in the discussion; however, we have now moved it to another paragraph to highlight the same.

This provides important insight into why some CML patients are &quot;optimal responders&quot; to TKI therapy while others experience treatment failure. CITE-seq in CML patients revealed several important findings. First, substantial cellular heterogeneity was observed at diagnosis, suggesting that this is a hallmark of CML. Further, patients who experienced treatment failure demonstrated increased numbers of primitive cells at diagnosis compared to optimal responders. This finding was validated in a bulk gene expression dataset from 59 CML patients, in which it was shown that the proportion of primitive cells versus lineage-primed cells correlates to treatment outcome. Even more importantly, because CITE-seq quantifies cell surface protein in addition to gene expression data, the authors were able to identify that BCR/ABL+ and BCR/ABL- CML stem cells express distinct cell surface markers (CD26+/CD35- and CD26-/CD35+, respectively). In optimal responders, BCR/ABL- CD26-/CD35+ CML stem cells were predominant, while the opposite was true in patients with treatment failure. Together, these findings represent a critical step forward for the CML field and may allow more informed development of CML therapies, as well as the ability to predict patient outcomes prior to treatment.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is an important, beautifully written, well-referenced study that represents a fundamental advance in the CML field. The data are clean and compelling, demonstrating convincingly that optimal responders and patients with treatment failure display significant differences in the proportion of primitive cells at diagnosis, and the ratio of BCR-ABL+ versus negative LSCs. The finding that BCR/ABL+ versus negative LSCs display distinct surface markers is also key and will allow for a more detailed interrogation of these cell populations at a molecular level.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>CITE-seq was performed in only 9 CML patient samples and 2 healthy donors.

Additional samples would greatly strengthen the very interesting and notable findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive assessment of our manuscript. As mentioned in response to comments from reviewer 1 and 2, CITE-seq remains an reource consuming single cell method potentially limiting the number of patients to be analyzed. However, during the revision process, we have increased the number of patient material analyzed for other assays; these include increased number to investigate the ratio between CD35+ and CD26+ populations at diagnosis, and 3 months of TKI therapy, qPCR for BCR::ABL1, and patients examined for GAS2, one of the top genes expressed in CML cells. Thus, &gt;80 patient samples across different assays have been analyzed to strengthen the conclusions. (Please see comment to reviewer 1 for more details)</p></body></sub-article></article>
