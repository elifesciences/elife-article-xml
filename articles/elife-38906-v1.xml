We investigated the evolution of <italic>HMGCS2</italic>, the key enzyme required for ketone body biosynthesis (ketogenesis). Unexpectedly, we found that three mammalian lineages, comprising cetaceans (dolphins and whales), elephants and mastodons, and Old World fruit bats have lost this gene. Remarkably, many of these species have exceptionally large brains and signs of intelligent behavior. While fruit bats are sensitive to starvation, cetaceans and elephants can still withstand periods of fasting. This suggests that alternative strategies to fuel large brains during fasting evolved repeatedly and reveals flexibility in mammalian energy metabolism. Furthermore, we show that <italic>HMGCS2</italic> loss preceded brain size expansion in toothed whales and elephants. Thus, while ketogenesis was likely important for brain size expansion in modern humans, ketogenesis is not a universal precondition for the evolution of large mammalian brains.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38906.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our brain requires a lot of energy to work properly. Sugars are usually the main type of fuel for the body, but when they run low – for example during a food shortage – fat, in the form of fatty acids, can be used instead. However, the brain cannot directly process these molecules; instead, fatty acids need to go through ketogenesis, a process that turns fat into ketone bodies, which the organ can then burn. Scientists believe that the ability to create ketone bodies was essential for us to evolve large brains. Yet, it is still unclear if all mammals can transform fatty acids into ketone bodies. One way to look into this question is to track whether other species have HMGCS2, the main enzyme that drives ketogenesis.</p><p>Jebb and Hiller examined the genomes of 70 different species of mammals for the gene that codes for HMGCS2. The comparisons revealed that cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises), Old World fruit bats and the African savanna elephant have all independently lost their working version of HMGCS2. Yet, many members of these three groups have evolved brains that are large for their body size. The genetic analyses showed that dolphins and elephants developed big brains after the enzyme became inactive, challenging the idea that HMGCS2 – and by extension ketogenesis – is always required for the evolution of large brains.</p><p>These results may also be useful for conservation efforts. Many fruit bats across the world are severely threatened, and their lack of ketogenesis could explain why these animals are highly sensitive to starvation and quickly die when food becomes scarce.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mammals</kwd><kwd>cetaceans</kwd><kwd>fruit bats</kwd><kwd>elephants</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hiller</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HI 1423/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hiller</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The evolutionary loss of the main enzyme required for ketone body biosynthesis suggests that alternative strategies to provide energy for large brains during fasting evolved repeatedly in mammals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Periods of fasting are a common event for many animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Secor and Carey, 2016</xref>). Fasting occurs due to natural food scarcity or as part of the life history strategy, for example during hibernation or migration. During fasting, the organism relies on stored sources of energy such as glucose in the form of glycogen and fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Secor and Carey, 2016</xref>). In addition, ketone bodies become an alternative fuel source that is important for many mammals to survive episodes of fasting or starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baird et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouchat et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sicart et al., 1978</xref>). For example, ketone bodies are used as an energy source in hibernating ground squirrels or elephant seal pups during their post-weaning fasting period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krilowicz, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castellini and Costa, 1990</xref>). Notably, while the brain cannot metabolize fatty acids, ketone bodies can cross the blood-brain barrier and provide fuel under conditions of low blood glucose levels. For example, after starving for 3 days, the human brain takes 25% of its energy from ketone bodies and if fasting continues, ketone bodies replace glucose as the predominant fuel for brain metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Owen et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hasselbalch et al., 1994</xref>). During the neonatal period, the developing human brain has high energy requirements and also relies on ketone bodies as a major fuel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cunnane and Crawford, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cahill, 2006</xref>). Given their importance in fueling large, energetically expensive brains, it has been posited that ketone bodies do not only have an important role during fasting, but have also been crucial for brain expansion during human evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cunnane and Crawford, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Ketone bodies comprise acetoacetate, acetone, and d-β-hydroxybutyrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and are mainly produced in the liver by ketogenesis. This metabolic process occurs in the mitochondria and uses fatty acid-derived acetyl-CoA to generate the water-soluble, acidic ketone bodies, which are secreted into the blood. The rate limiting step of ketogenesis is the production of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) by HMG-CoA synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hegardt, 1999</xref>). Mammals possess two HMG-CoA synthases that originated by gene duplication. While the cytosolic enzyme, encoded by <italic>HMGCS1</italic>, is broadly expressed and is necessary to produce cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hegardt, 1999</xref>), the mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase, encoded by <italic>HMGCS2</italic>, is primarily expressed in the liver and is only used for ketone body production. <italic>HMGCS2</italic> is required for ketogenesis, as mutations in the human gene and mouse gene-knockdown experiments abolish or greatly reduce ketogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouchard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thompson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wolf et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pitt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cotter et al., 2014</xref>). HMG-CoA synthase-2 deficiency in human can lead to coma after fasting for more than 22 hours due to low glucose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thompson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morris et al., 1998</xref>).

Together with the conserved genomic context, the lack of any evidence of a remaining functional <italic>HMGCS2</italic> in unassembled reads and the validated gene-inactivating mutations, we conclude that the main ketogenesis enzyme is lost in three independent mammalian lineages. Finally, we considered the possibility that HMGCS1, the cytosolic HMG-CoA synthase, may compensate for <italic>HMGCS2</italic> loss, which would require HMGCS1 to be localized in the mitochondria, where ketogenesis happens in other species. We found that the HMGCS1 protein of cetaceans, pteropodids and elephant does not possess a mitochondrial targeting domain. Furthermore, an analysis of available liver RNA-seq data from the minke whale and Egyptian fruit bat provides no indication of alternative or novel exons in <italic>HMGCS1</italic> that could encode such a targeting signal. Thus, HMGCS1 does not seem to be capable of compensating for the loss of <italic>HMGCS2</italic>, suggesting that ketogenesis is lost in cetaceans, pteropodids and Elephantimorpha.</p><p>Next, we investigated whether the loss of <italic>HMGCS2</italic> is associated with the loss of other enzymes in the ketogenesis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>ACAT1</italic> and <italic>HMGCL</italic> do not exhibit inactivating mutations in cetaceans, pteropodids and the elephant, likely because the respective enzymes are not only required for the production of ketone bodies but are also involved in leucine and isoleucine metabolism. In contrast to these two pleiotropic genes, <italic>BDH1</italic> is only involved in converting acetoacetate into the ketone body d-β-hydroxybutyrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that <italic>BDH1</italic> exhibits several inactivating mutations and evolved under relaxed selection in cetaceans and pteropodids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Overall, this suggests that the loss of <italic>HMGCS2</italic> is only associated with the loss of non-pleiotropic genes in the ketogenesis pathway.</p><p>The 59 other mammals, for which the genome assembly fully covered the <italic>HMGCS2</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), do not exhibit inactivating mutations in this gene. Consistent with the presence of a functional gene, we further estimated an average non-synonymous/synonymous (dN/dS) ratio of 0.16, which indicates that <italic>HMGCS2</italic> evolves under strong purifying selection in other mammals.</p><p>The observation that <italic>HMGCS2</italic> is well-conserved in the majority of mammals is consistent with ketogenesis being an important metabolic process. However, the recurrent loss of <italic>HMGCS2</italic> raises the question of which energy source is used by the brain during fasting. Consistent with the loss of ketogenesis in cetaceans, bottlenose dolphins do not produce ketone bodies after fasting for 3 days but are nevertheless able to maintain high blood glucose levels over this entire period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ridgway, 2013</xref>). It was suggested that dolphins maintain high glucose levels by synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrates (gluconeogenesis), in particular from glucogenic amino acids that are abundant in their diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ridgway, 2013</xref>). This suggests that ketogenesis became dispensable in dolphins and that <italic>HMGCS2</italic> was lost as a consequence of relaxed or no selection to maintain this gene. Similarly, the loss of ketogenesis in pteropodid fruit bats may be a consequence of the relatively constant availability of fruit year-round, which provides large quantities of glucose. This is in agreement with molecular dating, which estimates that the loss of <italic>HMGCS2</italic> happened rather late in the lineage leading to the fruit bat clade and may even have occurred independently after the split of the frugivorous flying foxes and the Egyptian fruit bat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistent with lack of ketone bodies as alternative fuel, Egyptian fruit bats that were fasted for more than 24 hours in captivity frequently died (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van der Westhuyzen, 1978</xref>). Thus, like HMG-CoA synthase-2 deficient human individuals, these bats are sensitive to starvation. Hence, while ketogenesis may have been lost under ancestral conditions of constantly available, glucose-rich food, the loss of <italic>HMGCS2</italic> may now represent a disadvantage, which will be of interest to ongoing conservation efforts for ecologically and economically important species in the pteropodid family. In contrast to cetaceans and fruit bats, little is known about how elephants respond to fasting; however, the following observation is consistent with the loss of ketogenesis. During musth, when elephant males experience longer periods of fasting and can lose 10% of their body weight, their blood becomes slightly more alkaline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rasmussen and Perrin, 1999</xref>). This is contrary to an increased blood acidity that would be expected from an increasing production of acidic ketone bodies.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38906.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>HMGCS2</italic> loss and brain size evolution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In pteropodids, molecular dating estimates that the loss of <italic>HMGCS2</italic> happened 29–18 Mya and thus may overlap the split of the flying foxes and the Egyptian fruit bat. It is not possible to resolve whether gene loss happened before or after the split as <italic>HMGCS2</italic> is completely deleted in the Egyptian fruit bat. While horseshoe bats and other insectivorous bat lineages have brains not larger than expected for their body size (encephalization quotient (EQ) &lt;1), brain size has increased in the lineage leading to the fruit bats that have EQ values &gt; 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stephan et al., 1981</xref>). Thus, brain size expansion presumably predates the loss of ketogenesis. (<bold>B</bold>) <italic>HMGCS2</italic> was already lost in the cetacean ancestor before the split of toothed and baleen whales ~ 36 Mya, as inferred from shared inactivating mutations in exons 1, 2 and 8. Molecular dating further estimates that the loss of this gene happened early on the cetacean branch 50–47 Mya. The cetacean ancestor had a brain slightly larger than expected for its body size with an EQ of 1.4. While EQ values increased and decreased in several cetacean lineages, brain size has greatly expanded in dolphins, reaching an EQ of 3.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Montgomery et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, brain size expansion in dolphins occurred after the loss of ketogenesis. (<bold>C</bold>) Early proboscids such as <italic>Moeritherium</italic>, an extinct lineage that split from other proboscids ~ 43 Mya, had brains about 20% of the size expected for a mammal of the same body size, and thus an EQ of 0.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shoshani et al., 2006</xref>). Exact EQ values of Palaeomastodons are not known; however, fossils have a small braincase, which indicates a low EQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanders et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benoit, 2015</xref>). In contrast, mastodons that diverged from elephants ~ 27 Mya had brains about twice as large as expected from their body size (EQ 2.2), similar to extant elephants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shoshani et al., 2006</xref>). This suggests that brain size expansion happened in a period between 37 and 27 Mya. Molecular dating indicates that <italic>HMGCS2</italic> loss happened between 45 and 42 Mya, suggesting that the loss of ketogenesis precedes brain size expansion in the elephant lineage.

For example, the encephalization quotient (EQ), measuring the ratio between the observed brain size and the size expected for a mammal of the same body weight, is 3.7 for the bottlenose dolphin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Montgomery et al., 2013</xref>). Compared to human, dolphins and elephants are also among the few mammals that have a higher degree of neocortex folding, a measure that positively correlates with neuron number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lewitus et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, while powered flight imposes a constraint on body and brain size in bats, pteropodid fruit bats exhibit a well-developed visual brain system and have brains nearly twice as large as that of insectivorous vesper bats of equal body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stephan et al., 1981</xref>). Species in all three lineages also exhibit cognitive behaviors that are regarded as a sign of intelligence, exemplified by vocal learning and, in dolphins and elephants, by complex social structures, tool use and self-recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krützen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foerder et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poole et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Plotnik et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the loss of <italic>HMGCS2</italic> in independent large-brained species suggests that ketone bodies are not strictly required to fuel large mammalian brains during fasting.</p><p>Finally, the timing of <italic>HMGCS2</italic> loss has implications for understanding the general preconditions for brain size expansion during the evolution of mammals. While the loss of <italic>HMGCS2</italic> in pteropodids likely happened after brain size expansion in this lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), shared inactivating mutations show that <italic>HMGCS2</italic> was already inactivated in the cetacean ancestor, and thus prior to a period of brain size expansion that resulted in the large brains of dolphins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boddy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Montgomery et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For the elephant lineage, we used molecular dating to estimate that <italic>HMGCS2</italic> was lost around 45–42 Mya (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Thus, like in toothed whales, the loss of this gene likely occurred prior to the period that led to large relative brain sizes in modern elephants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shoshani et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Consequently, while ketogenesis was likely a crucial factor for brain size increase in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cunnane and Crawford, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), the loss of ketogenesis has not prohibited drastic evolutionary brain size expansion in two other mammalian lineages.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified three independent losses of <italic>HMGCS2</italic> in placental mammals. While this may contribute to starvation sensitivity in fruit bats, cetaceans and elephants can withstand periods of fasting. Hence, alternative strategies to fuel large brains during fasting have evolved at least twice, revealing flexibility in the energy metabolism of mammals. Finally, the timing of <italic>HMGCS2</italic> loss indicates that ketogenesis is not a universal precondition for the evolution of large mammalian brains.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Vincent J Lynch as a guest Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wittkopp as the Senior Editor.

This is surprising because fatty acid-derived ketone bodies provide energy for the brain during neonatal development and fasting suggesting there is strong selection to maintain this gene and pathway. These data suggest that cetaceans, Old World fruit bats, and Proboscideans either evolved alternative metabolic strategies to deal with <italic>HMGCS2</italic> loss or some other functionally similar gene performs a similar role as <italic>HMGCS2</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) If ketones are no longer used for ATP production do other genes in the pathway show evidence of reduced purifying selection or loss?</p><p>2) Given the ability to estimate a relative date of loss of elephants why not bats and cetaceans?</p><p>3) Please confirm <italic>HMGCS2</italic> loss using the more recent loxAfr4 assembly; It's likely missing in loxAfr4 as well but best to confirm.</p><p>4) The fact that HMGCS1 is localized in the cytosol, and not in mitochondria, implies that HMGCS1 cannot rescue the lack of HMCGS2 (if so, please mention in the manuscript, and provide references supporting this fact). Along these lines, is it possible to show that HMGCS1 does not have a putative gain of a &quot;novel alternative exon1&quot; in HMGCS1 coding for a mitochondrial targeting domain could allow to make this paralog to be functionally redundant with <italic>HMGCS2</italic> (and making it therefore dispensable)? While the reviewers understand that this scenario may be remote, in such case those species could continue producing ketone bodies, which therefore would significantly affect the main conclusions of the manuscript. Is there EST (transcriptomic) data for any of the species that has lost HMCGS2 to discard (or at least check) that possibility? Gene prediction software could also be helpful to check for the presence of such potential mitochondria-target exon in HMGCS1 (which in principle should be shared within each group of mammals that share the loss to corroborate its presence).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38906.089</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) If ketones are no longer used for ATP production do other genes in the pathway show evidence of reduced purifying selection or loss?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this question. The first and third steps in the ketogenesis pathway are catalyzed by <italic>ACAT1</italic> and <italic>HMGCL</italic>, respectively. We found that these genes do not have any inactivating mutations in the lineages that lost <italic>HMGCS2</italic>. This is probably explained by the fact that both enzymes are also required for amino acid metabolism. <italic>BDH1</italic> is a non-pleiotropic enzyme that converts the ketone body acetoacetate into the ketone body d-β-hydroxybutyrate. We found that this gene is lost in cetaceans and pteropodids, where several inactivating mutations are present together with a signature of relaxed selection. No evidence for loss or relaxed selection was found in the elephant. Analyzing this gene in other mammals, we found that the shrew probably also lacks this enzyme, while <italic>ACAT1, HMGCS2</italic> and <italic>HMGCL</italic> are fully intact in this species. Similar to <italic>Bdh1</italic> knockout mice, acetoacetate and acetone are likely the main ketone bodies in the shrew.</p><p>These findings are shown in a new Figure 1—figure supplement 5 and described in a new paragraph:</p><p>“Next, we investigated whether the loss of <italic>HMGCS2</italic> is associated with the loss of other enzymes in the ketogenesis pathway (Figure 1A). […] Overall, this suggests that the loss of <italic>HMGCS2</italic> is only associated with the loss of non-pleiotropic genes in the ketogenesis pathway.”</p><p>We also added the three gene symbols to Figure 1A and better described enzyme function in the legend:</p><p>“With the exception of the mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase (<italic>HMGCS2</italic>, red font), the other two enzymes required for acetoacetate production also have roles in amino acid metabolism and are thus pleiotropic. <italic>BDH1</italic> is only required for converting acetoacetate into d-β-hydroxybutyrate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given the ability to estimate a relative date of loss of elephants why not bats and cetaceans?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now performed molecular dating for the fruit bat and cetacean lineage. To get estimates as precise as possible, we first investigated <italic>HMGCS2</italic> in species that represent their closest outgroups, using new genomes that recently became available. For the fruit bats, we inspected the genome of the horseshoe bat (the closest insectivorous outgroup) and found that this bat has an intact, annotated gene. For cetaceans, we aligned the hippo genome, which also revealed an intact gene. Both species have been added to the phylogenetic tree in Figure 1B. To estimate a Ka/Ks value for the internal branches along which the gene was lost, we used PAML. For the fruit bats, we estimate that <italic>HMGCS2</italic> loss occurred rather late on the branch and overlaps the split of the flying foxes and the Egyptian fruit bat (note that it cannot be resolved whether the gene was lost before or after the split since the gene is entirely deleted in the latter species). For cetaceans, we estimate a loss relatively soon after the split from the hippo lineage. To present these results, we decided to split the previous Figure 1 and show the molecular dating results for all three lineages in a new Figure 2A-C.</p><p>Since our full alignment now contains two additional species, we re-estimated the date of <italic>HMGCS2</italic> loss in the elephant lineage with PAML. Furthermore, we now included not only the African savanna elephant sequence in the alignment but also the sequences from the forest elephant, Asian elephant and mastodon that we obtained by aligning genomic read data. While this makes the assumption that the other Elephantimorpha species share the same deletion of <italic>HMGCS2</italic> exons 1-5, we believe adding additional species will increase the precision of the estimate. As shown in Supplementary file 3, with additional Elephantimorpha, we obtained a younger, probably more precise loss estimate of 45 to 42 Mya, which overlaps the split of the low-EQ Moeritherium. Importantly, the Palaeomastodon, a more recent lineage that split ~37 Mya from other proboscids (added to Figure 2C), is also described to have had a small braincase and thus probably had a low EQ, which suggests that loss of ketogenesis still predates the period of brain size expansion in Proboscidea.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please confirm HMGCS2 loss using the more recent loxAfr4 assembly; It's likely missing in loxAfr4 as well but best to confirm.</p></disp-quote><p>We downloaded the loxAfr4 genome and aligned it to the human genome. The loxAfr4 genome assembly confirms the genomic rearrangements including the deletion of most <italic>HMGCS2</italic> exons. We added to the legend of Figure 1—figure supplement 2:</p><p>“Alignment chains to the African savanna elephant loxAfr4 assembly are virtually identical and confirm the partial <italic>HMGCS2</italic> deletion.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The fact that HMGCS1 is localized in the cytosol, and not in mitochondria, implies that HMGCS1 cannot rescue the lack of HMCGS2 (if so, please mention in the manuscript, and provide references supporting this fact). Along these lines, is it possible to show that HMGCS1 does not have a putative gain of a &quot;novel alternative exon1&quot; in HMGCS1 coding for a mitochondrial targeting domain could allow to make this paralog to be functionally redundant with HMGCS2 (and making it therefore dispensable)? While the reviewers understand that this scenario may be remote, in such case those species could continue producing ketone bodies, which therefore would significantly affect the main conclusions of the manuscript. Is there EST (transcriptomic) data for any of the species that has lost HMCGS2 to discard (or at least check) that possibility? Gene prediction software could also be helpful to check for the presence of such potential mitochondria-target exon in HMGCS1 (which in principle should be shared within each group of mammals that share the loss to corroborate its presence).</p></disp-quote><p>We investigated the <italic>HMGCS1</italic> protein sequences in each loss species with TargetP, which reveals no evidence for the presence of a mitochondrial targeting domain. In order to identify novel or alternative first exons that could provide a new N-terminus, we first inspected available Augustus gene predictions for putative alternative <italic>HMGCS1</italic> transcripts and again found no mitochondrial targeting domain. Second, for the Egyptian fruit bat and the minke whale, RNA-seq data from the liver (the site of ketogenesis in other species) is available. By processing and analyzing this data, we found no evidence for alternative or novel first exons in the Egyptian fruit bat. For the minke whale, RNA-seq data showed an upstream first exon; however, this exon did not contain an ATG start codon, showing that this exon is part of the UTR and that the minke whale <italic>HMGCS1</italic> does not encode a different N-terminus.</p><p>These results are added as to the main text:</p><p>“Finally, we considered the possibility that <italic>HMGCS1</italic>, the cytosolic HMG-CoA synthase, may compensate for <italic>HMGCS2</italic> loss, which would require <italic>HMGCS1</italic> to be localized in the mitochondria, where ketogenesis happens in other species. […] Thus, HMGCS1 does not seem to be capable of compensating for the loss of <italic>HMGCS2</italic>, suggesting that ketogenesis is lost in cetaceans, pteropodids and Elephantimorpha.”</p><p>And as a new section to the Materials and methods:</p><p>“Investigating the possibility of co-option of <italic>HMGCS1</italic></p><p>We tested the amino acid sequences of the annotated or CESAR-inferred <italic>HMGCS1</italic> protein from all <italic>HMGCS2</italic> loss species for the presence of a potential mitochondrial target peptide (mTP) using TargetP [Emanuelsson et al., 2007]. […] For both species, we found no evidence of alternative or novel exons that could result in a different HMGCS1 N-terminus.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
