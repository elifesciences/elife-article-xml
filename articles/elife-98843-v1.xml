After prolonged genotoxin treatment, the checkpoint can be downregulated to allow cell cycle and growth resumption. In yeast, downregulation of the DNA damage checkpoint requires the Srs2 DNA helicase, which removes the ssDNA binding complex replication protein A (RPA) and the associated Mec1 checkpoint kinase from DNA, thus dampening Mec1-mediated checkpoint. However, it is unclear whether the ‘anti-checkpoint’ role of Srs2 is temporally and spatially regulated to allow timely checkpoint termination while preventing superfluous RPA removal. Here we address this question by examining regulatory elements of Srs2, such as its phosphorylation, sumoylation, and protein-interaction sites. Our genetic analyses and checkpoint level assessment suggest that the RPA countering role of Srs2 is promoted by Srs2 binding to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which recruits Srs2 to a subset of ssDNA containing regions. RPA antagonism is further fostered by Srs2 sumoylation, which we found depends on the Srs2-PCNA interaction and Mec1, and peaks after Mec1 activity reaches maximal levels. These data support a model in which Srs2 recruitment to PCNA adjacent to ssDNA-RPA filaments, followed by Mec1-dependent sumoylation, modulates RPA-mediated checkpoint signaling, while Srs2 action is limited at ssDNA regions lacking proximal PCNA, thereby favoring RPA-mediated ssDNA protection and repair.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA damage checkpoint</kwd><kwd>Srs2</kwd><kwd>RPA</kwd><kwd>sumolyation</kwd><kwd>PCNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM145260</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Xiaolan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Srs2 binding to PCNA and subsequent Mec1-dependent sumoylation regulate RPA-mediated checkpoint signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The DNA damage response promotes organismal survival of genotoxic stress by eliciting many cellular changes. A critical component of this response is a signaling process termed the DNA damage checkpoint (DDC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Enoch et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hartwell and Weinert, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanz et al., 2019</xref>). Upon experiencing genotoxic stress, apical DDC kinases are recruited to DNA lesion sites by the damage sensing proteins and are then activated by activator proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Usui et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zou and Elledge, 2003</xref>). A universal DDC sensor is the replication protein A (RPA) complex that binds with high affinity and specificity to single-strand DNA (ssDNA), whose abundance rises under almost all types of genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maréchal and Zou, 2015</xref>). Using the budding yeast system as an example, RPA bound to the ssDNA filament can interact with Ddc2 (homolog of the human ATRIP protein), the co-factor of the Mec1 (homolog of the human ATR protein) checkpoint kinase, and recruit the Mec1-Ddc2 complex to DNA lesion sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elledge, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foiani et al., 2000</xref>). Subsequently, Mec1 is activated by activator proteins, such as the 9-1-1 complex loaded at the 5’ DNA ends at ssDNA and double strand (ds) DNA junctions. Activated Mec1 can then phosphorylate multiple substrates, among which is a key downstream effector kinase Rad53, the phosphorylation of which turns on its own kinase activity and yields further phosphorylation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harrison and Haber, 2006</xref>). Collectively, the DDC kinases can modify hundreds of proteins, inducing a multitude of pathway changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanz et al., 2019</xref>). For example, DDC can arrest or delay the cell cycle progression to allow more time for genome repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanchez et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p> While DDC activation is crucial for the cell to cope with genotoxic stress, its timely downregulation is equally vital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Waterman et al., 2020</xref>). Many changes induced by the DDC kinases need to be reversed to allow continued cell growth and recovery. For example, the DDC-mediated cell cycle arrest has to be lifted to allow proliferation and alternative DNA repair mechanisms permitted at other cell cycle phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pellicioli et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Waterman et al., 2020</xref>). Thus far, DDC downregulation has been mainly studied using the model organism yeast, with several strategies being identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Waterman et al., 2020</xref>). One of these is mediated by the DNA helicase Srs2 that targets the most upstream step of the DDC pathway through removing RPA and the associated Mec1-Ddc2 from chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhingra et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, the role of Srs2 in DDC dampening (anti-checkpoint) can be separated from its well-studied role in removing the recombinase Rad51 from ssDNA (anti-recombination) that modulates homologous recombination levels and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhingra et al., 2021</xref>). The former role of Srs2 is critical for cell survival of genotoxins, such as camptothecin (CPT) that traps Top1 on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhingra et al., 2021</xref>). Considering that other organisms also possess DNA helicases capable of removing RPA from ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hormeno et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenkins, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shorrocks et al., 2021</xref>), it is plausible that an anti-checkpoint strategy involving RPA antagonism may be present beyond yeast.</p><p> Currently, little is known about how checkpoint dampening can be temporally controlled to minimize interference with the initial DDC activation that must occur in the early phase of the DNA damage response. In the case of the Srs2-mediated checkpoint regulation, it is also unclear how the process can minimize superfluous removal of RPA from ssDNA sites that are unlikely to induce the DDC due to lacking 5’ DNA ends at ss-dsDNA junctions for 9-1-1 loading, such as at those formed at R-loops. The main functions of RPA at these sites can be ssDNA protection and repair, rather than DDC induction, thus these sites may benefit from shielding from Srs2-mediated RPA removal. In addressing these questions, we hypothesize that Srs2-based RPA antagonism should be selective in location and timing, and that the regulatory elements within the Srs2 protein may contribute to such selectivity.</p><p> To examine the above hypothesis and to define Srs2 features relevant to its RPA antagonism during DDC regulation, we inspected Srs2 protein sites involved in its post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins. Our genetic analyses of mutations affecting each of these sites suggest that while most of the examined features do not affect RPA antagonism, Srs2 binding to PCNA, which marks 3’ DNA ends of ss-dsDNA junctions that flank ssDNA gaps or tails, and Srs2 sumoylation contribute to RPA regulation in the context of DDC. Srs2 binding to PCNA is known to recruit Srs2 to replication perturbation sites, while the roles of Srs2 sumoylation were less clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kolesar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moldovan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papouli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pfander et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saponaro et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, we found that Srs2 binding to PCNA and Srs2 sumoylation are functionally related since PCNA binding promotes Srs2 sumoylation. Moreover, Srs2 sumoylation level peaks late in the response to genomic stress after the DDC kinases are hyper-activated, and this modification depends on the Mec1 checkpoint kinase. Collectively, our data suggest a model wherein Srs2 can distinguish between two types of ssDNA regions using PCNA proximity as a guide for subsequent sumoylation, RPA removal, and countering hyper-activated checkpoint.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Srs2 regulatory features and their disabling mutants</title><p>To understand which Srs2 attributes are relevant to RPA regulation during the DNA damage response, we examined mutant alleles that perturb known features of the Srs2 protein. Srs2 was reported to contain a helicase domain at its N-terminal region and three protein–protein interaction sites at its C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Niu and Klein, 2017</xref>). We have previously shown that the Srs2 ATPase-dead allele (<italic>srs2-K41A</italic>) fails to downregulate both RPA levels on chromatin and the Mec1-mediated DDC, indicating a requirement of ATPase-driven stripping of RPA from ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhingra et al., 2021</xref>). The reported Srs2 protein-binding sites include a Rad51 binding domain (Rad51-BD), a PCNA interaction motif (PIM), and a SUMO interaction motif (SIM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colavito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kolesar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kolesar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papouli et al., 2005</xref>).

First, seven Cdk1 phosphorylation consensus sites of Srs2 were mutated to produce the <italic>srs2-7AV</italic> (T604V, S698A, S879A, S893A, S938A, S950A, and S965A) allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiolo et al., 2005</xref>), which was previously shown to affect homologous recombination.

Purified RPA complex containing these mutations exhibited a twofold increase in dissociation constant using ssDNA as substrate, compared to the wild-type RPA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhingra et al., 2021</xref>). In cells, <italic>rfa1-zm2</italic> supports normal Rfa1 protein level, cell growth, DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhingra et al., 2021</xref>). It also did not affect gene conversion, direct repeat repair or rDNA recombination, nor the hyper-recombination phenotype of <italic>srs2∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhingra et al., 2021</xref>).

We employed two readouts for DDC that are widely used. First, we used the F9 antibody, which specifically recognizes phosphorylated Rad53, to measure the levels of activated Rad53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fiorani et al., 2008</xref>). Second, we measured cellular ability to timely exit the G2/M phase after CPT treatment using FACS analyses. We note that CPT-induced DDC leads to G2/M delay rather than an arrest as shown in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhingra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Menin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Redon et al., 2003</xref>).

To test this idea, we examined the consequences of removing the Slx4-mediated anti-checkpoint function in <italic>srs2-∆PIM</italic> cells. Slx4 is known to bind the scaffold protein Rtt107, and their complex can compete with the DDC protein Rad9 for binding to damaged chromatin, consequently disfavoring Rad9’s role in promoting Rad53 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohouo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohouo et al., 2013</xref>).

This is because PCNA loading requires an ssDNA and dsDNA junction site with a 3’ DNA end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moldovan et al., 2007</xref>). We thus reasoned that Srs2 binding to PCNA may prevent Srs2 from removing RPA bound to ssDNA that is not flanked by PCNA, such as within R-loop regions and negatively supercoiling DNA regions, both of which are generated abundantly in CPT conditions due to topological stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pommier et al., 2022</xref>). This could provide a means for spatial control of Srs2’s anti-RPA role. We explored whether this role could also be regulated temporally. As the genetic data described above suggest that Srs2 sumoylation acts downstream of Srs2 binding to PCNA in antagonizing RPA, we examined the timing of Srs2 sumoylation after CPT treatment.</p><p> We released G1 synchronized cells into media containing CPT and examined Srs2 sumoylation at several time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Quantification of Srs2 sumoylated forms relative to its unmodified forms showed that its sumoylation level peaked between 1.5 and 2 hours after cells were released into CPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Quantification of phosphorylated forms of Rad9 relative to its unmodified form showed that checkpoint activation peaked 1 hour after cell release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). That checkpoint level peaked before Srs2 sumoylation level peaked suggests a possible dependence of the latter on the checkpoint.

We thus tested whether Mec1-mediated phosphorylation may render RPA more susceptible to being removed from ssDNA by Srs2. To this end, we mutated previously identified Mec1 phosphorylation sites on the Rfa1 and Rfa2 subunits. These include Rfa1 Ser178 and three sites on Rfa2 (S122, S187, S189) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albuquerque et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2010</xref>).

Here we address this question in the context of Srs2-mediated DDC dampening in budding yeast. Our previous work reports a requirement of Srs2’s ATPase activity in this role; here we examined additional Srs2 features involved in either binding to other proteins or post-translational modifications. Our results suggest that among the examined features, Srs2 binding to PCNA and its sumoylation are involved in RPA antagonism during DDC downregulation. We showed that mutants impairing these features, namely <italic>srs2∆-PIM</italic> and <italic>srs2-3KR</italic>, suppressed both DDC abnormalities and CPT sensitivity of <italic>rfa1-zm2</italic> cells. Interestingly, these features are functionally linked, since optimal Srs2 sumoylation requires its binding to PCNA. Further, the Srs2 sumoylation level peaks after Mec1 activity reaches its maximum and that Mec1 is required for this modification. We posit a model that can interpret previous and current data. In this model, Srs2 removal of RPA is favored at a subset of ssDNA-containing regions that have proximal PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, top). PCNA recruits Srs2 toward the adjacent RPA-ssDNA filament and promotes Srs2 sumoylation together with hyperactive Mec1 to foster downregulation of the Mec1 checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, bottom).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A working model for the regulation of Srs2-mediated checkpoint dampening.</title><p>RPA-coated ssDNA regions generated from multiple DNA metabolic processes include those without proximal PCNA, such as ssDNA within R-loops and negatively supercoiled regions, and those with proximal PCNA, such as ssDNA gaps associated with perturbed DNA replication or repair. In latter situations, the resultant RPA-ssDNA can recruit the Mec1/Ddc2 kinase complex. Mec1 is subsequently activated by other DDC proteins, such as the 9-1-1 complex that demarcates the 5’ end junctions adjacent to ssDNA regions (not drawn). After DDC is activated for a prolonged period, Srs2 recruited to PCNA that demarcates the 3’ end junction flanking the ssDNA regions can be sumoylated. Srs2 sumoylation level increases as Mec1 activation heightens and can result in more efficient RPA removal, leading to Mec1 downregulation.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-98843-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p> RPA-ssDNA filaments can be separated into two groups from the perspective of PCNA loading status. The first group contains 3’ DNA end at the ss-dsDNA junction that permit PCNA loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, top, green). These regions can include ssDNA gaps produced from perturbed replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sogo et al., 2002</xref>) or from excision and repair of trapped Top1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). Due to PCNA proximity, this group of ssDNA regions can favor Srs2 recruitment and RPA removal. Since they often also contain 5’ DNA ends required for loading the 9-1-1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Majka et al., 2006</xref>), these sites can be ideal for Srs2’s action in checkpoint dampening. Biochemical data suggested that PCNA is loaded exclusively at the 3’ DNA ends at ssDNA-dsDNA junctions by the RFC complex in the presence of RPA, though PCNA loading could occur at 5’ DNA ends in the absence of RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ellison and Stillman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Majka et al., 2006</xref>). We thus do not exclude the possibility that ssDNA-dsDNA junctions containing 5’ DNA ends, such as those formed at resected DNA breaks, may also allow Srs2-based RPA regulation. The second group of ssDNA regions is devoid of DNA ends and thus PCNA loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, top, white). These regions can be within R-loops or negatively supercoiled regions, which are induced by CPT treatment due to increased topological stress associated with the depletion of the functional pool of Top1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pommier et al., 2022</xref>). These regions are unlikely to contain DNA ends at ss-dsDNA junctions; thus, RPA there mainly supports DNA protection and repair and not DDC. We reason that these ssDNA sites can be shielded from Srs2 removal of RPA to allow better repair and protection. The notion that ssDNA regions close to PCNA are preferred for Srs2 anti-checkpoint action provides a rationale for how Srs2 could remove RPA at some sites while minimizing unnecessary RPA loss from other sites. Quantitative assessment of RPA residence on DNA and genome-wide mapping of Srs2 action sites in the future can further test the proposed models and provide more clarity. Regardless, results presented in this work provide evidence for the model that Srs2 can distinguish between two types of ssDNA regions using PCNA proximity as a guide for RPA removal.</p><p>Genetic analysis showed that <italic>srs2∆-PIM</italic> also suppressed <italic>rfa1-zm2</italic> sensitivity toward MMS, though to a less degree than seen in CPT conditions. While more than one factor could contribute to this difference, we note that CPT only activates the DNA damage checkpoint, while MMS additionally induces the DNA replication checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Menin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Redon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tercero et al., 2003</xref>). It is thus possible that the Srs2-RPA antagonism is more important for the DNA damage checkpoint compared with the DNA replication checkpoint. With this said, we do not exclude the possibility that the Srs2-RPA antagonism may also be relevant to specific forms of DNA repair. Further investigation of this possibility among others will shed light on differential suppressive effects seen here.</p><p>An involvement of Srs2-PCNA binding in Srs2-based RPA regulation could compensate for a lack of interaction between Srs2 and RPA. This scenario differs from Srs2-based Rad51 stripping that requires Srs2 interacts with Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antony et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colavito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krejci et al., 2003</xref>). It is thus likely that though both the anti-recombinase and anti-checkpoint roles of Srs2 benefit from selectivity of protein to be stripped from DNA, they are achieved via different means. Our previous work has provided several lines of evidence to support that Rad51 removal by Srs2 can be functionally separable from the Srs2-RPA antagonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhingra et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with this conclusion, deleting the Rad51 binding domain in Srs2 had no effect on <italic>rfa1-zm2</italic> phenotype in CPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This contrasts with mutating the PCNA binding and the sumoylation sites of Srs2, which suppressed <italic>rfa1-zm2</italic> defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This data provides additional evidence that Srs2 regulation of Rad51 is separable from the Srs2-RPA antagonism at genetic level. For this reason, the Srs2-based Rad51 function was not further examined in this study. However, future studies to address how Srs2 regulates RPA and Rad51 in different manners and whether there is a crosstalk between them in specific contexts will help to generate a more comprehensive understanding of both roles of Srs2.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that both PIM and SIM aid Srs2 recruitment to sumoylated form of PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papouli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pfander et al., 2005</xref>). Our data reveal that at least in CPT conditions, Srs2-PIM, but not Srs2-SIM, is involved in RPA regulation. This observation is congruent with phenotypic differences between Srs2’s PIM and SIM seen in other studies and here, such as a much stronger genotoxic sensitivity of the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kolesar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kolesar et al., 2012</xref>). Considering that only a small percentage of PCNA is sumoylated and mainly during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papouli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pfander et al., 2005</xref>), it is probably advantageous for Srs2 not being restricted to sumoylated PCNA in order to achieve efficiency in RPA regulation.</p><p>How could Srs2 binding to PCNA helps Srs2 sumoylation? While a full answer awaits future studies, we speculate that this interaction may render Srs2 more permissive for sumoylation and/or position Srs2 in proximity with its sumoylation E3 ligase Siz2 that binds RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chung and Zhao, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kolesar et al., 2012</xref>). Considering that Mec1, Ddc2, and RPA contain SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Psakhye and Jentsch, 2012</xref>), it is possible that sumoylation could help enrich Srs2 at ssDNA-RPA sites via SIM interactions, though other effects are possible. Compared with <italic>srs2-3KR</italic>, <italic>srs2-∆PIM</italic> showed better suppression of <italic>rfa1-zm2</italic> defects. This indicates that during RPA regulation, PCNA plays additional roles besides promoting Srs2 sumoylation.</p><p>We found that Srs2 sumoylation in cells also requires Mec1, which does not promote sumoylation in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cremona et al., 2012</xref>). On the contrary, Mec1 loss causes increased sumoylation levels of multiple proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cremona et al., 2012</xref>). It is currently unclear how Mec1 can specifically promote Srs2 sumoylation, but this may involve Mec1-mediated phosphorylation of SUMO substrates and/or enzymes. A requirement of Mec1 for Srs2 sumoylation and the dynamic nature of sumoylation suggest that Srs2 sumoylation may be a potential timing regulator. It is possible that hyperactivation of Mec1 favors Srs2 sumoylation that may aid its own downregulation. While fully testing this idea requires time-course phosphor-proteomic studies under genotoxin treatment, we examined a Mec1 auto-phosphorylation site implicated in its downregulation after induction of a single DNA break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Memisoglu et al., 2019</xref>). We did not find evidence that it is involved in Mec1 dampening in CPT condition, raising the possibility that distinct mechanisms may be used in different genomic stress conditions. We also found that two phosphorylation sites on Srs2 that showed Mec1 dependency in proteomic studies had no effect in the CPT situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albuquerque et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Faca et al., 2020</xref>); however, we note that these sites do not fit with the typical S/TQ Mec1 consensus sites, thus may not be the bona fide Mec1 sites. Other phosphorylation sites examined here include five Mec1 sites on Rfa1 and Rfa2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albuquerque et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Genetic analyses did not support their roles in the Srs2 and RPA antagonism. Thus, comprehensively map DDC kinase phosphorylation sites on Srs2, RPA, and possibly their regulators, such as the RPA chaperone Rtt105 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li, 2018</xref>), will be needed to identify targets of the kinases that can facilitate Srs2-based RPA regulation.</p><p>While we provide multiple lines of evidence in support of the involvement of Srs2 binding to PCNA and its sumoylation in RPA regulation during DDC downregulation, <italic>srs2-∆PIM</italic> or <italic>-3KR</italic> alone behaved normally in checkpoint assays. A lack of defect here can be due to buffering effects, both from not-yet -characterized Srs2 features and from other checkpoint dampening pathways. In addressing the former possibility, we tested the separation pin of Srs2 (Y775).</p><p>This residue was shown to be key for the Srs2’s helicase activity in vitro in a report that was published during the revision of our work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meir et al., 2023</xref>). We found that <italic>srs2-Y775A</italic> that severely compromised the Srs2 helicase activity rescued <italic>rfa2-zm2</italic> sensitivity to CPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). This result suggests that Y775 could contribute to in vivo RPA removal; future examination of this feature in conjunction with PCNA binding and sumoylation, can extend our understanding of Srs2-mediated DDC regulation. We also provided evidence for the latter possibility since <italic>srs2-∆PIM</italic> or <italic>-3KR</italic> showed additive phenotype when combined with a <italic>slx4</italic> mutant defective in DDC dampening function. The presence of multiple checkpoint-dampening factors that target different checkpoint modules highlights the importance of the process. Recent demonstration of other DNA helicases, such as the human HELB, HELQ, and BLM proteins, in stripping of RPA from ssDNA in vitro suggests that Srs2-like checkpoint downregulation may present in human cells as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hormeno et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenkins, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shorrocks et al., 2021</xref>). Since RPA-ssDNA binding not only plays a key role in checkpoint, but also in many other processes, the Srs2 features uncovered here may help to better understand how RPA dynamics is controlled by helicases and other factors during additional processes beyond DDC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

In addition, Srs2 plays a key role in in ribonucleotide excision repair. Besides DNA repair defects, srs2 mutants also show a reduced recovery after DNA damage that is related to its role in downregulating the DNA damage signaling or checkpoint response. Recent work from the Zhao laboratory (PMID: 33602817) identified a role of Srs2 in downregulating the DNA damage signaling response by removing RPA from ssDNA. This manuscript reports further mechanistic insights into the signaling downregulation function of Srs2.</p><p>Using the genetic interaction with mutations in RPA1, mainly rfa1-zm2, the authors test a panel of mutations in Srs2 that affect CDK sites (srs2-7AV), potential Mec1 sites (srs2-2SA), known sumoylation sites (srs2-3KR), Rad51 binding (delta 875-902), PCNA interaction (delta 1159-1163), and SUMO interaction (srs2-SIMmut). All mutants were generated by genomic replacement and the expression level of the mutant proteins was found to be unchanged. This alleviates some concern about the use of deletion mutants compared to point mutations. Double mutant analysis identified that PCNA interaction and SUMO sites were required for the Srs2 checkpoint dampening function, at least in the context of the rfa1-zm2 mutant. There was no effect of this mutants in a RFA1 wild type background. This latter result is likely explained by the activity of the parallel pathway of checkpoint dampening mediated by Slx4, and genetic data with an Slx4 point mutation affecting Rtt107 interaction and checkpoint downregulation support this notion. Further analysis of Srs2 sumoylation showed that Srs2 sumoylation depended on PCNA interaction, suggesting sequential events of Srs2 recruitment by PCNA and subsequent sumoylation. Kinetic analysis showed that sumoylation peaks after maximal Mec1 induction by DNA damage (using the Top1 poison camptothecin (CPT)) and depended on Mec1. This data are consistent with a model that Mec1 hyperactivation is ultimately leading to signaling downregulation by Srs2 through Srs2 sumoylation. Mec1-S1964 phosphorylation, a marker for Mec1 hyperactivation and a site found to be needed for checkpoint downregulation after DSB induction, did not appear to be involved in checkpoint downregulation after CPT damage. The data are in support of the model that Mec1 hyperactivation when targeted to RPA-covered ssDNA by its Ddc2 (human ATRIP) targeting factor, favors Srs2 sumoylation after Srs2 recruitment to PCNA to disrupt the RPA-Ddc2-Mec1 signaling complex. Presumably, this allows gap filling and disappearance of long-lived ssDNA as the initiator of checkpoint signaling, although the study does not extend to this step.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The manuscript focuses on the novel function of Srs2 to downregulate the DNA damage signaling response and provide new mechanistic insights.</p><p>(2) The conclusions that PCNA interaction and ensuing Srs2-sumoylation are involved in checkpoint downregulation are well supported by the data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98843.4.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Jiayi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Molecular Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dhingra</surname><given-names>Nalini</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Molecular Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Tammy</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Hunter College</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Vicki</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>City University of New York Hunter College</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Xiaolan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Molecular Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Overall, the data presented in this manuscript is of good quality.

Many of the conclusions are based on reasonable assumptions about the consequences of various mutations, but direct evidence of changes in Srs2 association with PNCA or other interactors is still missing. There is an assumption that a deletion of a Rad51-interacting domain or a PCNA-interacting domain have no pleiotropic effects, which may not be the case. How SLX4 might interact with Srs2 is unclear to me, again assuming that the SLX4 defect is &quot;surgical&quot; - removing only one of its many interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous studies have already provided direct evidence for the interaction between Srs2 and PCNA through the Srs2’s PIM region (Armstrong et al, 2012; Papouli et al, 2005); we have added these citations in the text. Similarly. Srs2 associations with SUMO and Rad51 have also been demonstrated (Colavito et al, 2009; Kolesar et al, 2016; Kolesar et al., 2012), and these studies were cited in the text.</p><p>We did not state that a deletion of a Rad51-interacting domain or a PCNA-interacting domain have no pleiotropic effects. We only assessed whether these previously characterized mutant alleles could mimic <italic>srs2∆</italic> in rescuing <italic>rfa1-zm2</italic> defects.</p><p>We assessed the genetic interaction between <italic>slx4-RIM</italic> and <italic>srs2-∆PIM</italic> mutants, and not the physical interaction between the two proteins. As we described in the text, our rationale for this genetic test is based on that the reports that both <italic>slx4</italic> and <italic>srs2</italic> mutants impair recovery from the Mec1 induced checkpoint, thus they may affect parallel pathways of checkpoint dampening.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One point of concern is the use of t-tests without some sort of correction for multiple comparisons - in several figures. I'm quite sceptical about some of the p &lt; 0.05 calls surviving a Bonferroni correction. Also in 4B, which comparison is **? Also, admittedly by eye, the changes in &quot;active&quot; Rad53 seem much greater than 5x. (also in Fig. 3, normalizing to a non-WT sample seems odd).</p></disp-quote><p>Claims made in this work were based only on pairwise comparison not multi-comparison. We have now made this point clearer in the graphs and in Method. As the values were compared between a wild-type strain and a specific mutant strain, or between two mutants, we believe that t-test is suitable for statistical analysis.</p><p>Figure 4B, ** indicates that the WT value is significantly different from that of the <italic>slx4-RIM srs2-∆PIM</italic> double mutant and from that of <italic>srs2-∆PIM</italic> single mutant. We have modified the graph to indicate the pair-wide comparison. The 5-fold change of active Rad53 levels was derived by comparing the values between the <italic>srs2∆ PIM slx4RIM-TAP</italic> double mutant and wild-type Slx4-TAP. In Figure 3, normalization to the lowest value affords better visualization. This is rather a stylish issue; we would like to maintain it as the other reviewers had no issues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the WT doubling time for this strain? From the FACS it seems as if in 2 h the cells have completed more than 1 complete cell cycle. Also in 5D. Seems fast...</p></disp-quote><p>Wild-type W303 strain has less than 90 min doubling time as shown by many labs, and our data are consistent with this. The FACS profiles for wild-type cells shown in Figures 3C, 4C, and 5C are consistent with each other, showing that after G1 cells entered the cell cycle, they were in G2 phase at the 1-hour time points, and then a percentage of the cells exited the first cell cycle by two hours.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have one over-arching confusion. Srs2 was shown initially to remove Rad51 from ssDNA and the suppression of some of srs2's defects by deleting rad51 made a nice, compact story, though exactly how srs2's &quot;suppression of rad6&quot; fit in isn't so clear (since Rad6 ties into Rad18 and into PCNA ubiquitylation and into PCNA SUMOylation). Now Srs2 is invoked to remove RPA. It seems to me that any model needs to explain how Srs2 can be doing both. I assume that if RPA and Rad51 are both removed from the same ssDNA, the ssDNA will be &quot;trashed&quot; as suggested by Symington's RPA depletion experiments. So building a model that accounts for selective Srs2 action at only some ssDNA regions might be enhanced by also explaining how Rad51 fits into this scheme.</p></disp-quote><p>While the anti-recombinase function of Srs2 was better studied, its “anti-RPA” role in checkpoint dampening was recently described by us (Dhingra et al, 2021) following the initial report by the Haber group some time ago (Vaze et al, 2002). A better understanding of this new role is required before we can generate a comprehensive picture of how Srs2 integrates the two functions (and possibly other functions). Our current work addresses this issue by providing a more detailed understanding of this new role of Srs2.</p><p>Single molecular data showed that Srs2 strips both RPA and Rad51 from ssDNA, but this effect is highly dynamic (i.e. RPA and Rad51 can rebind ssDNA after being displaced) (De Tullio et al, 2017). As such, generation of “deserted” ssDNA regions lacking RPA and Rad51 in cells can be an unlikely event. Rather, Srs2 can foster RPA and Rad51 dynamics on ssDNA. Additional studies will be needed to generate a model that integrates the anti-recombinase and the anti-RPA roles of Srs2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As a previous reviewer has pointed out, CPT creates multiple forms of damage. Foiani showed that 4NQO would activate the Mec1/Rad53 checkpoint in G1- arrested cells, presumably because there would be singlestrand gaps but no DSBs. Whether this would be a way to look specifically at one type of damage is worth considering; but UV might be a simpler way to look. As also noted, the effects on the checkpoint and on viability are quite modest. Because it isn't clear (at least to me) why rfa1 mutants are so sensitive to CPT, it's hard for me to understand how srs2-zm2 has a modest suppressive effect: is it by changing the checkpoint response or facilitating repair or both? Or how srs2-3KR or srs2-dPIM differ from rfa1-zm2 in this respect. The authors seem to lump all these small suppressions under the rubric of &quot;proper levels of RPA-ssDNA&quot; but there are no assays that directly get at this. This is the biggest limitation.</p></disp-quote><p>CPT treatment is an ideal condition to examine how cells dampen the DNA damage checkpoint, because while most genotoxic conditions (e.g. 4NQO, MMS) induce both the DNA replication checkpoint and the DNA damage checkpoint, CPT was shown to only induced the latter (Menin et al, 2018; Minca &amp; Kowalski, 2011; Redon et al, 2003; Tercero et al, 2003). Future studies examining 4NQO and UV conditions can further expand our understanding of checkpoint dampening in different conditions.</p><p>We have previously provided evidence to support the conclusion that <italic>srs2</italic> suppression of <italic>rfa1-zm</italic> is partly mediated by changing checkpoint levels (Dhingra et al., 2021). We cannot exclude the possibility that the suppression may also be related to changes of DNA repair; we have now added this note in the text.</p><p>Regarding direct testing RPA levels on DNA, we have previously shown that <italic>srs2∆</italic> increased the levels of chromatin associated Rfa1 and this is suppressed by <italic>rfa1-zm2</italic> (Dhingra et al., 2021). We have now included chromatin fractionation data to show that <italic>srs2-∆PIM</italic> also led to an increase of Rfa1 on chromatin, and this was suppressed by <italic>rfa1-zm2</italic> (new Fig. S2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Srs2 has also been implicated as a helicase in dissolving &quot;toxic joint molecules&quot; (Elango et al. 2017). Whether this activity is changed by any of the mutants (or by mutations in Rfa1) is unclear. In their paper, Elango writes: &quot;Rare survivors in the absence of Srs2 rely on structure-specific endonucleases, Mus81 and Yen1, that resolve toxic joint-molecules&quot; Given the involvement of SLX4, perhaps the authors should examine the roles of structure-specific nucleases in CPT survival?</p></disp-quote><p>Srs2 has several roles, and its role in RPA antagonism can be genetically separated from its role in Rad51 regulation as we have shown in our previous work (Dhingra et al., 2021) and this notion is further supported by evidence presented in the current work. Srs2’s role in dissolving &quot;toxic joint molecules” was mainly observed during BIR (Elango et al, 2017). Whether it is related to checkpoint dampening will be interesting to address in the future but is beyond of the scope of the current work that seeks to answer the question how Srs2 regulates RPA during checkpoint dampening. Similarly, determining the roles of Mus81 and Yen1 and other structural nucleases in CPT survival is a worthwhile task but it is a research topic well separated from the focus of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Experiments that might clarify some of these ambiguities are proposed to be done in the future. For now, we have a number of very interesting interactions that may be understood in terms of a model that supposes discriminating among gaps and ssDNA extensions by the presence of PCNA, perhaps modified by SUMO. As noted above, it would be useful to think about the relation to Rad6.</p></disp-quote><p>Several studies have shown that Srs2’s functional interaction with Rad6 is based on Srs2-mediated recombination regulation (reviewed by Niu &amp; Klein, 2017). Given that recombinational regulation by Srs2 is genetically separable from the Srs2 and RPA antagonism (Dhingra et al., 2021), we do not see a strong rationale to examine Rad6 in this work, which addresses how Srs2 regulates RPA. With this said, this study has provided basis for future studies of possible cross-talks among different Srs2-mediated pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The superfamily I 3'-5' DNA helicase Srs2 is well known for its role as an anti-recombinase, stripping Rad51 from ssDNA, as well as an anti-crossover factor, dissociating extended D-loops and favoring non-crossover outcome during recombination.

The data are in support of the model that Mec1 hyperactivation when targeted to RPA-covered ssDNA by its Ddc2 (human ATRIP) targeting factor, favors Srs2 sumoylation after Srs2 recruitment to PCNA to disrupt the RPA-Ddc2-Mec1 signaling complex. Presumably, this allows gap filling and disappearance of long-lived ssDNA as the initiator of checkpoint signaling, although the study does not extend to this step.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The manuscript focuses on the novel function of Srs2 to downregulate the DNA damage signaling response and provide new mechanistic insights.</p><p>(2) The conclusions that PCNA interaction and ensuing Srs2-sumoylation are involved in checkpoint downregulation are well supported by the data.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Additional mutants of interest could have been tested, such as the recently reported Pin mutant, srs2-Y775A (PMID: 38065943), and the Rad51 interaction point mutant, srs2-F891A (PMID: 31142613).</p><p>(2) The use of deletion mutants for PCNA and RAD51 interaction is inferior to using specific point mutants, as done for the SUMO interaction and the sites for post-translational modifications.</p><p>(3) Figure 4D and Figure 5A report data with standard deviations, which is unusual for n=2.

The only issue I see remaining is the site of Srs2 action. The authors argue in favor of gaps and against R-loops and ssDNA resulting from excessive supercoiling. The authors do not discuss ssDNA resulting from processing of onesided DSBs, which are expected to result from replication run-off after CPT damage but are not expected to provide the 3'-junction for preferred PCNA loading. Can the authors exclude PCNA at the 5'-junction at a resected DSB?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a sentence stating that we cannot exclude the possibility that PCNA may be positioned at a 5’-junction, as this can be observed in vitro, albert that PCNA loading was seen exclusively at a 3’-junction in the presence of RPA (Ellison &amp; Stillman, 2003; Majka et al, 2006).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations For the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For the authors):</bold></p><p>A Bonferroni correction should be made for the multiple comparisons in several figures.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>l. 41.

In our previous report (Dhingra et al., 2021), we provided several lines of evidence to support the conclusion that Rad51 is not relevant to the Srs2-RPA antagonism. For example, while rad51∆ rescues the hyper-recombination phenotype of <italic>srs2∆</italic> cells, rad51∆ did not affect the hyper-checkpoint phenotype of <italic>srs2∆</italic>. In contrast, <italic>rfa1-zm1/zm2</italic> have the opposite effects, that is, <italic>rfa1zm1/zm2</italic> suppressed the hyper-checkpoint, but not the hyper-recombination, phenotype of <italic>srs2∆</italic> cells. The differential effects of <italic>rad51∆</italic> and <italic>rfa1-zm1/zm2</italic> were also seen for the ATPase dead allele of Srs2 (<italic>srs2K41A</italic>). For example, <italic>rfa1-zm2</italic> rescued hyper-checkpoint and CPT sensitivity of <italic>srs2-K41A</italic> cells, while <italic>rad51∆</italic> had neither effect. These and other data described by Dhingra et al (2021) suggest that Srs2’s effects on checkpoint vs. recombination can be separated genetically. Consistent with our conclusion summarized above, deleting the Rad51 binding domain in Srs2 (<italic>srs2-∆Rad51BD</italic>) has no effect on <italic>rfa1-zm2</italic> phenotype in CPT (Fig. 2D). This data provides yet another evidence that Srs2 regulation of Rad51 is separable from the Srs2RPA antagonism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>l. 525 &quot;possibility, we tested the separation pin of Srs2 (Y775), which was shown to enables its in vitro helicase activity during the revision of our work...&quot; ?? there was helicase activity during the revision of your work?
