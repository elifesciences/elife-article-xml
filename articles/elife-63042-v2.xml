surveillance pathway that degrades aberrant mRNAs and also regulates the expression of a wide range of physiological transcripts. RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 AAA-ATPases form an hetero-hexameric ring that is part of several macromolecular complexes such as INO80, SWR1, and R2TP. Interestingly, RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase activity is required for NMD activation by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that DHX34, an RNA helicase regulating NMD initiation, directly interacts with RUVBL1-RUVBL2 in vitro and in cells. Cryo-EM reveals that DHX34 induces extensive changes in the N-termini of every RUVBL2 subunit in the complex, stabilizing a conformation that does not bind nucleotide and thereby down-regulates ATP hydrolysis of the complex. Using ATPase-deficient mutants, we find that DHX34 acts exclusively on the RUVBL2 subunits. We propose a model, where DHX34 acts to couple RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase activity to the assembly of factors required to initiate the NMD response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>AAA+ ATPases</kwd><kwd>nonsense mediated mRNA decay</kwd><kwd>RUVBL1-RUVBL2</kwd><kwd>DHX34</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2017-82632-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>López-Perrote</surname><given-names>Andrés</given-names></name><name><surname>Rodríguez</surname><given-names>Carlos F</given-names></name><name><surname>Serna</surname><given-names>Marina</given-names></name><name><surname>Llorca</surname><given-names>Oscar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Autonomous Government of Madrid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Y2018/BIO4747</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>González-Corpas</surname><given-names>Ana</given-names></name><name><surname>Llorca</surname><given-names>Oscar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Autonomous Government of Madrid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P2018/NMT4443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>González-Corpas</surname><given-names>Ana</given-names></name><name><surname>Llorca</surname><given-names>Oscar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>MRC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Core funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caceres</surname><given-names>Javier F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BES-2015-071348</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rodríguez</surname><given-names>Carlos F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-EM reveals the regulation of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 AAA-ATPases by DHX34, a helicase involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), and suggests mechanisms for how RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 function in NMD.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 are two closely related AAA-type ATPases that assemble as hetero-hexameric structures made of alternating subunits and comprising six ADP/ATP-binding domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 contain a unique domain II (DII) that protrudes from one side of the hexamer and defines two distinct faces of the ring, named ATPase-face and DII-face hereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cheung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ewens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gorynia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lakomek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">López-Perrote et al., 2012</xref>). DII domains comprise an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) fold domain (DII external) that connects to the hexameric ring by a flexible region containing a ß-stalk and a helical bundle (DII internal). Each RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 subunit contains a nucleotide-binding pocket and the adjacent subunit in the hexamer provides the arginine finger motif required for hydrolysis.

This experiment suggests that RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 do not interact with UPF1 or UPF2. Together with the lack of direct interaction detected in ‘C’ and when using purified proteins in ‘B’, these experiments were interpreted as indicating a lack of interaction between RUVBL1-RUVBL2 and either UPF1 or UPF2.

In various chromatin-remodeling complexes such as INO80 and SRCAP, these ATPases form a scaffold that organizes the architecture of other subunits in the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aramayo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eustermann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Feng et al., 2018</xref>). RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 also interact with RPAP3 and PIH1D1 proteins to form the R2TP complex, a HSP90 co-chaperone involved in the assembly and maturation of some large complexes including RNA polymerase II and members of the Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family such as ATR, ATM, SMG1, and mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Houry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maurizy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muñoz-Hernández et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rivera-Calzada et al., 2017</xref>). In all these complexes, the DII-face of the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ring is used as scaffold platform for the interaction with other proteins, which are recruited by the DII domains. One exception is the C-terminal domain of RPAP3 that binds at the ATPase-face of the ring through the interaction with RUVBL2 but not RUVBL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maurizy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muñoz-Hernández et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>ATP binding or hydrolysis by RUVBL1 and/or RUVBL2 is essential to all the reported activities in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Izumi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rajendra et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Venteicher et al., 2008</xref>), but the purified proteins display very weak ATPase activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gorynia et al., 2011</xref>). Little is known about the function of RUVBL1-RUVBL2-mediated ATP hydrolysis or how this is regulated within the cell. Inhibition of the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase stabilizes interactions with clients and proteins involved in mTOR assembly in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yenerall et al., 2020</xref>). This and the low rates of ATP hydrolysis indicates that RUVBL1-RUVBL2 might not function as a processive ATPase but rather as a switch regulated through interacting partners. Recent structures suggest that the interaction of proteins with the DII domains can alter the conformation of the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 hexameric ring. PIH1D1 in the R2TP complex and the insertion domain of Ino80 in the INO80 complex interact with the DII domains, inducing conformational changes in regions of the ATPase ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aramayo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muñoz-Hernández et al., 2019</xref>). In the R2TP complex, the interaction of PIH1D1 also induces changes in a region at the N-terminus of one RUVBL2 subunit that contains two histidine residues (His<sup>25</sup> and His<sup>27</sup>) that contribute to the interaction with the nucleotide. However, it has not been demonstrated whether these changes could regulate the ATPase activity of RUVBL1-RUVBL2.</p><p>In addition to their role as components of some macromolecular complexes, RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 regulate several cellular processes, including the Fanconia Anemia (FA) pathway, the assembly of the telomerase holoenzyme, and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a mechanism that removes aberrant transcripts. In FA, RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 associate with some components of the pathway, and their depletion reduces the amount of the FA core complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rajendra et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI, a measure of the activation of the FA pathway, can be rescued by siRNA-resistant versions of RUVBL1 but not by an ATPase-dead mutant. The assembly of the human telomerase holoenzyme also requires RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 and the levels of assembled telomerase in RUVBL1-depleted cells can be rescued by the expression of the wild-type protein but not by an ATPase-deficient mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Venteicher et al., 2008</xref>). An ATPase active RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complex is also required for phosphorylation of UPF1 by the SMG1 kinase, one of the key steps to initiate NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Izumi et al., 2010</xref>). In this work, we focus on the study of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 ATPases in the context of the NMD pathway.</p><p>NMD controls the quality of mRNAs by removing aberrant transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTCs). These are generated as errors during transcription or splicing, but they also appear through germline mutations in a number of genetic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hug et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kurosaki et al., 2019</xref>). NMD also plays an important role in fine-tuning gene expression by regulating the abundance of a significant fraction of physiological transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nasif et al., 2018</xref>), affecting functions such as stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lou et al., 2016</xref>). NMD is initiated by the assembly of transient multi-subunit complexes containing the up-frameshift (UPF) core NMD factors, UPF1, UPF2, and UPF3b, bound to the target mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hug et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kurosaki et al., 2019</xref>). First, the RNA helicase UPF1 and its specific kinase SMG1 bind to eukaryotic release factors eRF1 and eRF3 at ribosomes stalled at a PTC, forming the so-called surveillance (SURF) complex, where SMG1 is inhibited by the interaction of SMG8 and SMG9, two factors that block the access to the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Melero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Remodeling of the SURF complex by the interaction with NMD core factors UPF2 and UPF3b bound to the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) leads to the phosphorylation of UPF1 by SMG1, which results in the recruitment of factors that promote mRNA degradation. A fully functional NMD response requires the contribution of several other proteins beyond the core NMD machinery, including DHX34 (<italic>DEAH box protein 34</italic>), a DEAH box family RNA helicase that is required to initiate NMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hug and Cáceres, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Longman et al., 2007</xref>). DHX34 is made of a structural core containing two canonical recombinase A (RecA)-like domains, a winged-helix domain (WH), a helical bundle (the Ratchet domain), and an OB-fold domain, followed by a short C-terminal domain (CTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hug and Cáceres, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Melero et al., 2016</xref>). DHX34 promotes UPF1 phosphorylation and although the mechanism is unknown, current evidence suggests this occurring in complex with the SMG1 kinase and its substrate UPF1. A region around the RecA domains in DHX34 binds UPF1 directly, whereas the CTD interacts with SMG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hug and Cáceres, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Melero et al., 2016</xref>). DHX34 variants lacking the CTD domain fail to promote the degradation of a PTC-containing NMD reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Melero et al., 2016</xref>). Only recently, germline pathogenic variants of DHX34 were found in four families as specific to familiar forms of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rio-Machin et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, the four variants reduced the recruitment of UPF2 and UPF3b to UPF1, resulting in reduced UPF1 phosphorylation, suggesting a link between DHX34, the NMD pathway and the etiology of some inherited forms of these myeloid malignances.</p><p>RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 are also potential new non-canonical NMD regulators. Knockdown of RUVBL1 or RUVBL2 reduces SMG1-mediated UPF1 phosphorylation and affects the degradation of a PTC-containing β-globin reporter. These defects could only be recovered with wild-type and not ATPase-dead mutant versions of RUVBL1 indicating that the ATPase activity of the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complex is required to initiate the NMD response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Izumi et al., 2010</xref>). How RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 participate in NMD and how their ATPase activity is regulated in this pathway remains enigmatic.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that RUVBL1-RUVBL2 hetero-hexamers can bind directly to DHX34 in vitro and in cells in culture. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reveals that DHX34 induces global conformational changes in the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complex with the RUVBL2 subunit being mostly affected. DHX34 destabilizes the N-termini of all RUVBL2 subunits and in consequence ATP hydrolysis activity by RUVBL2 is reduced. This demonstrates that interacting partners can profoundly affect the structure and activity of RUVBL1-RUVBL2 hetero-hexameric complexes. Our results suggest that DHX34 could couple the regulation of RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase activity to the assembly of the complexes that initiate the NMD response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RUVBL1-RUVBL2 and DHX34 form a complex in vitro and in cells</title><p>To uncover the function of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 in NMD, we sought to address whether these AAA-ATPases can interact directly with some of the core protein factors involved in the initiation of NMD. Pull-down experiments from cell extracts cannot easily differentiate direct interactions from those associations that are mediated by connecting partners. Thus, we first tested which NMD factors could bind directly to RUVBL1-RUVBL2 using purified proteins and in vitro interaction assays, and subsequently verified them in cell lysates.</p><p>For this, RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 were co-expressed and purified as heteromeric complexes containing His-RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 in equimolar amounts, and forming oligomeric complexes where two hexameric rings interact though the DII domains, as revealed by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and in agreement with what we described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">López-Perrote et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martino et al., 2018</xref>). We first tested the interaction between RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complexes and UPF1<sup>115-914</sup> (a truncated version lacking the flexible N- and C-terminal ends of UPF1), UPF2, UPF3b, EJC, and DHX34 by pull-down experiments using the His-tag in RUVBL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Of all these, only DHX34 interacted directly with RUVBL1-RUVBL2 forming a stable complex that has not been previously described. We then verified the in vitro results using immunoprecipitation experiments from cells. When DHX34 was pulled down from cells, both RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 were detected by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). The interaction between DHX34, RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 in cell lysates was further confirmed in immunoprecipitation experiments using FLAG-RUVBL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). FLAG-RUVBL1 eluted also endogenous RUVBL1 and RUVBL2, in agreement with the oligomeric nature of the complexes formed by these ATPases. Together, these results reveal a direct interaction between RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 and DHX34.</p><p>We also analyzed the interaction with SMG1, the kinase that phosphorylates UPF1, since this is the key event triggering NMD and RUVBL1-RUVBL2 has been found in complexes containing SMG1 in cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Izumi et al., 2010</xref>). SMG1 was purified by affinity chromatography in complex with SMG8 and SMG9 and incubated with His-RUVBL1-RUVBL2. A pull-down experiment using the His-tag in RUVBL1 revealed that SMG1 forms a direct complex with RUVBL1-RUVBL2 and similar results were obtained in pull-down experiments using a FLAG-tag in SMG1 as bait. Curiously, in both types of experiments, SMG1 and RUVBL1-RUVBL2 interact but SMG8 and SMG9 were undetected in the elution, suggesting that the formation of a complex between RUVBL1-RUVBL2 and SMG1 exclude SMG8 and SMG9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>).</p><p>Together, these results indicate that RUVBL1-RUVBL2 can interact directly with the NMD factors SMG1 and DHX34.

More than 70% of particles in every position corresponded to particles clearly missing density of RUVBL2 N-terminus. Density for the N-terminus was not well defined for a small fraction of particles, but these corresponded to low-resolution structures due to the small number of images in these sub-groups. Finally, we applied a symmetry expansion strategy as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martino et al., 2018</xref>). For this, we rotated each particle around the 3-fold symmetry axis three times (0°, 120°, and 240°) to place all RUVBL1-RUVBL2 dimers in the same position, thus triplicating the data set. Next, by placing a mask around one position now containing all existing RUVBL1-RUVBL2 dimers, we subjected the symmetry-expanded data to classification, searching for heterogeneity in all the available RUVBL1-RUVBL2 dimers regardless of its position in the ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).

We and others have observed that RUVBL1-RUVBL2 co-purifies with nucleotides bound to all six subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gorynia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lakomek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Matias et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muñoz-Hernández et al., 2019</xref>), but whereas nucleotide remains bound to RUVBL1 in the RUVBL1-RUVBL2-DHX34 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), this is lost in all three RUVBL2 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The absence of density for nucleotide in RUVBL2 could not be attributed to a lack of sufficient resolution because nucleotides are clearly present in all RUVBL1 subunits in the same complex at similar resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).</p><p>DHX34 induces conformational changes in other regions of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 besides the N-termini of RUVBL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref> — <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). These changes affect mostly to the internal regions of the DII domains and regions in the AAA-ring. These changes do not affect key residues of the RUVBL1 nucleotide-binding pocket, which explains why ADP remains bound to RUVBL1 after the interaction with DHX34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The structure of the nucleotide-binding pocket in RUVBL2 is not altered significantly with respect to the crystal structure of RUVBL2 bound to nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This suggests that it is the displacement of the N-termini of RUVBL2 that is mostly responsible for the loss of nucleotide. Together, our results reveal that DHX34 affects nucleotide binding of every RUVBL2 subunit in the complex by stabilizing a conformation that displaces the N-termini of RUVBL2.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-63042-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Atomic structure of the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase ring.</title><p>Several views of the atomic model for RUVBL1-RUVBL2 to show the conformational changes in the hexameric ring after the interaction with DHX34.

In an attempt to improve the resolution of DHX34, we extracted the density corresponding to the protein in each particle by applying density subtraction methods. These images were processed and classified without the influence of RUVBL1-RUVBL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Despite our efforts, we were unable to improve the structure of DHX34. We suspect this could be a consequence of the limited number of images since small proteins need large datasets that allow classification and identification of the best particles in a homogenous conformation. This also indicates that the density of DHX34 of the cryo-EM map resolved in the context of the full RUVBL1-RUVBL2-DHX34 complex could be affected by the alignment of the AAA ring.</p><p>In isolation and at low resolution using negative-stain electron microscopy methods, DHX34 appears as a globular and compact protein comprising all of the conserved core domains, attached to a protruding extension corresponding to the C-terminal domain (CTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Melero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The CTD domains appears thicker in the volume of DHX34 than in the electron microscopy images used to obtain the low-resolution structure due to its flexibility and the use of staining agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Melero et al., 2016</xref>). We compared the cryo-EM volume of DHX34 extracted from the RUVBL1-RUVBL2-DHX34 complex with the low-resolution map of isolated DHX34. This comparison revealed that the dimensions of the DHX34 density that we observe attached to one ring of RUVBL1-RUVBL2 can only agree with one copy of DHX34, and that possibly, it is the DHX34 core domains and not the CTD that interact with RUVBL1-RUVBL2. Accordingly, purified DHX34 can still bind RUVBL1-RUVBL2 when its flexible C-terminal domain has been deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In addition, we estimated that the approximate mass of the volume occupied by DHX34 in the complex with RUVBL1-RUVBL2 is around 120 kDa by using the <italic>volume</italic> programme in EMAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ludtke et al., 1999</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blake.bcm.edu/emanwiki/Volume">https://blake.bcm.edu/emanwiki/Volume</ext-link>). This tool estimates the mass enclosed by an isosurface using an average density for proteins of 1.35 g/ml (0.81 Da/A<sup>3</sup>). Monomeric DHX34 and the DHX34 core domains alone have a molecular mass of 132 kDa and 111 kDa, respectively. Together, these analyses strongly suggest that one copy DHX34 interacts with one RUVBL1-RUVBL2 hexamer forming a complex with 3:3:1 stoichiometry.</p><p>Next, we tested whether any individual domain of DHX34 could have a significant role in mediating the interactions with RUVBL1-RUVBL2 in cultured cells. For this, we analyzed several DHX34 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We first tested a series of systematic domain deletion mutants and found that all single domain deletions retained binding to RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 to a measurable degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In order to test the importance of several DHX34 domains for RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 binding, we next analyzed larger truncated versions of DHX34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As shown by the quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, no domain is sufficient and necessary on its own to mediate the interaction with RUVBL1-RUVBL2. Heavily N- and C- terminal truncated versions of DHX34 showed a pronounced reduction in binding to RUVBL1-RUVBL2 but they could still bind to the ATPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Overall this analysis indicated that several interactions through different domains are made between DHX34 and RUVBL1-RUVBL2, which agrees with the structure of the complex that shows multiple regions of contact between DHX34 and the ATPases.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mapping the interaction between DHX34 and RUVBL1-RUVBL2 in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon depicting the functional domains of DHX34, showing the residue numbers that define their boundaries. Names of the domains are: N-terminal (NTD), L, RecA1, RecA2, winged-helix (WH), Ratchet, OB-fold and C-terminal (CTD).

RUVBL1-RUVBL2 hetero-hexameric complexes interact directly with SMG1 and also with DHX34, two factors involved in regulating NMD initiation.

Interestingly, variants of DHX34 unable to facilitate UPF1 phosphorylation have been found as pathogenic versions specific to inherited forms of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rio-Machin et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The regulation of RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase activity is poorly understood. The N-termini of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 contain two histidine residues, His<sup>25</sup> and His<sup>27</sup> in RUVBL2, that bind the nucleotide and contribute to maintain it within its binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muñoz-Hernández et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Silva et al., 2018</xref>). Here, cryo-EM reveals that the NMD factor DHX34 directly affects the conformation of RUVBL2 N-termini and decreases ATP hydrolysis. DHX34 distorts the N-terminal regions in all three RUVBL2 subunits that are not visible in the map, an indication that they are flexible and not attached to the hexameric ring after DHX34 binding. Thus, these changes provide an exit route for nucleotides, which are lost in all the RUVBL2 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We find that DHX34 down-regulates the ATPase activity of the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complex in vitro. Importantly, these effects are mediated exclusively by changes in RUVBL2 and not in RUVBL1, as shown by RUVBL2 ATPase-dead mutants not being sensible to DHX34. Together, these results show that DHX34 stabilizes a conformation of RUVBL2 unable to hydrolyze ATP.</p><p>Despite conformational changes occurring in RUVBL1 and RUVBL2, major changes and loss of nucleotide is only observed in the RUVBL2 subunits. It remains unclear how this translates to the function of the hexameric ring, but this argues in favor of a model where RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 perform different functions in the complex. Some evidence supports this model. Several reports indicate that RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 do not always share the same function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mao and Houry, 2017</xref>). The ATPase activity of RUVBL2 is several fold higher than RUVBL1 at least when expressed separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nano et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting they do not function in the same way. Along the same lines, RUVBL2 shows several specialized functions in the context of the R2TP complex. RUVBL2 binds RPAP3 and PIH1D1, two subunits of the R2TP complex, functions not shared by RUVBL1. Interestingly, cordycepin, a derivative of the nucleoside adenosine affects the circadian clock in mammals by targeting RUVBL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ju et al., 2020</xref>). A crystal structure of RUVBL1-RUVBL2 bound to cordycepin (PDB 6K0R) shows that the compound interacted with all RUVBL2 subunits but not with RUVBL1 and the N-termini of RUVBL2 were visible and folded into the protein. Therefore, it seems that RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 subunits could have specialized functions within the complex, maybe also in the context of NMD.</p><p>The role of RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase activity in cells is not understood beyond the fact that ATP binding and/or hydrolysis is essential in vivo for all the cellular pathways in which this has been analyzed. Thus, what the regulation of their ATPase activity could mean for NMD in cells is completely unknown. Purified RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complexes display low but measurable ATPase activity, which suggests that the complex might not work as a molecular motor but rather as a switch regulated by the interaction of partners. Recent experiments showed that RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 could pull-down partners of the R2TP chaperone pathway more efficiently when an inhibitor of their ATPase activity is used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yenerall et al., 2020</xref>). This was interpreted as an indication that RUVBL1-RUVBL2 may form more stable complexes in the absence of ATP hydrolysis and that hydrolysis could serve to disengage RUVBL1-RUVBL2 from its partners. The initiation of the NMD response requires the assembly of several transient macromolecular complexes involving core and auxiliary NMD factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hug et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kurosaki et al., 2019</xref>). Only when the right set of interactions has taken place, SMG1 kinase phosphorylates UPF1, which triggers a transition from an initial surveillance complex (SURF) to a decay-inducing complex (DECID) and mRNA decay. DHX34 interacts with both SMG1 and its substrate UPF1 and somehow promotes interactions with other NMD factors that activate UPF1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hug and Cáceres, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Melero et al., 2016</xref>). We can speculate that RUVBL1-RUVBL2 could contribute to these events by providing a platform that facilitates some of this complex set of interactions, coupling their ATPase activity to the formation of some of the NMD complexes. The inhibition of RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATP hydrolysis by DHX34 could maybe serve to stabilize this interaction while waiting for other NMD factors to bind DHX34 and RUVBL1-RUVBL2.</p><p>Together, our results reveal that DHX34, an NMD factor involved in NMD initiation, interacts directly with RUVBL1-RUVBL2 hetero-hexameric rings, profoundly modifying their structure and affecting their ATPase activity. This could help to couple RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase activity to the assembly of the complexes required to initiate the NMD response.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Transfections, immunoprecipitations, and western blotting</title><p>For interactions studies in cell extracts HEK293T cells were transfected with pcG-T7-DHX34 (WT and deletion mutants), pcDNA3-3xFLAG-UPF1 as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hug and Cáceres, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Melero et al., 2016</xref>), pCDNA-3xHA-Reptin or pCDNA-3xFLAG-Pontin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Izumi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rajendra et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Venteicher et al., 2008</xref>) (Addgene plasmids), pcIneoFLAG-UPF2 (generous gift from Andreas Kulozik, Heidelberg) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manuals instructions.

NADH absorbance at 340 nm was measured using a Jasco V-550 UV/VIS Spectrophotometer with a Jasco EHC-477T Temperature Controller and monitored using the ND-1000 and Spectra Manager software in time course experiments, and its decrease was used to determine ATP hydrolysis rates. Assays were performed at 37°C in 100 μl reactions in buffer 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, containing 2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), 0.5 mM NADH, 0.04 U/μl pyruvate kinase/0.05 U/μl lactic dehydrogenase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 5 mM ATP. The reaction components without the protein of study where incubated for 10 min until stabilization of the absorbance at 340 nm to allow the system to regenerate contaminant ADP. ATP hydrolysis reactions were started by addition of 3 μM of His-RUVBL1-RUVBL2 (concentration calculated considering monomers), either wild-type or ATPase-dead mutants, and in the absence or presence of 1 μM DHX34<sup>D279A</sup>, and carried out for 20 min. We used the following ATPase-dead mutants: His-RUVBL1<sup>E303Q</sup>-RUVBL2, His-RUVBL1-RUVBL2<sup>E300Q</sup> and His-RUVBL1<sup>E303Q</sup>-RUVBL2<sup>E300Q</sup>. A similar set of the experiments were performed with untagged RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complexes (wild-type and ATPase-dead mutants) after removal of the histidine tag present in RUVBL1. We also performed control experiments using wild-type DHX34 and the DHX34<sup>D279A</sup> mutant, and only buffer. Assays were performed at least by triplicate. ATP turnover (mol ATP/mol protein) indicated in min<sup>−1</sup> was calculated for a time interval during which the absorbance decrease was linear. Values in the graph are indicated as percentage of the rate of the wild-type protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Thermal stability determination</title><p>Samples thermostability was measured by nano differential scanning fluorimetry using a Tycho NT.6 instrument (NanoTemper Technologies) that measures the intrinsic fluorescence from tryptophan and tyrosine residues detected at emission wavelengths of 350 and 330 nm, as a 30°C · min−one thermal ramp is applied from 35°C to 95°C. The observed changes in fluorescence signal allows to monitor the unfolding process of the protein. The temperature at which a transition occurs, the inflection temperature (<italic>Ti</italic>), was determined by detecting the maximum of the first derivative of the fluorescence ratios (F350/F330) after fitting experimental data with a polynomial function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Accession numbers</title><p>The cryo-EM maps of the RUVBL1-RUVBL2-DHX34 complex and the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ring have been deposited in the EM database with accession codes EMD-11788 and EMD-11789 respectively.

the first structural and biochemical evidence that RuvBL1/RuvBL2 directly interacts with the RNA helicase DHX34, suggesting a potential mechanism for the previously described activity of this AAA ATPase in the initiation of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). The presented cryo-EM structure reveals how DHX34 binding to the RuvBL1/RuvBL2 heterohexamer induces a conformational change of RuvBL2's N-terminus and consequently modulates nucleotide binding and hydrolysis in every other subunit of the ATPase ring, potentially acting as a switch in orchestrating the assembly of NMD factors.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Regulation of RUVBL1-RUVBL2 AAA-ATPases by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay factor DHX34, as evidenced by Cryo-EM&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Andreas Martin as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>As you will see in the individual reviews, there are a number of issues and weaknesses, both, for the structure determination and the biochemical characterization, and with several of them consistently picked up by multiple reviewers. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers, and based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work cannot be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at this point. However, reviewers agreed that the manuscript is potential interesting, and we invite you re-submit your manuscript after the critical corrections, analyses, and additional experiments have been completed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>López-Perrote and colleagues present the structure of DHX34-bound RUVBL1-RUVBL2, which is implicated in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). This structure demonstrates how DHX34 uses most of its domains to interact with the internal regions of the DII domains in both RUVBL1 and RUVBL2, and causes large conformational changes in the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 hexamer, in particular the ATPase domain of RUVBL2. DHX34 is identified as a potential regulator of RUVBL1-RUVBL2's ATPase activity, which represents an important step in determining the mechanisms underlying the initiation of NMD.</p><p>However, before this manuscript can be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, the authors should address several concerns, as outlined below.</p><p>Major Points:</p><p>1) The authors suggest that oligomerization of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 hampers nucleotide exchange, yet this model seems not sufficiently supported by the data and the authors should adjust their discussion in this respect.</p><p>The ATP-binding pocket is located between neighboring protomers, with critical motifs contributed by both AAA domains, such that monomeric RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 are not capable of ATP hydrolysis. The comparison between hexamer and monomer is therefore unnecessary, and proposing that hexamerization lowers the ATP-hydrolysis rate does not make much sense. In fact, the subunit interface between RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 appears highly similar to that of other AAA+ motors, and it is in my opinion unlikely that the pocket itself &quot;traps&quot; the nucleotide and prevents exchange. At the various stages of the ATPase cycle (or positions in the hexameric ring), individual subunits of numerous other AAA+ hexamers show differential opening and closure of their nucleotide-binding sites. Depending on the averaging for the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 structure, subunits may appear uniformly closed, which, however, is not necessarily inconsistent with hydrolysis activity. What could contribute to the low rates, as suggested by the authors and previous studies, are the N-termini of RUVBL1/2 that seem to contact the nucleotide and in the case of RuvBL2 get released upon binding of DHX34. Given the minimal ATPase rate of 1 per min, RUVBL1/2 may indeed not work as a processive ATPase, but only as a switch that could get triggered by DHX34. In that respect this new structure is very interesting.</p><p>2) The overall analysis of nucleotide occupancies is problematic, considering that the resolution is not high enough to confidently assign nucleotides to each site.</p><p>The inherent averaging that occurs in single-particle cryo-EM image processing may very well explain the absence of detectable nucleotide in all RUVBL2 pockets of the DHX34-bound complex. As observed for many other cryo-EM structures of AAA+ motors, nucleotide pockets are highly dynamic and often less well resolved compared to the rest of the structure. Whether binding of DHX34 indeed induces a 3-fold symmetric state of the hexamer in which all 3 RUVBL2 sites are nucleotide free remains questionable. Building the class averages was likely determined by the asymmetric DHX34 density above the ring, and if the orientation of DHX34 is not well correlated with the nucleotide occupancy in a particular RuvBL2 subunit, averaging particles based on DHX34 could make it look like all 3 RuvBL2 sites are empty or lower in nucleotide density, whereas in reality it may be just one. If this were the case, the structure would resemble other AAA+ motors that show a small gap in the hexameric ring flanked by a nucleotide-free &quot;seam&quot; subunit, while all other subunits represent a continuum of nucleotide states.</p><p>To better evaluate the local resolution of the nucleotide pockets, it is necessary to have a zoomed-in view of these pockets on the ResMap of the 4.18Å RUVBL1-RUVBL2 hexameric ring (Figure 3—figure supplement 2D), highlighting the ADPs in RUVBL1. It is important to know the local resolution for these pockets, because based on the current evidence, the map alone may not provide enough detail to accurately assign nucleotides. One way to address this is by doing a more thorough analysis of the pockets themselves, including the overall size, shape, and location of key hydrolysis residues in comparison to known hydrolysis states of these pockets.</p><p>For example, in both Figure 4E and 4F it would be helpful to include labels of hydrolysis-relevant residues, like Arginine fingers and Walker A/B motifs, such that readers can easily orient themselves. In Figure 4E, the pocket looks just as &quot;open&quot; in the ATP-bound state (2XSZ) as in the DHX34-bound structure, and it is important to explain why this is considered a nucleotide-free rather than ADP- or ATP-bound state. Are there retracted residues that make this pocket incompetent for nucleotide binding? And could an ATP possibly fit into the RUVBL1 pocket? The current thresholding in Figure 4F does not exclude this possibility. It would also be appropriate to include the N-terminal histidines that directly interact with ADP in RUVBL1, as this may provide further evidence that it is indeed an ADP.</p><p>In general, it may be worth processing the data again and building class averages while masking out DHX34 to assess whether the hexamer indeed adopts a clear 3-fold symmetric state.</p><p>3) Regarding the very low ATPase rate of just 1 min-1, one potential issue may be that RUVBL1/2 was not purified in the presence of ATP and an ATP regeneration system. There are several examples of AAA+ motors that irreversibly lose robust activity when purified in the absence of ATP, and it may be worth testing whether RUVBL1/2 shows higher activities when purified in ATP.</p><p>The NADH consumption shown in Figure 5A is not linear, but increases over the 30 min measurements (30 – 60 min) for both, RUVBL1/2 and the DHX34-bound complex. What is the reason for that and what do the traces look like between the addition of RUVBL1/2 and the 30 min mark? The regeneration of ADP present in the RUVBL1/2 sample at the time of mixing should be completed within a couple of seconds, and temperature equilibration is expected to take only a couple of minutes. Non-linear absorbance changes over tens of minutes and a slow acceleration indicate that the system was not at steady state, which could also be consistent with the AAA+ motor being trapped in an inhibited state due to purification in the absence of ATP.</p><p>The authors discuss a model where ATP hydrolysis may regulate the interactions of RUVBL1/2 with other partners during NMD initiation, and the more stable binding of RUVBL1/2 to partners of the R2TP chaperone pathway in the absence of ATP hydrolysis is mentioned as an example. Similar effects have indeed been observed for various other AAA+ motors whose interactions are more dynamic during ATP hydrolysis. For RUVBL1/2, how does the very low ATPase activity of 1 min-1 compare to the off rate of its binding partners?</p><p>The authors propose that the ATPase inhibition of RUVBL1/2 by DHX34 may stabilize complexes. However, according to the presented model, DHX34 binding induces nucleotide release from every other site in the hexamer, which is expected to have distinct or even opposite effects compared to preventing hydrolysis and trapping hexamers in permanent ATP-bound states.</p><p>It is also suggested that DHX34 binding fully eliminates ATP hydrolysis (and even nucleotide interactions) in the RUVBL2 sites, while RUVBL1 &quot;continues hydrolyzing at comparable levels to those measured in the absence of HBX34&quot;. This would mean that ATPase subunits in the hexamer are completely independent in their ATP hydrolysis, with no communication between neighbors. Although this is not ruled out, it has to my knowledge not been reliable described for other AAA+ hexamers, which usually show coordinated transitions and subunit communications that are mediated by arginine fingers and various other interactions within the topologically-closed rings. In fact, the ATPase rates for the single Walker-B mutants RUVBL1(E303Q)-RUVBL2 and RUVBL1-RUVBL2(E318Q) do not show 50% lower activity, but a reduction by 80 or 75% (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B) compared to wild type, suggesting that there is indeed communication between neighboring subunits.</p><p>The authors may consider further investigating this, for instance by characterizing hexamers with Walker-A or Walker-B mutations in RUVBL2, or an Arginine-finger mutation in RUVBL1 in the presence and absence of HDX34. If the authors' model is correct, the ATPase activity of these RUVBL1/2 variants should not respond to DHX34 binding and be similar to that of DHX34-bound wild-type RUVBL1/2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Lopez-Perrote et al. show that RUVBL1-RUVBL2 participates in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway through direct interaction with the DHX34 RNA helicase. The authors present a cryo-EM structure of the complex, as well as pulldowns and functional assays that indicate DHX34 affects the conformation and activity of RUVBL1-RUVBL2.</p><p>Is there any indication of stoichiometry of DHX34 binding beside the triangular shape of the DHX34 density in the map (in Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3)? The homology model fit into the map (in Figure 3—figure supplement 3) is unconvincing as there are clear helical densities in the map that appear not to fit any of the homology model helices. Overall, the homology model and experimental map do not appear to be in good agreement. Could more than one DHX34 be binding? The map and model in their current form do not seem sufficient to answer this question.</p><p>It seems surprising that the deletion of any of the domains of DHX34 (Figure 3—figure supplement 4C) results in no loss of binding to RUVBL1-RUVBL2. This observation is particularly surprising because it suggests that any domain can be deleted without affecting the folding or soluble expression of DHX34. It is not clear from this experiment that there is a definitive threshold for &quot;loss of binding&quot;.</p><p>Further, the large variance in signal in the western blot appears to indicate that there could be a dependence on certain domains to bind (for instance RecA1), but the threshold for &quot;no binding&quot; is defined poorly. The authors should likely revise or modify the conclusion that this experiment supports the binding of all domains of DXH34 to RUVBL1-RUVBL2.</p><p>It is unclear if the 50% inhibition seen is due to incomplete binding of RUVBL1-RUVBL2 by DHX34 or if that 50% inhibition is an inherent property of the complex between the two.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The work described in this manuscript is potentially of interest but is not ready for publication in its present form for a number of reasons. While it may be difficult (impossible?) for additional lab work to be conducted at present, this should not mean that incomplete studies are suitable for publication.</p><p>1) The experiments in Figure 1 Panel D are done by mixing components in solution and allowing them to come to some sort of equilibrium. This can lead to results that are not easy to interpret correctly in the absence of appropriate controls. For example, the amount of RvbL1/2 is not constant across the 2nd gel (compare lanes 10 and 11), which suggests a problem. If the whole RvbL/SMG1/RPAP3/PIH1D1 complex is unable to be bound to the resin, then an amount will remain in solution in samples with RPAP3/PIH1D1. This is not the same result as competing for sites on RvbLs, this is competition between Rvbs and RPAP3-PIH1D1 for a site or sites on SMG1-8-9. Alternatively, a complex between SMG complex or its components and RPAP3-PIH1D1 would not stick to the resin but might prevent binding of RvbLs to SMG1. Pull downs using the FLAG tag would provide a necessary control (i.e. repeating part (C) but in the presence of RPAP3-PIH1D1). However, it would also need to be shown that SMG8-9 does not interact with RPAP3-PIH1D1 as well.</p><p>Also, in the final lane (lane 14) all bands are more intense than even the 1:4 ratio lane (lane 13), which could be consistent with a portion of RPAP3/PIH1D1 remaining in solution (e.g. bound to SMG complex or a component of it) when the SMG complex is present. It also needs to be stated somewhere what the concentration on RPAP3-PIH1D1 is in lanes 2, 7, 9 and 14. From the gel band densities in the input it would appear to be 1:4.</p><p>Consequently, the data cannot distinguish between at least three different situations (a) competition between SMG1 and RPAP3-PIH1D1 for RvbL hexamer, (b) both binding simultaneously (as discussed by authors), or (c) binding of RPAP3-PIH1D1 to some component of SMG complex that then precludes binding of either to RvbL hexamer. These alternatives need to be distinguished for these data to be of any value.</p><p>In fact, since these data have no relevance to the rest of the paper they could be deleted. If they are included, then they need to be improved e.g. by cryoEM to show whether SMG1-Rvb complex is hexamer or dodecamer and/or where SMG1 is located. In their present form the data are not convincing without further validation and/or suitable controls.</p><p>2) For the cryoEM study, it is not clear to me why after the Rvb component was masked off so a 4.2Å structure could be obtained, this was not then used to subtract the Rvb density to allow a better local refinement of the DHX34 component? This could improve the DHX34 density dramatically. The observation that the Rvb hexamer density improves so much when the DHX34 component is removed, suggests that there is enough signal from that part to cause the misalignment of the RvbL hexamer so should be sufficient to allow refinement of that part alone, even if that requires several conformational classes to be defined.</p><p>3) For the ATPase inhibition experiments there are a number of issues.</p><p>First, why do the activity traces begin at 30mins rather than time zero? The rates should be shown from the start of ATP turnover, initiated by, for example, addition of ATP or magnesium after allowing an incubation period for components to form complexes if necessary.</p><p>Second, the rates are not linear but are curves. The whole point of the coupled assay is that the ATP is regenerated so remains at a constant level and therefore the rates should be linear unless other factors such as subunit association/disassociation are occurring that mean the system is not at equilibrium. Unless the rates are linear then they are meaningless because they are not steady state. Which part of these curves were measured to estimate the rates? The Materials and methods section suggests an amount after 30 mins was determined, presumably simply a difference over that time? Which time interval? Obviously, this is not accurate or appropriate for a rate that is curving. Interesting, in every assay shown, the curves are getting faster showing the rates are getting quicker as time progresses. This needs to be explained, particularly for DHX34.</p><p>Third, the experiments need to address whether it is the Vmax for the reaction that has altered or whether affinity for ATP is different. Furthermore, the structure raises the intriguing possibility that the rate may be halved because only half of the ATPase sites are now active i.e. those in the RvbL1 subunits. The authors have already created the tools to follow this up biochemically by making so-called Walker B mutants for each RvbL subunit. If it is indeed the RvbL2 subunits that are inactivated by the helicase binding, then binding should have no, or lesser, effect on the ATPase activity in the RvbL1/RvbL2EQ hexamer while the RvbL1EQ/RvbL2 hexamer should show a more dramatic effect than wildtype RvbL1/RvbL2 hexamers, or even complete inhibition of activity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63042.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

DHX34 is identified as a potential regulator of RUVBL1-RUVBL2's ATPase activity, which represents an important step in determining the mechanisms underlying the initiation of NMD.</p><p>However, before this manuscript can be considered for publication in eLife, the authors should address several concerns, as outlined below.</p><p>Major Points:</p><p>1) The authors suggest that oligomerization of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 hampers nucleotide exchange, yet this model seems not sufficiently supported by the data and the authors should adjust their discussion in this respect.</p><p>The ATP-binding pocket is located between neighboring protomers, with critical motifs contributed by both AAA domains, such that monomeric RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 are not capable of ATP hydrolysis. The comparison between hexamer and monomer is therefore unnecessary, and proposing that hexamerization lowers the ATP-hydrolysis rate does not make much sense. In fact, the subunit interface between RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 appears highly similar to that of other AAA+ motors, and it is in my opinion unlikely that the pocket itself &quot;traps&quot; the nucleotide and prevents exchange. At the various stages of the ATPase cycle (or positions in the hexameric ring), individual subunits of numerous other AAA+ hexamers show differential opening and closure of their nucleotide-binding sites. Depending on the averaging for the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 structure, subunits may appear uniformly closed, which, however, is not necessarily inconsistent with hydrolysis activity. What could contribute to the low rates, as suggested by the authors and previous studies, are the N-termini of RUVBL1/2 that seem to contact the nucleotide and in the case of RuvBL2 get released upon binding of DHX34.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right that our initial version of the manuscript did not clearly explain the consequences of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 oligomerization. We would like to emphasize that our statement indicating that “<italic>oligomerization of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 hampers nucleotide exchange”</italic> was not directly drawn from our data, but rather an elaboration based on previous results found in the literature</p><p>“<italic>Crystal structure of the human AAA+ protein RuvBL1.

However, it does obstruct a possible ADP exit channel and, thus, contributes to prevent the ADP/ATP Exchange.</p><p>The three-dimensional structure of RuvBL1 reveals an ADP molecule tightly bound between DI and DIII and that access to the ATPase active site is additionally blocked by hexamerization, thereby making the exchange between ADP and ATP impossible. Additional cofactors are, therefore, likely to be needed to open the nucleotide pocket.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is unlikely that the pocket itself could trap the nucleotide and it is probably that the N-termini of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 regulates RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complexes.</p><p>Furthermore, our use of the terms “open” and “close” was not accurate, since we used it to refer to the absence of N-termini, where the access to the nucleotide binding pocket seems more exposed (“open”) compared to when the N-termini is shown in contact with the nucleotide (“closed”). We never intended to imply that the actual conformation of the nucleotide binding pockets was “open” or “closed”. We have now removed these terms and clarify this in the revised version.</p><p>Altogether, we have now extensively revised the appropriate Sections, mainly in the Introduction and in the Discussion.</p><p>Our revised conclusion is that DHX34 regulates hydrolysis by altering the N-termini of RUVBL2 that contact the nucleotide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the minimal ATPase rate of 1 per min, RUVBL1/2 may indeed not work as a processive ATPase, but only as a switch that could get triggered by DHX34. In that respect this new structure is very interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed interesting, and it is now mentioned in the Introduction and Discussion sections of the revised version. We have also commented on some recent manuscript that contains some new information about their rates of ATP hydrolysis (Nano et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The overall analysis of nucleotide occupancies is problematic, considering that the resolution is not high enough to confidently assign nucleotides to each site.</p><p>The inherent averaging that occurs in single-particle cryo-EM image processing may very well explain the absence of detectable nucleotide in all RUVBL2 pockets of the DHX34-bound complex. As observed for many other cryo-EM structures of AAA+ motors, nucleotide pockets are highly dynamic and often less well resolved compared to the rest of the structure. Whether binding of DHX34 indeed induces a 3-fold symmetric state of the hexamer in which all 3 RUVBL2 sites are nucleotide free remains questionable. Building the class averages was likely determined by the asymmetric DHX34 density above the ring, and if the orientation of DHX34 is not well correlated with the nucleotide occupancy in a particular RuvBL2 subunit, averaging particles based on DHX34 could make it look like all 3 RuvBL2 sites are empty or lower in nucleotide density, whereas in reality it may be just one. If this were the case, the structure would resemble other AAA+ motors that show a small gap in the hexameric ring flanked by a nucleotide-free &quot;seam&quot; subunit, while all other subunits represent a continuum of nucleotide states.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this analysis made by the reviewer although we respectfully disagree we cannot confidentially assign nucleotides to each state. Some of the image processing suggested by the reviewer was actually done in the manuscript, which means that we did not explain well in the text and figures.</p><p>In the revised version we have clarified these key points but we have also performed additional experiments in accordance with the suggestions, to address these issues in full.</p><p>1) The reviewer mentions that the resolution is not sufficient to confidentially assign nucleotide.</p><p>We believe this not to be correct</p><p>a) Resolution at the nucleotide binding sites is around 4 Angstroms, which is sufficient to observe density for the nucleotides (see new Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>b) In this work, the structure of the RUVBL1-RUVBL2-DHX34 contains an internal control, since we can see nucleotides in RUVBL1 at the resolutions reached, and importantly the resolution is similar for both RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 subunits (see new Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Density for the nucleotide is clearly seen in RUVBL1 and clearly absent in RUVBL2, strongly supporting that there is nucleotide in all RUVBL1 subunits but not in RUVBL2 subunits.</p><p>Thus, in our opinion, the resolution of our map is sufficient to clearly detect nucleotides in RUVBL1 and we have a similar resolution in RUVBL2. (Issues about the influence of our image processing on the occupancy are mentioned below).</p><p>In the revised version we now show in detail the density in the cryo-EM map for the nucleotide-binding pockets of all 6 subunits of the complex showing clear density for the nucleotide in RUVBL1 subunits and clear absence of density in RUVBL2 subunits in new Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p><p>2) Averaging may explain the absence of detectable nucleotide and class averages were determined by the asymmetric DHX34 density.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this can happen and this is why we used an image processing strategy designed to avoid it. We describe the structure of the full RUVBL1-RUVBL2-DHX34 complex in Figure 2, and then the structure of the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ring at higher resolution in Figure 3. The structure of RUVBL1-RUVBL2 in Figure 3 was determined after masking out the density of DHX34 at very initial stages of refinement to remove any influence of DHX34 in the alignment and avoid the issues mentioned by the reviewer.</p><p>In summary, the reviewer is right, but we actually performed an image processing strategy to avoid the influence of DHX34 by masking out its density during refinement. Now we have clarified this in Results and Materials and methods section, but we have also modified the workflow of the image processing in the supplementary figures to clarify this (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><p>3) New image processing and experiments to address this issue in full</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is critical to rule out that the lack of occupancy in all 3 RUVBL2 subunits is not an artifact of our image processing strategy.</p><p>Thus, in the revised version:</p><p>a) Additional image processing of the RUVBL1-RUVBL2-DHX34 complex:</p><p>After refinement of the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ring masking out DHX34, we have now classified the particles in 3D to search for potential heterogeneity in nucleotide occupancy. As suggested above by the reviewer, we followed the state of each subunit by presence or absence of the histidine containing N-termini, a clear structural feature at this resolution level. This analysis, shown on Figure 3—figure supplement 3 did not detect any particles with different nucleotide occupancy.</p><p>b) Since the reviewer raised the issue that some of our conclusions could be influenced by the averaging of particles with a different level of nucleotide occupancy at the same location, we also analyzed the final RUVBL1-RUVBL2 structure by 3D classification of each of the 3 RUVBL1-RUVBL2 dimers in the structure independently. Each dimer in the final refinement step was classified without further alignment and masking out all other regions in the ring to search for heterogeneity. In all three dimers the vast majority of the particles displayed a clear conformation where the N-termini is present in RUVBL1 and absent in RUVBL2.</p><p>This analysis strongly suggested that for a great majority of particles, all RUVBL1-2 dimers have similar nucleotide occupancy. This analysis is now shown on Figure 3—figure supplement 4.</p><p>c) To further strengthen the results described in 3.2, we also analyzed our data using a symmetry expansion strategy as described before (Martino et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2015). Briefly, because each RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complex has a roughly threefold symmetry we rotated each particle around the 3-fold symmetry axis three times to place all RUVBL1RUVBL2 dimers in the same position. This operation triplicated the data set and then we placed a mask around one of the dimers Particles were then subjected to a local classification strategy to look for heterogeneity in the nucleotide occupancy of each RUVBL1-RUVBL2 pair, regardless of each position in the ring. This is now shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 5, and confirms that the great majority of RUVBL1-RUVBL2 dimers have density for the N-terminus in RUVBL1 but not RUVBL2.</p><p>d) We have now performed ATPase experiments with several RUVBL1-RUVBL2 mutants that are compatible with an effect of DHX34 in all RUVBL2 subunits but not in RUVBL1 (see below and in response also to other reviewers)</p><p>Altogether, we believe that by clarifying the image processing performed by masking out DHX34 and all the new experiments described above, we have addressed the issue of the nucleotide occupancy in full.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To better evaluate the local resolution of the nucleotide pockets, it is necessary to have a zoomed-in view of these pockets on the ResMap of the 4.18Å RUVBL1-RUVBL2 hexameric ring (Figure 3—figure supplement 2D), highlighting the ADPs in RUVBL1. It is important to know the local resolution for these pockets, because based on the current evidence, the map alone may not provide enough detail to accurately assign nucleotides. One way to address this is by doing a more thorough analysis of the pockets themselves, including the overall size, shape, and location of key hydrolysis residues in comparison to known hydrolysis states of these pockets.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right. We have now modified Figure 3 to show details of the nucleotide binding pockets in RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 comparing our structure with previous crystal structures. As mentioned above, DHX34 affected mostly the N-termini of RUVBL2 but not significantly the nucleotide binding pockets themselves, as incorrectly implied in the previous version of the manuscript by using the terms “open” and “closed”. This has now been corrected.</p><p>Resolution at the nucleotide binding sites is around 4 Angstroms, which is sufficient to observe density for the nucleotides, and as suggested we now show the local resolution of the pockets themselves as well as detailed map in the new Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, in both Figure 4E and 4F it would be helpful to include labels of hydrolysis-relevant residues, like Arginine fingers and Walker A/B motifs, such that readers can easily orient themselves. In Figure 4E, the pocket looks just as &quot;open&quot; in the ATP-bound state (2XSZ) as in the DHX34-bound structure, and it is important to explain why this is considered a nucleotide-free rather than ADP- or ATP-bound state. Are there retracted residues that make this pocket incompetent for nucleotide binding? And could an ATP possibly fit into the RUVBL1 pocket? The current thresholding in Figure 4F does not exclude this possibility. It would also be appropriate to include the N-terminal histidines that directly interact with ADP in RUVBL1, as this may provide further evidence that it is indeed an ADP.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right and all this information has now been included in the revised version, in the new Figure 3. We previously used the term “open” to refer to the disappearance of the N-termini of RUVBL2 that facilitates the accessibility to the nucleotide pockets. We now think that this term is not very adequate because it might be interpreted as implying that the nucleotide pocket itself was more open, which is not what happens. We have now modified the revised version and clarify our findings, and we also make a comparison of the nucleotide pockets of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 before and after binding to DHX34.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, it may be worth processing the data again and building class averages while masking out DHX34 to assess whether the hexamer indeed adopts a clear 3-fold symmetric state.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, we believe we have now addressed the issues regarding the occupancy if RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 subunits by nucleotide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Regarding the very low ATPase rate of just 1 min-1, one potential issue may be that RUVBL1/2 was not purified in the presence of ATP and an ATP regeneration system. There are several examples of AAA+ motors that irreversibly lose robust activity when purified in the absence of ATP, and it may be worth testing whether RUVBL1/2 shows higher activities when purified in ATP.</p></disp-quote><p>The rates that we find for RUVBL1-RUVBL2 (4.9 mol ATP/mol protein·min) are in the same range that all previous works with these proteins, such as those found in Gorynia et al., 2011 (0.56 mol ATP/mol protein·min) and Lakomek et al., 2015 (3 mol ATP/mol protein·min). Interestingly, a recent work analyzed the ATPase activity of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 separately, observing that the activity of RUVBL2 is 8-fold higher than RUVBL1 (Nano et al., 2020).</p><p>RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complexes co-purify with nucleotide regardless of these not been present during purification. This has been observed in all structures solved till now where nucleotide, mostly ADP, but sometimes also ATP, fill every subunit in the complex. We think, in agreement with all previous reports, that these ATPases have an intrinsic low ATPase rate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The NADH consumption shown in Figure 5A is not linear, but increases over the 30 min measurements (30 – 60 min) for both, RUVBL1/2 and the DHX34-bound complex. What is the reason for that and what do the traces look like between the addition of RUVBL1/2 and the 30 min mark? The regeneration of ADP present in the RUVBL1/2 sample at the time of mixing should be completed within a couple of seconds, and temperature equilibration is expected to take only a couple of minutes. Non-linear absorbance changes over tens of minutes and a slow acceleration indicate that the system was not at steady state, which could also be consistent with the AAA+ motor being trapped in an inhibited state due to purification in the absence of ATP.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize since we did not explain well the details of how we performed the ATPase experiments. The method we performed has been used by others to measure the activity of other ATPases and also of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 (Nano et al., 2020). We have now clarified these issues.</p><p>We previously indicated that this experiment took place during 60 min in total, but it should be noted that the first 10 minutes were a pre-incubation time without the ATPase to allow the system to regenerate possible contaminant ADP present in the reagents, and not the reaction itself. We calculated rates of ATP consumption by averaging for a 30 min interval (from minute 30 to minute 60) during which the absorbance decrease was adjusted to a linear function.</p><p>In any case, we have decided to repeat and improve these experiments, at the same time that some mutants were also analyzed.</p><p>For this revised version:</p><p>– In our curves, linearity was lost only at the end experiment at 37ºC. We suspect that this could be due to the instability of DHX34. In our hands, DHX34 activity is affected over time upon storage and it might be possible that it is also affected after a long period at 37º. To investigate this, we have now analyzed the stability of DHX34 using nano differential scanning fluorimetry, a technique that measures the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein during a thermal ramp denaturation experiment. We found that DHX34 is stable during 20 min incubation at 37ºC but not at longer times (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), so accordingly experiments have been run for only 20 min.</p><p>– We have repeated the experiments for 20 min and NADH consumptions are now linear (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p><p>– We have clarified our methodology in Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors discuss a model where ATP hydrolysis may regulate the interactions of RUVBL1/2 with other partners during NMD initiation, and the more stable binding of RUVBL1/2 to partners of the R2TP chaperone pathway in the absence of ATP hydrolysis is mentioned as an example. Similar effects have indeed been observed for various other AAA+ motors whose interactions are more dynamic during ATP hydrolysis. For RUVBL1/2, how does the very low ATPase activity of 1 min-1 compare to the off rate of its binding partners?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned, current evidences suggest that the low ATPase activity of RUVBL1-RUVBL2 could be related to its function as a switch in different macromolecular complexes, but not as a processive motor ATPase. In several pathways, such as NMD, protein-protein interactions are transient due the dynamics of the process, and signals from others partners are needed for rearrangement steps to allow the remodeling of the complexes. RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase activity could have an impact on such signals, allowing assembly and/or disassembly of intermediate complexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors propose that the ATPase inhibition of RUVBL1/2 by DHX34 may stabilize complexes. However, according to the presented model, DHX34 binding induces nucleotide release from every other site in the hexamer, which is expected to have distinct or even opposite effects compared to preventing hydrolysis and trapping hexamers in permanent ATP-bound states.</p></disp-quote><p>At this stage we do not know what the function of the regulation of RUVBL1-RUVBL2 activity by DHX34 in the context of NMD is. Our speculation is based on recent findings showing that an allosteric inhibitor of RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPase activity stabilizes their interaction with clients of the PIKK assembly pathway in cells. Since DHX34 reduces hydrolysis, this could have a similar effect as the inhibitor described. Having said that, this is very speculative and we modified the Discussion section to give less strength to this educated guess.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also suggested that DHX34 binding fully eliminates ATP hydrolysis (and even nucleotide interactions) in the RUVBL2 sites, while RUVBL1 &quot;continues hydrolyzing at comparable levels to those measured in the absence of HBX34&quot;. This would mean that ATPase subunits in the hexamer are completely independent in their ATP hydrolysis, with no communication between neighbors. Although this is not ruled out, it has to my knowledge not been reliable described for other AAA+ hexamers, which usually show coordinated transitions and subunit communications that are mediated by arginine fingers and various other interactions within the topologically-closed rings. In fact, the ATPase rates for the single Walker-B mutants RUVBL1(E303Q)-RUVBL2 and RUVBL1-RUVBL2(E318Q) do not show 50% lower activity, but a reduction by 80 or 75% (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B) compared to wild type, suggesting that there is indeed communication between neighboring subunits.</p><p>The authors may consider further investigating this, for instance by characterizing hexamers with Walker-A or Walker-B mutations in RUVBL2, or an Arginine-finger mutation in RUVBL1 in the presence and absence of HDX34. If the authors' model is correct, the ATPase activity of these RUVBL1/2 variants should not respond to DHX34 binding and be similar to that of DHX34-bound wild-type RUVBL1/2.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we cannot conclude that DHX34 affects only RUVBL2 sites with the data available in our first version of the manuscript. To make things more complex, recent evidence shows that RUVBL2 subunits might be more active than RUVBL1 subunits (Nano et al., 2020). Therefore, calculations on the ratio of reduction of activity after adding DHX34 are not sufficient to relate the observed phenomena to either RUVBL1 or RUVBL2 subunits.</p><p>To address this issue, we have performed the experiments suggested by the reviewer which are part of the new Figure 5 and its supplemental figures:</p><p>– We generated RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 double mutants unable to bind nucleotide, and we used them to purify RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complexes with one or both subunits mutated. As a control, we analyzed the complex by electron microscopy before performing experiments (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, B). To our surprise, we were unable to find the well-characterized hexameric top views, and complexes appeared as heterogeneous in size and shape. Other groups have found before that ADP or ATP could help the assembly of recombinant RUVBL2, and we interpreted that assembly of recombinant hexameric complexes is affected when nucleotide cannot bind to both subunits.</p><p>– We then focused on RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 mutations that are affected in ATP hydrolysis but not ATP binding. Complexes containing one or both subunits mutated were purified and their correct assembly verified using electron microscopy.</p><p>– We also tested the ATPase activity of the different mutants in the absence and presence of DHX34. This information is now found in Figure 5 and fully confirms that DHX34 affects only RUVBL2, since DHX34 effects are only detected in complexes containing wildtype RUVBL2 but not ATPase-dead RUVBL2 mutants.</p><p>A key point to our work was that the effects of DHX34 on ATP hydrolysis correlate well with the conformational changes observed in RUVBL2 but not RUVBL1 subunits. The new experiments added a strong support this conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Lopez-Perrote et al. show that RUVBL1-RUVBL2 participates in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway through direct interaction with the DHX34 RNA helicase. The authors present a cryo-EM structure of the complex, as well as pulldowns and functional assays that indicate DHX34 affects the conformation and activity of RUVBL1-RUVBL2.</p><p>Is there any indication of stoichiometry of DHX34 binding beside the triangular shape of the DHX34 density in the map (in Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3)? The homology model fit into the map (in Figure 3—figure supplement 3) is unconvincing as there are clear helical densities in the map that appear not to fit any of the homology model helices. Overall, the homology model and experimental map do not appear to be in good agreement. Could more than one DHX34 be binding? The map and model in their current form do not seem sufficient to answer this question.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right that the homology model does not fit the structure of the complex, and we indicated this in the text. We have removed this fitting experiment in the manuscript since, we agree with the reviewer, it does not provide a sufficiently useful information.</p><p>To determine the stoichiometry of the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 complex:</p><p>1) We have extracted the densities for DHX34 from the map of the complex. These images were processed to obtain a cryo-EM map of DHX34 processed independently of RUVBL1-RUVBL2. Although resolution was poor given the limited number of images, insufficient for such a small and flexible protein, this map was useful to compare with the structure of isolated DHX34 from negative stain microscopy. This comparison suggested that only one molecule of DHX34 was bound to RUVBL1-RUVBL2.</p><p>2) In addition, we estimated the mass of this volume as 120 kDa using the “volume” programme from EMAN (see text for details).</p><p>Together these results indicate that only one DHX34 binds to each RUVBL1-RUVBL2 and that we only probably visualize the core of the protein and not the flexible C-terminal domain. Details can be found in the final section of Results and in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 1</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems surprising that the deletion of any of the domains of DHX34 (Figure 3—figure supplement 4C) results in no loss of binding to RUVBL1-RUVBL2. This observation is particularly surprising because it suggests that any domain can be deleted without affecting the folding or soluble expression of DHX34. It is not clear from this experiment that there is a definitive threshold for &quot;loss of binding&quot;.</p><p>Further, the large variance in signal in the western blot appears to indicate that there could be a dependence on certain domains to bind (for instance RecA1), but the threshold for &quot;no binding&quot; is defined poorly. The authors should likely revise or modify the conclusion that this experiment supports the binding of all domains of DXH34 to RUVBL1-RUVBL2.</p></disp-quote><p>The DHX34 mutants we used were designed and selected by our collaborators in Edinburgh (Nele Hug and Javier F Caceres). In our previous collaborative study, we showed that they soluble and maintain certain functional properties (Melero et al., 2016). Here, we made use of these already tested mutants to analyze their effect on DHX34 binding.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is surprising that we do not have larger effects in some mutants. This could be partially due to the difficulty to confidentially detect small differences but maybe also to the possible influence of additional factors for the RUVBL1-RUVBL2-DHX34 interaction in cells, such as the contribution of additional NMD proteins.</p><p>We have now repeated these experiments and quantified the effect of individual domains of DHX34 and larger deletions covering several domains in the binding to RUVBL1-RUVBL2 (new Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear if the 50% inhibition seen is due to incomplete binding of RUVBL1-RUVBL2 by DHX34 or if that 50% inhibition is an inherent property of the complex between the two.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right. In addition, recent evidence shows that RUVBL2 subunits might be more active than RUVBL1 subunits (Nano et al., 2020).

We believe that the revised version of the manuscript has addressed the issues raised by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The experiments in Figure 1 Panel D are done by mixing components in solution and allowing them to come to some sort of equilibrium. This can lead to results that are not easy to interpret correctly in the absence of appropriate controls. For example, the amount of RvbL1/2 is not constant across the 2nd gel (compare lanes 10 and 11), which suggests a problem. If the whole RvbL/SMG1/RPAP3/PIH1D1 complex is unable to be bound to the resin, then an amount will remain in solution in samples with RPAP3/PIH1D1. This is not the same result as competing for sites on RvbLs, this is competition between Rvbs and RPAP3-PIH1D1 for a site or sites on SMG1-8-9. Alternatively, a complex between SMG complex or its components and RPAP3-PIH1D1 would not stick to the resin but might prevent binding of RvbLs to SMG1. Pull downs using the FLAG tag would provide a necessary control (i.e. repeating part (C) but in the presence of RPAP3-PIH1D1). However, it would also need to be shown that SMG8-9 does not interact with RPAP3-PIH1D1 as well.</p><p>Also, in the final lane (lane 14) all bands are more intense than even the 1:4 ratio lane (lane 13), which could be consistent with a portion of RPAP3/PIH1D1 remaining in solution (e.g. bound to SMG complex or a component of it) when the SMG complex is present. It also needs to be stated somewhere what the concentration on RPAP3-PIH1D1 is in lanes 2, 7, 9 and 14. From the gel band densities in the input it would appear to be 1:4.</p><p>Consequently, the data cannot distinguish between at least three different situations (a) competition between SMG1 and RPAP3-PIH1D1 for RvbL hexamer, (b) both binding simultaneously (as discussed by authors), or (c) binding of RPAP3-PIH1D1 to some component of SMG complex that then precludes binding of either to RvbL hexamer. These alternatives need to be distinguished for these data to be of any value.</p><p>In fact, since these data have no relevance to the rest of the paper they could be deleted. If they are included, then they need to be improved e.g. by cryoEM to show whether SMG1-Rvb complex is hexamer or dodecamer and/or where SMG1 is located. In their present form the data are not convincing without further validation and/or suitable controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the SMG1 interaction data is disconnected from the rest of the manuscript, which is focused on the interaction between RUVBL1-RUVBL2 and DHX34. We have now removed this from the revised version, including the competition experiments using RPAP3PIH1D1, which were a concern for this reviewer.</p><p>Nonetheless, we have left the main RUVBL1-RUVBL2-SMG1 interaction experiment as part of supplemental information in the context of the interaction experiments of RUVBL1-RUVBL2 with most factors involved in NMD initiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For the cryoEM study, it is not clear to me why after the Rvb component was masked off so a 4.2Å structure could be obtained, this was not then used to subtract the Rvb density to allow a better local refinement of the DHX34 component? This could improve the DHX34 density dramatically. The observation that the Rvb hexamer density improves so much when the DHX34 component is removed, suggests that there is enough signal from that part to cause the misalignment of the RvbL hexamer so should be sufficient to allow refinement of that part alone, even if that requires several conformational classes to be defined.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried again to improve the structure of DHX34 as suggested (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), but without success, possibly because the number of particles is not sufficiently large for a small protein. All these new analyses are part of Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and one section of results. In addition, we have compared our low-resolution map of DHX34 when bound to RUVBL1-RUVBL2 with the low-resolution map of DHX34 obtained in isolation. This, and other analysis, suggests that the stoichiometry of the RUVBL1-RUVBL2-DHX34 complex is 3:3:1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) For the ATPase inhibition experiments there are a number of issues.</p></disp-quote><p>Some of the issues about the ATPase experiments mentioned by the reviewer have their origin in our lack of adequate explanations on how the experiments were conducted, and how our results were represented. We have now addressed this in full by providing significant more details in the Materials and methods section and by relating our experiments to a recent work that measures the ATPase activity of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 using the same protocols we use.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>First, why do the activity traces begin at 30mins rather than time zero? The rates should be shown from the start of ATP turnover, initiated by, for example, addition of ATP or magnesium after allowing an incubation period for components to form complexes if necessary.</p><p>Second, the rates are not linear but are curves. The whole point of the coupled assay is that the ATP is regenerated so remains at a constant level and therefore the rates should be linear unless other factors such as subunit association/disassociation are occurring that mean the system is not at equilibrium. Unless the rates are linear then they are meaningless because they are not steady state. Which part of these curves were measured to estimate the rates? The Materials and methods section suggests an amount after 30 mins was determined, presumably simply a difference over that time? Which time interval? Obviously, this is not accurate or appropriate for a rate that is curving. Interesting, in every assay shown, the curves are getting faster showing the rates are getting quicker as time progresses. This needs to be explained, particularly for DHX34.</p></disp-quote><p>In our experiments, reaction components of the pyruvate kinase-lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay and the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 and DHX34 protein complexes were incubated separately for 10 min at 37 ºC for stabilization. This step was done to allow the system to regenerate possible contaminant ADP from the reagents, so the ATPase reaction starts from a stable baseline. Then, the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 and DHX34 protein are added to the reaction to initiate hydrolysis, and the measurements were taken for additionally 50 min. The experiment took place during 60 min in total, but the first 10 minutes were the pre-incubation time, not the ATP hydrolysis reaction per se. This was not properly explained in the previous version of the manuscript. We calculated rates of ATP consumption by averaging for a 30 min interval during which the absorbance decrease was adjusted to a linear function (from minute 30 to minute 60). Similar approach has been used before (Nano et al., 2020). But the selection of the interval was arbitrary as long as rates were linear and we decided then to represent in the graphs maintaining the original numbering of minutes in our experiment. We have now repeated all the ATPase experiments in the manuscript, and in addition to new experiments using several RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 mutants. We have now clarified how the experiment was performed, and we now consider as time zero when the mix was performed but removing the first minute where the measurement is distorted by the opening and closing of the Jasco V-550 UV/VIS Spectrophotometer.</p><p>For this revised version:</p><p>– In our curves, linearity was lost only at the end experiment at 37ºC. We suspect that this could be due to the instability of DHX34. In our hands, DHX34 activity is affected over time upon storage and it might be possible that it is also affected after a long period at 37º. To investigate this, we have now analyzed the stability of DHX34 using nano differential scanning fluorimetry, a technique that measures the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein during a thermal ramp denaturation experiment, and we found that DHX34 is stable during 20 min incubation at 37ºC but not at longer times, so experiments have been run for only 20 min (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>– We have repeated the experiments for 20 min after the mixing and NADH consumptions are now linear (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p><p>– We have clarified our methodology in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>All these changes are now part of Figure 5 and its supplemental figures and a more detailed version of Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, the experiments need to address whether it is the Vmax for the reaction that has altered or whether affinity for ATP is different. Furthermore, the structure raises the intriguing possibility that the rate may be halved because only half of the ATPase sites are now active i.e. those in the RvbL1 subunits. The authors have already created the tools to follow this up biochemically by making so-called Walker B mutants for each RvbL subunit. If it is indeed the RvbL2 subunits that are inactivated by the helicase binding, then binding should have no, or lesser, effect on the ATPase activity in the RvbL1/RvbL2EQ hexamer while the RvbL1EQ/RvbL2 hexamer should show a more dramatic effect than wildtype RvbL1/RvbL2 hexamers, or even complete inhibition of activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Recent evidence shows that RUVBL2 subunits might be more active than RUVBL1 subunits (Nano et al., 2020). Therefore, calculations on the ratio of reduction of activity after adding DHX34 are not sufficient to relate the observed phenomena to either RUVBL1 or RUVBL2 subunits. To address this issue, we have made use of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 mutant unable to hydrolysis ATP, and have measured the influence of adding DHX34. Complexes containing one or both subunits mutated were purified and their correct assembly verified using electron microscopy. We then tested the ATPase activity of the different mutants in the absence and presence of DHX34. This information is now found in Figure 5 and full confirms that DHX34 affects only RUVBL2, since DHX34 effects are only detected in complexes containing wildtype RUVBL2 but not ATPase-dead RUVBL2 mutants.</p><p>A key point to our work was that the effects of DHX34 on ATP hydrolysis correlate with the conformational changes observed in RUVBL2 but not RUVBL1 subunits. The new experiments added strongly support this conclusion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
