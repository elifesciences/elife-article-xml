investigated extensively. In this report, we demonstrate that the gRNAs of Cas9 and Cpf1, and donor DNA can be chemically modified at their terminal positions without losing activity. Moreover, we show that 5’ fluorescently labeled donor DNA can be used as a marker to enrich HDR edited cells by a factor of two through cell sorting. In addition, we demonstrate that the gRNA and donor DNA can be directly conjugated together into one molecule, and show that this gRNA-donor DNA conjugate is three times better at transfecting cells and inducing HDR, with cationic polymers, than unconjugated gRNA and donor DNA. The tolerance of the gRNA and donor DNA to chemical modifications has the potential to enable new strategies for genome engineering.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25312.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25312.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25312.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>There are several different technologies that can be used to make specific changes to particular genes in cells. These “gene editing” approaches have the potential to help humans in a variety of different ways, for example, to treat diseases that presently have no cure, or to improve the nutritional quality of crop plants. One such gene editing approach is known as CRISPR. To edit a specific gene, a molecule called a guide ribonucleic acid (or guide RNA for short) binds to a section of the gene and recruits an enzyme to cut the DNA encoding the gene in a particular location. Adding a “donor” DNA molecule that contains the desired “edit” can lead to the cell repairing the broken gene in a way that incorporates the desired change.</p><p>Modifying the guide RNA or the donor DNA can enhance CRISPR editing. For example, extending the guide RNA molecules by adding “aptamer” sequences can enable researchers to specifically activate the genes that have been edited. It is also possible to add chemical tags to RNA and DNA, but it is not clear how chemical modifications to the guide RNA and donor DNA could affect CRISPR.</p><p>Here Lee et al. investigated whether adding chemical tags to the guide RNA and/or donor DNA could enhance gene editing. The experiments show that the modified guide RNAs and donor DNAs were still active and could edit DNA in mouse and human cells. Adding a fluorescent molecule to the donor DNA allowed Lee et al. to track which cells contained donor DNA and separate them from other cells. The fluorescent cells had twice as much editing compared to groups of unsorted cells.</p><p>In further experiments, the guide RNA and donor DNA were fused together and supplied to cells together with a DNA cutting enzyme. Cells containing this combined molecule had three times more editing than cells exposed to the original CRISPR system. This change may aid the development of new uses for CRISPR because it simplifies the system from three components (an enzyme, guide RNA and donor DNA) to just a cutting enzyme and the combined molecule.</p><p>Overall, the findings of Lee et al. show that chemical modifications to guide RNA and donor DNA can make the CRISPR system more versatile. It opens up the possibility of new applications such as adding a targeting group that would direct the CRISPR Cas9 system to a specific cell type or tissue.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25312.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25312.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd>gene editing</kwd><kwd>drug delivery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors declare that there was no funding for this work</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The guide RNA and donor DNA of the CRISPR/Cas system tolerate large chemical modifications and can be engineered for enhanced delivery and gene editing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The CRISPR/Cas9 system uses a gRNA to target and cleave DNA sequences with specificity, and can result in precise genome editing via homology directed repair (HDR) if a donor DNA template is simultaneously delivered along with the CRISPR/Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mali et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">DeWitt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Long et al., 2014</xref>). Modifications to the gRNA and the donor DNA are effective methods to engineer CRISPR/Cas9 to enhance editing and develop new applications. For example, extension of the gRNA with aptamer sequences can be used to recruit RNA binding counterparts within the cell that enable either the visualization or transcription of specific DNA sequences in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mali et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, incorporation of modified RNA bases into the gRNA results in reduced immunogenicity, increased stability, and enhanced gene editing efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rahdar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hendel et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, chemical modification of the donor DNA with phosphorothioates dramatically increases HDR efficiency by increasing donor DNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Renaud et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, modification of either the guide RNA or the donor DNA has great potential for enhancing the biotechnological applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 system.</p><p>However, outside of base modifications and backbone modifications, very little is known about the chemical modifications that are tolerated by the gRNA of the CRISRP/Cas9 system and the donor DNA. In particular, it is uncertain if the gRNA of Cas9 and the donor DNA tolerate modifications with chemical moieties that are structurally unrelated to nucleotide bases, and how big these modifications can be without affecting the functionality of Cas9 or donor DNA. In addition, nothing is known about the tolerance of the Cpf1 gRNA to chemical modifications. Information about the chemical modifications tolerated by the gRNA and donor DNA can provide new ways to engineer the CRISPR/Cas9 system for high efficiency editing and also enable new applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 system not related to DNA cleavage.</p><p>In this report, we investigated the types of synthetic modifications that the gRNA and donor DNA can tolerate in the CRISPR gene editing systems, and demonstrate that the gRNA and the donor DNA can be modified at their terminal positions with large modifications ranging from planar hydrophobic molecules to 35 kDa nucleic acids, without losing activity. We exploited the tolerance of the donor DNA to 5’ modifications to develop a method for enriching cells that had been edited via HDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In addition, we also exploited the tolerance of the donor DNA and gRNA to terminal modifications to develop a method for increasing the delivery and HDR efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system and donor DNA in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25312.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>gRNA and donor DNA engineering enables the development of new strategies for enriching gene edited cells and for improving their delivery into cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Fluorescently labeled donor DNA can be used as a marker for rapidly enriching HDR edited cells.

Cas9 complexed to gDonor is more efficient at inducing HDR in cells, after transfection with cationic polymers, than free gRNA complexed to Cas9 and donor DNA. The gDonor/Cas9 complex binds polycations, and the resulting nanoparticles have both gRNA and donor DNA in a single nanoparticle, leading to efficient HDR in cells (left). In contrast, Cas9 RNP + donor DNA forms heterogenous complexes with polycations, which are unable to encapsulate Cas9 RNP and donor within the same nanoparticle, leading to low efficiency HDR in cells (right).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25312.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25312.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-25312-fig1-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25312.004</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Synthesis of DBCO-crRNA.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25312.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25312.004</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-25312-fig1-figsupp1-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig1s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25312.005</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Synthesis of DNA-crRNA.</title><p>Azide modified DNA was reacted with DBCO-crRNA via copper free click chemistry.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25312.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25312.005</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-25312-fig1-figsupp2-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig1s3" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25312.006</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</label><caption><title>The synthesis of DNA-crRNA was confirmed with gel electrophoresis.</title><p>The low molecular weight band is crRNA.

Without this information, it is challenging to rationally engineer gRNAs for biotechnological applications. We therefore generated a small library of 8 chemically modified CRISPR targeting RNAs (crRNAs), which had modifications at their 5’ or 3’ ends, and evaluated their ability to cleave genomic DNA, after complexation with Cas9, in cells expressing blue fluorescent protein (BFP). The chemical modifications we synthesized or purchased are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>. The library consisted of crRNAs targeting the BFP sequence, which had an amine, azide, fluorescent dye, strained alkyne, disulfide, and a short single stranded DNA (87 nucleotides), at their 5’ or 3’ position. These modifications were chosen because of their importance in performing conjugation reactions.</p><p>crRNAs with the chemical modifications shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> were complexed with tracrRNA and Cas9 and electroporated into BFP-HEK cells. The percentage of BFP negative cells was determined via flow cytometry 5 days after the electroporation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> demonstrates that the crRNA for Cas9 tolerates large modifications at its 5’ end, and is less tolerant to modifications on the 3’ end. For example, 5’ modified crRNAs had a similar non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) frequency in BFP-HEK and BFP-K562 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) as control unmodified crRNA. In contrast, crRNA with 3’ modifications had a 50% reduction in NHEJ efficiency in cells. The sensitivity of crRNA to 3’ modifications is anticipated as the 3’ of the crRNA in Cas9 hybridizes with tracrRNA and is in close proximity to the Cas9 protein, whereas the 5’ end has a looser interaction with Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yamano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jinek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fu et al., 2014</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25312.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The gRNAs for Cas9 and Cpf1 and donor DNA tolerate large chemical modifications at their terminal ends.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Chemical structure of modified gRNAs. gRNAs with 5’ or 3’ modifications were purchased or synthesized.

Cpf1 is a recently discovered RNA-guided endonuclease of the class 2 CRISPR-Cas, and has the potential to be an alternative to Cas9 as it recognizes non-classical PAM sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yamano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zetsche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kleinstiver et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zetsche et al., 2017</xref>). Unlike Cas9, which requires both crRNA and trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), Cpf1 requires only crRNA, and therefore it is an even more attractive target for chemical modifications. crRNA targeting the BFP gene and Cpf1 were electroporated into BFP-HEK cells, and the percentage of BFP negative cells was quantified by flow cytometry. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> demonstrates that the crRNA from AsCpf1 (from Acidaminococcus) tolerates chemical modifications such as amine, azide, and DBCO at its 3’ end; in contrast, bulky 5’ end modifications such as azide and DBCO are less tolerated. For example, BFP-HEK cells electroporated with 3’ amine-crRNA and Cpf1 had a similar NHEJ frequency as cells electroporated with Cpf1 and unmodified crRNA. In contrast, BFP-HEK cells electroporated with crRNAs with 5’ modifications and Cpf1 had a reduction in NHEJ frequency and generated only 50–80% of the NHEJ levels as cells treated with unmodified crRNA. The 5’ nucleotide of the crRNA has more interaction points with the Cpf1 protein than the 3’ nucleotide, and the sensitivity of the 5’ end to chemical modifications corresponds with the crystal structure of Cpf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yamano et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the gRNAs for Cas9 and Cpf1 can be modified at one of their terminals with minimal loss of activity, and this tolerance should enable a variety of new strategies for gRNA engineering.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The donor template DNA tolerates chemical modifications</title><p>In addition, we also investigated the tolerance of the donor DNA to chemical modifications. We investigated the HDR efficiency of donor DNA with 5’ and 3’ modifications composed of an azide modification, an amine modification, and an Alexa 647 modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). For these experiments, a donor DNA which converts the BFP gene to the GFP gene was electroporated in cells along with Cas9 RNP targeting the BFP gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Richardson et al., 2016</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref> demonstrates that the donor DNA tolerates modifications at both its 5’ and 3’ ends, and BFP-HEK cells electroporated with chemically modified donor DNA were efficiently converted to GFP expressing cells via HDR. The tolerance of the donor DNA to chemical modifications at the 5’ and 3’ ends is anticipated based on the role of the donor DNA in the HDR mechanism. The donor DNA is rarely incorporated directly into the genome after a double stranded break, and instead, acts as a template for the DNA repair. Therefore, modifications of the 5’ and 3’ ends are likely to be tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Holloman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Durai et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the donor DNA can be modified at its 5 or 3’ position without losing activity, and this tolerance should enable a variety of new strategies for donor DNA engineering.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Fluorescently labeled donor DNA can be used to enrich for cells that are likely to be edited via HDR</title><p>Chemically modified gRNAs and donor DNA can potentially be used to address technological challenges limiting progress in the field of genome editing, such as the lack of methods available for rapidly identifying cells genetically edited via HDR. Current methods for identifying gene edited cells requires deep sequencing of randomly selected clones or the introduction of new additional proteins for magnetic bead pull down or fluorescence labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). However, neither of these methods is ideal for selecting gene edited cells and alternatives are greatly needed. For example, randomly choosing clones from cell transfection experiments and sequencing them to identify gene edited cells requires significant levels of investment and requires several weeks to complete. Similarly, introducing additional proteins into cells for the purpose of purification causes numerous additional complications, such as cell perturbation and unnecessary foreign protein expression. In addition, most cell identification and enrichment methods take several days to complete, which are too long for many primary cells because they rapidly change their phenotype after culturing <italic>in vitro</italic>. The inability to rapidly identify gene edited cells currently limits the development of gene edited cell therapies and the development of engineered cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dever et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the development of a fast and non-invasive method for enriching gene-edited cells has the potential to accelerate progress in multiple areas of genome engineering.</p><p>The donor DNA concentration in the nucleus is a key factor that determines the HDR efficiency after a double stranded break. We therefore investigated if donor DNA that was fluorescently labeled could be used as a beacon for FACs sorting, to identify cells that had a high probability of undergoing HDR, after transfection with Cas9 RNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Enriching cells for gene editing, non-invasively via FACS, has the potential to significantly accelerate gene editing cell culture protocols, because it will reduce the number of clones that need to be isolated and sequenced. A donor DNA was labeled with Alexa 647, termed trackable Donor (tDonor), and was electroporated into BFP-HEK cells along with Cas9 RNP. Sixteen hours after the electroporation, cells that internalized high levels of the tDonor and low levels of the tDonor were sorted using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). After three days of culture, the HDR frequency was determined using flow cytometry and compared to bulk unsorted cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> demonstrates that tDonor can be used as a selectable marker to enrich for cells that have a high probability of being edited via HDR. Cells that had internalized high levels of the donor DNA had a high rate of HDR, and the HDR rate in these cells increased by a factor of 2. Likewise, sorted cells that had low levels of tDonor showed significantly lower levels of HDR editing, demonstrating that the amount of Donor DNA in a cell is an important factor for HDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3b, c and d</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25312.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Fluorescently labeled donor DNA can be used to enrich for cells that have been edited via HDR.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Overview of the cell enrichment process.

Although viral vectors based on AAV can efficiently deliver Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Long et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tabebordbar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>), their toxicity is problematic. Therefore there is great interest in developing non-viral delivery vehicles that can deliver Cas9, gRNA and donor DNA into cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yin et al., 2016</xref>). Cationic polymers are a promising delivery vehicle for Cas9, as they avoid several of the problems associated with using AAV, such as immunogenicity and off-target DNA damage caused from the sustained expression of Cas9. However, simultaneous delivery of donor DNA and Cas9 RNP into cells is challenging with cationic vectors, because the donor DNA and the Cas9 RNP have different charge densities, and it is therefore unlikely that a single nanoparticle will contain both Cas9 RNP and donor DNA. As a result, it is challenging to deliver Cas9 RNP and donor DNA simultaneously into the same cell and efficiently induce HDR.</p><p>To circumvent this obstacle, we performed experiments to determine if the gRNA and donor DNA could be combined into a single molecule (termed gDonor). gDonor should complex polycations even after binding the Cas9 protein because the gDonor has a much higher charge density than either the gRNA or donor DNA, due to its longer length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). In addition, gDonor should significantly increase the transfection efficiency of polycationic vectors because every cell that has internalized gRNA will have also have internalized donor DNA. Finally, using gDonor for inducing HDR ensures that there is donor DNA in the vicinity of the DNA cleavage site, and this may further promote efficient HDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Holloman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Durai et al., 2005</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25312.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>A gRNA-donor DNA conjugate (gDonor) transfects cells with higher efficiency than free gRNA and donor DNA.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The proposed mechanism of gene editing with gDonor/Cas9 complexes in cells.

The gRNA was designed to cut the BFP gene and the donor DNA was designed to convert the BFP gene into the GFP gene. The gDonor was purified via gel extraction, and was synthesized with a 40% yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). The activity of the gDonor was investigated by determining its ability to induce NHEJ or HDR in BFP-HEK cells, after electroporation with the Cas9 RNP. In addition, the DNA cleavage pattern of the gDonor in cells was also compared against cells treated with Cas9 RNP and donor DNA to determine whether conjugation to the donor DNA affected the function of the gRNA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> demonstrates that the gDonor was able to convert the BFP gene to the GFP gene via HDR with an efficiency similar to unmodified gRNA and Donor DNA, and thus both the gRNA and donor DNA of the gDonor are active. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> demonstrates that the NHEJ frequency induced by gDonor is dose dependent. In addition, deep sequencing analysis of the electroporated cells demonstrates that the gDonor cleaved its target sequence in cells with specificity and induced a similar pattern of indel mutations as unmodified gRNA control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Additional control cell experiments were conducted with a scrambled DNA conjugated gRNA, which had the same charge density as the gDonor.

Lipofection of Cas9 RNP and Alexa647 labeled 127nt donor ssDNA was conducted following previously published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zuris et al., 2015</xref>). Cells were sorted using a BD influx cell sorter (BD Biosciences) in the Berkeley flow cytometry facility, 16 hr after the nucleofection. Positive gating captured the top 20% of Alexa647 positive cells and negative gating captured the bottom 20% of cells, which had the least amount of Alexa647 fluorescence. DNA extraction was conducted 3 days later and PCR amplification of the mdx target region was conducted using the primer set (GAGAAACTTCTGTGATGTGAGGACATATAAAG and CAATATCTTTGAAGGACTCTGGGTAAAATATC). The HDR efficiency in cells was determined via restriction enzyme digestion of the PCR amplified target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schumann et al., 2015</xref>). The donor DNA for these experiments contained a ClaI restriction enzyme site. The PCR amplicon of the mdx locus was incubated with 10 units of ClaI. After 16 hr of incubation at 37°C, the products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis using a 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Gel (Bio-rad) and stained with SYBR green (Thermo Fisher). Individual band intensity was quantified using ImageLab and the HDR efficiency was calculated using the following equation, where (a) is the uncleaved PCR amplicon and (b) and (c) are the cleavage products: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-12"><title>gDonor synthesis and purification</title><p>5’ Azide-donor DNA was purchased from IDT. 5’ Azide-donor DNA (10 μM) was mixed with 5’ DBCO-crRNA (30 μM) in DI water (50 μL). The solution was incubated at room temperature overnight and the unreacted crRNA was removed by running the reaction solution through a 30k concentrator (Amicon Ultra, EMD Millipore). The gDonor reaction solution was analyzed via gel electrophoresis using a polyacrylamide gel (4–20% Mini-protean TGX Precast gel, Biorad) 200 ng of the reaction mixture was loaded into the gel. The yield of the gDonor was calculated by dividing the band intensity of the gDonor with the combined band intensities of the gDonor + unreacted Donor DNA. The intensity of the gDonor was multiplied by 8/13 to account for its higher molecular weight. PAGE gel extraction was conducted to purify the gDonor conjugate. The gDonor band was cut with a sharp knife and eluted using the crush and soak method in nuclease-free water for 16 hr, and isolated via ethanol precipitation. The purified gDonor was analyzed via gel electrophoresis using a polyacrylamide gel (4–20% Mini-protean TGX Precast gel, Biorad), 200 ng of crRNA, donor DNA, unpurified gDonor, and purified gDonor were loaded onto the gel.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>Deep sequencing analysis</title><p>The genomic region of the Cas9 target sequence was amplified by PCR using Phusion high-fidelity polymerase according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Target genes were amplified first with primer sets (ATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGC and TCGATGCCCTTCAGCTCGATGC). After PCR clean-up, the target gene was amplified with deep sequencing primers. The amplicons were purified using the ChargeSwitch PCR clean-up kit (Thermo Fisher) prior to the deep sequencing PCR. After barcoding and purification, the Berkeley Sequencing facility performed DNA quantification using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic as the Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Suzie Pun (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript is a valuable systematic report of the extent to which terminal modifications are permitted on guide RNA and donor DNA in CRISIP/Cas9 and Cpf1 gene editing, with a focus on Cas9. The observation that guide RNA and donor DNA can be chemically conjugated is particularly important. In addition, the investigators apply fluorophore labeling of donor DNA as a means to enrich cells that have a higher probability of being genetically modified simply due to the amount of donor DNA associated with the cells. The results are valuable and expected to inform the design and use of bioconjugates with crRNA/Cpf1 guide RNA. In a broader sense, the study is an important advance in delivery technology.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We would like you to address the following concerns raised during the reviews, some of which will require the inclusion of additional experimental data.</p><p>1) You state: &quot;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> demonstrates that the crRNA of AsCpf1 (from Acidaminococcus) tolerates chemical modification at its 3' end, in contrast 5' end modifications are less tolerated.&quot; However, the statistical significance is unclear (based on the large variance in the data), and only one 3' modification was investigated, which makes it difficult to draw a conclusion on a trend. Please revise the statement to the extent supported by data.</p><p>2) The use of fluorescent labeling enabled enrichment by a factor of 2. Please comment on the statistical significance of this enrichment and its practical importance with regard of simplifying the whole process.</p><p>3) In addition to histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the reader would benefit from the integral FACS data that will also illustrate gating used for sorting. Because the enrichment was not high, it is of interest to see if more stringent gating would have yielded a more pure cell population. We suggest that FACS data are included, along with the relevant discussion.</p><p>4) In the last paragraph of the subsection “A gRNA-donor DNA conjugate (gDonor) can function as a gRNA and a donor DNA”, the authors state that gDonor was synthesized with a 40% yield.

Please revise the statement to the extent supported by data.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful comment, and have performed additional experiments to investigate if the Cpf1 gRNA is more tolerant to 3’ modifications than 5’ modifications. We purchased or synthesized Cpf1 gRNAs with amine, DBCO, and azide modifications, at either the 3’ or 5’ end, and investigated their ability to generate NHEJ in BFP-HEK cells. These new results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and demonstrate that the Cpf1 gRNA is more tolerant to modifications at its 3’ end than its 5’ end. Cpf1 gRNAs with 5’ modifications composed of either an azide or DBCO had a statistically significant reduction in NHEJ efficiency in comparison to gRNAs that had 3’ amine or azide modifications. We have rewritten the text to describe this additional experiment and also to more accurately reflect the experimental data. It now states: “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> demonstrates that the crRNA from AsCpf1 (from Acidaminococcus) tolerates chemical modifications such as amine, azide, and DBCO at its 3’ end; in contrast, bulky 5’ end modifications such as azide and DBCO are less tolerated.[…] In contrast, BFP-HEK cells electroporated with crRNAs with 5’ modifications and Cpf1 had a reduction in NHEJ frequency and generated only 50-80% of the NHEJ levels as cells treated with unmodified crRNA.”</p><p><italic>2) The use of fluorescent labeling enabled enrichment by a factor of 2. Please comment on the statistical significance of this enrichment and its practical importance with regard of simplifying the whole process.</italic> </p><p>We performed the cell enrichment experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C-E</xref> in triplicate. For each experimental group, three separate cell culture plates were treated with Cas9 RNP and fluorescent donor DNA, sorted and analyzed for HDR. We have performed a one-way ANOVA, post-hoc Tukey test between the average HDR frequency of Alexa647 enriched samples versus the average HDR frequency of control unsorted cells, and obtained a p value lower than 0.01, demonstrating statistical significance.</p><p>Enriching cells for gene editing, non-invasively, via FACS, has the potential to significantly accelerate gene editing cell culture protocols, because it will reduce the number of clones that need to be isolated and sequenced by a factor of 2. The identification of edited cells now requires isolating clones, growing them up and performing deep sequencing. The flow sorting technique presented here, requires minimal additional cost, and will reduce the number of clones that need to be isolated by a factor of 2, and should therefore lower the cost of isolating edited cells. We anticipate that flow sorting based on the donor DNA fluorescence will be particularly useful for editing primary cells, because these cells cannot be easily cultured ex vivo and have a low gene editing efficiency. We have added additional text to the manuscript to explain the potential advantages of flow sorting based on the donor DNA fluorescence, it now states: <bold>“</bold>Enriching cells for gene editing, non-invasively via FACS, has the potential to significantly accelerate gene editing cell culture protocols, because it will reduce the number of clones that need to be isolated and sequenced”.</p><p><italic>3) In addition to histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the reader would benefit from the integral FACS data that will also illustrate gating used for sorting. Because the enrichment was not high, it is of interest to see if more stringent gating would have yielded a more pure cell population. We suggest that FACS data are included, along with the relevant discussion.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comment. We have now included the original FACS and flow cytometry data for the experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, to show the gating used for sorting and quantification. The top image of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows the histogram of Alexa647 fluorescence and the gating that was used to delineate Alexa647-negative and Alexa647-positive cells. The fluorescent microscopy images of the Alexa647-negative and Alexa647-positive cells are also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.</p><p>We have performed an additional experiment to determine if using a more stringent gate for cells that internalized donor DNA would lead to cell populations with higher levels of HDR. We therefore performed an HDR experiment on BFP-HEK cells, transfected with fluorescently labeled donor DNA and Cas9 RNP, and isolated the top 10% of Alexa 647+ cells and the top 20% of Alexa 647+ cells, via flow sorting, and compared their HDR efficiency. We did not observe a difference in HDR efficiency between these two cell populations, suggesting that a 2 fold increase in HDR efficiency is the maximum enrichment we can generate with flow sorting based on the donor DNA fluorescence.</p><p><italic>4) In the last paragraph of the subsection “A gRNA-donor DNA conjugate (gDonor) can function as a gRNA and a donor DNA”, the authors state that gDonor was synthesized with a 40% yield. Please specify how this was calculated since <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> seems to show much lower yield of conjugated gDonor (third lane).</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this discrepancy. The yield in the gDonor synthesis experiment was calculated by running the gDonor reaction mixture on a gel and quantifying the band intensities of the gDonor and the unreacted Donor DNA. The yield of the gDonor was determined by dividing the band intensity of the gDonor with the combined band intensities of the gDonor + unreacted Donor DNA, which represents the maximum possible yield. The intensity of the gDonor was multiplied by 8/13 to account for its higher molecular weight.</p><p>The gel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> is difficult to interpret because the crRNA was used in a large excess and the intensity of the donor DNA and gDonor bands therefore appear small. We have performed another synthesis of the gDonor and have removed the excess crRNA in the reaction via a spin filter. The resulting gDonor reaction was run on a new gel and quantified as described above. This new gel is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, and the band intensities are now clearly visible and correspond to a 40% yield. We have described the procedure used to calculate the gDonor synthesis yield in the Methods.</p><p><italic>5) The statement that gDonor increases PAsp(DET)-mediated HDR is not supported rigorously enough, because of co-delivery of donor DNA and gRNA. It is possible that the longer gDonor results in more efficient packaging of Cas9. To be certain, one more control that should be included: gRNA/Cas9 + Donor DNA with extra nucleic acids at the 5' gRNA to increase its' polyanionic character for packaging.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful comment. As suggested by the reviewers, we have performed additional transfections experiments with gRNA that has extra nucleic acids at its 5’ end, and have compared its transfection efficiency against gDonor. This new data is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and demonstrates that increasing the gRNA with nucleic acids does not increase transfection efficiency. This new data is described in the text as follows: “Additional control cell experiments were conducted with a scrambled DNA conjugated gRNA, which had the same charge density as the gDonor. […] The gDonor represents a new reagent for improving the delivery of both Cas9 RNP and donor DNA into cells and has great potential for accelerating the development of Cas9 based therapeutics.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
