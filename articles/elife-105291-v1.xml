This motile stage invades cutaneous blood vessels to reach the liver and infect hepatocytes. The circumsporozoite protein (CSP) on the sporozoite surface is an important antigen targeted by protective antibodies (Abs) in immunoprophylaxis or elicited by vaccination. Antibody-mediated protection mainly unfolds during parasite skin migration, but rare and potent protective Abs additionally neutralize sporozoite in the liver. Here, using a rodent malaria model, microscopy and bioluminescence imaging, we show a late-neutralizing effect of 3D11 anti-CSP monoclonal antibody (mAb) in the liver. The need for several hours to eliminate parasites in the liver was associated with an accumulation of 3D11 effects, starting with the inhibition of sporozoite motility, sinusoidal extravasation, cell invasion, and terminating with the parasite killing inside the invaded cell. This late-neutralizing activity could be helpful to identify more potent therapeutic mAbs with stronger activity in the liver.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd><italic>Plasmodium</italic></kwd><kwd>monoclonal antibodies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-19-CE15-0027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguirre-Botero</surname><given-names>Manuela C</given-names></name><name><surname>Pacios</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><name><surname>Celli</surname><given-names>Susanna</given-names></name><name><surname>Aliprandini</surname><given-names>Eduardo</given-names></name><name><surname>Gladston</surname><given-names>Anisha</given-names></name><name><surname>Thiberge</surname><given-names>Jean-Michel</given-names></name><name><surname>Formaglio</surname><given-names>Pauline</given-names></name><name><surname>Amino</surname><given-names>Rogerio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-19-CE15-0027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguirre-Botero</surname><given-names>Manuela C</given-names></name><name><surname>Pacios</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><name><surname>Celli</surname><given-names>Susanna</given-names></name><name><surname>Aliprandini</surname><given-names>Eduardo</given-names></name><name><surname>Gladston</surname><given-names>Anisha</given-names></name><name><surname>Thiberge</surname><given-names>Jean-Michel</given-names></name><name><surname>Formaglio</surname><given-names>Pauline</given-names></name><name><surname>Amino</surname><given-names>Rogerio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Laboratoire d'Excellence Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguirre-Botero</surname><given-names>Manuela C</given-names></name><name><surname>Pacios</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><name><surname>Celli</surname><given-names>Susanna</given-names></name><name><surname>Aliprandini</surname><given-names>Eduardo</given-names></name><name><surname>Gladston</surname><given-names>Anisha</given-names></name><name><surname>Thiberge</surname><given-names>Jean-Michel</given-names></name><name><surname>Formaglio</surname><given-names>Pauline</given-names></name><name><surname>Amino</surname><given-names>Rogerio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100021716</institution-id><institution>Pasteur -

The infection, caused by parasites of the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, begins with the inoculation of the sporozoite stage into the skin by an infected mosquito (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sidjanski and Vanderberg, 1997</xref>). Within the skin, sporozoites become activated and move through the dermis until some find and invade a blood vessel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vanderberg and Frevert, 2004</xref>). Upon entering circulation, parasites arrest in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tavares et al., 2017</xref>), cross the sinusoidal barrier within 2–3 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tavares et al., 2013</xref>), and eventually invade hepatocytes. Intracellular parasites replicate massively before being released back into the blood to infect erythrocytes and cause the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sturm et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tarun et al., 2006</xref>). The sporozoite surface is covered by a dense coat of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), shown to be an immunodominant protective antigen in a rodent malaria model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zavala et al., 1983</xref>). This protein has a highly conserved structural organization across diverse <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, comprising conserved N- and C-terminal domains and a highly variable and repetitive central region. Due to its surface localization, abundance, conservation between the same species and immunodominant character, CSP has been targeted by the most effective malaria vaccines. For example, RTS,S/AS01 and R21/Matrix M, the only two malaria vaccines recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), include a fragment of the central repetitive region and the C-terminal domain of the CSP from <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (Pf), the most lethal human-infecting parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Almeida et al., 2021</xref>). Extensive research has demonstrated a positive correlation between high levels of anti-CSP antibodies (Abs) induced by the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine and efficacy against malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">White et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">White et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">White et al., 2015</xref>). Remarkably, anti-CSP monoclonal Abs (mAbs) protect in vivo against sporozoite infection in various experimental settings, including mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Imkeller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kisalu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Murugan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oyen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Potocnjak et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yoshida et al., 1980</xref>), monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cochrane et al., 1982</xref>), and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaudinski et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kayentao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>It has been observed that Abs that target the CSP central repetitive region exhibit a cytotoxic effect on the sporozoites, accompanied by the shedding of the CSP surface coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stewart and Vanderberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yoshida et al., 1980</xref>), inhibition of motility, loss of infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hollingdale et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stewart et al., 1986</xref>), and parasite death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Botero et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aliprandini et al., 2018</xref>). These effects are independent of downstream host immune effectors such as the complement and immune host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aliprandini et al., 2018</xref>). Instead, Ab cytotoxicity increases when parasites are moving in 3D substrates such as the matrix of the cutaneous environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Botero et al., 2023</xref>). Accordingly, neutralization of sporozoites by anti-CSP Abs occurs primarily during their migration through the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Botero et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aliprandini et al., 2018</xref>) and is dependent on sporozoite motility and host cell-wounding activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aliprandini et al., 2018</xref>), which are both crucial for parasite progression in the dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amino et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Yet, while the role of the skin in anti-CSP Abs-mediated sporozoite neutralization has been increasingly studied, little is known about the mechanisms by which these effectors contribute, outside of the skin, to neutralize sporozoite infection. Potent Abs or high concentrations of them were shown to efficiently target sporozoites in the blood and liver (BL) following intravenous (i.v.) parasite inoculation which bypasses the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Botero et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Potocnjak et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Ab cytotoxicity is also thought to be responsible for sporozoite neutralization in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), but some highly cytotoxic Abs were not able to significantly decrease infection following an i.v. sporozoite inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Botero et al., 2023</xref>). In this study, we analyzed how 3D11, a cytotoxic mAb against the CSP of <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> (Pb) which has been shown to inhibit parasite motility and kill sporozoites in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aliprandini et al., 2018</xref>), as well as to inhibit motility in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flores-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>), affects sporozoite distribution in the BL, hepatocyte infection, and intracellular development. The current investigation provides a comprehensive view of the kinetics and mode of action of 3D11 on multiple steps of liver infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tissue-dependent neutralization of Pb sporozoites</title><p>To assess how efficiently the anti-PbCSP repeat mAb 3D11 targets sporozoites in the skin and in the BL, mice were passively immunized intraperitoneally with 100 µg of mAb 3D11 or with an isotype control (W24). Twenty-four hours later, animals were challenged either i.v. or micro-injected into the skin with, respectively, 1000 and 5000 GFP-expressing sporozoites. The sporozoite inoculum was adjusted to achieve comparable infection regardless of the route of parasite injection as reflected by the similar parasitemia of the control groups, measured by the percentage of infected red blood cells by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, W24). In addition, we compared the results obtained following these two routes of inoculation with infection initiated by sporozoites naturally transmitted by mosquitos. The extent of bite exposure was adjusted to reach a level of host infection equivalent to that obtained after skin and i.v. challenge. Protection was assessed by measuring the parasitemia 5 days after sporozoite inoculation when parasites are still growing exponentially in the blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Sterile protection was defined as the percentage of uninfected animals 10 days after the challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The skin and the bite challenge allowed us to study 3D11 neutralizing activity in the cutaneous tissue as well as in the BL, while the i.v. challenge bypasses the skin, and reflects only the mAb-neutralizing activity in the BL.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tissue-dependent neutralization of Pb sporozoites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of the log of percentual parasitemia at day 5 post-challenge and (<bold>B</bold>) survival curves of animals that received 100 µg of the isotype control (W24) or 3D11 monoclonal antibody (mAb), followed by inoculation of sporozoites, in the tail vein (i.v.), micro-injected in the skin or by mosquito bite (bite).

Despite not eliciting sterile protection, 3D11 led to a tenfold reduction in parasitemia after i.v. challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and accordingly, a delayed prepatency in passively immunized mice compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results confirm that the bite challenge is more comparable to the skin challenge than the i.v. challenge, as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Botero et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aliprandini et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, we confirmed that 3D11 predominantly neutralizes sporozoites in the skin, but also targets sporozoites in the BL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flores-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>), establishing a quantitative measure of its relative tissue protection.</p><p>Next, we investigated the impact of higher mAb concentration on sporozoite neutralization in the BL. Following the same passive immunization schedule, we compared the parasitemia of mice injected intraperitoneally with 100 and 300 µg of mAb 3D11 and challenged i.v. 24 hr later. Increasing the mAb dose to 300 µg further reduced the parasitemia by ~100-fold compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, this threefold increase of the mAb dose still failed to confer sterile protection against i.v. challenge while 100 µg of 3D11 were sufficient to clear the infection in 86–100% of the mice after skin or bite challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, C</xref>).

Sporozoites were scored as motile if they moved at least one body length in 5 min, otherwise, they were considered non-motile. Additionally, we also quantified if the parasites were inside the vessel or outside that is, in the hepatic parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since 3D11 does not target PbPf GFP parasites, most of them are motile in the first hour of analysis, making them easily distinguishable from GFP-expressing endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Already 10 min after inoculation, 3D11-susceptible parasites displayed a strong impairment in motility compared to the control parasites in passively immunized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). At this time point, sporozoites were only occasionally observed dying during these first minutes. Thirty minutes after sporozoite injection, almost none of the susceptible Pb mCherry parasites were motile while 50% of the control PbPf GFP sporozoites were still moving. Two hours later, a similar number of PbPf (<italic>n</italic> = 18, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and Pb (<italic>n</italic> = 29, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) sporozoites were found in the liver, all, already immotile. Strikingly, only 52% of the Pb mCherry susceptible sporozoites were found in the parenchyma in contrast to 89% of non-susceptible parasites, indicating that 3D11 affects sporozoite entry into the hepatic parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To exclude any effect coming from the insertion of the window on these results, additional experiments were performed by imaging dissected livers of passively immunized mice. Ex vivo, we observed that after 1 hr, 97% of the control parasites (<italic>n</italic> = 34) were inside the parenchyma in contrast to 53% of the susceptible sporozoites (<italic>n</italic> = 45), confirming the results of the in vivo experiments. Since comparable numbers of Pb mCherry and PbPf GFP sporozoites were found in the microscopic fields quantified in vivo and ex vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), we can infer that 3D11 blocks sporozoite entry into the hepatic parenchyma by around twofold. Yet, this impairment alone cannot explain the decrease of at least one order of magnitude in the parasitemia measured 3–4 days after infection in the mice used for in vivo imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Hence, in 3D11-treated mice, most sporozoites die in the hepatic parenchyma probably due to the loss of fitness caused by the 3D11 mAb. However, whether the late reduction in parasite load occurring after 4 hr post-infection is associated with the death of extracellular sporozoites that failed to invade hepatocytes or corresponds to the clearance of parasites undergoing abortive intracellular development could not be addressed in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>In vitro effect of 3D11 on sporozoite invasion and development</title><p>To better understand the late-neutralizing effect of 3D11 mAb observed on sporozoites in vivo, we performed an invasion and development assay in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Prudêncio et al., 2008</xref>) using Pb GFP-expressing sporozoites to infect the hepatoma cell line HepG2 in the presence or absence of 3D11.

The inhibition patterns of cell invasion and parasite killing were similar suggesting that the Ab’s cytotoxic effect could account for part of the invasion inhibition in this setting. However, the causality of this association still needs to be demonstrated since at low 3D11 concentrations the inhibition of invasion was higher than killing.</p><p>To determine if the cytotoxic effect of 3D11 also causes delayed parasite killing within HepG2 cells, we compared the percentage of surviving and developing parasites relative to the control at 2, 15, and 44 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in the number of intracellularly developing parasites when comparing the recently invaded cells (2 hr) with later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, 2 hr vs. 15 and 44 hr). Notably, this effect was already reached at 15 hr. For example, the exposition of sporozoites for 2 hr with 5 µg/ml of 3D11 led to a more than 50% reduction in the post-invasion number of intracellular parasites at 15 and 44 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The dose-dependent loss of fitness caused by 3D11 mAb was also demonstrated by decreasing GFP intensities of the surviving EEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Post-invasion labeling of 3D11 bound to the membrane of intracellular parasites revealed a strong staining surrounding the parasite at 2 and 15 hr, but only punctual traces of 3D11 at 44 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, 3D11 - cyan). Of note, CSP was detected surrounding the control parasites at all time points indicating that the lack of staining at 44 hr is not due to a decrease in the CSP amount on the parasite surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, CSP, Control). To evaluate the potential post-invasion entry of 3D11 into the PV of infected cells and posterior neutralization of intracellular parasites, we incubated invaded cells from 2 to 44 hr with 3D11, but no effect on the parasite intracellular development was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, 2 hr p.i.). 3D11 incubated for 2 hr with sporozoites and cells elicited, as expected, a dose-dependent inhibition of parasite development. Altogether, our results indicate that the late inhibition of parasite development is already achieved at 15 hr and likely caused by Abs dragged inside cells bound to sporozoites before or during the invasion. In line with the late sporozoite neutralization effect observed in the liver, the in vitro assay demonstrates that 3D11 not only inhibits sporozoite entry into host cells but also affects its fitness resulting in subsequent parasite killing hours after invasion.</p><p>To further characterize the killing of intracellular parasites by 3D11 in HepG2 cells, we next evaluated the expression of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) marker, UIS4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mueller et al., 2005</xref>), to infer the parasite intracellular development at 2, 4, and 44 hr.

This ~threefold increase in the UIS4-negative population could explain the late killing of intracellular sporozoites by 3D11. Whether this population is constituted by intracellular transmigratory sporozoites lacking a PVM or parasites surrounded by a PVM, but incapable of secreting UIS4 still needs to be determined. At 44 hr, surviving EEFs in the 3D11-treated samples presented a similar area and UIS4 staining intensity than control parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>). However, as observed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), the GFP intensity of 3D11-treated parasites was significantly lower than control EEFs, indicating that 3D11 can somehow affect protein expression with undetermined effects in the genesis of red blood cell infecting stages.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The skin plays a major role in parasite-dependent cytotoxicity induced by anti-CSP Abs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Botero et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aliprandini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flores-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vanderberg and Frevert, 2004</xref>).

Despite having lower protective efficiency in the BL than in the skin, this extra-cutaneous neutralizing activity is a characteristic of the most potent protective Abs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Botero et al., 2023</xref>), indicating that the killing of skin escapees is critical for sterilizing immunity. In the hepatic environment, these cytotoxic Abs have been shown to prevent parasite egress from sinusoids, hinder cell traversal, and kill sporozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). However, the hepatic cytotoxic neutralizing activities of these different Abs do not always match their protective activity.</p><p>By combining intravital imaging and cellular assays, we quantified the <italic>P. berghei</italic> clearance by 3D11 focused on the different steps of parasite development in the liver. We first measured the effect of 3D11 in the BL and compared it to its effect in the skin by controlling the number of sporozoites for the i.v. and skin challenges. This allowed us to show that 3D11-mediated protection mainly unfolds in the skin, leading to sterile protection upon skin challenge, while there is only a tenfold decrease in parasitemia after i.v. challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, these data support the notion that 3D11 is less effective in the bloodstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flores-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>), as higher concentrations of Abs are required to protect against i.v. challenge compared to skin challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Accordingly, previous studies have reported that high amount of 3D11 transferred to mice is required to provide sterile protection after an i.v. challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Charoenvit et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Potocnjak et al., 1980</xref>). To increase protection in the BL, instead of transferring 100 µg of 3D11 by i.p. injection and waiting 24 hr for the sporozoite inoculation, for the ensuing intravital imaging experiments, we transferred 100 µg of 3D11 by i.v. injection and inoculated parasites in the tail vein 10 min after the Ab transfer. This modification increased the protection in one order of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig3s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>When bioluminescent parasites are i.v. injected in passively immunized mice, 3D11 does not inhibit parasite arrest in the liver, suggesting that the repeat region of Pb CSP is not involved in the sporozoite homing to the liver. It is striking that once the parasites reach the liver, the bioluminescent signal in 3D11-treated mice only decreases ~30% at 4 hr post-sporozoite inoculation indicating that most parasites are lately killed by 3D11. A deeper and direct analysis of parasite elimination using intravital confocal microscopy showed that 3D11 mAb promptly inhibits parasite motility in the liver. After arresting in the liver in comparable numbers, ~80% of control PbPf sporozoites were motile, while only 40% of susceptible Pb mCherry sporozoites were moving (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, the reduction in motility only prevented the hepatic parenchyma invasion of ~50% of parasites. These results suggest that 3D11 inhibits sporozoite motility and limits their exit from the liver sinusoids, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) but this twofold difference in parasite translocation alone cannot completely explain the ~100-fold reduction of parasitemia observed 3 days later in 3D11-treated versus control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). During 3 hr of continuous imaging, it was observed that 3D11-susceptible parasites rarely fragmented and died in vivo. These experiments were conducted in mice expressing GFP in endothelial cells, which made the accurate quantification of control PbPf GFP sporozoites difficult. Nonetheless, susceptible Pb mCherry parasites sporozoites were found in comparable numbers to the non-susceptible GFP sporozoites, indicating a low killing activity of 3D11 in the first 3 hr post-i.v. inoculation, and in concordance with the bioluminescence data. This observation contrasts with the findings on the effects of potent PfCSP human mAb (hmAbs) where 20 and 40% of sporozoites died while recording their in vivo effect in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). This discrepancy in parasite killing may be due to differences in Ab potency. However, this level of killing cannot also completely explain the magnitude of anti-CSP-mediated protection in both studies. To dissect the late-killing effect of the 3D11 mAb, we quantified the in vitro effect of this cytotoxic antibody in the process of invasion and sporozoite development inside hepatoma HepG2 cells. As previously described, 3D11 inhibits sporozoite cell invasion in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hollingdale et al., 1982</xref>). In our experimental setup, 5 µg/ml of 3D11 inhibited 88% of cell invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>), which accounts for most of the 95% infection inhibition observed after 15 and 44 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). It is important to note that the cytotoxicity of anti-CSP Abs correlates with sporozoite loss of fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Botero et al., 2023</xref>), quantified by the inhibition of motility, the loss of infectivity, and the killing of sporozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Botero et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aliprandini et al., 2018</xref>). The dose–response similarity between the inhibition of invasion and the decrease in viability, both measured in the same assay, suggests that the inhibitory activity of 3D11 on cell invasion assays could be a consequence of the cytotoxic effect of this antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, this does not rule out other mechanisms of invasion inhibition. Additionally, our data also show a lasting effect of 3D11 on intracellular parasites in vitro after Ab removal. This effect is reflected not only in the two- to threefold decrease in parasite numbers between 2 and 15 hr compared to the control using 2.5 and 5 µg/ml of 3D11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) but also in the decrease of EEF fitness, revealed by its decreased GFP intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>). Notably, a similar effect has been previously reported using sera from mice immunized with PfCSP or mAb against <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic> (Py) CSP. Incubation of Pf or Py sporozoites with the immune sera or mAbs not only affected sporozoite invasion in vitro but continued to affect intracellular forms for several days after invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mazier et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nudelman et al., 1989</xref>). Additionally, using anti-Pf CSP sera, it was also observed that late EEFs from sera-treated sporozoites had abnormal morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mazier et al., 1986</xref>). Altogether, it was thus concluded that the anti-CSP Abs present in the sera had a long-term effect on the parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mazier et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nudelman et al., 1989</xref>). Importantly, in our experimental settings and using the mAb 3D11, we did not observe any malformation of the Pb EEFs but rather a decrease in the EEF GFP fluorescence at 44 hr in the 3D11-treated samples compared to the control. These differences could be due to the distinct invasion and developmental process of Pb and Pf, or to the potency of the Abs present in the serum compared to 3D11. The in vivo bioluminescence data suggest that 3D11 only weakly interferes with the development of late EEFs, as the signal of survivors in 3D11-treated mice between 24, 44, and 72 hr only slightly decreased, and this difference was not significative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Accordingly, in vitro, the decrease on intracellular parasite numbers already occurred at 15 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, F</xref>) and stayed constant until 44 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). The GFP fluorescence decrease observed at 44 hr in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C, D</xref>), could explain the slight decrease in the bioluminescence signal observed in vivo between 24 and 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, the relative percentual increase of the UIS4-negative population in 3D11-treated parasites versus control parasites indicates that the long-term killing could be a consequence of this phenotype. Further experiments are needed to determine whether the same phenotype is occurring in vivo and if the 3D11 lasting neutralizing activity is associated with the inhibition of UIS4 secretion or with the intracellular arrest of PVM-negative transmigratory parasites.</p><p>Although 3D11 cytotoxicity could be the primary contributor to the inhibition of parasite entry into the liver parenchyma in vivo and cell invasion in vitro, it is unclear whether it is the sole factor responsible for these effects. MAbs with high cytotoxicity, such as mAb10, do not significantly protect mice after i.v. sporozoite challenge, despite displaying a similar cytotoxic neutralizing activity profile in the liver than protective mAbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Botero et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). CIS43, a hmAb that targets the junctional epitope of Pf CSP, has been found to interfere with its proteolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kisalu et al., 2018</xref>), which is a crucial process for cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coppi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Espinosa et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, it has recently been shown using 13 distinct PfCSP hmAbs, that protection after i.v. challenge strongly correlates with high affinity to the junctional region, which contains all three repeat motifs of Pf CSP (NPDP, NVDP, and NANP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Botero et al., 2023</xref>), reinforcing the hypothesis that anti-CSP repeat Abs could hinder the CSP processing at the putative cleavage site region I that is located adjacent to the junctional region of the central repetitive region of Pf CSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coppi et al., 2005</xref>). 3D11 Fab was shown to preferentially bind to the NPND motifs located mostly at the junction with the N-terminal domain. Still, it also cross-reacts with all repeat motifs, binding to PbCSP in a spiral-like conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kucharska et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, further investigation is required to elucidate the role of CSP processing in inhibiting sporozoite invasion by anti-CSP Ab, for example, using parasites lacking the N-terminal domain of CSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coppi et al., 2011</xref>). To investigate other potential mechanisms by which Abs are neutralizing sporozoites in the BL, it is necessary to use non-cytotoxic conditions. This can be addressed by using a low-cytotoxic mAb, like CIS43, or parasites lacking sporozoite-secreted pore-forming proteins, such as SPECT2. It has been previously demonstrated that Ab-mediated killing depends on the shedding of CSP, which renders the parasite membrane susceptible to its own cell-wounding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aliprandini et al., 2018</xref>). According to this study, Pb and Py SPECT2KO mutants have a higher resistance to the killing activity of CSP Abs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aliprandini et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, this study shows the kinetics of sporozoite elimination by the cytotoxic 3D11 mAb in the liver and quantifies the inhibitory activity of 3D11 in the key steps of hepatic infection. The measurement of the inhibition of invasion and 3D11 cytotoxicity in vitro suggests a potential association between these two activities, but this result does not exclude the concomitant existence of other neutralizing mechanisms. Remarkably, this study reveals a late-killing effect of cytotoxic 3D11 on sporozoites within the liver parenchyma. This late-killing activity was also observed in vitro and it was associated with the increase of a population lacking the PVM developmental marker UIS4. This study shows that cytotoxic 3D11 mAb exerts its protective action outside the skin by inhibiting several critical steps in the hepatic infection and, surprisingly, taking several hours to significantly decrease the hepatic load of parasites. Understanding the mechanisms of sporozoite neutralization by anti-CSP Abs in the host tissues is crucial for better comprehending parasite biology and developing new tools to prevent sporozoite infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HepG2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HB-8065</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, female)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RjOrl:SWISS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Janvier Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#SN-SWISS-F</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, female)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6JRj</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Janvier Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#SC-C57J-F</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SDA 500</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CEPIA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ANKA, Pb GFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ishino et al., 2006</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ANKA, Pb mCherry</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Botero et al., 2023</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ANKA, Pb GFP- luciferase</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Franke-Fayard et al., 2008</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ANKA, PbPf</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2020</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3D11 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BEI Resources</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MRA-100</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(0.006–100 µg/ml)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Parasites, mosquitoes, and mice</title><p>For the i.v., skin, and bite challenges, we used transgenic Pb ANKA strain parasites expressing GFP (PbGFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ishino et al., 2006</xref>).

The authors show that the anti-CSP mAb could protect against intravenous (i.v.) Pb sporozoite challenge along with the cutaneous challenge, but requires higher concentration of antibody. Importantly, the study shows that the anti-CSP mAb not only affects sporozoite motility, sinusoidal extravasation, and cell invasion but also partially impairs the intracellular development inside the liver parenchyma, indicating a late effect of this antibody during liver stage development. While the study is interesting and conducted well, the only novel yet very important observation made in this manuscript is the effect of the anti-CSP mAb on liver stage development.</p><p>Major</p><p>This observation is highlighted in the manuscript title but is supported by only limited data. A such it needs to be substantiated and a mechanism should be investigated. The phenomenon of intracellular effects of the anti-CSP mAb should be analyzed in much more detail. For example, can the authors demonstrate uptake of the Ab together with the parasite during hepatocyte invasion? What cellular mechanism leads to elimination?</p><p>Lines 234 - 243; 308 - 325: These results are the gist of the entire study and also defined the title of the manuscript. Thus, it would be pre-mature to claim the substantial effect of 3D11 antibody in late killing of the parasite in the infected hepatocytes just by looking at the decreased GFP fluorescence. The authors need to at least verify the fitness of the liver stages by measuring the size of the developing parasites as well as using different parasite specific markers (UIS4, MSP1, HSP70 etc.) in immunofluorescence assays on the infected liver sections and in vitro infections.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate the comments. We have taken the suggestions into consideration and deepened the characterization of 3D11's late killing of parasites. We first analyzed the presence of 3D11 in the intracellular parasite after the invasion and compared it with the CSP expression on the surface of control parasites (new Fig. 4F). Next, we tested a potential action of 3D11 added in the cell culture after the invasion (new Fig. 4G). The two new panels and the text accompanying them are shown below.</p><p>“Post-invasion labeling of 3D11 bound to the membrane of intracellular parasites revealed a strong staining surrounding the parasite at 2 and 15h, but only punctual traces of 3D11 at 44h (Figure 4F, 3D11, 3D11). Of note, CSP was detected surrounding the control parasites at all time-points indicating that the lack of staining at 44h is not due to a decrease in the CSP amount on the parasite surface (Figure 4F, CSP, Control). To evaluate the potential post-invasion entry of 3D11 into the PV of infected cells and posterior neutralization of intracellular parasites, we incubated invaded cells from 2 to 44 h with 3D11, but no effect on the parasite intracellular development was observed (Figure 4G, 2h p.i.). 3D11 incubated for 2 h with sporozoites and cells elicited, as expected, a dose-dependent inhibition of parasite development. Altogether, our results indicate that the late inhibition of parasite development is already achieved at 15h and likely caused by antibodies dragged inside cells bound to sporozoites before or during the invasion.”</p><p>Finally, we better characterized the parasite loss of fitness caused by 3D11 in infected cells by quantifying the parasite size, GFP intensity and the presence and intensity of UIS4, a parasitophorous vacuole membrane developmental marker at 2, 4 and 44h as described below in the new figure 5 and accompanying text.</p><p>“To further characterize the killing of intracellular parasites by 3D11 in HepG2 cells, we next evaluated the expression of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) marker, UIS4 37, to infer the parasite intracellular development at 2, 4 and 44h. HepG2 cells were incubated with Pb-GFP expressing sporozoites in the absence (Control, Figure 5) or presence of 1.25 µg/mL of 3D11 during the first two hours of incubation (3D11, Figure 5). The chosen 3D11 concentration led to ~50% decrease in cell invasion (Figure 4C, 2h) and ~30% decrease in the post-invasion number of EEFs (Figure 4D), leaving enough parasites to be analyzed by microscopy. To distinguish between extracellular and intracellular parasites at 2h, washed and fixed samples were incubated with mouse 3D11 mAb (1µg/mL) and revealed with a fluorescent anti-mouse secondary antibody (Figure 5A, 3D11 in blue). Samples were then permeabilized and incubated with a goat anti-UIS4 polyclonal antibody revealed with a fluorescent anti-goat secondary antibody (Figure 5A, UIS4 in red). DNA was stained with Hoechst (Figure 5A, DNA in white).</p><p>Extracellular GFP+ sporozoites were identified by their 3D11+UIS4- phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>,2h extracellular). Conversely, intracellular parasites were identified by their 3D11- phenotype and stained positive or negative for UIS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, 2h and 44h, intracellular). UIS4+ PVM is normally associated with a productive cell infection 37. However, a small number of EEFs can develop in the absence of UIS4 37, likely inside the host cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, 44h, intranuclear).</p><p>In the control and 3D11-treated groups, the percentage of intracellular UIS4- parasites decreased 2 to 3-fold from 2 to 44h, as expected of a parasite population negative for a marker of productive infection (Figure 5B). However, while at 2h in the control group, this population represented 14% of intracellular parasites, in the 3D11-treated group, it reached 48% (Figure 5B). This ~3-fold increase in the UIS4 negative population could explain the late killing of intracellular sporozoites by 3D11. Whether this population is constituted by intracellular transmigratory sporozoites lacking a PVM or parasites surrounded by a PVM, but incapable of secreting UIS4 still needs to be determined. At 44h, surviving EEFs in the 3D11-treated samples presented a similar area and UIS4 staining intensity than control parasites (Figure 5C, D). However, as observed by flow cytometry (Figure 4D), the GFP intensity of 3D11-treated parasites was significantly lower than control EEFs, indicating that 3D11 can somehow affect protein expression with undetermined effects in the genesis of red blood cell infecting stages.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor</p><p>• Line 44 - 43: The statement is applicable only to the rodent infecting Plasmodium parasites.

Now the text reads:</p><p>“Altogether, these data indicate that 3D11 rather than having an early effect on i.v. inoculated sporozoites in the blood circulation, e.g. by inhibiting the homing or killing the parasite in the blood, requires more than 4 h to eliminate most parasites in the liver.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure 3B: The numbers of sporozoites detected in the experiment varies from 0 h (line 172) to 2 h (line 184).

The cells were subsequently trypsinized. The supernatant plus the washing steps and the trypsinized cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to quantify the amount of GFP + events inside and outside cells (Figure 3A and Figure S4). Viability was then quantified by the sum of the total number of sporozoites (GPF + events) in the supernatant, inside and outside the cells. We calculated the percentage of parasite viability by dividing the average of the total number of sporozoites in the treated samples by the average in controls using three technical replicates for each condition. Additionally, we quantified the percentage of infected cells using the total number of GFP + events in the HepG2 gate (Figure S4). To compare the biological replicates, we further normalized to the control of each experiment. For the samples used to analyze parasite development, the cells were incubated for 15 or 44 h after sporozoite addition, and the medium was changed after 2 and 24 h. The cells were trypsinized and the percentage of intracellular parasites was determined by flow cytometry as described above (Figure S4). The prolonged effect between 2 h and 15/44 h was calculated by normalizing the percentage of infected cells at 15/44 h to that of 2 h. For all flow cytometry measurements, the same volume was acquired.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure 4: The flow layouts should be included for at least comparing the 0 vs. 5 μg/ml of 3D11 mAb concentrations.</p></disp-quote><p>Flow layouts were added in the supplementary figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Line 651 (Figure S1 legend): Typographical error '14'.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noticing.

By using microscopy and bioluminescence imaging in the P. berghei rodent malaria model, the authors first demonstrate that higher antibody concentrations are required for protection against intravenous sporozoite challenge, when compared to cutaneous challenge, which is not surprising. The study also shows that the 3D11 mAb reduces sporozoite motility, impairs hepatic sinusoidal barrier crossing, and more relevantly inhibits intracellular development of liver stages through its cytotoxic activity. These findings highlight the role of this specific monoclonal antibody, 3D11 mAb against CSP, in targeting sporozoites in the liver.</p><p>Major Comments</p><p>The study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of protection conferred by the 3D11 anti-CSP monoclonal antibody against P. berghei sporozoites and this finding allow the field to speculate that other monoclonal antibodies against CSP of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> may act similarly. However, an important experiment is missing that would significantly strengthen the conclusions. Specifically, the authors should perform experiments where the monoclonal antibody is added immediately after the sporozoites have completed invasion. This should be done both in vitro and in vivo to show whether the antibody has any effect on intracellular development of liver stages when added after invasion.</p><p>While the claims are generally supported by the data presented, to comprehensively conclude the late cytotoxic effects of 3D11, the additional experiment of post-invasion antibody application is relevant. This would help determine if the observed effects are due to the antibody's action during invasion or its continued action post-invasion.</p><p>The data and methods are presented in a manner that allows for reproducibility. The use of microscopy and bioluminescence imaging is well-documented. The experiments appear adequately replicated, and statistical analyses are appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 2 for these important suggestions. To be sure that the effect might not come from the internalization of the antibodies after sporozoite invasion, we tested the amount of 3D11 bound to the parasite following invasion (new Fig. 4F) and the potential post-invasion neutralizing effect of 3D11 in vitro. The results obtained are presented below.</p><p>“Post-invasion labeling of 3D11 bound to the membrane of intracellular parasites revealed a strong staining surrounding the parasite at 2 and 15h, but only punctual traces of 3D11 at 44h (Figure 4F, 3D11, 3D11).
