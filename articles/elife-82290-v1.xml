This evolutionary fate of a gene can also be affected by factors independent of gene dispensability, including the mutability of genomic positions, but such features have not been examined well. To uncover the genomic features associated with gene loss, we investigated the characteristics of genomic regions where genes have been independently lost in multiple lineages. With a comprehensive scan of gene phylogenies of vertebrates with a careful inspection of evolutionary gene losses, we identified 813 human genes whose orthologs were lost in multiple mammalian lineages: designated ‘elusive genes.’ These elusive genes were located in genomic regions with rapid nucleotide substitution, high GC content, and high gene density. A comparison of the orthologous regions of such elusive genes across vertebrates revealed that these features had been established before the radiation of the extant vertebrates approximately 500 million years ago. The association of human elusive genes with transcriptomic and epigenomic characteristics illuminated that the genomic regions containing such genes were subject to repressive transcriptional regulation. Thus, the heterogeneous genomic features driving gene fates toward loss have been in place and may sometimes have relaxed the functional indispensability of such genes. This study sheds light on the complex interplay between gene function and local genomic properties in shaping gene evolution that has persisted since the vertebrate ancestor.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gene loss</kwd><kwd>elusive gene</kwd><kwd>late replication timing</kwd><kwd>LAD</kwd><kwd>synonymous substitutions</kwd><kwd>gene fate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Chimpanzee</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Central bearded dragon </kwd><kwd>Tropical clawed flog </kwd><kwd>Coelacanth</kwd><kwd>Spotted gar</kwd><kwd>Bamboo shark</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hara</surname><given-names>Yuichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuraku</surname><given-names>Shigehiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005865</institution-id><institution>Mochida Memorial Foundation for Medical and Pharmaceutical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hara</surname><given-names>Yuichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21K06132</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hara</surname><given-names>Yuichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20H03269</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuraku</surname><given-names>Shigehiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP21wm0325050</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hara</surname><given-names>Yuichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The genomic features associated with a gene fate to loss have been retained for approximately 500 million years during evolution, and the genes with these features exhibit restricted expression profiles, leading to the genes being less important.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the course of evolution, genomes continue to retain most genes with occasional duplications, while losing some genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blomme et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernández and Gabaldón, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shen et al., 2018</xref>). This retention and loss can be interpreted as gene fate; genes are stably retained in the genome, but some factors may cause them to transition to a state where deletion occurs. Accordingly, identification of the factors allowing gene loss may facilitate our understanding of gene fate. Gene retention or loss has generally been considered to depend largely on the functional importance of the particular gene from the perspective of molecular evolutionary biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albalat and Cañestro, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartha et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanc et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Olson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shen et al., 2018</xref>). Genes with indispensable functions have usually been retained with highly conserved sequences in genomes through rapid elimination of alleles that impair gene functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hirsh and Fraser, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Krylov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Miyata et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pál et al., 2006</xref>). On the contrary, genes with less important functions are likely to accept more mutations and structural variations, which can degrade the original functions, leading to gene loss through pseudogenization or genomic deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jordan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang et al., 2003</xref>). To date, gene loss has been imputed to the relaxation of functional constraints of individual genes. Gene loss has further been revealed to drive phenotypic adaptation in various organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albalat and Cañestro, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Olson, 1999</xref>), as well as in a gene knockout collection of yeasts in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giaever and Nislow, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maclean et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To uncover the association between fates and functional importance of the genes, molecular evolutionary analyses have been conducted at various scales, from gene-by-gene to genome-wide. A number of studies have revealed that the genes with reduced non-synonymous substitution rates (or <italic>K</italic><sub>A</sub> values) and ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (<italic>K</italic><sub>A</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>S</sub> ratios) are less likely to be lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jordan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang et al., 2003</xref>). A genome-wide comparison of duplicated genes in yeast revealed larger <italic>K</italic><sub>A</sub> values for those lost in multiple lineages than those retained by all the species investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrne and Wolfe, 2007</xref>). Other comprehensive studies of gene loss across metazoans and teleosts revealed that the genes expressed in the central nervous system are less prone to loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernández and Gabaldón, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roux et al., 2017</xref>). These observations again suggest that gene fate depends on the functional constraints of a particular gene.</p><p>Besides functional constraints, several studies have identified the genes lost independently in multiple lineages, revealing that the genomic regions containing these genes ‘prefer’ particular characteristics associated with structural instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cortez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hughes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lewin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maeso et al., 2016</xref>). In mammals, tandemly arrayed homeobox genes derived from the Crx gene family were lost in multiple species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lewin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maeso et al., 2016</xref>). The findings suggest that genomic features containing tandem duplications facilitate unequal crossing over, leading to frequent gene loss. Mammalian chromosome Y, which contains abundant repetitive elements and continues to reduce in size, has lost a considerable number of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cortez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hughes et al., 2012</xref>). In the stickleback genome, a <italic>Pitx1</italic> enhancer was independently lost in multiple lineages inhabiting freshwater due to its genomic location in a structurally fragile site, leading to recurrent loss of pelvic fins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xie et al., 2019</xref>). Genes and genomic elements in such particular regions may be prone to loss in a more neutral manner than the relaxation of functional importance or via functional adaptations. Accordingly, these studies focusing on the particular genomic regions led us to search for the common features in genomes that potentially facilitate gene loss. Genome-wide scans have revealed heterogeneous distributions of a variety of sequence and structural features so far, for example, base composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernardi and Bernardi, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Katzman et al., 2011</xref>), the frequency of repetitive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Korenberg and Rykowski, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Medstrand et al., 2002</xref>), and DNA-damage sensitivity induced by replication inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Debatisse et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Helmrich et al., 2006</xref>). However, the extent to which these characteristics are associated with gene fates has not been understood well at a genome-wide level.</p><p>The accumulation of near-complete genome assemblies for various organisms facilitates comprehensive taxon-wide analysis of gene loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernández and Gabaldón, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guijarro-Clarke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rice and McLysaght, 2017</xref>). Along with this motivation, we recently performed a comprehensive analysis on the fate of paralogs generated via the two-round whole-genome duplications in early vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hara et al., 2018a</xref>). The results revealed that the genes retained by reptiles but lost in mammals and Aves rapidly accumulated not only non-synonymous but also synonymous substitutions in comparison with the counterparts retained by almost all the vertebrates examined, indicating that those genes prone to loss show increasing mutation rates. Furthermore, these loss-prone genes were located in genomic regions with high GC contents, high gene densities, and high repetitive element frequencies. These findings suggest that the fates of those genes are influenced not only by functional constraints but also by intrinsic genomic characteristics. Because the findings were restricted to a set of particular genes, they prompted us to examine whether this trend is associated with gene fates on a genome-wide scale.</p><p>In this study, we inferred molecular phylogenies of vertebrate orthologs to systematically search for the genes harboring different fates in the human genome. We previously referred to the nature of genes prone to loss as ‘elusive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hara et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hara et al., 2018b</xref>). In this study, we define the elusive genes as those that are retained by modern humans but have been lost independently in multiple mammalian lineages. As a comparison of the elusive genes, we retrieved the genes that were retained by almost all of the mammalian species examined and defined them as ‘non-elusive,’ representing those persistent in the genomes. We conducted a careful search for gene loss to reduce the false discovery rate (FDR), which is usually caused by incomplete sequence information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Botero-Castro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deutekom et al., 2019</xref>). By comparing the genomic regions containing these genes, we uncovered genomic characteristics relevant to gene loss. We associated the elusive genes with a variety of findings from deep sequencing analyses of the human genome, including transcriptomics, epigenomics, and genetic variations. These data assisted us to understand how intrinsic genomic features may affect gene fate, leading to gene loss by decreasing the expression level and eventually relaxing the functional importance of ‘elusive’ genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of human ‘elusive’ genes</title><p>We defined an ‘elusive’ gene as a human protein-coding gene that existed in the common mammalian ancestors but was lost independently in multiple mammalian lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’ for details). We searched for such genes by reconstructing phylogenetic trees of vertebrate orthologs and detecting gene loss events within the individual trees. To search for elusive genes, we paid close attention to distinguishing true evolutionary gene loss from falsely inferred gene loss caused by insufficient genome assembly, gene prediction, and orthologous clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Botero-Castro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deutekom et al., 2019</xref>), as described below.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Detection of ‘elusive’ genes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Pipeline of ortholog group clustering and gene loss detection.

In addition, the orthologs of many members of the Myomorpha were not found, suggesting that gene loss occurred in this lineage.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82290-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We first produced highly complete orthologous groups comprised of nearly complete gene sets. We merged multiple gene annotations of a single species followed by assessments of the completeness of the gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Using these gene sets, we then created two sets of ortholog groups with different methods and merged them into a single set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In searching for gene loss events, we restricted our study to those that occurred in the common ancestors of particular taxonomic groups. This procedure relieved false identifications of gene loss in a species or an ancestor of a lower taxonomic hierarchy caused by incomplete genomic information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><p>We integrated gene annotations from Ensembl, RefSeq, and the sequence repositories of individual genome sequencing projects to produce gene annotations for 114 mammalian and 132 non-mammalian vertebrates. From these, we selected the annotations of 101 and 90 species, respectively, that exhibited high completeness in the BUSCO assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simão et al., 2015</xref>; Supplementary Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Using these gene sets, clustering of ortholog groups was conducted by OrthoFinder, and these groups were integrated into the ortholog groups provided by the Ensembl Gene Tree. This integration resulted in 50,768 vertebrate ortholog groups. Phylogenetic tree inference of the integrated ortholog groups and pruning of the individual trees based on gene duplications resulted in 17,495 mammalian ortholog groups that contained human genes. We classified the mammalian species into 15 taxonomic groups ranging from order to family (listed in Table S1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). For the individual mammalian orthologs, we searched for the taxa in which the gene was absent in all the species examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We interpreted this gene absence as an evolutionary loss that occurred in the common ancestor of the taxon. Validating the gene loss through an ortholog search in genome assemblies and synteny-based ortholog annotations, we extracted the ortholog groups that were retained by humans but were lost independently in the common ancestors of at least two taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Hereafter we call the human genes belonging to these ortholog groups ‘elusive genes.’ To compare these, we also selected the ortholog groups that contained all of the mammals examined including single-copy human genes. We called these ‘non-elusive genes.’ This comprehensive scan of gene phylogenies resulted in 813 elusive and 8050 non-elusive genes (Supplementary Table S2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Genomic signatures of the human elusive genes</title><p>The loss-prone nature of the elusive genes suggests a relaxation of their functional constraints. To uncover the molecular evolutionary characteristics associated with each elusive gene, we computed synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates in coding regions, namely <italic>K</italic><sub>S</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>A</sub>, respectively, between human and chimpanzee and mouse orthologs for the elusive and non-elusive genes.

To investigate possible antiquities of the genomic properties associated with elusive genes, we investigated their orthologs in non-mammalian vertebrates by scrutinizing the ortholog groups used for elusive gene identification. We found that 152 out of 813 elusive genes originated in mammalian lineages, and this proportion was larger than those of the elusive genes (65 out of 8050, p=2.50 × 10<sup>-110</sup>), indicating that the elusive genes are more abundant in recently born genes than non-elusive genes. We then selected 517 elusive and 7900 non-elusive genes that originated in the common ancestors of jawed vertebrates or earlier. These subsets allowed us to examine the degree of retention of non-mammalian vertebrate orthologs in the elusive and non-elusive genes. On average, approximately 40% of these elusive genes were found to be retained by non-mammalian vertebrates, while this proportion increased up to 90% for the non-elusive genes.

However, only 3.00 and 9.00% of the elusive genes with <italic>H</italic>′ &lt; 1 and <italic>H</italic>′ ≥ 1 were located in regions of extremely high GC content (&gt;60%), respectively, showing that the elusive genes <italic>H</italic>′ ≥ 1 rather tend to contain more genes with high GC content (p=0.0176).

These observations indicate that, in an epigenetic manner, the chicken orthologs of the elusive genes are not regulated to reduce their expression level. This idea was further supported by a comparison of the expression profiles between the chicken orthologs of the elusive and non-elusive genes, showing no significant differences between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our analyses indicate that the genomic features of the elusive genes such as high GC and high nucleotide substitutions do not always correlate with a reduction in pleiotropy of gene expression that potentially leads to an increase in functional dispensability in the course of vertebrate evolution. In addition, avian orthologs of the elusive genes did not show higher <italic>K</italic><sub>A</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>S</sub> values than those of the non-elusive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), likely consistent with not significant difference in gene expression levels between them in the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cherry, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhang and Yang, 2015</xref>). We further compared expression profiles between the orthologs of the human elusive and non-elusive genes in several non-mammalian vertebrates and found that the orthologs of the elusive genes tend to exhibit low pleiotropy in green anole, coelacanth, and gar but not in Western clawed frog. The result suggests that the low pleiotropy of the elusive genes has persisted at least since the bony vertebrate ancestors. With respect to the chicken genome, the ‘elusive’ features for the genes orthologous to human elusive genes might have been relaxed—functional importance of the orthologs has increased—during evolution leading to chicken.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we identified elusive genes that were lost in multiple lineages during mammalian evolution using a comprehensive scan of gene phylogenies. To identify gene loss events, absence of evidence (i.e. missing genes caused by incomplete genome assemblies and gene annotations) should be reviewed meticulously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deutekom et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, gene loss might be detected erroneously because of failure in similarity searches for orthologs of rapidly evolving genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moyers and Zhang, 2015</xref>). In this study, we aimed to reduce these false discoveries through our multifaceted approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We selected those species with highly complete gene annotations through integration of multiple gene annotations. Using these improved gene annotations, we created orthologous groups by employing a highly sensitive homology search with MMSeqs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Steinegger and Söding, 2017</xref>) and merged them into those identified in the Ensembl database. Furthermore, we restricted the loss events that were observed as gene absence in all species examined within all hierarchical levels of the selected taxonomic groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). This absence is likely to have occurred as a gene loss in the common ancestor of the particular taxon rather than as a false discovery of gene loss in the individual species independently. Genuine continuous (e.g. telomere-to-telomere) genome assemblies are now available using modern sequencing technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nurk et al., 2022</xref>). These genomic assemblies may help relieve the labor of examining for information losses, thereby facilitating the identification of genuine gene loss in any given species.</p><p>In the human genome, the elusive genes and their flanking regions harbor particular characteristics, including high GC content and high gene density, that may have originated long before the emergence of mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Frequent synonymous variations across modern humans in the elusive genes, consistent with higher synonymous substitution rates between the vertebrate orthologs, suggest that the genomic regions including elusive genes have been subject to rapid evolution for approximately 500 million years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Our findings indicate that heterogeneous genomic characteristics potentially affect the fate of genes at the latest period of vertebrate evolution. Analyses with large numbers of germline mutations in the human genome have illustrated the heterogeneity of mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell and Eichler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seplyarskiy and Sunyaev, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Terekhanova et al., 2017</xref>). High GC content in the elusive genes may have facilitated an elevation of the mutation rate, as observed in the enrichment of rare variants in high-GC regions in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schaibley et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, some of the elusive genes appear to have retained particular epigenetic marks including sparse ATAC-seq peaks, late replication timings, and location within LADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">4</xref>); these epigenetic marks are relevant to an increase in the mutation rate. Genomic regions with late replication timing exhibit increased mutation rates because of their unstable structure during the S-phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Koren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stamatoyannopoulos et al., 2009</xref>). LADs retain more G-to-T mutations because of their susceptibility to oxidative damage in the nuclear periphery resulting in high levels of 8-oxoguanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yoshihara et al., 2014</xref>). Close coordination of the studies on gene evolution with germline mutation repertoires and spectra, which can be approximated from the collection of de novo mutations obtained by trio sequencing, may further facilitate our understanding of gene fates driven by heterogeneous genomic features—this would be viewed as ‘mutation-driven’ evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nei, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The epigenetic marks of elusive genes are relevant to the suppression of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">van Steensel and Belmont, 2017</xref>), and indeed, these genes harbor weakened and spatially restricted expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">4</xref>). However, the genomic features associated with these epigenetic marks usually exhibit lower GC contents and reduced gene density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilbert et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">van Steensel and Belmont, 2017</xref>). This discrepancy may be caused in part by a gain of local heterochromatin accompanied by suppression of the expression of transposable elements, as observed in various eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choi and Lee, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiston-Lavier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grewal and Jia, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rangasamy, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Underwood et al., 2017</xref>). Previous analyses showed frequent heterochromatinization of the human genomic regions where KRAB zinc finger genes colocalize with L1 retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Imbeault et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">O’Geen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vogel et al., 2006</xref>). One of the genomic regions found in human chromosome region 19p12 also contains many elusive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vogel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Closer attention to the local gene and repeat contents including repetitive elements and tandem gene clusters might facilitate our understanding of heterochromatinization in restricted genomic regions, although we excluded such gene clusters in our search for elusive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><p>A chromosomal-scale view of the distribution of elusive genes illuminated their significant correlation with the genes whose chicken orthologs are located on microchromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). More importantly, genomic regions rich in elusive genes were traced back to the microchromosomes of the ancestral gnathostomes by reconstructing chromosomes of the ancestral genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). This inference of ancestral karyotypes augments our observations that some elusive natures of genomic sequences have been retained for hundreds of millions of years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In other words, the result suggests that the disparity of genomic regions that allows the ‘elusiveness’ for the genes has been retained during vertebrate evolution. On the other hand, comparisons of the expression profiles between the orthologs of the elusive and non-elusive genes for non-mammalian vertebrates suggest that the orthologs of the elusive genes have been associated with a reduction in pleiotropy of gene expression since vertebrate ancestors but acquired the diverse expressions in chicken and frog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, in the chicken genome, the diverse expressions of the chicken orthologs of the human elusive genes may be correlated with the abundance of ATAC-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). These findings again suggest that the chicken orthologs of the human elusive genes have increased pleiotropy of gene expression, which may lead to a lineage-specific acquisition of functional indispensability. It should be noted that the choices of tissues used in these analyses were largely different between the human and non-mammalian vertebrates (Tables S3 and S4; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b and c</xref>). The chicken ATAC-seq data could be obtained only from developing embryos, while the human ATAC-seq in ENCODE were performed with cell lines. Therefore, the aforementioned interpretation should be treated carefully.</p><p>Finally, we note the potential evolutionary courses that facilitate the transition of gene fate from retention to loss. One possible course is a decrease in essential functions because of rapid sequence evolution in local genomic regions. The elusive genes located in those genomic regions with rapidly evolving characteristics are likely to accumulate neutral or even moderately harmful mutations in coding regions frequently, resulting in impaired essential functions. Another factor is the spatiotemporal suppression of gene expression via epigenetic constraints. Previous studies showed that lowly expressed genes are associated with low functional essentiality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cherry, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gout et al., 2010</xref>), as shown for elusive genes in our study. Elusive genes with reduced pleiotropy may have limited opportunities to function, potentially leading to loss of their important roles. The extent of these evolutionary forces may have varied with time and lineages, resulting in a patchy loss of elusive genes phylogenetically. Interestingly, a recent large-scale scan of de novo mutations in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> indicates the association of mutation rates with epigenetic features and functional essentiality of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Monroe et al., 2022</xref>). Further investigation of the association of genes with the surrounding genomic regions in various taxa may provide a common understanding of genomic and epigenomic features that potentially alter the fate of genes. Although epigenetic features are plastic, our findings indicate that the disparities of genomic regions are reflected in the heterogeneity of evolutionary forces and have been retained for hundreds of millions of years. This idea prompts us to explore evolutionary constraints on more global genomic regions that are potentially associated with structural characteristics including chromosomal composition and locations within the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sequence retrieval</title><p>We retrieved genome assemblies and gene annotations of 114 mammals and 132 non-mammal vertebrates from RefSeq (accessed on April 9, 2018), Ensembl release 92, and the repositories of the individual genome projects (Supplementary Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Gene annotations for a single species from multiple repositories were integrated into one as follows. When gene annotations of multiple repositories were referring to the same version of the genome assembly, the annotation GTF files were merged with the ‘cuffcompare’ tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Trapnell et al., 2012</xref>). Otherwise, translated amino acid sequences were clustered by CD-HIT v. 4.6.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2012</xref>) with 100% sequence similarity, and the representative sequence for each cluster was retrieved by assuming that each cluster represented a single locus. Subsequently, we selected the canonical amino acid sequence for each locus: canonical peptides of the Ensembl genes were retrieved from the Ensembl database; for other resources, the longest amino acid sequence from the isoforms of a locus was chosen. The completeness of the gene annotations was performed on the gVolante web server with assessments by BUSCO v.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simão et al., 2015</xref>) by referring to the vertebrate ortholog sets provided by BUSCO and CVG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hara et al., 2015</xref>).

This sequence set, restricted to Ensembl sequences only, was used as the ‘backbone’ of the ortholog set of all the selected species. In addition, we generated ortholog groups for all the species used by employing OrthoFinder2 v. 2.3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Emms and Kelly, 2019</xref>) based on the similarity of amino acid sequences: a sequence similarity search was performed using MMSeqs2 v. 2339462c06eab0bee64e4fc0ebebf7707f6e53fd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Steinegger and Söding, 2017</xref>).

This function inferred gene duplication nodes in the rooted trees, resulting in separation of the trees into 17,495 subtrees of mammalian ortholog groups containing human genes.

This absence was further assessed by the ortholog annotation of human genes in the Ensembl Gene Tree database.</p><p>We selected taxonomic groups for the individual mammalian ortholog groups in which the orthologs were missing in all the species examined (Table S1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). We restricted our study to gene losses that were likely to have occurred in the common ancestor of particular taxonomic groups, rather than those arising from the incompleteness of gene annotations. When a gene was missing in all the taxonomic groups in the same hierarchy, we considered that the gene was lost in the common ancestor of these groups. Finally, we found 1233 human genes belonging to the ortholog groups that were absent in two or more taxonomic groups and defined them as elusive genes. The gene loss events inferred by molecular phylogeny were further assessed by synteny-based ortholog annotations implemented in RefSeq, as well as a homolog search in the genome assemblies (Table S1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>) with TBLASTN v2.11.0+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>) and MMSeqs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Steinegger and Söding, 2017</xref>) referring to the latest RefSeq gene annotations (last accessed on December 2, 2022). This procedure resulted in the identification of 813 elusive genes that harbored three or fewer duplicates. Similarly, we extracted 8050 human genes whose orthologs were found in all the mammalian species examined and defined them as non-elusive genes.

Define the red and orange crosses in the legend.</p><p>Figure 7 appeared first in the Discussion section. Can this part be moved to the Results section?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, I believe that this is an interesting study. However, this version of the manuscript could be significantly improved in terms of logical depth and methodological stringency.</p><p>1. Authors actually support the concept of mutation-driven evolution, i.e., the high mutation rate in genomic regions harboring the elusive genes would predispose their fate toward death. To increase the significance of their work, I suggest authors cite (Nei 2013; Xie et al. 2019) and put their work in a bigger context.</p><p>2. Authors mentioned that elusive genes are less important and thus more prone to loss. In my view, pleiotropy is a better term compared to importance. That is, elusive genes are less pleiotropic [e.g. narrowly expressed, Figure 5] and thus their loss are more tolerable or easily compensated by other genes. Actually, narrow expression breadth has been observed to be correlated with gene loss in both humans and flies (MacArthur et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2015).</p><p>3. I am generally convinced that authors reliably identified elusive genes by identifying gene loss events in the common ancestor of multiple descendant species (to control for errors induced by assembly or annotation, Figure 1). However, Figure 7 shows the enrichment of elusive genes in human chr19. This chromosome is well known to be enriched with tandemly duplicated Krueppel-associated box C2H2 zinc-finger protein family (KZNF), many of which are primate-specific (Shao et al. 2019). I suspect that tree-based strategy implemented in Figure 1 could not be able to dissect the evolution of this super complex gene family. I am proposing two specific analyses: how many elusive genes encoded by chr19 are KZNFs? how many of them have Ensembl one-to-one orthologs across mammals?</p><p>4. With the patterns in Figure 3 and 7, authors argued that features of elusive genes are deeply ancient and could be inherited from the microchromosomes of early vertebrates. This statement has multiple problems.</p><p>a) Figure 3 only show genomic level features (e.g., high GC content) conserved in multiple vertebrates including shark and chicken. Epigenetic features analyzed in Figure 5 to 6 were only based on human data. I suggest authors to extend these analyses to shark or chicken. Although some epigenetic data could not be available for these species, transcriptome data analyzed in Figure 5 should be available for at least some species.</p><p>b) In Figure 7, authors propose the concept related with microchromosomes. These chromosomes have been extensively studied, especially in birds. Some features of microchromosomes are consistent with that of elusive genes [e.g., high GC, (Bravo et al. 2021)]. However, microchromosomes are conserved in terms of gene order and their genes generally show high protein-level constraints as shown by low Ka/Ks (Waters et al. 2021; Li et al. 2022). Authors need to reconcile their discovery with the previous rich literature.</p><p>c) Line (L) 204, among 982 human elusive genes, only 540~390 are shared by other species (e.g., shark). I suggest taking advantage of genome-level synteny based age data generated in Shao et al. 2019 to examine the age distribution of human elusive genes. If a high proportion of them are dated as being old (e.g., shared by jawed vertebrates), the statement that these genes have an ancient origin could be better supported.</p><p>References</p><p>Bravo GA, Schmitt CJ, Edwards SV. 2021.

Please consider it during revision.</p><p>&quot;The authors attempt to argue that the elusive status is ancient (&quot;Thus, the heterogeneous genomic features driving gene fates toward loss have been in place since the ancestral vertebrates&quot;). However, in response to my previous suggestion regarding chicken microchromosomes, the authors present mixed results. They observed high GC content, high gene density, and short gene length in chicken, similar to the findings in humans (Figure 3). Yet, the critical functional data between the two species are conflicting: human elusive genes exhibit low expression and fewer ATAC-seq peaks, while their chicken counterparts display the opposite pattern. In other words, chicken elusive genes exhibit higher pleiotropy, which may decrease the likelihood of their loss. Thus, these genes are not elusive, and high GC content, high gene density, and short gene length do not necessarily predict elusiveness. Given that the authors only analyzed the functional data of human and chicken genomes, it is not possible to determine whether the &quot;elusive&quot; status is ancient or derived from the human or mammalian lineage. I suggest that the authors analyze the transcriptome data in shark or spotted gar to provide further phylogenetic context. Otherwise, the authors should significantly tone down their statement.&quot;</p><p>The reviewing editor also has some comments on the title and abstract.</p><p>1. Please consider revising the title to &quot;The Impact of Local Genomic Properties on the Evolutionary Fate of Genes Across Vertebrates&quot;.</p><p>2. Please consider adding a sentence (or something similar) at the end of the abstract. &quot;This study sheds light on the complex interplay between gene function and local genomic properties in shaping gene evolution across vertebrate lineages.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82290.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The identification of &quot;elusive genes&quot; in the current manuscript requires additional scrutinization, given it is the foundation of the whole study.

The validation of gene loss has employed the ortholog annotations implemented in the RefSeq gene prediction pipeline, a synteny-based ortholog clustering platform other than TOGA, as well as similarity sequence search by MMSeqs2 that performs superior to NCBI BLAST.</p><p>For the revised manuscript, we have refined the elusive gene set as the reviewer suggested. In the genome assemblies, we have searched for the orthologs of the elusive genes for the species in which they were missing. The search has been conducted by querying amino acid sequences of the elusive genes with tblastn as well as MMSeqs2 that performed superior to tblastn in sensitivity and computational speed. In addition, regarding a comment by Reviewer 3 we have searched for the orthologs by referring to existing ortholog annotations. We used the ortholog annotations implemented in RefSeq instead of those from the TOGA pipeline: both employ synteny conservation. We have coordinated the identified orthologs with our gene loss criteria–absence from all the species used in a particular taxon–and excluded 268 genes from the original elusive gene set. These genes contain those missing in the previous gene annotations used in the original manuscript but present in the latest ones, as well as those falsely missing due to incorrect inference of gene trees. Finally, the refined set of 813 elusive genes were subject to comparisons with the non-elusive genes. Importantly, these comparisons retained the significantly different trends of the particular genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic features between them except for very few cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref>). This indicates that both initial and revised sets of the elusive genes reflect the nature of the ‘elusiveness,’ though the initial set contained some noises. We have modified the numbers of elusive genes in the corresponding parts of the manuscript including figures and tables. Additionally, we have added the validation procedures in Methods.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Difference in statistical significances across different elusive gene sets.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Features</th><th valign="bottom">Non-significant in theinitial gene set(1,081 elusive genes)</th><th valign="bottom">Non-significant in thecurrent gene set(<bold>813</bold>)</th><th valign="bottom">Non-significant in the current gene setexcluding chr19(669)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene density in the turkey genome</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">✓</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">✓</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">✓</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene density in the green anole genome</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">✓</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene density in the bamboo shark genome</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">✓</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene density in the whale shark genome</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">✓</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">✓</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">✓</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>K</italic><sub>S</sub> in avians</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">✓</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">✓</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>K</italic><sub>A</sub> in avians</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">✓</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">✓</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">✓</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>K</italic><sub>A</sub> in sharks</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">✓</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">✓</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">✓</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATAC-seq peak density for GM23338</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">✓</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lamin B1 ChIP-seq peak density for K562</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">✓</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>The other features showed significantly different trends between the elusive and non-elusive genes for all of the elusive gene sets and thus are not included in this table.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>cd-hit clustering with 100% sequence identity only clusters those with identical (and sometimes truncated) sequences, and, in the cluster, the sequences other than the representative are discarded.

We totally agree that transcriptomic and epigenomic features cannot be easily distinguished from gene dispensability and do not think that these features of the elusive genes can be explained solely by intrinsic properties of the genomes. Our motivation for investigating the expression profiles of the elusive gene is to understand how they lost their functional indispensability (original manuscript L285-286 in Results). We also discussed the possibility that sequence composition and genomic location of elusive genes may be associated with epigenetic features for expression depression, which may result in a decrease of functional constraints (original manuscript L470-474 in Discussion). Nevertheless, we think that the original manuscript may have contained misleading wordings, and thus we have edited them to better convey our view that gene expression and epigenomic features are related to gene function.</p><p>(P.2, Introduction) “This evolutionary fate of a gene can also be affected by factors independent of gene dispensability, including the mutability of genomic positions, but such features have not been examined well.”</p><p>(P6, Introduction) “These data assisted us to understand how intrinsic genomic features may affect gene fate, leading to gene loss by decreasing the expression level and eventually relaxing the functional importance of ʻelusiveʼ genes.”</p><p>(P33, Discussion) “Another factor is the spatiotemporal suppression of gene expression via epigenetic constraints. Previous studies showed that lowly expressed genes reduce their functional dispensability (Cherry, 2010; Gout et al., 2010), and so do the elusive genes.”</p><p>Additionally, responding to the advices from Reviewers 1 and 2, we have added a new section Elusive gene orthologs in the chicken microchromosomes in which we describe the relationship between the elusive genes and chicken microchromosomes. In this section, we also argue for the relationship between the genomic feature of the elusive genes and their transcriptomic and epigenomic characteristics. In the chicken genome, elusive genes did not show reduced pleiotropy of gene expression nor the epigenetic features relevant with the reduction, consistently with the moderation of nucleotide substitution rates. This also suggests that the relaxation of the ‘elusiveness’ is associated with the increase of functional indispensability.</p><p>(P27, Elusive gene orthologs in the chicken microchromosomes in Results) “Our analyses indicates that the genomic features of the elusive genes such as high GC and high nucleotide substitutions do not always correlate with a reduction in pleiotropy of gene expression that potentially leads to an increase in functional dispensability, although these features have been well conserved across vertebrates. In addition, the avian orthologs of the elusive genes did not show higher <italic>K</italic><sub>A</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>S</sub> values than those of the non-elusive genes (Figure 3; Figure 3—figure supplement 1), likely consistent with similar expression levels between them (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) (Cherry, 2010; Zhang and Yang, 2015). With respect to the chicken genome, the sequence features of the elusive genes themselves might have been relaxed during evolution.”</p><p>Also, please refer to [Rev1- point2] for the mutability of the elusive genes. To examine this point, we have computed nucleotide sequence differences in introns, namely <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub>, between the human and chimpanzee genomes. This analysis revealed higher <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> values in the elusive genes than in the non-elusive genes, which is in line with our original hypothesis.

Authors actually support the concept of mutation-driven evolution, i.e., the high mutation rate in genomic regions harboring the elusive genes would predispose their fate toward death. To increase the significance of their work, I suggest authors cite (Nei 2013; Xie et al. 2019) and put their work in a bigger context.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for considering a way to enhance the significance of our study.

Authors mentioned that elusive genes are less important and thus more prone to loss. In my view, pleiotropy is a better term compared to importance. That is, elusive genes are less pleiotropic [e.g. narrowly expressed, Figure 5] and thus their loss are more tolerable or easily compensated by other genes. Actually, narrow expression breadth has been observed to be correlated with gene loss in both humans and flies (MacArthur et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2015).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful suggestion.

I am generally convinced that authors reliably identified elusive genes by identifying gene loss events in the common ancestor of multiple descendant species (to control for errors induced by assembly or annotation, Figure 1). However, Figure 7 shows the enrichment of elusive genes in human chr19. This chromosome is well known to be enriched with tandemly duplicated Krueppel-associated box C2H2 zinc-finger protein family (KZNF), many of which are primate-specific (Shao et al. 2019). I suspect that tree-based strategy implemented in Figure 1 could not be able to dissect the evolution of this super complex gene family. I am proposing two specific analyses: how many elusive genes encoded by chr19 are KZNFs? how many of them have Ensembl one-to-one orthologs across mammals?</p></disp-quote><p>Responding to this comment, we investigated the KZNF genes on chromosome 19. We identified 206 those genes in chromosome 19, of which 75 were found to be elusive. Of these, 30 genes retained one-to-one orthologs of the mouse or dog. Although we excluded the nearly identical paralogs in our pipeline in the original manuscript and have refined the elusive gene set with synteny-based ortholog annotation in the current manuscript, the elusive KZNF genes have remained in this refined gene set. The elusive KZNF genes on chromosome 19 were lost in some mammalian lineages and duplicated in early primates.</p><p>Motivated by this comment, we conceived a possibility whether the enrichment of the paralogs of the elusive genes on chromosome 19 overrepresents the features relevant to the ‘elusiveness’. We thus have created another set of elusive genes, those excluding the genes on chromosome 19, and performed comparisons on the genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic features of the elusive and non-elusive genes. The results showed that the significant/non-significant differences have been maintained except for a few cases (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref>), indicating that the characteristics remained unchanged even when chromosome 19 is excluded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. With the patterns in Figure 3 and 7, authors argued that features of elusive genes are deeply ancient and could be inherited from the microchromosomes of early vertebrates. This statement has multiple problems.</p><p>a) Figure 3 only show genomic level features (e.g., high GC content) conserved in multiple vertebrates including shark and chicken. Epigenetic features analyzed in Figure 5 to 6 were only based on human data. I suggest authors to extend these analyses to shark or chicken. Although some epigenetic data could not be available for these species, transcriptome data analyzed in Figure 5 should be available for at least some species.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this reviewer’s comment, we have investigated the transcriptomic and epigenetic characteristics of the orthologs of the elusive genes in non-mammalian vertebrates as we had done for human in the original manuscript. We have retrieved gene expression profiles of normal tissues and early embryos from bulk RNA-seq data of chicken, tropical clawed frog, coelacanth, and spotted gar, respectively, from the Bgee database (https://bgee.org/). We have then compared expression profiles between the orthologs of the elusive and non-elusive genes for the individual species using the same procedure as those in the manuscript. Only the anole, coelacanth, and gar orthologs of the elusive genes show the enrichment of low <italic>H’</italic> values (newly created figure in Figure 5—figure supplement 1). This indicates that the low pleiotropy of expression of the elusive genes is not always observed in the non-mammalian species.</p><p>Furthermore, we have compared epigenomic properties between the orthologs of the elusive and non-elusive genes in the chicken genome. We have retrieved ATAC-seq narrow peak data for tissues of chicken embryos from NCBI GEO and compared the density of ATAC peaks between the orthologs of the elusive and non-elusive genes. The result indicates that, in five samples out of the eight, the orthologs of the elusive genes retained more ATAC peaks than those of the non-elusive genes, and that the reminders did not show this difference (newly created figure in Figure 6—figure supplement 5). This observation may remind us of a link between the reduction of the ‘elusiveness’ and the decrease of functional dispensability in gene evolution. However, it should be interpreted carefully, as different sets of tissues were used for the transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses between human and chicken. As described above, the chicken ATAC-seq experiments were mainly performed with developing embryos, while the human ATAC-seq used in our study were performed with cell lines. Nevertheless, the cross-species comparison of the epigenetic features suggests that the sequence features relevant to the elusive genes do not always induce the epigenetic conditions for gene expression depletion.</p><p>We have newly created Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Figure 6—figure supplement 5 as shown below, described the results in the newly created section Elusive gene orthologs in the chicken microchromosomes in Results, and discussed them in Discussion. Also, we described the procedures in Methods.</p><p>(P-26-27, Elusive gene orthologs in the chicken microchromosomes in Results)</p><p>“Elusive gene orthologs in the chicken microchromosomes</p><p>The heterogeneous locations of the elusive genes can also be examined from a chromosome-scale viewpoint (Figure 7; Figure 7—figure supplement 1). The visualization via chromosome ideograms indicated an overlap of the elusive genes with the genomic regions enriched for the genes whose chicken orthologs are on the microchromosomes (chromosomes 11-38 and W), providing a statistical support for this trend (<italic>p</italic>=0.0175; Figure 7a). Indeed, microchromosomes of the chicken and other vertebrate exhibit genomic features including high GC-content, high gene density, and rapid nucleotide substitutions in comparison with their macrochromosomes (Groenen et al., 2009; International Chicken Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2004; Schield et al., 2019; Waters et al., 2021), which also characterize genomic regions containing elusive genes. On the contrary, previous studies revealed that the chicken microchromosomes are preferentially located in the A compartments of the nucleus (Perry et al., 2020) and are early replicating (McQueen et al., 1998). These characteristics associated with the microchromosomes were opposite characteristics to the human genomic regions preferentially containing the elusive genes.</p><p>We further analyzed the ATAC-seq peaks in the chicken genome and found more peaks in the genomic regions including the elusive gene orthologs than in those containing non-elusive gene orthologs in four samples out of eight and no significant differences in the peak density in the four remaining samples (Figure 6; Figure 6—figure supplement 5). These observations indicate that, in an epigenetic manner, the chicken orthologs of the elusive genes are not regulated to reduce their expression level. This idea was further supported by a comparison of the expression profiles between the chicken orthologs of the elusive and non-elusive genes, showing no significant differences between them (Figure 5; Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Our analyses indicate that the genomic features of the elusive genes such as high GC and high nucleotide substitutions do not always correlate with a reduction in pleiotropy of gene expression that potentially leads to an increase in functional dispensability in the course of vertebrate evolution. In addition, avian orthologs of the elusive genes did not show higher <italic>K</italic><sub>A</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>S</sub> values than those of the non-elusive genes (Figure 3; Figure 3—figure supplement 1), likely consistent with not significant difference in gene expression levels between them in the species (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) (Cherry, 2010; Zhang and Yang, 2015). With respect to the chicken genome, the sequence features of the elusive genes might have been relaxed during evolution.”</p><p>(P32-33, Discussion) “A chromosomal-scale view of the distribution of elusive genes illuminated their significant correlation with the genes whose chicken orthologs are located on microchromosomes (Figure 7a). More importantly, genomic regions rich in elusive genes were traced back to the microchromosomes of the ancestral gnathostomes by reconstructing chromosomes of the ancestral genomes (Figure 7b). This inference of ancestral karyotypes augments our observations that some elusive natures of genomic sequences have been retained for hundreds of millions of years (Figure 3). In other words, the result suggests that the disparity of genomic regions which allows the ‘elusiveness’ for the genes has been retained during vertebrate evolution. On the other hand, comparisons of the expression profiles between the orthologs of the elusive and non-elusive genes for non-mammalian vertebrates indicate that the elusive genes are not always associated with the restricted expression profiles (Figure 5; Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Additionally, in the chicken genome, this trend in gene expression may be correlated with the abundance of ATAC-seq peaks in the elusive genes (Figure 6—figure supplement 5). These findings again suggest that the elusive genes are not always associated with a reduction in pleiotropy of gene expression, which may lead to an increase of functional dispensability during evolution. It should be noted that the choices of tissues used in these analyses were largely different between the human and non-mammalian vertebrates (Tables S3, S4). The chicken ATAC-seq data could be obtained only from developing embryos, while the human ATAC-seq in ENCODE were performed with cell lines. Therefore, the aforementioned interpretation should be treated carefully.”</p><p>(P40, Methods) “We also compared expression profiles and ATAC-seq peak densities between the orthologs of the elusive and non-elusive genes in nonmammalian vertebrates in a similar way as we did with the human datasets.</p><p>Normalized gene expression profiles from RNA-seq data of normal adult tissues and early embryos for chicken, green anole, Western clawed frog, coelacanth, and spotted gar were obtained from the Bgee version 15 database (Bastian et al., 2021) (Table S4). ATAC-seq narrow peak signals of chicken tissues were retrieved from NCBI GEO (Table S4) followed by coordination of the genome assembly with galGal5 with the UCSC liftOver tool (Hinrichs et al., 2006) as needed.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In Figure 7, authors propose the concept related with microchromosomes. These chromosomes have been extensively studied, especially in birds. Some features of microchromosomes are consistent with that of elusive genes [e.g., high GC, (Bravo et al. 2021)]. However, microchromosomes are conserved in terms of gene order and their genes generally show high protein-level constraints as shown by low Ka/Ks (Waters et al. 2021; Li et al. 2022).

Instead, we have used the ortholog groups of jawed vertebrates built in this study and further added older branching dates of their orthologs and paralogs from the Ensembl Gene Tree.

Please consider it during revision.</p><p>&quot;The authors attempt to argue that the elusive status is ancient (&quot;Thus, the heterogeneous genomic features driving gene fates toward loss have been in place since the ancestral vertebrates&quot;). However, in response to my previous suggestion regarding chicken microchromosomes, the authors present mixed results. They observed high GC content, high gene density, and short gene length in chicken, similar to the findings in humans (Figure 3). Yet, the critical functional data between the two species are conflicting: human elusive genes exhibit low expression and fewer ATAC-seq peaks, while their chicken counterparts display the opposite pattern. In other words, chicken elusive genes exhibit higher pleiotropy, which may decrease the likelihood of their loss. Thus, these genes are not elusive, and high GC content, high gene density, and short gene length do not necessarily predict elusiveness. Given that the authors only analyzed the functional data of human and chicken genomes, it is not possible to determine whether the &quot;elusive&quot; status is ancient or derived from the human or mammalian lineage. I suggest that the authors analyze the transcriptome data in shark or spotted gar to provide further phylogenetic context. Otherwise, the authors should significantly tone down their statement.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware of your concern about the inconsistency of the results between human and chicken, and therefore already included comparisons of the gene expression profiles between the orthologs of the elusive and non-elusive genes with several non-mammalian vertebrates in the previous revision (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).

We would like to use the title that you suggested without the last two words (‘The Impact of Local Genomic Properties on the Evolutionary Fate of Genes’). This title is more likely to increase the accessibility of our paper to a broad readership beyond those who are primarily investigating vertebrates, potentially prompting them to investigate genomic properties associated with the fate of genes in diverse organisms such as invertebrates, fungi, and plants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

This study sheds light on the complex interplay between gene function and local genomic properties in shaping gene evolution that has persisted since the vertebrate ancestor.</p></body></sub-article></article>
