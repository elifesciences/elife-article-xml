disorder. Loss of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of <italic>PLA2G6</italic>, leads to ceramide accumulation, lysosome expansion, and mitochondrial defects. Here, we report that retromer function, ceramide metabolism, the endolysosomal pathway, and mitochondrial morphology are affected in INAD patient-derived neurons. We show that in INAD mouse models, the same features are affected in Purkinje cells, arguing that the neuropathological mechanisms are evolutionary conserved and that these features can be used as biomarkers. We tested 20 drugs that target these pathways and found that Ambroxol, Desipramine, Azoramide, and Genistein alleviate neurodegenerative phenotypes in INAD flies and INAD patient-derived neural progenitor cells. We also develop an AAV-based gene therapy approach that delays neurodegeneration and prolongs lifespan in an INAD mouse model.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>INAD</kwd><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>gene therapy</kwd><kwd>ceramides</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd><kwd>drug screen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Drosophila</kwd><kwd>IPSC</kwd><kwd>Neural progenitor cells</kwd><kwd>Dopaminergic neurons</kwd><kwd>Mice</kwd><kwd>Adeno-associated virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007915</institution-id><institution>Baylor College of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50HD103555</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bellen</surname><given-names>Hugo J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017236</institution-id><institution>Huffington Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bellen</surname><given-names>Hugo J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shan and Lee-Jun Wong Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Guang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>INADcure Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Guang</given-names></name><name><surname>Bellen</surname><given-names>Hugo J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute- Chair in Neurogenetics</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bellen</surname><given-names>Hugo J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Endolysosmal trafficking defects, expansion of lysosomes, elevation of ceramides, and disruption of mitochondria are root causes of INAD/PARK14.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) (OMIM #256600) is a devastating and lethal pediatric neurodegenerative disorder caused by recessive variants in <italic>PLA2G6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khateeb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morgan et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, variants in <italic>PLA2G6</italic> also cause atypical NAD (aNAD) (OMIM # 610217) and <italic>PLA2G6</italic>-related dystonia-parkinsonism, also called Parkinson disease 14 (PARK14) (OMIM #612953) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paisan-Ruiz et al., 2009</xref>). Collectively, these three diseases are called <italic>PLA2G6</italic>-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurian et al., 2008</xref>). Iron accumulation has been observed in the basal ganglia of some INAD and aNAD as well as PARK14 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferese et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yoshino et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, these diseases are also categorized as neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation 2 (NBIA2) (OMIM #610217) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gregory et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morgan et al., 2006</xref>). The symptoms of INAD include early onset ataxia (age 1–3 years), mental and motor deterioration, hypotonia, progressive spastic tetraparesis, visual impairments, bulbar dysfunction, and extrapyramidal signs. INAD patients usually die before their 10th birthday. In contrast to the severe defects in INAD, aNAD, and PARK14 patients have a later onset of symptoms, including progressive dystonia and parkinsonism. Cerebellar atrophy is a characteristic symptom in both INAD and aNAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gregory et al., 2008</xref>). The formation of spheroid structures in the nervous system is a typical neuropathological hallmark of PLAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hedley-Whyte et al., 1968</xref>). These spheroid structures contain numerous membranes as well as α-synuclein and ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riku et al., 2013</xref>) and are named tubulovesicular structures (TVSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sumi-Akamaru et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, Lewy bodies and phosphorylated tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles have also been observed in the nervous system of the PLAN patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paisán-Ruiz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riku et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Mice that lack <italic>Pla2g6</italic> (genotype: <italic>Pla2g6<sup>KO/KO</sup></italic>) exhibit a normal lifespan but show a slowly progressive motor defect, first observed at around 1 year of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shinzawa et al., 2008</xref>). These mice show some phenotypes observed in INAD patients, including a progressive axonal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shinzawa et al., 2008</xref>), cerebellar atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>), and the presence of TVS and α-synuclein-containing spheroids in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shinzawa et al., 2008</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed a swelling of the presynaptic membrane, synaptic degeneration, and mitochondrial inner membrane defects in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beck et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Another mouse model of INAD that harbors a spontaneous G373R missense mutation in <italic>Pla2g6</italic> (genotype: <italic>Pla2g6<sup>G373R/G373R</sup></italic>) was also identified. Homozygous <italic>Pla2g6<sup>G373R/G373R</sup></italic> mice express Pla2g6-G373R protein at a comparable level to wild-type littermates. The inheritance of this mutation is recessive and <italic>Pla2g6<sup>G373R/G373R</sup></italic> was proposed to be a severe loss of function allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wada et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, these homozygous <italic>Pla2g6<sup>G373R/G373R</sup></italic> mice only live for about 100 days and show severe behavioral and neuropathological phenotypes at a much earlier age than the mice that lack <italic>Pla2g6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wada et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, no iron accumulation has been documented in the brain of both INAD mouse models.</p><p>We previously found that flies that lack <italic>iPLA2-VIA</italic> (the fly homolog of <italic>PLA2G6</italic>), abbreviated INAD flies, display slow progressive neurodegeneration, including severe bang-sensitivity, motor impairments as well as defects in vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). TEM revealed that INAD flies exhibit swelling of synaptic terminals, the presence of TVSs, the disruption of the mitochondrial inner membranes, and an obvious accumulation of lysosomes. The expression of human <italic>PLA2G6</italic> cDNA fully rescues these defects in flies. These data not only show functional conservation of <italic>PLA2G6</italic> throughout evolution but also suggest that introducing human <italic>PLA2G6</italic> into INAD mice or INAD/PARK14 patients may alleviate the progression of the disease.</p><p>We previously discovered that iPLA2-VIA binds to the retromer subunits, Vps26 and Vps35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). Loss of <italic>iPLA2-VIA</italic> reduces the level of Vps26 and Vps35, and impairs retromer function . This leads to an increase in trafficking to the lysosomes followed by an expansion of lysosomes in size and number. This in turn causes an elevation of ceramide levels, increasing membrane stiffness which may further impair retromer function, leading to a negative feed-forward amplification of the defects. Pharmacological or genetic manipulations that either reduce ceramide levels or activate the retromer robustly suppress the loss of <italic>iPLA2-VIA</italic>-associated neurodegenerative phenotypes in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). Based on our previous findings, we proposed that impaired retromer-endolysosomal results in an increase in ceramide, which is toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, an enzymatic dead iPLA2-VIA can fully rescue the loss of <italic>iPLA2-VIA</italic>-associated defects highlighting the important role of iPLA2-VIA in regulating the endolysosomal pathway via its interaction with the retromer proteins.</p><p>The previous data raise several questions. Are the defective pathways we observed in flies similarly affected in INAD patient-derived cells as well as INAD mouse models? Can drugs that target ceramide metabolism and the endolysosomal pathway alleviate neurodegenerative phenotypes in INAD models? Finally, can the introduction of human <italic>PLA2G6</italic> cDNA rescue neurodegenerative phenotypes in INAD patient-derived cells and INAD mouse models? Here, we report a reduction of Vps35 and an elevation of ceramides and impaired endolysosomal trafficking and mitochondrial morphology in INAD patient-derived cells as well as in the INAD mice, suggesting that these pathways are affected in the three species tested so far. We also assess 20 drugs in INAD flies and patient-derived cells and identify 4 drugs that improve lysosomal function and reduce elevated ceramides and suppress neurodegenerative phenotypes suggesting a causal relationship. Finally, we report the development of a gene therapy approach that alleviates neurodegenerative phenotypes and prolongs lifespan in the INAD mice providing potential therapeutic strategies to treat INAD and PARK14.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>PLA2G6</italic> is highly expressed in human iPSCs and NPCs, but not in skin fibroblasts</title><p>INAD patient-derived skin fibroblasts have been used in several studies to explore the molecular mechanisms of INAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davids et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kinghorn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Villalón-García et al., 2022</xref>).

To assess the phenotypes associated with the patient-derived skin fibroblasts, we determined the levels of LAMP2, a lysosomal marker, as well as the morphology of mitochondria. The patient-derived skin fibroblasts (88101) from Family 1 show an elevation of LAMP2 levels and a disrupted mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>).

Hence, the phenotypes are inconsistent in patient-derived skin fibroblasts. In summary, skin fibroblasts express no or very low levels of PLA2G6 and exhibit highly variable phenotypes making it difficult to interpret data derived from skin fibroblasts. We, therefore, opted to use iPSCs and neurons derived from these cells to characterize phenotypes associated with INAD.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ceramide accumulation, lysosomal expansion, and mitochondrial defects in INAD patient-derived NPCs and DA neurons</title><p>To assess the phenotypes associated with INAD patient-derived cells, we reprogramed lymphoblasts from a patient in Family 2 (<italic>PLA2G6-R70X</italic>) into iPSCs. We obtained two clones, 29-1 and 29-3. As mentioned above, 29-3 was used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> to determine the expression of PLA2G6. To generate a control for the INAD patient-derived iPSCs, we used CRISPR technology to correct the variant in patient-derived iPSCs (29-1) to generate 29-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Hence, 29-1 and 29-2 are an isogenic pair of INAD patient-derived iPSCs. Patient and isogenic gene-corrected control lines were differentiated into ventral midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Each line uniformly expressed the positional transcription factor signature markers for ventral midbrain floor plate region neural progenitor cells (NPC) (OTX2+, LMX1A+, FOXA2+, NESTIN+, and are negative for the forebrain marker FOXG1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nolbrant et al., 2017</xref>). Upon further differentiation, these NPCs gave rise to a robust population of ventral midbrain DA neurons (TH<sup>+</sup>) with typical neuronal morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). We then used the isogenic pair (29-1 and 29-2) of INAD patient-derived ventral midbrain NPCs as well as DA neurons differentiated from these NPCs in subsequent experiments.</p><p>Given that variants in <italic>PLA2G6</italic> also cause parkinsonism, we explored if there are defects associated with INAD patient-derived DA neurons. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>, we did not observe obvious overall cell morphological changes in INAD patient-derived (29-1 and 29-3) and genetically corrected DA neurons (29-2). We measured the levels of Glucosylceramide (GlcCer), and examined the morphology of lysosomes (LAMP2) and mitochondria (ATP5a). GlcCer is easily observed in both control- and patient-derived DA neurons (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C; a-c</xref>) but not in the undifferentiated NPCs (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C; a-c</xref>). This suggests that DA neurons, but not NPCs generate high levels of GlcCer. However, the GlcCer levels are two to three fold higher in INAD patient-derived DA neurons (29-1 and 29-3) than in corrected cells (29-2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C; a-c</xref>). Furthermore, lysosomes are increased in number and enlarged in size in cells that carry the variant compared to corrected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C; d-f</xref>). Finally, we also observed enlarged mitochondria in the INAD patient-derived DA neurons (29-1 and 29-3) when compared to corrected cells (29-2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C; g-l</xref>).</p><p>To extend our observations, we also examined the changes of lysosomal and mitochondrial morphology in NPCs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, we observed an increase in size and number of lysosomes in the INAD patient-derived NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; arrows in upper panel; quantifications on the right). Moreover, the mitochondria in the corrected NPCs form a connected network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; arrowheads in lower panel). However, the mitochondria in the INAD patient-derived NPCs are enlarged and fragmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; arrows in lower panel; quantifications on the right). To assess the levels of PLA2G6 and LAMP2, we performed western blots on NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; quantified in the right panels). Both clones of the INAD patient-derived NPCs, 29-1 and 29-3, do not express PLA2G6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; lanes 1 and 3, respectively). However, the genetically corrected cells obviously express PLA2G6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; lane 2). Interestingly, LAMP2 levels are significantly upregulated in INAD patient-derived NPCs compared to corrected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), consistent with a lysosomal expansion. To assess the function of the mitochondria, we measured ATP levels in 29-1, 29-2, and 29-3 patient-derived NPCs. We found that the ATP levels are significantly higher in the genetically corrected cells (29-2) than in the other two lines, indicating defective mitochondrial function in the patient-derived NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>Next, we performed lipidomic assays to measure the levels of Ceramides and their derivatives in the INAD patient-derived NPCs (29-1) and the genetically corrected cells (29-2). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, we found a significant increase in total Cer and HexCer levels and they are about two fold higher in the patient-derived NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; left panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>).

The data show that INAD patient-derived NPCs exhibit an elevation of the HexCer (including GlcCer) and many different other types of ceramides. In summary, loss of <italic>PLA2G6</italic> leads to an elevation of GlcCer, expansion of lysosomes, and defects in mitochondrial dynamics and functions. Moreover, these phenotypes are reversed in genetically corrected cells, indicating a causative relationship.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ceramide accumulation, lysosomal expansion, and mitochondrial defects in mouse models of INAD</title><p>To study the neuropathology in mice, we obtained two INAD mouse models: mice that lack <italic>Pla2g6</italic> (<italic>Pla2g6<sup>KO/KO</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao et al., 2004</xref>) and mice that carry a homozygous <italic>G373R</italic> point mutation (<italic>Pla2g6<sup>G373R/G373R</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wada et al., 2009</xref>).

We used INAD flies in a primary screen and then tested the drugs that improve the phenotypes in flies in INAD patient-derived cells. Based on a review of the literature, we identified 20 drugs that have been reported to control or affect sphingolipid metabolism, endolysosomal trafficking and drugs that are being tested to treat Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>; see references in Table 4). We previously reported that INAD flies show severe bang-sensitivity at 15 days of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). This assay is a quick and sensitive assay that measures the propensity of flies to seize upon shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Wild-type flies right themselves in less than a second after a vortex paradigm. In contrast, bang-sensitive flies are paralyzed for an extended period of time before they can right themselves. We used this assay as our primary screen assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, wild-type flies are not bang-sensitive. In contrast, INAD flies show severe bang-sensitivity and require ~20 s to recover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We identified drugs that worsen the bang-sensitivity, including Fingolimod, Ozanimod, Fumonisin, Hydrochloroquine, Lonafarnib, Omigapil, and Taurine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Another set of drugs did not affect bang-sensitivity, including Miglustat, Ibiglustat, NCGC607, Rapamycin, VER-155008, Deoxygalactonojirimycin, CuATSM, and Metformin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, five drugs suppressed bang-sensitivity, including Ambroxol, Genistein, PADK, ML-SA1, and Azoramide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To confirm the rescue effect, we retested the drugs that suppressed the bang-sensitivity at a dosage that is 10 times higher than the dosage used in the first round. Each drug exhibited a dose-dependent increase in rescue activity, suggesting that the ability to suppress bang-sensitivity is dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To assess if these drugs modify the phenotypes in INAD patient-derived NPCs we probed Western blots of the treated cells for LAMP2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>, patient-derived NPCs (29-1) do not express PLA2G6 and exhibit elevated levels of LAMP2. Correcting the variant (29-2) strongly reduces LAMP2 levels.

In <italic>Pla2g6</italic> knockout mice, cerebellar atrophy, as well as a loss of Purkinje neurons were observed in older animals (18 months) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, mice with a knock-in of a variant identified in <italic>PARK14</italic> patients, exhibit an early onset loss of the substantia nigra and a loss of DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiu et al., 2019</xref>). These data suggest that loss of Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum and/or DA neurons in the substantia nigra are features that are shared by patients and mice that lack <italic>Pla2g6</italic>. We find that GlcCer is highly enriched in Purkinje and DA neurons in mutant <italic>Pla2g6</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and in INAD patient-derived DA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and iron lead to ROS-induced lipid peroxidation. This promotes ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>). Loss of <italic>PLA2G6</italic> in cancerous cell lines or placental trophoblasts promotes lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beharier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kajiwara et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2022b</xref>). An accumulation of peroxidated lipids at day 25 was also observed in adult brains of flies that carry a hypomorphic allele of <italic>iPLA2-VIA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kinghorn et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Pla2g6<sup>R748W/R748W</sup></italic> mice that contain a PARK14 variant, exhibit an early impairment of rotarod performance, an elevation of ferroptotic death, and a loss of DA neurons in the midbrains in 7-month-old <italic>Pla2g6<sup>R748W/R748W</sup></italic> knock-in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, ferroptosis is also observed in rotenone-infused rats as well as in α-synuclein-mutant <italic>Snca<sup>A53T</sup></italic> mice, suggesting that this pathway may be affected in different models of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). However, in flies that lack <italic>iPLA2-VIA</italic>, we did not observe an elevation of iron or ROS in 15-day-old adults (these flies live a maximum of 30 days), yet these flies already exhibit a severe ceramide accumulation and lysosomal expansion. Similarly, the INAD mice exhibit a severe ceramide accumulation and lysosome expansion in Purkinje neurons and DA neurons prior to neuronal death. We therefore argue that ceramide accumulation and lysosome expansion precede ferroptosis. Our data are also consistent with the observation that activation of lysosomes and autophagy promote ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Torii et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, loss of <italic>PLA2G6</italic> may disrupt retromer function, and lead to impaired recycling of proteins and lipids which in turn causes lysosomal and autophagy defects that activate ferroptosis.</p><p>We screened drugs that affect sphingolipid metabolism, endolysosomal trafficking as well as drugs that are being explored in PD. Upon screening these drugs in flies, we identified drugs that had a positive impact on bang-sensitivity and subsequently screened them in NPCs derived from an INAD patient. We identified four drugs, Ambroxol, Desipramine, Azoramide, and Genistein that alleviate bang-sensitivity and ERG defects in INAD flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, these drugs also reduce LAMP2 and restore ATP levels in INAD patient-derived NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). Upon oral uptake, Ambroxol is transported to lysosomes where it serves as a molecular chaperone for β-glucocerebrosidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Magalhaes et al., 2018</xref>), the enzyme encoded by <italic>GBA,</italic> associated with Gaucher Disease and PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sidransky, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wong et al., 2004</xref>). Ambroxol promotes β-glucocerebrosidase activity in the lysosomes to reduce the levels of GlcCer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Magalhaes et al., 2018</xref>). Given that loss of <italic>Pla2g6</italic> leads to a robust accumulation of GlcCer in Purkinje neurons and in DA neurons, Ambroxol may promote the degradation of GlcCer and reduce the toxicity of GlcCer accumulation, consistent with our model. However, it should not affect the elevation of other ceramides and hence may only partially suppress the phenotypes associated with elevated ceramides. Indeed, RNAi knockdown of <italic>lace</italic>, the rate-limiting enzyme that synthesizes ceramides, strongly impairs ceramide synthesis, and has the most potent suppressive effect as it affects all ceramides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, Miglustat and Ibiglustat, two inhibitors of UGCG UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase that are being used to reduce GlcCer levels in Gaucher disease patients, did not reduce the bang-sensitivity in INAD flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). UGCG UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase is the enzyme that generates GlcCer. Blocking its activity reduces GlcCer levels but does not affect the other ceramides. We argue that this may lead to an elevation of other ceramides, and these drugs may not be effective given that many other ceramides are elevated in INAD. Indeed, Desipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant that is transported to the lysosomes where it functions as an acidic sphingomyelinase inhibitor to suppress the overall ceramide synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jenkins et al., 2011</xref>), showed a significant rescue effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Hence, based on our drug screen, we identify two drugs, Ambroxol and Desipramine, that reduce the levels of ceramides and lysosomal defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). These data are consistent with our model that increased ceramide levels contribute to the pathogenesis of INAD and <italic>PARK14</italic>.</p><p>Azoramide, a drug tested for parkinsonism, promotes protein folding and secretion without inducing ER stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fu et al., 2015</xref>). It reduces ER stress, abnormal calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, elevated ROS as well as cell death in PARK14 patient-derived DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ke et al., 2020</xref>). Azoramide reduces bang-sensitivity in flies and reduces the lysosomal expansion in INAD patient-derived NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Azoramide promotes protein folding and hence may reduce the levels of misfolded proteins and alleviate lysosomal stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jackson and Hewitt, 2016</xref>). Finally, Genistein is an isoflavone naturally found in soy products. It exhibits neuroprotective effects in DA neurons in the MPTP-induced mouse model of Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). It has been shown to promote lysosomal biogenesis by activating the transcription factor EB (TFEB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moskot et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, the identification of Azoramide and Genistein to alleviate neurodegeneration in INAD models indicates that lysosomal defects are indeed key contributors to the pathogenesis of INAD.</p><p>We previously showed that whole-body expression of human <italic>PLA2G6</italic> cDNA in flies that lack <italic>iPLA2-VIA</italic> completely rescued the neurodegenerative defects as well as lifespan, whereas neuronal expression strongly suppressed the neuronal phenotypes but did not extend lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). To assess the effect of expressing PLA2G6 in INAD mice and patient NPCs, we created two AAV-based vectors, <italic>AAV-EF1a-EGFP</italic> and <italic>AAV-EF1a-PLA2G6</italic>, which express EGFP or human PLA2G6 under the control of a ubiquitous promoter (<italic>EF1a</italic>) in human NPCs and mice. After delivery using ICV and IV into mice, the EGFP is broadly expressed in the nervous system as well as in other organs including the heart and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Upon delivery of <italic>AAV-EF1a-PLA2G6</italic> to patient-derived NPCs, the construct expresses low levels of PLA2G6 (10–20% of the endogenous levels). However, this is sufficient to partially alleviate the defects including Vps35 levels, lysosomal expansion and mitochondrial morphological and functional abnormalities in NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Moreover, delivery of <italic>AAV-EF1a-PLA2G6</italic> into <italic>Pla2g6<sup>KO/G373R</sup></italic> mice also delays the onset of rotarod defect, helps to sustain body weight, and prolongs lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Importantly, it also reduces the levels of GlcCer and LAMP2, and increases the levels of Vps35 in <italic>Pla2g6<sup>KO/G373R</sup></italic> INAD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These proof-of-concept data are important because they indicate that the defects caused by a loss of <italic>PLA2G6</italic> can be delayed by low levels of <italic>PLA2G6</italic> expression and reversed in NPCs. However, the efficiency of delivery and expression need to be improved, possibly by testing other serotypes of AAV or injecting more virus.</p><p>In summary, the accumulation of ceramides, expansion of lysosomes, and disruption of mitochondria are key phenotypes that are associated with the loss of <italic>PLA2G6</italic> in flies, mice, and human cells. The defects are obvious in mouse DA neurons and Purkinje cells, two cell populations that have been implicated in INAD/PARK14. We also identified four drugs that suppress the ceramide levels or promote lysosome functions and that alleviate the defects caused by loss of <italic>PLA2G6</italic> in INAD flies and in INAD patient-derived NPCs. These data, combined with previous data, provide compelling evidence that endolysosmal trafficking defects, expansion of lysosomes, elevation of ceramides, and disruption of mitochondria are at the root of the pathogenesis of INAD and PARK14. Finally, we report encouraging data for a proof-of-concept trial to test the efficiency of a gene therapy approach. We argue that combining a drug and gene therapy approach will provide an avenue to significantly improve the quality of life of INAD/PARK14 patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> and drug treatment</title><p>Mixed genders of flies (approximately 50% male and 50% female) were used for all experiments.

To generate the vector backbone, pAAV-EF1a-CVS-G-WPRE-pGHpA (Addgene; 67528) was digested with XbaI and EcoRV and gel eluted to remove the CVS-G. The digested PCR fragments were ligated in the digested vector backbone to generate pAAV-EF1a-PLA2G6-WPRE-pGHpA. The pGHpA was replaced by SV40pA to reduce the total size of the construct. Similarly, the pAAV-EF1a-EGFP was constructed following the same method except the EGFP cDNA was used. Lenti-CMV-PLA2G6 was purchased from Horizon Discovery-Precision LentiORF collection (OHS5897-202617053).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>AAV-PHP.eB package</title><p>A plasmid DNA cocktail solution was produced by combining the pAAV transgene (pAAV-EF1a-PLA2G6 or pAAV-EF1a-EGFP), rep/cap serotype PHP.eB, and Ad∆F6 helper plasmids and transfected into HEK293T cells with iMFectin poly transfection reagent – GenDEPOT. A total of 80×15 cm<sup>2</sup> dishes were overlaid with the DNA cocktail solution and were allowed to incubate for 4 hr before adding fresh media. Three days post-transfection, dishes were imaged, harvested, and digested. The collected cell viral lysate was centrifuged, supernatant was transferred to a new tube and digested separately. The cell pellet was resuspended in TMN (Tris-HCl cell suspension buffer) and cell-associated AAV was recovered by cell lysis treatment with 5% sodium deoxycholate, DNase, RNase, and three subsequent freeze/thaw cycles. Media-secreted AAV was precipitated in a 40% polyethylene glycol solution. Digest CVL was centrifuged to remove cell debris and cleared supernatant was transferred to a new tube. PEG precipitated supernatant was centrifuged, the resulting pellet was resuspended in HBS (HEPES Buffered Saline) solution. After digestion and precipitation, cleared cell viral lysate and media secreted AAV were combined and purified on a discontinuous iodixanol gradient. The band corresponding to purified AAV was extracted and diluted in DPBS supplemented with 0.001% Pluronic F-68. Viral diluent was then concentrated in Amicon centrifugation filtration units (100,000 MW) to the desired volume. Concentrated AAV was first diluted 1:100 and then serially diluted 10-fold to yield AAV dilutions of 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, and 0.0001. The titer of the AAV vectors was quantified with the primers corresponding to WPRE and probed against a GVC in-house standard. The AAV-PHP.eB was packaged by the Gene Vector Core at Baylor College of Medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Mouse house keeping</title><p>All experimental animals were treated in compliance with the United States Department of Health and Human Services and the Baylor College of Medicine IACUC guidelines.

Animals were anesthetized preoperatively with isoflurane. Following anesthesia, animals were checked for pedal withdrawal reflex; if absent, the animals were transferred to stereotaxic apparatus and maintained under anesthesia using volatilized isoflurane (1–3% depending on physiological state of the animal, which was continuously monitored by response to tail/toe pinch). Isoflurane was diluted with pressurized oxygen using an anesthetic vaporizer system that allows precise adjustment of isoflurane and gas flow to the animal. Surgical site was prepared by shaving hair, administering depilatory cream and three times betadine surgical scrub, three times ethanol wipe. A short incision (0.5–2 cm) was made over the skull using small surgical scissors. Following the incision, a small burr hole craniotomy (&lt;1 mm in diameter) was made using a dental drill 0.5 µl of AAV particles were injected into the third ventricle (coordinates from Bregma in mm: ML 1, AP –0.3, DV −2.3) using a 33-gauge Hamilton syringe. Post-injection, the scalp was sutured using surgical nylon monofilament (Ethicon Cat# 1689G) in a simple interrupted pattern for skin-to-skin closure. After 7 days, mice were briefly anesthetized with isoflurane and sutures were gently removed using small scissors and forceps.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Mouse tail vein injections</title><p>Random selected mice were placed in restrainer to immobilize and have easy access to the tail. Tail was soaked in warm water for 10–15 s to cause vasodilation (enlargement) of the vein and was swabbed with a gauze dampened with alcohol to increase the visibility of the vein. One of the two lateral tail veins was located in the middle third of the tail. With the bevel of the needle facing upward and the needle almost parallel to the vein, the needle was slid into the tail vein. By gently applying negative pressure to the plunger and observing a flash of blood in the hub vein penetration was confirmed. Slowly the plunger was pressed to inject AAV-containing solution into the vein. The needle was removed from the vein and slight pressure was applied to the puncture site with a dry piece of gauze until the bleeding has stopped. The animal was removed from its restrainer and placed in the cage. The animal was monitored for 5–10 min to ensure hemostasis and that the bleeding has stopped.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Mouse rotarod assay</title><p>We measured the time (latency) a mouse takes to fall off the rod under continuous acceleration. On the day of testing, mice were kept in their home cages and acclimated to the testing room for at least 15 min (acclimation phase). The apparatus was set to accelerating mode from 5 to 40 rpm in 300 s. We record the latency at which each mouse falls off the rod. The first trial is the training period. During the training period, the mice were tested three times separated by 15 min intervals in a day and the trials were repeated for 3 consecutive days. After the training period, the mice were tested once a week. At the end of the rotarod assay, we weighted each mouse every other week.

key pathologies in PLA2G6-associated disease in both patient-derived neuronal models and a novel trans heterozygote mouse model. It identifies a number of possible compounds that could potentially be re-purposed for therapeutic use in PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration and provides a proof-of-principle in mouse that gene therapy with human PLA2G6 can rescue defects in PLA2G6 deficiency. The data are solid and convincing, and will stimulate future work to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms at play.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82555.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Pfeffer</surname><given-names>Suzanne R</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00f54p054</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.08.16.504080">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.16.504080v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>You will see below that the reviewers felt that further characterization of the diverse aspects you cover would add greatly to the overall impact of this study. We will leave it to you to be guided by these comments and add additional information to bolster the story and address the comments below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Points to address:</p><p>iPSC/NPC work</p><p>– While the patient IPSC-derived neuronal cell data is interesting and confirms previous findings in <italic>Drosophila</italic> models of PLA2G6 knockout, it does not fully recapitulate all the pathologies previously reported by the authors in the INAD flies. The fly work led to the hypothesis that loss of PLA2G6 leads to loss of normal retromer function with consequent sphingomyelin/CPE mis trafficking and endolysosomal dysfunction, resulting in elevated ceramide levels. Does loss of PLA2G6 in the patient-derived neuronal cells lead to retromer dysfunction and increased ceramide levels? Are levels of Vps35 or Vps26 altered in the patient derived cells? It is interesting that GlcCer levels are up, but it would be useful to look specifically at different ceramide species. The reason for this is that the drugs previously used to rescue neurodegeneration were focused on reducing ceramide levels and not GlcCer. The significance of elevated GlcCer is not clear, and indeed drugs used in Gaucher's disease patients to specifically lower GlcCer were not successful in rescuing the PLAn phenotypes in this study.</p><p>– Figure 1E: It is not clear how the mitochondrial fragmentation phenotypes were quantified. How many cell/images were quantified? Was any quantification performed for the LAMP2 immunostaining? Although it looks like there is an obvious difference between patient and control NPCs, it should at least be stated that the images are representative.</p><p>– The current study demonstrates mitochondrial morphological abnormalities (with fragmentation). Is there also evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in the patient-derived cells?</p><p>Mouse work</p><p>– Again, as with the patient-derived cell data, the mouse work is of significant interest but would benefit from exploration with regards to retromer function, ceramide levels and mitochondrial function in view of the previous hypothesis put forward from the fly work. The authors state that there is ceramide accumulation in the introduction summary and in the summary at the end of the mouse results – strictly speaking accumulation of GlcCer has been shown.</p><p>Drug screening</p><p>– The general feel of this work is that although it is of considerable interest, because of the potential for drug-repurposing for therapeutic purposes in PLAN, it has not been performed very rigorously. The candidate compounds have only been tested using one fly readout and a western blot in NPCs. Although statistically significant, the biological relevance of the degree of rescue of bang sensitivity is difficult to assess based on this data alone. This work would benefit from confirmatory studies of the molecular effectiveness of the drug. Ideally it would next be tested in the mouse models to show true efficacy at the lifespan and behavioural phenotype level. At the very least, validation of the drugs that were effective at rescuing bang-sensitivity require further validation in vivo in the fly model (e.g. ERG, photoreceptor loss suppression).</p><p>Gene therapy work</p><p>– While this work is of significant interest, the only cellular defect that is shown to be improved in the patient-derived NPCs is that of the mitochondrial fragmentation and LAMP2 expression. A reduction in ceramide levels or improvement in retromer function would support the efficacy at the cellular level. It is not clear how the fragmentation phenotype has been quantified for the NPCs (as in Figure 1E). The figure legend does not state that the images are representative. There is no indication of how many cells/images were quantified in the figure legend or in the methods.</p><p>– The rescue of the rotarod assay is quite modest. Were any other motor phenotypes rescued? It would be nice to see rescue at the neuropathological level.</p><p>Statistics</p><p>– The statistics for the cell and fly work all employ a 2-tailed Student T-test. However, given that there are at least 3 in dependent groups being compared on each graph, a one-way ANOVA with post hoc test (e.g. Bonferroni) would be better used.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This article aims to extend human disease-related studies of PLA2G6 from fly models to iPS-neurons, mouse models, to look for drugs that suppress phenotypes and test them, and to attempt AAV whole body rescue. Generally, each of these questions/aims/experiments is excellent, but as presented, it's a bit of an underdeveloped hodgepodge of results, with each experiment somewhat underdeveloped or analyzed for the respective phenotype, in my opinion. I think the general thrust of the experiments is excellent. But the data are relatively cursory in many instances. Further development and characterization of the phenotypes would require quite a bit of work but vastly improve the paper.</p><p>1. The phenotypes characterized in iPS neurons are somewhat cursory. First the lipid analyses. GlcCer levels are measured, but I cannot find any description of this in the methods. Also, it would seem important to do thorough lipidomics in these cell types, as well as the mouse brains. Are other sphingolipids or glycosphingolipids affected?</p><p>2. Second, lysosomal phenotypes are measured as cells with abnormalities. This needs better quantification, such as lysosomal number and intensity per cell. Also, there is no other phenotyping of the lysosomes for function or lysosomal proteins. This seems to need much more.</p><p>3. Third, mitochondria are stained for. These images are really poor and hard to interpret anything with respect to morphology. This also needs some sort of quantification. Later in the paper, quantifying with reference to expression of a rescue vector per cell would help a lot. There is also no functional characterization of mitochondria. This seems to need much more than staining.</p><p>4. In mice, the primary phenotypes are RotoRod and survival. These seem okay. However, neuropath of rescue studies with AAV or lentivirus would be good. This would also need some quantification.</p><p>5. The phenotyping for the drug rescue studies consists of screening in flies and then lysosomal staining in iPS neurons. This seems inadequate. If the drugs really do work, then an extensive analysis of the ones that do work and some controls would be much more convincing. What happens to the lipids? The lysosomal and mitochondrial morphology and function? The mito morphology shown again seems uninterpretable and not well quantified. Also, did the authors try a rescue with one of these drugs in the mouse model?? That would seem to be the obvious step.</p><p>6. Instead, the authors move on to rescuing the mouse model with AAV expressing the enzyme and get the somewhat expected result with replacing the gene in all cell types. What is shown is RotoRod and lifespan and body weight, but what about the lipids, the neuropath defects, etc.?</p><p>7. Little is made of the enzymatic function of PLA2G6 and how it relates to the phenotype unfortunately. Also, it would be good to see if the same lipid phenotypes are present in the current systems (cells, mice) and whether they are rescued with the AAV in this system.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82555.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Points to address:</p><p>iPSC/NPC work</p><p>– While the patient IPSC-derived neuronal cell data is interesting and confirms previous findings in <italic>Drosophila</italic> models of PLA2G6 knockout, it does not fully recapitulate all the pathologies previously reported by the authors in the INAD flies.

Are levels of Vps35 or Vps26 altered in the patient derived cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these questions. To address these questions we tested a few commercially available antibodies that recognize Vps26 or Vps35. We identified a Goat polyclonal antibody (Abcam; ab10099) that detects the endogenous Vps35 punctae in Patient-derived NPCs as well as in mice. By using this antibody, we found that the number of Vps35 punctae is much higher in the genetically corrected NPCs (29-2) than the INAD patient derived NPCs (29-1) (Figure 5A, a-b and B). This is consistent with our finding in flies that PLA2G6 improves the stability of Vps35 (Lin et al., 2018).</p><p>Moreover, we tested whether the selected drugs or the expression of human PLA2G6 can restore retromer levels in INAD patient derived NPCs. The addition of Ambroxol, Azoraminde, Desipramine or Genistein to the patient derived NPCs did not restores Vps35 levels (Figure 5A, a-f and B). These data suggest that these drugs may function downstream of the retromer. Ambroxol promotes GCase activity to degrade GlcCer in lysosomes, Azoraminde promotes UPR in the ER, whereas Desipramine blocks ceramide salvage pathway and Genistein enhances lysosome biogenesis. Indeed, these actions are all downstream of the retromer function.</p><p>In contrast to the drugs, the expression of the human PLA2G6 restored Vps35 levels (Figure 5A, a,b, g-i and B). This is consistent with our model that PLA2G6 binds to Vps35 and Vps26 to stabilize the retromer complex. In summary, the expression of the human PLA2G6, but not the identified drugs restores Vps35 levels. The expression of the human PLA2G6 promotes retromer levels and function and facilitates the recycling of the proteins and Ceramides to reduce lysosomal expansion and neurodegeneration. The data are now presented in the newly generated Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is interesting that GlcCer levels are up, but it would be useful to look specifically at different ceramide species.

As shown in Figure 1H, we found that the total Cer and total HexCer levels are about two fold higher in the patient derived NPCs (Figure 1H; left panel and Figure 1—source data 3). However, although the levels of Sphinganine and</p><p>Sphingosine are increased in the patient derived NPCs, they are not statistically significantly increased (Figure 1H; right panel and Figure 1—source data 3). These data show that INAD patient derived NPCs exhibit an elevation of the HexCer (including GlcCer) and many other ceramides. This may also explain why a reduction of GlcCer by drugs used in Gaucher's disease patients fail to suppress neurodegenerative phenotypes in the INAD flies. The data are now presented in the manuscript (Figure 1H and Figure 1—source data 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1E: It is not clear how the mitochondrial fragmentation phenotypes were quantified.

The n number is indicated in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The current study demonstrates mitochondrial morphological abnormalities (with fragmentation). Is there also evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in the patient-derived cells?</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer comment, we measured ATP levels in 29-1, 29-2 (corrected cells) and 29-3 patient derived NPCs. The ATP levels are higher in the genetically corrected cells (29-2) than in the patient NPCs (29-1 and 29-2). These data indicate that the mitochondrial function is indeed defective in the patient derived NPCs (Figure 1G). We further show that this reduction in ATP levels is mildly but significantly suppressed by treating the NPCs with the four drugs, Ambroxol, Azoraminde, Desipramine or Genistein (Figure 3E), as well as the expression of human PLA2G6 with the gene therapy constructs (Figure 4E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Mouse work</p><p>– Again, as with the patient-derived cell data, the mouse work is of significant interest but would benefit from exploration with regards to retromer function, ceramide levels and mitochondrial function in view of the previous hypothesis put forward from the fly work.

However, unlike in flies and human cells, we did not observed an obvious change in HexCer as well as other ceramides (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and Figure 2—source data 1). Given that the GlcCer antibody shows obvious changes that are consistent among the three species, we argue that the lipidomic assays are not sensitive enough to detect the increase in GlcCer because only Purkinje cells seem to be affected. In summary, the changes maybe masked by cells that do not show an obvious increase. We have now included these data in the manuscript.</p><p>In summary, we observed elevation of GlcCer, expansion of lysosomes, disruption of mitochondria, reduction of Vps35 punctae, and increased number of MVB and TVS in the Purkinje cells of the <italic>KO/G373R</italic> mice. These phenotypes are consistent with what we observed in the INAD flies and human cells, suggesting that these defects are evolutionary conserved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Drug screening</p><p>– The general feel of this work is that although it is of considerable interest, because of the potential for drug-repurposing for therapeutic purposes in PLAN, it has not been performed very rigorously.

We performed ERG assays and quantified photoreceptor loss in INAD flies. As shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-C, the defective electroretinogram (ERG) phenotypes associated with INAD flies are significantly improved when Ambroxol, Azoraminde, Desipramine or Genistein was added to the food. Moreover, the loss of photoreceptors phenotype is also reduced in INAD flies raised in the food containing each of the four drugs (Supplement Figure 5D-E). In summary, we provide more evidence showing that the four drugs can suppress the loss of PLA2G6-induced phenotypes in flies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Gene therapy work</p><p>– While this work is of significant interest, the only cellular defect that is shown to be improved in the patient-derived NPCs is that of the mitochondrial fragmentation and LAMP2 expression.

We have done the following experiments to address the concerns:</p><p>1. To address retromer function, we now assess the levels of Vps35 in the treated and untreated patient NPCs. We found that expression of the human PLA2G6 restores Vps35 levels (Figure 5A, a,b, g-i and B).</p><p>2. To assess GlcCer levels in mice, we quantified the GlcCer levels in Purkinje cells prior to and after expression of human PLA2G6 using AAV injections. As shown in Figure 7A, these injections strongly suppresses the levels of GlcCer in Purkinje cells based on Ab staining.</p><p>3. To quantify the fragmentation phenotype, we now measure the length of mitochondria a shown in Figure 4E. Moreover, we also measured the levels of ATP in treated or untreated NPCs. The data show that expression of human PLA2G6 using the gene therapy construct improves morphology and function of mitochondria.</p><p>4. We now added how many images were quantified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The rescue of the rotarod assay is quite modest. Were any other motor phenotypes rescued? It would be nice to see rescue at the neuropathological level.</p></disp-quote><p>To explore the rescue at the neuropathological level, we scarified two injected KO/G373R mice at ~P300. These two mice were not able to stay on the rod in a rotarod assay. However, they behave relatively normal in their home cage (Supplemental video). As shown in Figure 7A, we found that the GlcCer levels are strongly suppressed in the Purkinje cells of these two P300 animals when compared to the uninjected KO/G373R mice that are 140 days old (Figure 7A). Moreover, the levels of LAMP2 are also reduced in the Purkinje cells of these injected mice (Figure 7B). Hence, the injection of the gene therapy construct restores GlcCer levels and alleviates lysosome expansion.</p><p>Next, we assessed the levels of Vps35 in the injected and uninjected KO/G373R mice. Similar to our observations in INAD flies and INAD patient-derived NPCs, the levels of Vps35 is significantly reduced in the KO/G373R mice (Figure 7C). Interestingly, expression of human PLA2G6 not only restores the levels of Vps35, but also enhances its expression (~2 folds of the wild-type mice) (Figure 7C). In summary, expression of human PLA2G6 using our gene therapy construct in KO/G373R mice increases Vps35 punctae. This promotes retromer functions and facilitates the recycling of GlcCer and other cargoes. This in turn reduces lysosomal stress and alleviates neurodegenerative phenotypes.

However, this will take a long time and will require a significant influx in funding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Instead, the authors move on to rescuing the mouse model with AAV expressing the enzyme and get the somewhat expected result with replacing the gene in all cell types. What is shown is RotoRod and lifespan and body weight, but what about the lipids, the neuropath defects, etc.?</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our response in question 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Little is made of the enzymatic function of PLA2G6 and how it relates to the phenotype unfortunately. Also, it would be good to see if the same lipid phenotypes are present in the current systems (cells, mice) and whether they are rescued with the AAV in this system.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously shown that the enzymatically dead PLA2G6 fully rescues the lethality as well as other defects associated with INAD flies (Lin et al. 2018). These data indicate that the enzymatic activity may not play a key role in the pathogenesis of INAD. We now mention this in the introduction (Line 97100).</p></body></sub-article></article>
