crucial for memory-guided decision-making. Neural activity in the hippocampus exhibits place-cell sequences at multiple timescales, including slow behavioral sequences (~seconds) and fast theta sequences (~100–200 ms) within theta oscillation cycles. How prefrontal ensembles interact with hippocampal sequences to support decision-making is unclear. Here, we examined simultaneous hippocampal and prefrontal ensemble activity in rats during learning of a spatial working-memory decision task. We found clear theta sequences in prefrontal cortex, nested within its behavioral sequences. In both regions, behavioral sequences maintained representations of current choices during navigation. In contrast, hippocampal theta sequences encoded alternatives for deliberation and were coordinated with prefrontal theta sequences that predicted upcoming choices. During error trials, these representations were preserved to guide ongoing behavior, whereas replay sequences during inter-trial periods were impaired prior to navigation. These results establish cooperative interaction between hippocampal and prefrontal sequences at multiple timescales for memory-guided decision-making.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>decision making</kwd><kwd>working memory</kwd><kwd>Theta oscillation</kwd><kwd>sharp-wave ripple</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH112661</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jadhav</surname><given-names>Shantanu P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001341</institution-id><institution>Richard and Susan Smith Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Odyssey award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jadhav</surname><given-names>Shantanu P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hippocampal and prefrontal neuronal populations form slow behavioral-timescale (~seconds) and fast cognitive-timescale (~100 ms) sequential activity patterns as theta and replay sequences, which play distinct yet cooperative roles in memory-guided decision-making.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The neural substrates that support decision-making are still not fully understood. The link between decision-making and neural representations at the behavioral timescale has been studied extensively in various cortical and sub-cortical circuits of different species. Early classic work showed that during tasks involving sustained attention or decision-making, neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) can exhibit persistent activity over seconds throughout retention intervals for maintenance of decision-related information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fuster, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goldman-Rakic, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Miller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sreenivasan and D'Esposito, 2019</xref>). In contrast to these low-dimensional representations that require long-lived stable states, decision-related information can also be held in a dynamic population code. At the ensemble level, heterogenous activity patterns comprising sequences of neuronal activation that span entire task periods have emerged as a common coding scheme in many brain regions, including PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baeg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ito et al., 2015</xref>), hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pastalkova et al., 2008</xref>), PPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crowe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>), and striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakhurin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnes et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In addition to this behavioral-timescale activity, recent work has raised the possibility that neural dynamics at fast, cognitive timescales that occur transiently during discrete subsets of task periods can also underlie upcoming decisions. In many brain areas, such as prefrontal, parietal, orbitofrontal cortices, and hippocampus, population activity can change in an abrupt, coordinated, and transient manner in support of flexible decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernacchia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Durstewitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnson and Redish, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karlsson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Latimer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lundqvist et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rich and Wallis, 2016</xref>). For example, discrete transient bursts of gamma and beta oscillations in PFC have been shown to increase with working-memory load during delays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lundqvist et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, recent studies have identified time-compressed neuronal sequences in the hippocampus as a specific cell-assembly pattern at fast timescales that can support decision-making processes.</p><p>Hippocampal theta sequences provide time-compressed ensemble representations of spatial paths within single cycles of theta oscillations (6–12 Hz) during active navigation, which reflect a candidate neural mechanism for planning at decision time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnson and Redish, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Papale et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pezzulo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zielinski et al., 2020</xref>). Whether theta sequences exist in PFC during decision-making has yet to be determined. Further, during pauses in exploration, replay sequences are observed in the hippocampus during individual sharp-wave ripples (SWRs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carr et al., 2011</xref>), and are known to interact with PFC to reactivate past and future trajectories on the temporal scale of 100–200 ms during memory-guided decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tang and Jadhav, 2019</xref>). Disruption of fast sequences in the hippocampus, while leaving behavioral-timescale spatial representations intact, can impair navigation decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jadhav et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Petersen and Buzsáki, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Robbe and Buzsáki, 2009</xref>). Thus, fast hippocampal sequences are promising transient activity patterns that can support decision-making at sub-second speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Papale et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pezzulo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2019</xref>). Whether and how these fast-timescale representations are organized together in hippocampal-prefrontal circuits, and how they, especially theta sequences, are linked to behavioral-timescale mechanisms for decision-making is unknown. To address these questions, we examined neuronal ensemble activity simultaneously in the hippocampus and PFC of rats during learning of a spatial working-memory decision task.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Choice-specific neuronal sequences in CA1 and PFC during navigation decisions</title><p>We trained nine rats to learn a spatial working-memory task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

As a result of spatially specific firing, sequences of CA1 and PFC cells successively activated on the timescale of seconds as the rat ran through a trajectory (i.e. behavioral sequences), as previously reported by several groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frank et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kinsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stout and Griffin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wood et al., 2000</xref>). Further, these sequences were reactivated on the timescale of hundreds of milliseconds during SWRs at the reward well (i.e., replay sequences; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), confirming our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, within each cycle of theta oscillations during navigation, which corresponds to expression of fast CA1 theta sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dragoi and Buzsáki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foster and Wilson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Skaggs et al., 1996</xref>), we found that PFC cells were organized into sequences as well and could occur concurrently with the hippocampal sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Given these observations, we further quantified these sequences and investigated their roles in decision making.</p><p>First, we characterized how CA1 and PFC neurons encode choices on the behavioral timescale. We found that at the single-cell level, many CA1 and PFC cells exhibited strong preferential firing during navigation on L- versus R- side trajectory (trajectory-selective cells; mean ± SEM = 38.4 ± 1.2% in CA1, 23.5 ± 1.3% in PFC for inbound, 35.0 ± 0.7% in CA1, 20.9 ± 0.6% in PFC for outbound; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), consistent with prior reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frank et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kinsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stout and Griffin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wood et al., 2000</xref>). These trajectory-selective cells, when ordered by the peak firing on the preferred trajectory, form unique sequences for each choice type spanning the entire trial length at the behavioral timescale, including the common center stem prior to the choice point (CP) and the side arms after the CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>).</p><p>To directly assess the cell-assembly representation of the animals’ choices, we used a memoryless Bayesian decoding algorithm (see Materials and methods; decoding bin = 120 ms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2019</xref>). We found that behavioral sequences in CA1 and PFC consistently predicted the animals’ current location and choice well above chance level across all positions of a trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kinsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stout and Griffin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wood et al., 2000</xref>), even on the common center stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, the decoding accuracy on the center stem significantly increased in CA1 (p=0.0003 and &lt;1e-4 for outbound and inbound, respectively), and was stable in PFC across sessions (p’s &gt; 0.05 for outbound and inbound, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>, <italic>right</italic>), in agreement with our previous findings of an increased proportion of CA1 ‘splitter cells’ (center-stem trajectory-selective cells) and a stable proportion of PFC ‘splitter cells’ over learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the larger proportions of inbound splitter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2019</xref>) also contributed to better decoding for inbound choices compared to that for outbound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>).

To investigate how these theta sequences related to animals’ memory state and upcoming behavior, we examined the Bayesian reconstructed positions of forward-shifted candidate theta sequences in different theta-phase bins during reference-memory-guided inbound versus working-memory-guided outbound navigation. We found that the positions behind the actual location of the animal were decoded with higher probability during inbound than outbound navigation in both CA1 and PFC, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>), implying that inbound sequences started farther behind and outbound sequences sweep father ahead of the current animal position.

Before the CP (corresponding to periods on the center stem for outbound navigation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), CA1 theta sequences serially encoded both alternative trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

After the choice was made (i.e., after CP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), as expected, both CA1 and PFC theta sequences preferentially encoded the animal’s current choice as the animal’s ran down the track toward reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, F and G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). Note that after CP, CA1 theta sequences representing the alternative choice only constituted a minority of the total sequences, reminiscent of the previous findings of a small proportion of hippocampal theta sequences representing the alternative running direction on a linear track (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), and encoding locations far away from an animal’s current position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wikenheiser and Redish, 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Theta-sequence representations of behavioral choices in CA1 and PFC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Single-event examples of CA1 theta sequences encoding alternative. Two detailed example sequences are shown in (Ai) and (Aii) (presented as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

These prefrontal phenomena follow a succession of results on hippocampal sequences, but our study points to different yet complementary roles of prefrontal and hippocampal sequences at multiple timescales. By dissecting fast cognitive-timescale sequences from slow behavioral-timescale sequences in a spatial working-memory and navigation task, these findings thus provide a unified framework that integrates hippocampal and prefrontal mechanisms of multi-timescale cell-assembly dynamics for memory-guided decision-making.</p><p>First, during delay periods of the spatial navigation task on the center stem, choice information was maintained by behavioral-timescale sequences in CA1 and PFC on correct as well as incorrect trials. These sequences are contextually modulated by current journeys, and can enable choice-related information processing on a behavioral timescale for planning actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ito et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, we determined the existence of compressed-timescale theta sequences in PFC, similar to previously described CA1 theta sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dragoi and Buzsáki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foster and Wilson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Skaggs et al., 1996</xref>). These transient theta sequences in CA1 and PFC were nested within behavioral-timescale sequences during navigation. However, in contrast to trajectory-dependent firing sequences at the behavioral-timescale, theta sequences retain representations of choice options to support vicarious memory recall and deliberative decision-making, and function in a complementary manner with fast replay sequences involved in decision priming prior to onset of navigation, highlighting novel roles of these compressed sequences in guiding ongoing choice behavior. Notably, the mechanism of using internally generated sequences to simulate future scenarios has been used as a key feature that improves performance of model-based learning computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daw and Dayan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mattar and Daw, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pezzulo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pezzulo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>At the level of single theta cycles, we found that prior to the decision-making point in the navigation task, CA1 theta sequences report both actual and alternative choices, and are unable to predict chosen destination till after the decision has been made. On the other hand, we found robust PFC theta sequences that maintain prediction of upcoming choice prior to the decision point. Thus, theta sequences underlie a cognitive timescale mechanism that also maintains choice information, with the key distinction that this fast timescale mechanism can support vicarious memory recall of different choices, which was not seen at the behavioral timescale. These findings build on previous results that demonstrated theta-timescale activity patterns in the hippocampus representing future locations by recruiting cells encoding positions after the choice point (i.e. non-splitters; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnson and Redish, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Papale et al., 2016</xref>), and show that trajectory-specific coding of splitter cells at the behavioral timescale is preserved in fast theta sequences for representing future choices prior to the choice point as well. This process may be important in the event that animals have to change decisions or adapt to change in contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rich and Wallis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yu and Frank, 2015</xref>). In agreement with this idea, a recent study has shown that theta timescale mechanisms in CA1 can not only represent possible future paths, but also possible directions of motion on a moment-to-moment basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kay et al., 2020</xref>). Representation of past locations within theta cycles has also been recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Complementing these results, previous studies have shown that theta oscillation cycles comprise cognitive computation units, corresponding to segregation of cell assemblies that represent different spatial experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Geisler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jezek et al., 2011</xref>) and alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnson and Redish, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Papale et al., 2016</xref>). The results shown here establish that the representation of alternatives in the hippocampus interacts with prefrontal theta sequences in a content-specific manner, which can be used to guide actual choices.</p><p>The exact mechanism underlying these interactions, however, remains unclear. It has been shown that cortical neurons are sensitive to temporally organized inputs from the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Branco et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Siapas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sigurdsson et al., 2010</xref>), and pharmacological disruption of prefrontal activity results in impaired theta sequences in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmidt et al., 2019</xref>), as well as impaired performance in the W-track task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maharjan et al., 2018</xref>). Behavioral-state-dependent prefrontal-hippocampal interactions during theta oscillations can potentially also be mediated through connections with entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>), nucleus reuniens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ito et al., 2015</xref>), or other regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eichenbaum, 2017</xref>) that contribute to theta generation and memory retrieval. The specific roles of these circuits will need to be further elucidated in future investigations.</p><p>Notably, theta-associated mechanisms at both behavioral and theta timescales during active navigation supported retention during working memory periods, but did not predict errors in decisions. Rather, we found that compressed SWR replay sequences during inter-trial periods prior to the onset of trajectories prime the decision without apparent external cue triggers, which is maintained from the onset of the trajectory via behavioral and theta sequences. Previous studies have shown that SWR-reactivation in the hippocampus is less coordinated prior to incorrect versus correct trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Singer et al., 2013</xref>), and disrupting awake SWRs leads to increase in errors in the spatial working memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jadhav et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, we have previously shown a relationship between reverse and forward CA1-PFC replay with past and future trajectories, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with all these prior results, our current findings provide definitive evidence that coherent CA1-PFC replay of future trajectories prior to navigation onset primes the chosen destination in this memory-guided decision-making task, and errors in CA1-PFC replay predict incorrect decisions.</p><p>It is important to note that the expression of behavioral- and compressed-timescale sequences representing different trajectories are inextricably linked. Choice-specific representations of both theta and replay sequences depend on choice encoding through trajectory preferred firing of behavioral sequences. Furthermore, trajectory-selective neurons showed an extended tail of their spatial fields, which is inherently a behavioral-timescale characteristic, and likely contributes to trajectory-modulated look-ahead of theta sequences. Finally, there is evidence that degradation of theta sequences results in impaired sequential activation during sleep replay in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drieu et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it is the interactions among these multi-timescale activity patterns that potentially govern decision-making. The network mechanisms that enable expression of sequences at distinct timescales in multiple circuits remain a key question for future investigation.</p><p>Overall, our results provide a critical extension to classic models, which emphasize behavioral-timescale activity patterns typically spanning entire retention intervals, by establishing a role of discrete, fast timescale ensemble activity patterns in decision-making processes. Such a mechanism is broadly supported by recent findings of rapid shifts in activity patterns during decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernacchia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Durstewitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karlsson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Latimer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rich and Wallis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sadacca et al., 2016</xref>), including discrete gamma oscillatory bursts in PFC underlying working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lundqvist et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Miller et al., 2018</xref>), which occur at a similar timescale to compressed theta and replay sequences. Together, these results suggest the possibility of transient LFP oscillations as informative signatures of fast evolving cell assemblies that bear on decision-making processes, and the cooperative behavioral- and cognitive-timescale mechanisms described here may reflect a general organizing principle of neural dynamics underlying decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Long Evans rats; male</italic>)</td><td>Long Evans</td><td>Charles River</td><td>Cat#: Crl:LE 006 <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:RGD_2308852">RGD_2308852</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Cresyl Violet</td><td>Acros Organics</td><td>Cat#: AC229630050</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Formaldehyde</td><td>Fisher</td><td>Cat#: 50-00-0,67561,7732-18-5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Isoflurane</td><td>Patterson Veterinary</td><td>Cat#: 07-806-3204</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Ketamine</td><td>Patterson Veterinary</td><td>Cat#: 07-803-6637</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Xylazine</td><td>Patterson Veterinary</td><td>Cat#: 07-808-1947</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Atropine</td><td>Patterson Veterinary</td><td>Cat#: 07-869-6061</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Bupivacaine</td><td>Patterson Veterinary</td><td>Cat#: 07-890-4881</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Beuthanasia-D</td><td>Patterson Veterinary</td><td>Cat#: 07-807-3963</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MATLAB 2017a</td><td>Mathworks, MA</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001622">SCR_001622, V2017a</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Trodes</td><td>SpikeGadgets</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://spikegadgets.com/trodes/">https://spikegadgets.com/trodes/</ext-link>, V1.9</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Matclust</td><td>Mattias P.

A sequence was considered significant if it met two criteria: first, its sequence score (i.e. weighted correlation) exceeded the 97.5th percentile or was below the 2.5th percentile (for reverse sequences) of the shuffled distributions; and its goodness-of-fit (<italic>R<sub>max</sub></italic>) was higher than the 95th percentile of their shuffles. We considered the significant trajectory type as the decoded trajectory, and if more than one trajectory type were significant, the trajectory with the highest sequence score was considered as the decoded trajectory. For plotting purposes only, a moving window (30 ms, advanced in steps of 5 ms) was used for displaying theta sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>For synchronous CA1 and PFC theta sequences, we examined if their representations were coherent or independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J-L</xref>).

Given that <italic>p</italic>(<italic>Seq<sub>PFC</sub></italic> = actual) and <italic>p</italic>(<italic>Seq<sub>PFC</sub></italic> = alternative) are significantly different from the chance level (50%; p’s &lt; 1e-4, signed-rank tests compared to 50%), stochastic independence would predict that the distributions of sequences coherently representing actual and alternative (i.e., <italic>p</italic>(<italic>Seq<sub>PFC</sub></italic> = actual| <italic>Seq<sub>CA1 </sub></italic>= actual) and <italic>p</italic>(<italic>Seq<sub>PFC</sub></italic> = alternative | <italic>Seq<sub>CA1 </sub></italic>= alternative)) both significantly differ from the chance level.

Briefly, candidate replay events were defined as the SWR events during which ≥ 5 place cells fired. Each candidate event was then divided into 10 ms non-overlapping bins (i.e. <italic>τ</italic> = 10 ms), and decoded based on the Bayes’ rule described above. The assessment of significance for replay events was implemented by a Monte Carlo shuffle, in which the <italic>R</italic>-squared from linear regression on the temporal bins versus the locations of the posterior probability matrix was compared to the <italic>R</italic>-squared derived from the shuffled data (i.e. time shuffle, circularly shuffling temporal bins of the posterior probability matrix). A candidate event with an <italic>R</italic>-squared that exceeded the 95th percentile of their shuffles (i.e. p&lt;0.05) was considered as a replay event.</p><p>For SWR events with significant CA1 replay sequences detected, we further measured CA1-PFC reactivation during these events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2019</xref>). We only analyzed the events where ≥ 5 place cells and ≥5 PFC cells fired. Briefly, for an event with <italic>N</italic> CA1 and <italic>M</italic> PFC cells active, a (<italic>N</italic> × <italic>M</italic>) synchronization matrix during RUN (<bold>C<sub>RUN</sub></bold>) was calculated with each element (<italic>C<sub>i,j</sub></italic>) representing the Pearson correlation coefficient of the linearized spatial firing rate maps on a certain trajectory type (see <italic>Spatial firing rate maps and linearization</italic>) of the <italic>i</italic>-th CA1 cell and the <italic>j</italic>-th PFC cell. To measure the population synchronization pattern during the SWR, the spike trains during the SWR were divided into 10 ms bins and z transformed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peyrache et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2019</xref>). The (<italic>N</italic> × <italic>M</italic>) synchronization matrix during the SWR (<bold>C<sub>SWR</sub></bold>) was then calculated with each element (<italic>C<sub>i,j</sub></italic>) representing the correlation of the spike trains of a CA1-PFC cell pair. Finally, the reactivation strength of this event for each trajectory type was measured as the correlation coefficient (<italic>R</italic>) between the population matrices, <bold>C<sub>RUN</sub></bold> and <bold>C<sub>SWR</sub></bold>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Theta-sequence prediction of behavioral choices</title><p>For theta-sequence prediction of behavioral choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H and I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), trial-by-trial classification analysis was performed using support vector machines (SVMs) through the <italic>libsvm</italic> library (version 3.12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang and Lin, 2011</xref>). For each region (CA1 or PFC), two independent SVMs were trained for before-CP and after-CP periods. For each trial, the numbers of theta sequences representing the actual versus the alternative choice during a given period (before CP, or after CP) were used as a feature (<italic>n</italic> = 2) to predict the current choice (<italic>k</italic> = 2, L or R). All classifiers were <italic>C</italic>-SVMs with a radial basis function (Gaussian) kernel and trained on correct trials. Hyperparameter (<italic>C</italic> and <italic>γ</italic>; regularization weight and radial basis function width, respectively) selection was performed using a random search method with leave-one-out cross-validation to prevent overfitting. The selected hyperparameters were then used to report the leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy. The percentage of correctly inferred trials was computed across all training/test trial combinations to give prediction accuracy. The significance of this prediction was determined by comparing to the distribution of shuffled data by randomly shuffling the trial labels (L or R), and this shuffled dataset was used to train a classifier in the same way as the actual dataset. A prediction accuracy based on the actual dataset that was higher than the 95th percentile of its shuffles (p &lt; 0.05) was considered as significant. Only trials with at least one theta sequence for actual and alternative choices were used for prediction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>CA1-PFC reactivation prediction of correct and incorrect responses</title><p>For prediction of correct and incorrect responses with CA1-PFC reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), SVMs were used similar to the theta-sequence prediction analysis (see above). Two independent SVMs were trained on forward and reverse replay events. For each trial, the averaged CA1-PFC reactivation strength for the actual versus the alternative trajectory across all reactivation events during immobility at the reward well <italic>prior</italic> to the trial was used as a feature (<italic>n</italic> = 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>) to predict correct versus incorrect responses (<italic>k</italic> = 2, correct or incorrect, regardless of which side arm that the animals choose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Singer et al., 2013</xref>). The significance of this prediction was determined by comparing it to the distribution of shuffled data by randomly shuffling the trial labels (correct or incorrect), and this shuffled dataset was used to train a classifier in the same way as the actual dataset. Given the unbalanced nature of the dataset (a lot more correct trials than incorrect trials), we resampled the incorrect trials (with replacement) to match the correct trials and used ROC analysis to measure the predictive power of the classifiers. The area under each ROC curve (AUC) was computed, and an AUC based on the actual dataset that was higher than the 95th percentile of its shuffles (p &lt; 0.05) was considered as significant. Only trials with at least one reactivation event of the given type (forward or reverse) were used for prediction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed using custom routines in MATLAB (MathWorks) and GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software). We used nonparametric and two-tailed tests for statistical comparisons throughout the paper, unless otherwise noted. We used Kruskal-Wallis or Friedman test for multiple comparisons, with post hoc analysis performed using a Dunn’s test. p&lt;0.05 was considered the cutoff for statistical significance. Unless otherwise noted, values and error bars in the text denote means ± SEMs. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those generally

cells, sharp wave-ripples, and theta rhythms, as well as those interested in the functional significance of hippocampal-medial prefrontal cortex networks. This paper involves recordings of large neuronal ensembles in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex in animals performing a hippocampal-dependent spatial working memory task. The paper provides a number of descriptions, at different timescales and with different analyses, of how neural activity in the rat hippocampus and prefrontal cortex relates to behavioral performance of a memory task.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Multiple time-scales of decision making in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Reviewers agreed that this is a strong submission with beautiful data and figures, as well as analyses that are appropriate and solid. However, they felt that there was a lack of clarity regarding the paper's major conclusions and how some of the analyses led to those conclusions. Reviewers are confident that the authors will be able to address these concerns. No new data are required to support the conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors (required)):</italic></p><p>1) To avoid confusion, the authors should perhaps reconsider using the phrase &quot;population spikes&quot; here. This phrase often has a different meaning in neurophysiology from what is meant here.</p><p>2) To improve readability, the authors may want to consider not using the needless, non-standard abbreviation CP for choice point.</p><p>3) In the figures, perhaps a different color than blue could be used for the left arm to improve clarity and readability. The color blue indicates outbound in some figures/panels and left arm trajectory in other figures/panels.</p><p>4) I am confused by the broken y-axis in Figure 1B. Why is the axis disrupted with 0.4 written twice?</p><p>5) The distance index in Figure 3C-D is not described in the Materials and methods section. The description in the figure legend is confusing. The description states that it compares posterior probabilities for future versus past locations, making it sound as though this means future and past relative to the present location of the animal. However, the figure legend also refers to theta phases, making it sound as though this measure was calculated based on theta phases of spikes. How exactly was this measure computed?</p><p>6) The claim &quot;Note the robust difference of CA1-PFC reactivation of taken versus not-taken path during correct trials compared to that during incorrect trials&quot; is not well supported because no interaction effect is reported (i.e., interaction showing that CA1-PFC reactivation strength for same vs. alternative paths was significantly different for correct vs. incorrect trials). It seems as if only multiple paired t-tests were used here. Also, the data for correct and incorrect trials are plotted on different y-axis scales for panels A and B in Figure 7—figure supplement 2, making comparisons of effects difficult.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors (required)):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Tang and colleagues extend previous work on medial prefrontal-hippocampal interactions in several important ways. In rats performing a well-validated spatial working memory task, they demonstrate the existence of theta sequences in PFC ensembles that mirror the organizational properties of theta sequences in hippocampus (albeit with less reliability than the canonical spatial representations in hippocampus). They show further that PFC theta sequences are coordinated with theta sequence representations in hippocampus; specifically, when hippocampus represents the animal's impending choice destination in a theta cycle, there is an increased likelihood that the simultaneous PFC representation shows the same representation. Finally, the authors show that the content of these fast timescale &quot;cognitive&quot; representations in theta cycles is dissociable from slower &quot;behavioral timescale&quot; representations. Specifically, at the behavioral time scale so called &quot;splitter cells&quot; provide sufficient information to decode impending choice from either hippocampus or PFC. In contrast, fast time scale representations diverged between the two structures before the animal committed to one choice option, with PFC representing the animals upcoming choice and hippocampus representing both possible choice options. This dissociation, however, was dynamically modulated, because after animals committed to a decision, both structure represented the chosen outcome.</p><p>I think this manuscript is a potentially important contribution to our understanding of PFC-hippocampal dynamics. First, the identification of clear theta sequences in PFC is, on its own, an important result that is complementary to a recent report showing reactivation of spatially-tuned PFC cells that is highly reminiscent of reactivation of place cells in hippocampus (Kaefer...Csicsvari, 2020). In addition, however, the authors probe the coordination of prefrontal and hippocampal theta sequences, and find that there is an apparent relationship that is dynamically modulated by the behavioral demands of the decision making task. Together, I think the body of work reported here is an important contribution to our understanding of how these structures work together.</p><p>The analysis is described clearly and with excellent detail, and appears rigorous and appropriate to the authors' questions. This is an incredibly information-rich manuscript, but it is well organized and well explained throughout. Overall, I think this is a strong contribution, and I have only very minor suggestions to improve it.</p><p>At several points the authors mention that results in the present manuscript replicated their previous report (Shin et al 2019). This is important, but is somewhat tempered by the fact that 6/9 rats were reanalyzed from that 2019 data set.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors (required)):</italic></p><p>This is an unusual paper in that it covers a large amount of ground, with 4-5 main claims that each individually have been (or could be) the subject of entire papers. In its attempt to integrate each of these findings into an overall theory, the paper reads a bit like a hybrid between a review and an empirical paper. One the one hand, this is a strength because it aspires to much-needed synthesis; on the other hand, I found it difficult to identify which statements are the primary empirical claims advanced in the paper, and which statements are interpretations. Moreover, for those statements that looked like main claims, I am not convinced that as presented, there is sufficient support. Thus, overall, I think the paper requires (a) more explicit statements about what the key primary claims are, and (b) additional analyses to better support those claims and/or better separation of result and interpretation.</p><p>To expand on the above: as far as I can tell, the main novel claims seem to be:</p><p>1) the prefrontal cortex (PFC) expresses theta sequences</p><p>2) theta sequences in both the hippocampus (HC) and PFC are trajectory-specific (&quot;splitter sequences&quot;)</p><p>3) PFC, but not HC, theta sequence content predicts future choice</p><p>4) joint HC-PFC activity during replay predicts error vs. correct trials</p><p>Based on these findings, the authors conclude that interaction at multiple timescales between HC and PFC supports memory-guided decision-making.</p><p>If adequately supported, each of these claims would be a useful addition to the field, with the dissociation between HC and PFC theta sequences of particular interest. However, as currently presented, the claims seem out of step with the underlying evidence; in each case, this overall issue could be addressed by bolstering the analyses and/or by making the claims more precise or toned down.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>Claim 1: What counts as a &quot;theta sequence&quot; requires clarification. Do the authors consider the ensemble pattern generated from independently phase precessing cells a theta sequence? If yes, then the claim that mPFC has theta sequences follows directly from previous single cell results (Jones and Wilson, 2005 PLoS Biology; Zielinski et al., 2019 J Neurosci) and they should acknowledge this. If no, they need provide a clear definition and associated analysis criterion of what constitutes a theta sequence, perhaps using a peer prediction analysis along the lines of Harris et al. 2003 Nature; Foster and Wilson, 2007 Hippocampus; Chadwick et al., 2015 eLife. Judging by the authors' comments, it seems they are aware of this issue and don't in fact think that their results can be explained by independently phase precessing cells, but if this one of their central claims then a clear definition and associated analysis should be provided up front as well as throughout the relevant sections.</p><p>Claim 2: The authors need to be explicit about what, if any, claim they are making about theta sequences being trajectory-specific. If the claim is that HC theta sequences represent alternative futures before making a choice, i.e. recruiting cells representing positions after the choice point, this has been shown previously (Johnson and Redish, 2007 J Neurosci; Kay et al., 2020 Cell). If, on the other hand, the claim is that based on tuning curves prior to the choice point only, i.e. HC and/or PFC theta sequences are trajectory-specific (&quot;splitter sequences&quot;) this would be novel, but requires analyses to determine whether the observed sequences are more split than would be expected from a resampled distribution.</p><p>Claim 3: This is potentially the most interesting finding, but as currently presented I found it confusing: isn't there an inconsistency between on the one hand, the claim that behavioral-timescale activity supports choice prediction based on pre-choice point (CP) activity in HC (Figure 1H), and on the other, the result that HC pre-CP theta sequences cannot predict choice (Figure 6H)? Is this because the decoding followed by binary classification (as L or R) of theta sequences ignores firing rate differences that could be used to decode future choice? Or is this because the theta sequence analysis throws out some part of the data that is included in the behavioral-timescale analysis? The concern is that if it is the former, a different classifier that uses firing rates would lead to a quite different result; if it is the latter, it seems the current result could be quite sensitive to arbitrary decisions of what data to include. The authors should discuss, and perhaps perform additional analyses, to explain the apparent inconsistency (see minor comments below for suggestions).</p><p>Claim 4: By itself, the current analyses of the HC/PFC interaction during SWR periods does not seem enough to conclude that there is something important about the interaction unless the authors also test how predictable performance is from HC and PFC content alone (perhaps with a GLM that could determine how much the prediction is improved by adding their measure of HC-PFC coordination). Also, how does this relate to the Shin et al. Neuron 2019 paper showing that CA1-PFC coordination could distinguish between replay of chosen and non-chosen path: is this just a restatement of that same result?</p><p>Regarding the overall interpretation that HC and PFC interact during memory guided decision making: wouldn't that require that HC and PFC theta sequences should be related? In fact, because PFC but not HC theta sequences predict upcoming choice, would that not be equally or more consistent with these structures not interacting? The analysis in Figure 6L could potentially speak to this point, but without additional analysis it is not clear to me if the reported result isn't just a consequence of PFC but not CA1 sequences being predictive of upcoming choice. Without a more direct demonstration of theta sequence coordination and a relationship to choice, the evidence for interaction seems to be mostly based on the SWR analysis, which as pointed out above needs to be more thorough in order to support an interaction.</p><p>– Different criteria for selecting splitter cells are used in HC and PFC, why not use the same criteria for both?</p><p>– Goal vs trajectory representation: &quot;maintained representations of current goals&quot;; &quot;modulated by journeys and goals&quot; - the authors should avoid making claims about goal representation: unless the authors analyze error trials, goal representation is confounded with memory of the previous trial. In addition, splitter cells seem to be better described as representing trajectories rather than goals (Grieves et al., eLife 2016).</p><p>– The replay results are given relatively high importance in the discussion and feature in the abstract, but are only presented in a supplementary figure; its relative prominence across sections should be made more consistent.</p><p>– &quot;In this delayed alternation task, animals had to traverse a delay section ...&quot; please clarify if an actual delay was enforced (i.e. keeping the animal confined to the central stem for some specified time) or if the task was self-paced. This is important because adding delays to continuous alternation tasks is known to make the tasks hippocampus-dependent (e.g. Ainge et al. Hippocampus 2007).</p><p>– Figure 1D: if the goal is to show a splitter cell, the authors should show an example where the signal splits in the stem, not around the choice point (where we know behavior is likely to differ)</p><p>– &quot;approximately 50% of all theta sequences in both CA1 and PFC met these additional stringent criteria&quot;: please explain why the Figure 2—figure supplement 1 - panel D shows a different number (around 10%)?</p><p>– The authors should cite and discuss Stout and Griffin 2020 Frontiers Behavioral Neuroscience and Kinsky et al., 2020 Nature Communications as some of their findings are similar to those reported here.</p><p>– &quot;both theta-associated mechanisms at the two timescales&quot; - isn't there just one timescale for theta-associated mechanisms, i.e. theta sequences?</p><p>– &quot;we have previously shown a relationship between forward and reverse CA1-PFC replay with past and future trajectories respectively (Shin et al., 2019).&quot; It seems that in the cited paper forward replay was associated with future trajectories while reverse replay was associated with past ones, while the text implies the reverse - shouldn't it be &quot;with future and past trajectories respectively&quot;?</p><p>– &quot;resampled the incorrect trials with replacement to match the correct trials&quot; - shouldn't it be the reverse (downsampling correct trials?)</p><p>– &quot;spatial fields&quot; or &quot;place fields&quot; are generally used to refer to specific regions of high firing of a place cell (O'Keefe, 1976). Instead it seems that what the authors mean here is &quot;rate maps&quot;, i.e., representations of firing rate as a function of space including all activity of the cell. Indeed, no criteria for place field detection are indicated in this paragraph. The authors could replace &quot;spatial fields&quot; by rate maps when appropriate and only use spatial fields or place fields when considering the actual place fields to avoid any confusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66227.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Reviewers agreed that this is a strong submission with beautiful data and figures, as well as analyses that are appropriate and solid.

The distance index of the 1<sup>st</sup> half of theta phases is thus measured by comparing the probabilities in the quadrants ahead (quadrant III, future) and behind (quadrant II, past) as (III – II)/ (III + II).

It seems as if only multiple paired t-tests were used here. Also, the data for correct and incorrect trials are plotted on different y-axis scales for panels A and B in Figure 7—figure supplement 2, making comparisons of effects difficult.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. As per the suggestion, we have now removed the claim “Note the robust difference of CA1-PFC reactivation of taken versus not-taken path during correct trials compared to that during incorrect trials”. We have also changed the y-axis scale for panel A as the same for panel B in Figure 7—figure supplement 2.</p><p>The claim of “robust difference” for correct trial compared to incorrect trials referred to lower and significant <italic>p</italic>-values observed for correct trials compared to incorrect trials (correct trials: <italic>p</italic> = 0.0016 and 0.0037 for forward and reverse events, respectively; incorrect trials: <italic>p</italic> = 0.56 and 0.024 for forward and reverse events, respectively; Figure 7—figure supplement 2A-B). These <italic>p</italic>-values were derived from paired tests on a replay event-by-event basis. The rationale for the paired test here is that the strength of a replay event is affected by the number of active neurons and different aspects of selectivity of these neurons during the event. Since replay events during correct versus incorrect trials are two different sample sets, multiple paired tests and interaction effects between correct versus incorrect trials were thus not used.</p><p>To assess the trial-by-trial difference of replay strengths for correct and incorrect conditions, which may not be detectable and/or suitable using multiple paired tests, as the reviewer also noted, we therefore used SVM classifiers to examine whether the replay strengths have predictive power for correct and incorrect responses on a trial-by-trial basis. Indeed, significant differences between correct and incorrect trials are seen using this method, and we now report this result in the main figure (Figure 7F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors (required)):</p><p>In this manuscript, Tang and colleagues extend previous work on medial prefrontal-hippocampal interactions in several important ways. In rats performing a well-validated spatial working memory task, they demonstrate the existence of theta sequences in PFC ensembles that mirror the organizational properties of theta sequences in hippocampus (albeit with less reliability than the canonical spatial representations in hippocampus). They show further that PFC theta sequences are coordinated with theta sequence representations in hippocampus; specifically, when hippocampus represents the animal's impending choice destination in a theta cycle, there is an increased likelihood that the simultaneous PFC representation shows the same representation. Finally, the authors show that the content of these fast timescale &quot;cognitive&quot; representations in theta cycles is dissociable from slower &quot;behavioral timescale&quot; representations. Specifically, at the behavioral time scale so called &quot;splitter cells&quot; provide sufficient information to decode impending choice from either hippocampus or PFC. In contrast, fast time scale representations diverged between the two structures before the animal committed to one choice option, with PFC representing the animals upcoming choice and hippocampus representing both possible choice options. This dissociation, however, was dynamically modulated, because after animals committed to a decision, both structure represented the chosen outcome.</p><p>I think this manuscript is a potentially important contribution to our understanding of PFC-hippocampal dynamics. First, the identification of clear theta sequences in PFC is, on its own, an important result that is complementary to a recent report showing reactivation of spatially-tuned PFC cells that is highly reminiscent of reactivation of place cells in hippocampus (Kaefer...Csicsvari, 2020). In addition, however, the authors probe the coordination of prefrontal and hippocampal theta sequences, and find that there is an apparent relationship that is dynamically modulated by the behavioral demands of the decision making task. Together, I think the body of work reported here is an important contribution to our understanding of how these structures work together.</p><p>The analysis is described clearly and with excellent detail, and appears rigorous and appropriate to the authors' questions. This is an incredibly information-rich manuscript, but it is well organized and well explained throughout. Overall, I think this is a strong contribution, and I have only very minor suggestions to improve it.</p><p>At several points the authors mention that results in the present manuscript replicated their previous report (Shin et al 2019). This is important, but is somewhat tempered by the fact that 6/9 rats were reanalyzed from that 2019 data set.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have reworded ‘replicate’ to state ‘we have previously shown/ reported’, or that the results were consistent with our previous reports. This was especially relevant for the CA1-PFC reactivation results originally reported in Figure 7—figure supplement 2. Here, we would also like to note that the trial-by-trial prediction of correct and incorrect responses based on replay events (originally reported in Figure 7—figure supplement 2E-F) was a new result which was not achieved in Shin et al. 2019, and therefore not just a simple replication of our previous finding. Given the novelty and importance of the replay prediction result, especially in the context of lack of error prediction by theta sequences, we have now elevated this result to the main figure (Figures 7E and 7F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors (required)):</p><p>This is an unusual paper in that it covers a large amount of ground, with 4-5 main claims that each individually have been (or could be) the subject of entire papers.

Further, we would like to argue that it is a significant strength of the manuscript that by presenting these findings in context of hippocampal phenomena, we are able to integrate both hippocampal and prefrontal results for behavioral sequences, theta sequences and replay sequences in a unified framework for memory-guided decision making. While we are aware of the extensive work on hippocampal sequences which is cited in the manuscript, there have been only very few studies investigating the relationship between these different sequences, even just in the hippocampus (e.g., Papale et al., 2016; Drieu et al., 2018), which is a major goal in the field (Pezzulo et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 2017). In the current study, we therefore present the new prefrontal results in the context of hippocampal sequences, and also build upon our previous replay results (Shin et al., 2019) to contrast the roles of the three types of sequences in memory-guided decision making. We hope the reviewer will share our vision and appreciate the strength of these findings.</p><p>We have now provided explicit statements and an updated focus on these primary advances of our current study in the Discussion section:</p><p>“In this work, we discovered theta sequences, theta cycle skipping and theta-sequence prediction of behavioral choices in PFC. These prefrontal phenomena follow a succession of results on hippocampal sequences, but our study points to different yet complementary roles of prefrontal and hippocampal sequences at multiple timescales. By dissecting fast cognitive-timescale sequences from slow behavioral-timescale sequences in a spatial working-memory and navigation task, these findings thus provide a unified framework that integrates hippocampal and prefrontal mechanisms of multi-timescale cell-assembly dynamics for memory-guided decision making.”</p><p>We have also followed the reviewer’s suggestions and provided additional evidence with new analyses and explanations to support our main novel conclusions. In overview, (1) we have now provided evidence that theta sequences in CA1 and PFC observed here, as ensemble-level phenomena, cannot be fully accounted for by single-neuronal phase precession, and thus the observation of the PFC theta sequences is a genuine and novel finding of the present work; (2) we have further clarified that our finding of “trajectory-specific” CA1 and PFC theta sequences is an important extension of the previously observed choice coding of theta sequences in the hippocampus; (3) we have demonstrated that the difference between behavioral- and theta-sequence coding of choices in CA1 and PFC is not a result of the methodological concerns suggested; (4) we have made changes in the presentation of the replay results, and added more explicit interpretation of the theta-sequence coordination result to enhance clarity.

This relationship, however, hasn’t been studied before in PFC and is thus of interest. To address this issue, we used the phase-jitter analysis from Foster and Wilson <italic>Hippocampus</italic> 2007. In brief, for any given cell at any given position, there is a range of theta phases at which the cell will fire. Therefore, within each candidate theta sequence event, for each spike, we randomly chose a phase from the distribution of possible phases, and shifted the spike time accordingly. The correlation between cell and time for each event was thus altered by the phase jittering (Foster and Wilson, <italic>Hippocampus</italic>, 2007). “If this (phase-position) relationship alone determines the occurrence of theta sequences, it should be possible to choose randomly from any of the phases available for a given cell and given position, and then observe theta sequences to <italic>the same degree</italic>” (Foster and Wilson, <italic>Hippocampus</italic>, 2007).</p><p>The response figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>) shows the distribution of correlations across 100 phase-jitter shuffles of all events (gray lines), compared with the distribution of correlations of original events (black and orange lines for PFC and CA1, respectively). Although the difference is more apparent for CA1 than PFC, correlations for actual events were significantly greater than those for shuffles in both regions (p(CA1) = 3.72e-96, and p(PFC) = 1.28e-39 for outbound; p(CA1) = 2.39e-132, and p(PFC) = 4.29e-59 for inbound; KS tests).</p><p>We have now included this result in a new figure supplement (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), and added the following description into the Results section:</p><p>“To test whether theta phase precession can account for the occurrence of theta sequences, we performed a phase-jitter analysis (Foster and Wilson, 2007), in which we randomly chose a phase of each spike from the distribution of possible phases of that cell in the position bin and shift the spike time accordingly for each candidate event. We found that sequence scores of actual events were significantly greater than those of shuffles in both CA1 and PFC (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), and thus theta phase precession does not account for the full extent of observed theta sequences in CA1 and PFC.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Claim 2: The authors need to be explicit about what, if any, claim they are making about theta sequences being trajectory-specific. If the claim is that HC theta sequences represent alternative futures before making a choice, i.e. recruiting cells representing positions after the choice point, this has been shown previously (Johnson and Redish, 2007 J Neurosci; Kay et al., 2020 Cell). If, on the other hand, the claim is that based on tuning curves prior to the choice point only, i.e. HC and/or PFC theta sequences are trajectory-specific (&quot;splitter sequences&quot;) this would be novel, but requires analyses to determine whether the observed sequences are more split than would be expected from a resampled distribution.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify the trajectory-specific theta sequences.

On the other hand, for the theta sequences that swept beyond the choice point, the tuning curves after the choice point (or non-splitter) also contributed, similar to previous findings (Johnson and Redish, <italic>JNeurosci</italic>, 2007; Kay et al., <italic>Cell</italic>, 2020). Therefore, as the reviewer correctly pointed out, our findings extend these previous findings to show trajectory-specific theta sequences in CA1 and PFC. While previous reports show that splitter cells encode distinct trajectories at the behavioral timescale (e.g., Frank et al., 2000; Wood et al., 2000; Ito et al., 2015), our finding suggest that splitter information can also be utilized at fast theta timescales. However, we would like to note that, a recent study (Kay et al., <italic>Cell</italic>, 2020) has investigated the relationship between CA1 splitter cells and theta-timescale activity, and suggested that a splitter cell’s “firing on the non-preferred path is consistent with representation of a possible future, or hypothetical, location” at the theta timescale, although the decoding of theta sequences using splitter templates was not directly tested, which we have studied here. This previous study had also established theta-timescale representation of real and hypothetical heading directions in the hippocampus, which is similar to our trajectory-specific theta sequences in principle.</p><p>To determine whether the observed sequences are significantly more split for different choices, the observation of each sequence was tested against two resampled distributions, in which the trajectory coding information (i.e., spatial shuffling) and cell identities (i.e., cell ID shuffling) were randomly shuffled. This method is also similar to that used in previous studies to determine whether the observed theta sequences are significantly more split for different heading directions (e.g., Wang et al., <italic>Science</italic>, 2020; Kay et al., <italic>Cell</italic>, 2020).</p><p>We now discuss this point more thoroughly in the manuscript. Specifically, we have included the following in the Discussion section:</p><p>“These findings build on previous results that demonstrated theta-timescale activity patterns in the hippocampus representing future locations by recruiting cells encoding positions after the choice point (i.e., non-splitters; Johnson and Redish, 2007; Kay et al., 2020; Papale et al., 2016), and show that trajectory-specific coding of splitter cells at the behavioral timescale is preserved in fast theta sequences for representing future choices prior to the choice point as well.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Claim 3: This is potentially the most interesting finding, but as currently presented I found it confusing: isn't there an inconsistency between on the one hand, the claim that behavioral-timescale activity supports choice prediction based on pre-choice point (CP) activity in HC (Figure 1H), and on the other, the result that HC pre-CP theta sequences cannot predict choice (Figure 6H)? Is this because the decoding followed by binary classification (as L or R) of theta sequences ignores firing rate differences that could be used to decode future choice? Or is this because the theta sequence analysis throws out some part of the data that is included in the behavioral-timescale analysis? The concern is that if it is the former, a different classifier that uses firing rates would lead to a quite different result; if it is the latter, it seems the current result could be quite sensitive to arbitrary decisions of what data to include. The authors should discuss, and perhaps perform additional analyses, to explain the apparent inconsistency (see minor comments below for suggestions).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The reviewer raised the concern that the difference between behavioral versus theta sequences that we found in HC could potentially be accounted for by the fact that we used different decoders for theta versus behavioral sequences, of which theta-sequence decoder ignored firing rate differences, but only used the sequential structure. First of all, we would like to note that our results of hippocampal behavioral and theta sequences confirm previous reports that HC theta sequences on the center stem that sweep beyond the choice point serially encode alternatives (see also responses to Comment 2; e.g., Johnson and Redish, 2007; Kay et al., 2020), and HC trajectory-dependent activity at the behavioral timescale consistently represents upcoming choice on the center stem (e.g., Takahashi, <italic>eLife</italic>, 2013; Ito et al., 2015). Furthermore, we would like to point out that it is not surprising that decoding of the same data at different timescales can reveal different information (e.g., Kayser et al., <italic>Neuron</italic>, 2009; Huxter et al., <italic>Nature</italic>, 2003; Rich and Wallis, 2016; Zheng et al., 2020). To directly address this concern, we have now performed a decoding analysis for behavioral sequences that is identical to theta sequence decoding. This result shows that the difference of behavioral versus theta sequences was not a simple result of different decoders used.</p><p>First, the reviewer is correct in pointing out that the Bayesian decoders for behavioral-timescale activity and theta sequences are indeed not identical. For behavioral-timescale activity, we used a bin-by-bin decoding that takes “firing rate differences” into account: for a behavioral sequence before the choice point that can be divided into <italic>N</italic> behavioral-timescale bins (bin = 120 ms), of each time bin <italic>i</italic> (<italic>i</italic> ∈[1, <italic>N</italic>]), the location (<italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic>) and choice (i.e., trajectory type, <italic>tr<sub>i</sub></italic>) with the maximum decoded probability (i.e., max(p(<italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic>,<italic>tr<sub>i</sub></italic>|<bold>spikes</bold>))) was compared to the actual position and choice of the animal in that bin. On the other hand, for a theta sequence that can be divided into <italic>N</italic> theta-timescale bins (<italic>S</italic> = [<italic>s<sub>1</sub></italic>, <italic>s<sub>2</sub></italic>, …, <italic>s<sub>N</sub></italic>], <italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic> is the firing pattern in the <italic>i</italic>-th bin; bin = 20 ms), the posterior probability matrix <bold>Pmat</bold> (<italic>p</italic>(<italic>X</italic>,<italic>Tr</italic>|<bold>spikes</bold>), <italic>X</italic> = [<italic>x<sub>1</sub></italic>, <italic>x<sub>2</sub></italic>, …, <italic>x<sub>N</sub></italic>]) was used to compute a trajectory score for each trajectory type (i.e., <italic>Tr</italic>, <italic>Tr</italic> ∈{<italic>L</italic>, <italic>R</italic>}; see Materials and methods), and compare with its shuffled distributions, with the significant trajectory type that has the highest sequence score as the decoded trajectory. Therefore, this decoder emphasized the sequential structure of a theta-sequence event, instead of just firing rate differences between the two trajectory types. We would like to note that we used the bin-by-bin decoder of behavioral sequences to compare the decoding accuracy with previously reported results of behavioral sequences (e.g., Ito et al., <italic>Nature</italic>, 2015; Takahashi, <italic>eLife</italic>, 2013; Harvey et al., <italic>Nature</italic>, 2012). For theta sequences, however, a “sequential” decoder was often employed (Feng et al., <italic>JNeurosci</italic>, 2015; Wang et al, <italic>Science</italic>, 2020; Zheng et al., <italic>Neuron</italic>, 2015).</p><p>However, we understand the reviewer’s concern about the differences of the decoders. There are two ways to make these two decoders identical: using a bin-by-bin decoder of maximum decoded probability for theta-timescale activity; and using a sequential decoder for behavioral sequences.</p><p>For the first approach, previous studies have used a bin-by-bin decoder for theta-timescale activity, just as the behavioral-sequence decoder, and found similar results that hippocampal theta-timescale activity can serially represent actual and alternative choices (Johnson and Redish, 2007; Papale et al., 2016).</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Behavioral-sequence representations of choices in CA1 and PFC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Single-event examples of (<bold>A</bold>) CA1 and (<bold>B</bold>) PFC behavioral sequences simultaneously recorded during a C-to-R outbound trial.

The choice representation of each behavioral sequence was determined by a sequential decoder, similar to that for theta sequences.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66227-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>On the other hand, given that we focused on the “sequential” structure of ensemble activity in this study, we have now used a sequential decoder for behavioral sequences, just as the theta-sequence decoder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). To do so, we took &quot;an event&quot; of behavioral sequences, as the firing pattern during a single trial (trajectory) on the center stem, and used it as an input to the Bayesian decoder with spatial shuffling, just as used in theta-sequence decoding, but with time window of 400 ms (instead of 20 ms for theta sequences). Unlike CA1 theta sequences that serially encode actual and alternative choices, CA1 behavioral sequences preferentially encode the actual choice. Therefore, this result is consistent with the one found by the bin-by-bin decoder (Figure 1), suggesting that the difference between behavioral versus theta sequences cannot simply be accounted for by the choice of the decoders. Note that the more robust representations here, compared to bin-by-bin decoding shown in Figure 1, are expected, because this measure took the whole sequence structure (i.e., <italic>S</italic> = [<italic>s<sub>1</sub></italic>, <italic>s<sub>2</sub></italic>, …, <italic>s<sub>N</sub></italic>]) into account, which is less noisy than using the information within a single bin only (i.e., <italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic>). Also, we note that these results are consistent with previous findings that splitters cells show not only rate remapping (firing rate difference) but also global remapping (firing position difference) on different trajectory types (e.g., Wood et al., 2000; Frank et al., 2000; Fujisawa et al., 2008; examples in panels <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold> of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the latter concern, i.e. whether the observed difference between behavioral and theta sequences is because that the theta sequence analysis throws out some part of the data that is included in the behavioral-timescale analysis, first, we show above that using the same classifier for the distinct timescale sequences still yields the same result. Further, as noted above, it is not surprising that decoding of the same data at different timescales can reveal different information (e.g., Kayser et al., <italic>Neuron</italic>, 2009; Huxter et al., <italic>Nature</italic>, 2003; Rich and Wallis, 2016; Kay et al., 2020, Zheng et al., 2020). We also want to note that the proportion of significant theta sequences included in this analysis was determined by the Bayesian decoder with shuffling procedures, with numbers consistent with many previous reports of theta sequences in the hippocampus (Gupta et al., 2012; Drieu et al., 2018; Schmidt et al., 2019), and we did NOT make any arbitrary decisions of what data to include. Finally, we also show that applying additional criteria for significance to the Bayesian decoder, which changed the number of theta sequences used, also revealed the same result (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A, left), arguing against the possibility of sensitivity to data used.</p><p>To avoid potential confusion, we have now underscored the different window sizes for decoding in the Results section:</p><p>(for behavioral sequences) “To directly assess the cell-assembly representation of the animals’ choices, we used a memoryless Bayesian decoding algorithm (see Materials and methods; decoding bin = 120 ms) (Shin et al., 2019).”</p><p>and:</p><p>(for theta sequences) “In order to statistically identify theta sequences in CA1 and PFC, the firing pattern within each candidate hippocampal theta cycle (≥ 5 cells active in a given brain region) during active running were analyzed using the Bayesian decoding approach (decoding bin = 20 ms),…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Claim 4: By itself, the current analyses of the HC/PFC interaction during SWR periods does not seem enough to conclude that there is something important about the interaction unless the authors also test how predictable performance is from HC and PFC content alone (perhaps with a GLM that could determine how much the prediction is improved by adding their measure of HC-PFC coordination). Also, how does this relate to the Shin et al. Neuron 2019 paper showing that CA1-PFC coordination could distinguish between replay of chosen and non-chosen path: is this just a restatement of that same result?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern. We have investigated hippocampal-prefrontal interactions during SWRs in detail elsewhere in several previous studies (Jadhav et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2017; Shin et al. 2019). In one of these studies (Jadhav et al., 2016), we have used GLMs to predict SWR-related spiking of PFC neurons from the activity of the simultaneously recorded CA1 ensembles, and “these findings demonstrate that there is close coordination between CA1 and PFC activity during SWRs”. Consistent results have been shown by several other subsequent studies (e.g., Wang and Ikemoto, <italic>JNeurosci</italic>, 2016; Yu et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2017).</p><p>For the replay result shown here, it is indeed consistent with our previous finding that CA1-PFC coordination could distinguish between replay of chosen and non-chosen paths (Shin et al., 2019), as the reviewer noted. Here, with additional data, we perform a trial-by-trial prediction of correct and incorrect responses based on replay events (Figure 7—figure supplement 2E-F in the previous version; now elevated to Figure 7F in the revised version), which is a new result and was not achieved in Shin et al. 2019. Finally, given the lack of error prediction by theta and behavioral sequences, the result of replay prediction thus provides further insights into the mechanisms underlying accuracy of memory-guided decision making. Together, these findings offer a consolidated view of multi-timescale sequences in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the overall interpretation that HC and PFC interact during memory guided decision making: wouldn't that require that HC and PFC theta sequences should be related? In fact, because PFC but not HC theta sequences predict upcoming choice, would that not be equally or more consistent with these structures not interacting? The analysis in Figure 6L could potentially speak to this point, but without additional analysis it is not clear to me if the reported result isn't just a consequence of PFC but not CA1 sequences being predictive of upcoming choice. Without a more direct demonstration of theta sequence coordination and a relationship to choice, the evidence for interaction seems to be mostly based on the SWR analysis, which as pointed out above needs to be more thorough in order to support an interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that PFC theta sequences preferentially encode the actual choice, and PFC but not hippocampal theta sequences predict upcoming choice. It is common that two (even directly) interacting brain regions can encode different task information, which by itself cannot reveal whether these structures are interacting or not. For the CA1-PFC coordination in Figure 6L, we argue that this result cannot be simply accounted for by the fact that the majority of PFC theta sequences depict the actual choice, assuming independence of CA1 and PFC theta sequences. For synchronous CA1 and PFC theta sequences, if the representations of CA1 and PFC theta sequences (denoted as <italic>Seq<sub>CA1</sub></italic> and <italic>Seq<sub>PFC</sub></italic>, respectively) are stochastically independent, then <italic>p</italic>(<italic>Seq<sub>PFC</sub></italic> = actual| <italic>Seq<sub>CA1</sub> </italic>= actual) = <italic>p</italic>(<italic>Seq<sub>PFC</sub></italic> = actual| <italic>Seq<sub>CA1</sub> </italic>= alternative) = <italic>p</italic>(<italic>Seq<sub>PFC</sub></italic> = actual) = 1- <italic>p</italic>(<italic>Seq<sub>PFC</sub></italic> = alternative). Given that <italic>p</italic>(<italic>Seq<sub>PFC</sub></italic> = actual) and <italic>p</italic>(<italic>Seq<sub>PFC</sub></italic> = alternative) are significantly different from the chance level (50%; p’s &lt; 1e-4, signed-rank tests compared to 50%), stochastic independence would predict that the distributions of sequences coherently representing actual and alternative (i.e., <italic>p</italic>(<italic>Seq<sub>PFC</sub></italic> = actual| <italic>Seq<sub>CA1</sub></italic> = actual) and <italic>p</italic>(<italic>Seq<sub>PFC</sub></italic> = alternative | <italic>Seq<sub>CA1</sub> </italic>= alternative)) both significantly differ from the chance level. However, if they are dependent, different distributions for actual and alternative should be observed, which is indeed the case as shown in Figure 6L, i.e., <italic>p</italic>(<italic>Seq<sub>PFC</sub></italic> = actual| <italic>Seq<sub>CA1</sub> </italic>= actual) significantly differs from the chance level (p’s = 0.0312), but <italic>p</italic>(<italic>Seq<sub>PFC</sub></italic> = alternative | <italic>Seq</italic><sub><italic>CA1</italic></sub>= alternative) does not (p = 0.94 and 0.48 for outbound and inbound, respectively; signed-rank tests).</p><p>In addition, we would like to note that the idea of CA1-PFC interactions at the theta timescale is also supported by previous evidence showing that PFC cells phase-lock and phase-precess to hippocampal theta oscillations (Jadhav et al., 2016; Jones and Wilson, 2005a; Siapas et al., 2005; Sigurdsson et al., 2010), as well as theta-frequency synchrony and coherent spatial coding between the hippocampus and PFC (Benchenane et al., 2010; Gordon, 2011; Hasz and Redish, 2020; Jones and Wilson, 2005b; Sigurdsson et al., 2010; Zielinski et al., 2019). Furthermore, disruption of prefrontal activity results in impaired theta sequences in the hippocampus (Schmidt et al., 2019). We have discussed these studies in our manuscript.</p><p>We have now explicitly mentioned and discussed this issue in the Results section:</p><p>“Note that this result cannot be simply accounted for by the fact that the majority of PFC theta sequences depict the actual choice, assuming independence of CA1 and PFC theta sequences (see Materials and methods).”</p><p>and in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“For synchronous CA1 and PFC theta sequences, we examined if their representations were coherent or independent (Figures 6J-6L).

While the reviewer is correct that these tasks have been shown to be hippocampus independent, we would like to clarify a distinction with the W-maze alternation task. It has been shown in previous studies using lesions or optogenetic manipulations that animals are likely to accomplish such a continuous (T-maze/8-maze) spatial alternation task as a “habit” (Ainge et al., <italic>Hippocampus</italic>, 2007; Sabariego et al., <italic>Neuron</italic>, 2019), and such tasks do not depend on the hippocampus (Ainge et al., <italic>Hippocampus</italic>, 2007; Sabariego et al., <italic>Neuron</italic>, 2019), medial entorhinal cortex (Sabariego et al., <italic>Neuron</italic>, 2019), or prefrontal-hippocampal communication via nucleus reuniens (Ito et al., 2015). However, the sensitivity of the W-maze task to hippocampal and prefrontal functions is quite different from these continuous alternation tasks. It has been shown that rats with hippocampal lesions exhibited impaired learning of both inbound and outbound components of the task (Kim and Frank, 2009); disruption of SWRs can impair the learning of the outbound component of the task (Jadhav et al., 2012); contralateral hippocampal-PFC inactivation also impairs learning of the outbound component of the task (Maharjan et al., 2018). A distinguishing feature of the W-maze task is that working-memory (outbound) and reference-memory (inbound) demands are regularly interleaved between trials, and the time in the center arm and well serves as a built-in ‘‘delay’’ period (Kim and Frank, 2009), leading to the hippocampal dependence and the difference in learning this task compared to simple continuous alternation mazes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1D: if the goal is to show a splitter cell, the authors should show an example where the signal splits in the stem, not around the choice point (where we know behavior is likely to differ)</p></disp-quote><p>An example where the signal splits in the stem has been shown in Figure 1E.
