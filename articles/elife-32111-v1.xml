Here, we show a selective deficiency in mitochondrial coenzyme Q (CoQ) in insulin-resistant adipose and muscle tissue. This defect was observed in a range of in vitro insulin resistance models and adipose tissue from insulin-resistant humans and was concomitant with lower expression of mevalonate/CoQ biosynthesis pathway proteins in most models. Pharmacologic or genetic manipulations that decreased mitochondrial CoQ triggered mitochondrial oxidants and insulin resistance while CoQ supplementation in either insulin-resistant cell models or mice restored normal insulin sensitivity. Specifically, lowering of mitochondrial CoQ caused insulin resistance in adipocytes as a result of increased superoxide/hydrogen peroxide production via complex II. These data suggest that mitochondrial CoQ is a proximal driver of mitochondrial oxidants and insulin resistance, and that mechanisms that restore mitochondrial CoQ may be effective therapeutic targets for treating insulin resistance.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32111.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>After we eat, our blood sugar levels increase. To counteract this, the pancreas releases a hormone called insulin. Part of insulin’s effect is to promote the uptake of sugar from the blood into muscle and fat tissue for storage. Under certain conditions, such as obesity, this process can become defective, leading to a condition known as insulin resistance. This condition makes a number of human diseases more likely to develop, including type 2 diabetes. Working out how insulin resistance develops could therefore unveil new treatment strategies for these diseases.</p><p>Mitochondria – structures that produce most of a cell’s energy supply – appear to play a role in the development of insulin resistance. Mitochondria convert nutrients such as fats and sugars into molecules called ATP that fuel the many processes required for life. However, ATP production can also generate potentially harmful intermediates often referred to as ‘reactive oxygen species’ or ‘oxidants’. Previous studies have suggested that an increase in the amount of oxidants produced in mitochondria can cause insulin resistance.</p><p>Fazakerley et al. therefore set out to identify the reason for increased oxidants in mitochondria, and did so by analysing the levels of proteins and oxidants found in cells grown in the laboratory, and mouse and human tissue samples. This led them to find that concentrations of a molecule called coenzyme Q (CoQ), an essential component of mitochondria that helps to produce ATP, were lower in mitochondria from insulin-resistant fat and muscle tissue. Further experiments suggested a link between the lower levels of CoQ and the higher levels of oxidants in the mitochondria. Replenishing the mitochondria of the lab-grown cells and insulin-resistant mice with CoQ restored ‘normal’ oxidant levels and prevented the development of insulin resistance.</p><p>Strategies that aim to increase mitochondria CoQ levels may therefore prevent or reverse insulin resistance. Although CoQ supplements are readily available, swallowing CoQ does not efficiently deliver CoQ to mitochondria in humans, so alternative treatment methods must be found. It is also of interest that statins, common drugs taken by millions of people around the world to lower cholesterol, also lower CoQ and have been reported to increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Further research is therefore needed to investigate whether CoQ might provide the link between statins and type 2 diabetes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Insulin resistance</kwd><kwd>Mitochondria</kwd><kwd>Oxidants</kwd><kwd>Coenzyme Q</kwd><kwd>Insulin</kwd><kwd>Ubiquinone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>092255/Z/10/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fazakerley</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1052616</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stocker</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP150102408</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stocker</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1086850</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>James</surname><given-names>David E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1061122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>James</surname><given-names>David E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lower mitochondrial coenzyme Q was a consistent feature across multiple in vitro and in vivo models of insulin resistance and was sufficient to cause insulin resistance through increased mitochondrial oxidants.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insulin resistance is a major risk factor for several metabolic diseases including type two diabetes. This defect is found in all metabolic tissues most notably adipose tissue, muscle and liver. While insulin resistance in adipose and muscle tissue is likely to occur in a cell autonomous manner recent evidence suggests that liver insulin resistance may occur via a mechanism involving defects in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Perry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Titchenell et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A range of perturbations have been shown to trigger insulin resistance including diets high in fat and/or sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Samocha-Bonet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Turner et al., 2013</xref>), hyperinsulinaemia, hyperlipidaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roden et al., 1996</xref>), inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hotamisligil et al., 1994</xref>), corticosteroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Houstis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kusunoki et al., 1995</xref>). These insults may cause insulin resistance via distinct means indicating that insulin resistance maybe a heterogeneous disorder. For example, stresses such as lipotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chavez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Griffin et al., 1999</xref>), endoplasmic reticulum stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ozcan et al., 2004</xref>), mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kelley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Montgomery and Turner, 2015</xref>) and mitochondrial oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hoehn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Houstis et al., 2006</xref>) have all been reported to play a causal role in insulin resistance. However, we and others have shown that mitochondrial oxidative stress is a common feature of many in vitro insulin resistance models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoehn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Houstis et al., 2006</xref>) and metabolic tissues both from mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Paglialunga et al., 2015</xref>), and in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>). Further, many cellular stresses associated with insulin resistance such as ceramides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">García-Ruiz et al., 1997</xref>) and endoplasmic reticulum stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Malhotra and Kaufman, 2007</xref>) may also increase mitochondrial oxidant production. Despite this evidence for mitochondrial oxidants being a common feature and cause of insulin resistance the molecular mechanisms that trigger increased oxidant production in mitochondria as well as the precise source of these oxidants remain unclear.</p><p>In the present study, we have performed global analysis of the proteome and transcriptome in insulin-resistant adipose tissue from mice and humans and in a range of insulin resistance models in cultured adipocyte models including hyperinsulinaemia, inflammation, and glucocorticoids in an effort to identify changes that may contribute to mitochondrial oxidant production. The mevalonate/coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis pathway was altered in all models, and this was accompanied by a selective decrease in mitochondrial CoQ content in all models of adipocyte insulin resistance as well as in human adipose tissue and in insulin-resistant muscle from mice fed a high fat high sucrose diet. Loss of mitochondrial CoQ was both necessary and sufficient to drive complex II-dependent mitochondrial oxidant production and adipocyte insulin resistance. Our data provide evidence for decreased mitochondrial CoQ content and resultant generation of oxidants being a convergent pathway for many different models of insulin resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Insulin resistance models</title><p>To identify pathways that may contribute to insulin resistance in adipose tissue we used unbiased proteomics to specifically look for factors or pathways that: (a) change across a range of insulin-resistant models including in humans, and (b) that have a demonstrable link to mitochondrial redox homeostasis. The models studied included adipose tissue from mice fed a high fat high sucrose diet (HFHSD) for different periods of time and three in vitro models of insulin resistance (3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with chronic insulin, dexamethasone or tumour necrosis factor-α). We initially focussed on adipose tissue as our tissue of interest for two main reasons. First, adipose tissue insulin resistance is found in mice and humans that display whole body insulin resistance and insulin resistance at this site can influence whole body insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sugii et al., 2009</xref>). Second, there are highly robust in vitro adipocyte models (3T3-L1 cells) that accurately recapitulate both insulin action and the generation of insulin resistance using a range of insults that mimic perturbations implicated in insulin resistance in vivo such as hyperinsulinemia, inflammation and glucocorticoids. These models are invaluable since they provide a highly controlled system for manipulating insulin sensitivity in a cell autonomous manner.</p><p>Mice fed a HFHSD for one day were glucose intolerant and the extent of glucose intolerance plateaued by 14 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Adipose tissue insulin resistance was observed by 5 d and this degree of resistance was maintained to 42 d of HFHSD feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Skeletal muscle exhibited a comparatively delayed onset of insulin resistance consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Turner et al., 2013</xref>), but also reached a maximal observed insulin resistance by 14 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Insulin resistance in in vitro models was defined by impaired HA-GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and insulin-mediated 2-deoxyglucose (2DOG) uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Together, these models provided an ideal integrated platform with which to explore drivers of insulin resistance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32111.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Proteomic analysis of adipocyte insulin resistance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Adipose tissue <sup>3</sup>H-2-DOG uptake during a glucose tolerance test in mice fed a high fat high sucrose diet (HFHSD) for indicated times.

Thus, we next examined if the observed decrease in mitochondrial CoQ reflected changes in CoQ biosynthesis, which we measured by determining <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-CoQ<sub>9</sub> in 3T3-L1 adipocytes incubated with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-4-hydroxybenzoic acid. Consistent with pathway analysis and our intracellular measures of cholesterol content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1M–P</xref>), CoQ biosynthesis rates were lower in cells treated with dexamethasone or TNF-α but elevated in response to chronic insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1Q</xref>). Together, it appears probable that dexamethasone and TNF-α treatments lower mitochondrial CoQ largely via reduced biosynthesis, although increased CoQ in microsomal and PM subcellular fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>) in these models point to additional dysregulation of CoQ trafficking. Since these models replicate the lower content of mevalonate/CoQ biosynthesis pathway proteins measured in mice and humans, it is likely that decreased CoQ biosynthesis contributes to loss of CoQ in these more physiological systems. This does not appear to be the case for adipocytes treated with chronic insulin, where additional pathway(s) likely contribute to dysregulated mitochondrial CoQ homeostasis.</p><p>The above findings highlight loss of mitochondrial CoQ as a common feature of adipocyte insulin resistance so we next investigated if a similar phenomenon occurs in other insulin responsive tissues, most notably muscle in view of its major role in whole body glucose metabolism/insulin resistance. In muscle, we found decreased mitochondrial CoQ at 14 and 42 d HFHSD feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These time points correlate with the emergence of insulin resistance in muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In contrast to adipose tissue, total muscle CoQ was lower at all time points tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1R</xref>), potentially reflecting higher mitochondrial content of this tissue. Liver mitochondrial CoQ was unchanged in response to HFHSD feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1S</xref>), despite changes in total CoQ at 5 d HFHSD feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1T</xref>).

In addition, CoQ can regulate the formation of superoxide anion radicals from the various CoQ-interacting sites of complexes I, II and III. In this respect, excess mitochondrial CoQ above that required for maximal respiratory flux can be thought of as an ‘electron sink’. Consistent with this concept, previous studies have shown that modest loss of mitochondrial CoQ can be tolerated for electron transport activity, but at the cost of increased mitochondrial oxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Quinzii et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesised that loss of CoQ in mitochondria may contribute to increased oxidants in insulin resistance. To test this possibility, we utilised peroxiredoxin (PRDX) dimerisation as an indicator of subcellular oxidant burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perkins et al., 2015</xref>). Peroxiredoxins undergo homodimerisation as part of their mechanism to reduce hydroperoxides particularly hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>).

The majority of superoxide from succinate-driven respiration via complex II has been reported to result from reverse electron transport from CoQH<sub>2</sub> into complex I, which can be inhibited with rotenone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Quinlan et al., 2012</xref>). To test whether this may account for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generated in response to loss of CoQ we tested whether NB-responsive PRDX3 dimerisation was inhibited by rotenone. Rotenone had no effect on the PRDX3 redox state in NB-treated cells, similar to what was observed for antimycin A (a complex III inhibitor) and oligomycin (a complex V inhibitor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Further, treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with NB did not change the CoQ redox state, just as the CoQ redox state was not altered in other in vitro models of insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Since a more reduced CoQ pool is required for reverse election transport from CoQH<sub>2</sub> to complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Murphy, 2009</xref>), these data suggest that reverse electron transport was not involved in the observed increase in superoxide/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resulting from loss of mitochondrial CoQ, and that complex II itself was the likely origin the oxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Quinlan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To test whether inhibition of oxidant production from complex II using TTFA and malonate could overcome insulin resistance we assessed insulin-stimulated HA-GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 insulin-resistant adipocytes in the presence or absence of these complex II inhibitors. Treatment of control 3T3-L1 adipocytes with TTFA did not impair insulin-stimulated HA-GLUT4 translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>) or insulin-regulated inhibition of lipolysis (data not shown), suggesting that impaired complex II activity does not cause adipocyte insulin resistance per se. Both TTFA and malonate improved insulin-stimulated HA-GLUT4 translocation to the PM in all models of insulin resistance tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I–7J</xref>), albeit not to the same level as observed in control cells. Further, TTFA improved insulin-stimulated 2DOG uptake in adipose explants isolated from mice fed a HFHSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that lower mitochondrial CoQ accelerates superoxide generation, most likely from complex II, which in turn elevates the mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> burden, promotes PRDX3 dimerisation and drives insulin resistance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Mitochondrial oxidants have been reported to play an important role in the development of insulin resistance in adipose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hoehn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Houstis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Paglialunga et al., 2015</xref>) and muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hoehn et al., 2009</xref>).

Here, we provide insights into the sequence of events that lead to increased oxidant production and insulin resistance. Mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of adipose tissue from mice fed a HFHSD, insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes and adipose tissue from insulin-resistant humans, revealed down-regulation of the mevalonate/CoQ biosynthesis pathway in multiple models, and a separate targeted metabolite analysis revealed a common decrease in mitochondrial CoQ content in these models as well as in insulin-resistant muscle. Decreased mitochondrial CoQ was sufficient to cause insulin resistance via a mechanism requiring mitochondrial oxidants, while restoration of mitochondrial CoQ restored insulin sensitivity. These data suggest a novel pathway that may drive insulin resistance across a broad range of models including muscle and adipose tissue from mice and adipose tissue from obese humans. The pathway involves decreased expression of mevalonate pathway/CoQ biosynthetic enzymes, lower mitochondrial CoQ and insulin resistance as a result of oxidant production primarily from complex II.</p><p>Based on the current study, many insults implicated in insulin resistance including hyperinsulinaemia, inflammation, corticosteroids and caloric excess converge upon loss of mitochondrial CoQ as a potential cause of insulin resistance. Mechanistically, this could be explained by decreased expression of CoQ biosynthetic enzymes, and lower CoQ synthesis rates, in a majority of models studied. Related to this, our finding that mevalonate pathway inhibiting statins lowered CoQ content and caused insulin resistance in a CoQ-dependent manner may shed new light on the link between statin therapy in humans and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cederberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Preiss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sattar et al., 2010</xref>). The lack of concordance between transcript and protein expression within the mevalonate/CoQ pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) across the different insulin-resistant models suggests that there may be multiple mechanisms by which this pathway is targeted in response to different upstream insults and this maybe mediated via either transcriptional or post-translational regulation. Furthermore, our subcellular analysis of CoQ content and data from the chronic insulin model indicate that other aspects of CoQ biology that we do not yet understand may be involved in regulating mitochondrial CoQ abundance in insulin-resistant conditions. These features could include the regulation of CoQ turnover and/or its trafficking between mitochondria and other parts of the cell. Together, this supports the notion that various insults act in different ways, all decreasing mitochondrial CoQ as a common means of inducing insulin resistance.</p><p>Modest loss of CoQ has been reported to increase mitochondrial oxidants in a range of cellular systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cornelius et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duberley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Quinzii et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Quinzii et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rodríguez-Hernández et al., 2009</xref>), although the precise mechanism for this effect remains unknown. Our data are consistent with loss of mitochondrial CoQ increasing mitochondrial superoxide/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production because we observed increased superoxide in response to reduced CoQ biosynthesis using a highly specific mass-spectrometry-based assay for superoxide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–F</xref>). Our data also suggest that this superoxide is, in part, derived from the flavin site of complex II (II<sub>F</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Quinlan et al., 2012</xref>) since the complex II inhibitors TTFA and malonate lowered PRDX3 dimer/monomer status. Oxidation of succinate via complex II has been reported to generate large amounts of superoxide via reverse electron transport to complex I. However, rotenone had no effect on PRDX3 dimerisation in adipocytes treated with NB and we detected no difference in the overall CoQ redox state, suggesting that under these conditions superoxide/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> does not originate from complex I via reverse electron transfer. Unlike electron transfer from complex I to CoQ, electron transfer from flavoproteins in complex II to CoQ is not limited by the energetic constraints established by the membrane potential. This means that electrons can be transferred to CoQ whenever additional substrate is made available to these flavoproteins, provided oxidized CoQ is available to receive the electrons. In addition, although there is some evidence that complex III is a site of superoxide production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Quinlan et al., 2013</xref>), the majority of superoxide in the mitochondria is derived from flavin sites, including complex II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Quinlan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Starkov and Fiskum, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tretter et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesise that increased superoxide production from the II<sub>F</sub> site is due to increased steady-state concentrations of the flavin radical as a result of impaired electron transfer to CoQ at the binding site II<sub>Q</sub>, due to decreased CoQ. This interpretation is supported by our finding that maximal complex II activity was impaired in all models studied. Alternatively, lower CoQ may favour reverse electron transfer to complex II, and superoxide production from II<sub>F</sub>, under conditions where other enzymes (e.g. mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Orr et al., 2012</xref>]) are feeding electrons into the CoQ pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Quinlan et al., 2012</xref>). However, there are likely additional sites of superoxide production since inhibition of complex II only partially rescued PRDX3 dimerisation. Despite knowledge of increased oxidants in insulin-resistant humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boden et al., 2015</xref>) and that scavenging mitochondrial oxidants benefits insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hoehn et al., 2009</xref>), the mechanism for increased oxidants in mitochondria in insulin resistance has remained unclear. Our data address this question and place loss of mitochondrial CoQ as a common defect and cause of mitochondrial oxidants, via complex II-derived superoxide, and insulin resistance in adipocytes and perhaps muscle.</p><p>An important question is how increased mitochondrial oxidants impair insulin action. Our data from cells supplemented with CoQ revealed that improvements in insulin-stimulated glucose transport and inhibition of lipolysis were not associated with improved insulin signalling to Akt or its downstream substrate TBC1D4. This is consistent with previous reports that defects in insulin-stimulated glucose transport in insulin resistance are not due to obvious defects in proximal insulin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoehn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Although retrograde signalling from the mitochondria to the nucleus is well described it seems unlikely that this mitochondrial oxidant-induced insulin resistance requires changes in transcription because induction of mitochondrial oxidants acutely impairs insulin action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hoehn et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it is more likely that there is a presently undiscovered signal transduction pathway that communicates directly to mediators of insulin action in the cytoplasm. Future studies exploring specific targets involved in this pathway and their connection with mitochondria and oxidants are warranted.</p><p>Coenzyme Q has received considerable attention as a supplement to ameliorate a range of medical conditions, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease, based on the observation that serum and tissue CoQ<sub>10</sub> concentrations are decreased in individuals with these conditions. While there are reports of CoQ supplementation benefitting these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ayer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hodgson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mortensen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Raygan et al., 2016</xref>), the efficacy of CoQ<sub>10</sub> in the treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ayer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eriksson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Suksomboon et al., 2015</xref>). Our study provides a reasonable rationale for targeting the CoQ biosynthesis pathway as a potential therapeutic target. Overall low bioavailability of orally administered CoQ<sub>10</sub> or CoQ<sub>10</sub>H<sub>2</sub> represents a substantial limitation, particularly in situations of modest CoQ deficiency such as those shown here to be sufficient to initiate insulin resistance, and where mitochondrial CoQ homeostasis needs to be restored in metabolic tissues such as adipose and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 1995</xref>). We overcame this limitation in mice by intra-peritoneal administration of CoQ to provide proof-of-principle that restoration of mitochondrial CoQ improves insulin action and whole body glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Unfortunately, intra-peritoneal administration of CoQ<sub>10</sub> is not likely a practical strategy for the treatment of insulin resistance in humans. Pharmacological inhibition of the CoQ biosynthesis pathway, e.g., by polyisoprenoid epoxides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bentinger et al., 2008</xref>), or targeting additional processes that contribute to the regulation of mitochondrial CoQ content may represent potential options in the future. In the present study, we found that the protein levels, but not the corresponding levels of the mRNAs, of the CoQ biosynthetic enzymes COQ7 and COQ9 were decreased in insulin resistance. These proteins form a dimeric complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lohman et al., 2014</xref>) the formation of which may be regulated via a post-translational mechanism. Although little is known about the molecular regulation of COQ protein turnover, the CoQ biosynthetic protein complex has been reported to be stabilised by the atypical kinase ADCK3/COQ8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stefely et al., 2016</xref>)), mitochondrial proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Veling et al., 2017</xref>) and CoQ itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 2014</xref>). Destabilisation of the complex lowers expression of many of the COQ proteins altered in insulin-resistant adipose tissue, including COQ3, 7 and 9. Therefore, it may be that loss of COQ7 and 9 in insulin resistance is a result of increased turnover due to complex instability. Another therapeutic option is based on our data implicating complex II as the site of increased oxidant production in response to loss of mitochondrial CoQ. Recent chemical screens have successfully identified compounds that prevent superoxide production from complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brand et al., 2016</xref>) and III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Orr et al., 2015</xref>), without impairing electron transport. Identifying similar compounds for complex II may be useful in mitigating superoxide/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production and overcoming insulin resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

For assessment of the effect of TTFA or malonate on HA-GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, cells were incubated with 100 µM TTFA or 10 mM malonate for 2 hr in DMEM/10% FCS/GlutaMAX and for 2 hr during serum starvation in DMEM/0.2% BSA/GlutaMAX prior to assessment of insulin action.</p></sec><sec id="s4-37"><title>Overexpression of mitochondrial-targeted catalase (mCat)</title><p>Mitochondrial-targeted human catalase (human catalase with the 24 residue MnSOD mitochondrial localisation signal at its N-terminus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arita et al., 2006</xref>) was inserted into the pBABE-puro vector.

For each dataset, the sub-groups were initially compared with the relevant ANOVA depending on the levels of treatments. If row or column factors were significant, specific sub-groups were then compared using Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test (adjusting for multiple comparisons using the Sidak method). Significant effects were defined as p&lt;0.05 by these t-tests, as reported in the figures. Human data were assessed by Mann Whitney tests and significant effects were defined as p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank G Dallner for advice on pharmacological inhibition of CoQ biosynthesis.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mitochondrial CoQ deficiency is a common driver of oxidative stress and insulin resistance&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Mark McCarthy as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>James et al. use a proteomics approach to screen for novel pathways involved in insulin resistance. By cross-referencing results obtained from 3T3-L1 cell line insulin resistance models with a sucrose-fed mouse model they identify changes to several pathways. This is an ambitious and comprehensive effort. The authors identify the mevalonate-Coenzyme Q pathway as a key pathway and propose a causative mechanism to explain the correlation. Although most of the studies presented are supportive of the hypothesis, the evidence supporting a causal relationship between loss of CoQ biosynthesis and the development of insulin resistance is not definitive.</p><p>The reviewers are in agreement that the work was potentially of interest to the general audience of <italic>eLife</italic>. However, they believe that additional studies are required to support the idea that CoQ supplementation or manipulation of components of this pathway can improve insulin sensitivity, especially since this hypothesis was previously tested, and while some studies report improvement of hyperglycemia, others have reported no effect.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors focus primarily on glucose uptake to evaluate insulin responses. While this makes sense for skeletal muscle, for adipose tissue (the primary tissue studied in this manuscript) the authors should test the effects on insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis. This is especially important since NEFA liberation from fat is a major contributor to hepatic glucose production. This could be assessed by measuring glycerol/FFA release to the media following the same manipulations described in the manuscript that reduce/enhance insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Measurements of serum FFA can also be done following CoQ treatment and glucose injection.</p><p>2) Along the same lines, since the authors claim that CoQ supplement improves insulin sensitivity, it would be important to perform ITTs to support this.</p><p>3) The improvement in insulin sensitivity upon catalase overexpression and complex II inhibition seems modest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I and J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). To strengthen the causality between CoQ levels and insulin resistance it would be helpful to show whether TTFA/malonate treatment also improves insulin sensitivity in adipose explants derived from HFHSD-fed mice.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32111.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors focus primarily on glucose uptake to evaluate insulin responses.

Measurements of serum FFA can also be done following CoQ treatment and glucose injection.</p></disp-quote><p>These data are included in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We assessed insulin-mediated suppression of lipolysis in all in vitro models of insulin resistance including NB-treated cells and cells in which <italic>Coq7</italic> and <italic>Coq9</italic> were knocked down.

In chow-fed mice, CoQ had no effect on blood glucose during the ITT or tracer uptake into epididymal fat, inguinal fat or quadriceps.
