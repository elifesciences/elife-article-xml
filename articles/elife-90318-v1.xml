Absence seizures are characterized by spike-and-wave discharges on the electroencephalogram associated with a transient alteration of consciousness. However, it is still unknown how the brain responds to external stimuli during and outside of seizures. This study aimed to investigate responsiveness to visual and somatosensory stimulation in Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), a well-established rat model for absence epilepsy. Animals were imaged under non-curarized awake state using a quiet, zero echo time, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sequence. Sensory stimulations were applied during interictal and ictal periods. Whole-brain hemodynamic responses were compared between these two states. Additionally, a mean-field simulation model was used to explain the changes of neural responsiveness to visual stimulation between states. During a seizure, whole-brain responses to both sensory stimulations were suppressed and spatially hindered. In the cortex, hemodynamic responses were negatively polarized during seizures, despite the application of a stimulus. The mean-field simulation revealed restricted propagation of activity due to stimulation and agreed well with fMRI findings. Results suggest that sensory processing is hindered or even suppressed by the occurrence of an absence seizure, potentially contributing to decreased responsiveness during this absence epileptic process.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>EEG-fMRI</kwd><kwd>absence seizure</kwd><kwd>GAERS</kwd><kwd>awake</kwd><kwd>sensory perception</kwd><kwd>mean-field model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Human Brain Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Third Specific Grant Agreement project nr. 945539</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barbier</surname><given-names>Emmanuel L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Infrastructure d'avenir en Biologie Santé ANR-11-INBS-0006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barbier</surname><given-names>Emmanuel L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rats with absence epilepsy exhibit hindered and restricted sensory processing during ongoing seizures, as demonstrated by functional magnetic resonance imaging and mean-field simulation studies.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Absence seizures typically appear in children between the ages of 5 and 7, and are characterized by a sudden, brief impairment of consciousness, an interruption from ongoing activities, and an unresponsiveness to environmental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loiseau et al., 1995</xref>). These seizures typically last for a few seconds to several minutes and include a regular electroencephalographic pattern known as spike-and-wave discharge (SWD) with a frequency of 2–5 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Szaflarski et al., 2010</xref>). In non-treated patients, absence seizures can occur from a few to hundreds of times per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loiseau et al., 1995</xref>). The impaired consciousness during absence seizures can be highly disabling. Indeed, absence epilepsy is not a benign condition and is often accompanied by severe neuropsychiatric comorbidities including impairment of attention, memory, and mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crunelli et al., 2020</xref>). To better understand how these comorbidities arise, it is important to investigate how information processing is altered between the ictal and interictal periods.</p><p>In absence epilepsy, human neuroimaging studies suggest that during a seizure, there may be a lack of conscious information processing due to impaired frontoparietal network, arousal systems in the thalamus and brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blumenfeld, 2012</xref>), or default mode network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luo et al., 2011</xref>). Likewise, multiple human studies on absence seizure have demonstrated lack of responsiveness to external stimuli such as commands and questions, potentially caused by focal disruption of information processing in specific corticothalamic networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blumenfeld, 2012</xref>). However, to our knowledge, current neuroimaging studies on absence epilepsy have been conducted in a resting state, without external stimulus. Therefore, it remains unclear how the brain manages environmental stimuli during absence discharges, and more research is needed to understand how the brain responsiveness is affected during altered brain states.</p><p>The GAERS is a well-established model of absence epilepsy. It is based on the selection of rats exhibiting spontaneous SWD and recapitulates most electrophysiological, behavioral, and pharmacological features of human absence epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Depaulis et al., 2016</xref>). Although the origin of absence seizures is not fully understood, current studies on rat models of absence seizures suggest that they arise from excitatory drive in the barrel field of the somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meeren et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Polack et al., 2007</xref>) and then propagate to other structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2008</xref>) including thalamus, knowing to play an essential role during the ictal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huguenard, 2019</xref>). Notably, thalamic subnetwork is believed to play a role in coordinating and spacing of SWDs via feedforward inhibition together with burst firing patterns. This leads to the rhythms of neuronal silence and activation periods that are detected in SWD waves and spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huguenard, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCafferty et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Previous results on GAERS have indicated that, during an absence seizure, hyperactive electrophysiological activity in the somatosensory cortex can contribute to bilateral and regular SWD firing patterns in most parts of the cortex. These patterns propagate to different cortical areas (retrosplenial, visual, motor, and secondary sensory), basal ganglia, cerebellum, substantia nigra, and thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Polack et al., 2007</xref>). Although SWDs are initially triggered by hyperactive somatosensory cortical neurons, neuronal firing rates, especially in majority of frontoparietal cortical and thalamocortical relay neurons, are decreased rather than increased during SWD, resulting in an overall decrease in activity in these neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCafferty et al., 2023</xref>). Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated blood volume or BOLD signal decreases in several cortical regions including parietal and occipital cortex, but also, quite surprisingly, increases in subcortical regions such as thalamus, medulla, and pons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCafferty et al., 2023</xref>). In line with these findings, graph-based analyses have shown an increased segregation of cortical networks from the rest of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wachsmuth et al., 2021</xref>). Altogether, alterations in these focal networks in the animal models of epilepsy impair cognitive capabilities needed to process specific concurrent stimuli during SWD and therefore could contribute to the lack of behavioral responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chipaux et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meeren et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Studer et al., 2019</xref>), although partial voluntary control in certain stimulation schemes can be still present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The objective of this study was to investigate changes in whole-brain responsiveness to sensory stimuli during ictal and interictal states, using the GAERS animal model. To avoid the potential impact of anesthetic agents on fMRI recordings and because absence seizures can be only observed in awake animals, EEG-fMRI was performed in GAERS trained to remain still and awake, i.e., non-curarized and non-anesthetized, using a previously validated protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paasonen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stenroos et al., 2018</xref>). For this purpose, the functionality of the zero echo time (ZTE) sequence was first piloted, and selected over traditional echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence for its lower acoustic noise and reduced magnetic susceptibility artifacts. The selected MRI sequence thus appeared optimal for awake EEG-fMRI measurements. Visual and somatosensory whisker stimulations were used during both ictal and interictal states, as previous research has shown altered electrophysiological activity and behavior in these sensory systems during seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meeren et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pavone et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Studer et al., 2019</xref>). By using both stimulation schemes, we aimed to investigate alterations in brain responsiveness in each sensory system and to identify any common changes. To further describe the change when switching between ictal and interictal states, the whole-brain response to visual stimulus in each state was simulated, using a recent mean-field model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Volo et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fine-tuning of fMRI recording in awake rats</title><p>Using our EEG-fMRI setup with transmit-receive loop coil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) the spatial signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was ~25 whereas the temporal SNR was between 30 and 60 in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In pilot studies, responses to visual stimulation measured using ZTE and EPI sequences were compared in one animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

For the results presented here, the stimulus was simulated in the primary visual cortex (indicated by the red-circled pixel). As we can see from the statistical maps, the propagation of the stimulus is drastically restrained during ictal periods in comparison with interictal periods. During the ictal periods the dynamics of the system is dominated by the highly synchronous and regular SWD oscillation, and the effect of the stimulus does not alter significantly the ongoing dynamics. On the contrary, during the interictal periods, where the system exhibits an AI dynamic, the effect of stimulus generates a large variation of the ongoing dynamics in the regions linked to the stimulated area (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Thanks to specific fMRI and EEG recordings obtained in awake rats, we have uncovered significant differences in brain activity and activation of specific structures during visual and whisker stimulations, depending on whether they occur during a seizure period or not.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>ZTE fMRI of non-curarized awake rats enabled absence seizure detection</title><p>Recording absence seizures in rats can be challenging because they only occur when the animals are in a calm and stress-free awake state. Despite the disturbance caused by MRI scanning noise and the need for rat restraint, we were able to successfully detect absence seizures in awake GAERS during training periods and fMRI sessions. We found that the ZTE sequence, which produced considerably lower sound pressures compared to traditional EPI, was the optimal MRI sequence for our purpose. Based on our experience from current and previous experiments, we believe that acoustic noise level is the most significant stress factor for awake rats because it can cause increased motion and thereby potential confounds in task-based and resting-state fMRI studies. ZTE-based fMRI may provide better localization of activated sites because it is sensitive to change in blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Restom et al., 2007</xref>), and it has also been suggested that ZTE-fMRI is 67% more sensitive than standard BOLD EPI due to its ability to detect increases in tissue oxygenation which shortens the T1-relaxation rate of spins in a pseudo-steady state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Whole-brain responsiveness during an interictal condition</title><p>In the visual stimulation group, responses were most pronounced in the visual cortex, the superior colliculus, and the thalamus, including the lateral geniculate nucleus, which are all part of the rat visual pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sefton et al., 2015</xref>). As binocular stimulation was used, responses in both hemispheres were observed. Interestingly, we also detected activation in the frontal cortex, including the prelimbic, cingulate, and secondary motor cortices. The involvement of frontal cortical areas can be explained by the fact that medial prefrontal cortex, which includes the prelimbic cortex, is known to be a central area for rat’s attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Williams et al., 1999</xref>) and that lesion in the medial prefrontal cortex impaired the accuracy of detecting brief flashes of light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muir et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>In the whisker stimulation group, responses were mostly seen in the somatosensory cortex, including the barrel field, and in the ventral posteromedial thalamus, which are part of the rat whisker system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adibi, 2019</xref>). This finding suggests that the somatosensory cortex, the initiating zone of the seizures, is functional during the interictal state in GAERS. Additionally, we detected activation in the frontal cortex, which could be due to increased attention to external cues. Surprisingly, positive activation was also observed in part of the auditory cortex. This activation could be explained by the rats’ ability to differentiate the sound coming from air puffs from the ongoing MRI noises, causing increased auditory activation during stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Decreased cortical activity during a seizure per se</title><p>Experimental and simulation results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) illustrated typical synchronous and regular SWD patterns with a spike component followed by a longer-lasting wave or silence component. The silence component of SWD is thought to be caused by neuronal deactivation or increased inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fisher and Prince, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gloor, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Inoue et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kostopoulos et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCafferty et al., 2023</xref>), potentially resulting in overall decreased neuronal activity in the thalamocortical and cortical neurons. Our findings of negative HRFs in the cortical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) are in line with this hypothesis, suggesting reduced neuronal activity. Supporting evidence was found in a recent neuroimaging study conducted with GAERS showing that during an absence seizure, a larger group of neural populations in the frontoparietal cortex had a decreased firing rate, while a smaller portion of neuronal populations had an increased firing rate, leading to reduced fMRI cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCafferty et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, other studies utilizing optical flowmetry in GAERS have noticed decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in cortical capillaries during an absence seizure, with preserved P<sub>O2</sub>, P<sub>CO2</sub>, and arterial blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nehlig et al., 1996</xref>) suggesting decreased cortical brain activity. However, the mechanism for the observed subcortical fMRI increases in this study and a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCafferty et al., 2023</xref>) illustrating the disagreement between electrophysiological and fMRI signals are yet to explained and demand further studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Decreased responsiveness during an absence seizure</title><p>Based on fMRI results, we noticed reduced activation in the cortex during ictal state, along with limited propagation of activity compared to the interictal period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which could indicate decreased responsiveness and information processing during external stimulation. Simulation results using a mean-field model also illustrated no observable change in spiking rate together with restricted propagation of neuronal activity in response to visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming fMRI finding. Previous electrophysiological experimental studies using whisker stimulation setups on GAERS have demonstrated that event-related potentials are modulated but still present during an absence seizure compared to seizure-free periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chipaux et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Studer et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, our findings do not necessarily correspond to a decreased amplitude of event-related potential per se but could rather indicate decreased sum of excitatory-inhibitory neuronal state when stimulating during SWD.</p><p>During an SWD, the overall neuronal activity in several cortical areas is globally decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCafferty et al., 2023</xref>) potentially due to the wave component of SWD with increased thalamocortical inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McCafferty et al., 2018</xref>). In that state, excitation caused by external stimulation can cause relative increases of activity in responsive brain areas. However, if excitation in these neuronal populations is relatively lower compared to the neuronal suppression caused by SWD, the total sum of activity is negative compared to baseline. As fMRI is believed to measure the sum of neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>), this appears as reduced fMRI amplitude, which was also apparent in measured HRFs in cortical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, reduced fMRI responsiveness implies that SWD is a dominant brain feature even under stimulation condition, and that particularly the ‘wave’ phase of the neuronal oscillatory pattern of SWD can prevent responsiveness in GAERS during these conditions.</p><p>As previously discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chipaux et al., 2013</xref>, the lack of conscious perception to paroxysmal stimulation event could be caused by the concomitant appearance of SWD or SWD complex that is shortly (&lt;500 ms in humans) following a stimulation. In our study, as SWD complexes co-occurred with stimulation events, this could hinder the potential conscious perception of visual and somatosensory stimulation. Interestingly, when stimulation events were applied during a seizure but were not followed by SWD complexes (i.e. stimulation ended a seizure), fMRI response amplitudes were higher than when stimulation did not end a seizure. This could mean that the stimulation response exceeded a threshold to shift the brain back to a responsive or conscious state, which was apparent in the fMRI signal as well. The reason for the change in brain state in these stimulation cases is unclear, as stimulation strength remained the same throughout the experiment. However, there is a potential for future experiments and therapeutic interventions to study further how different stimulation schemes affect neuronal populations and cause a shift from ictal to non-ictal state.</p><p>In this study, we were able to detect spontaneous absence seizures inside the magnet using awake, non-curarized, rats and a quiet ZTE imaging sequence, and thereby able to study whole-brain sensory perception in ictal and interictal brain states. Rats were stimulated with blue led light and with somatosensory whisker air puffs during both interictal and ictal states. We found that cortical activation was spatially wider and stronger during interictal stimulation compared to ictal stimulation. Moreover, the detected decreases in the cortical HRF when sensory stimulation was applied during SWDs could play a role in decreased sensory perception. Further studies are required to evaluate whether this HRF change is a cause or a consequence of the reduced neuronal response. Altogether, these stimulation-based fMRI experiments, combined with the brain-wide simulation results, suggest that rats with absence epilepsy have hindered and restricted sensory processing during an ongoing seizure, although not fully abolished. These findings may contribute to our understanding of cognitive impairments observed in patients suffering from absence epilepsy and the severe neuropsychiatric comorbidities observed in children. Additionally, the results of this study provide insight into the information processing during SWD and may aid in the development of future therapeutic approaches for absence epilepsy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were approved by the local animal welfare committee (Comité Local GIN, C2EA-04) and complied with EU guidelines (Directive 2010/63/EU). Every precaution was taken to minimize the number of animals used and stress to animals during experiments. A total of 11 adult 8–12 months of age GAERS rats were used (260±21 g, 6 males, 5 females). After implantation of an EEG lead (see below), rats were individually housed in their cages. Animals were maintained on a 12/12 hr light-dark cycle at room temperature of 22 ± 2°C, humidity of 50–60%. Food (Extrudat, vitamin-fortified, irradiated &gt;25 kGy) and water were available ad libitum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>EEG implantation</title><p>Carbon fiber (WPI Sarasota FL) electrodes were prepared as follows. Fiber leads were cut to small (~30 mm in length) parts and the end of the electrode was exposed from insulating cover to leave a brush-like, ~5 mm length, tip. Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (induction with 5%, a percentage gradually decreased to 1–2% for the surgery maintenance). The head was then shaved to remove the fur above the scalp, and the rat was positioned in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Germany). After local lidocaine hydrochloride injections (2 g/100 ml, 0.05 ml/site), the skull was exposed, cleaned with sterile 0.9% saline and hydrogen peroxide, and allowed to dry. Small holes were drilled halfway through the skull and carbon fiber electrodes were laid and glued with cyanoacrylate over the right motor cortex (AP: +2, ML: +2.5 mm) and right primary somatosensory cortex (AP: −2.5, ML: +3 mm) for seizure detection. An electrode working both as a reference and ground was placed on top of the cerebellum (AP: −12, ML: +2 mm). The other end of electrode leads was inserted inside a plastic tube, which was positioned at the center of the skull. A thin layer of cyanoacrylate was applied to cover the skull. On top of the glue, a layer of dental cement (Selectaplus, DeguDent GmbH, Germany) was applied to finish the implant. Following the surgery, rats were individually caged to recover, and the welfare of the animals was closely monitored.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Animal habituation for awake imaging</title><p>A low noise ZTE MRI sequence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wiesinger and Ho, 2022</xref>) was used with awake rats aiming for low-stress and low-motion functional imaging sessions that allows rats to produce spontaneous seizures. For the habituation, peak ZTE scanner noise was measured with an omnidirectional condenser microphone (MT830R, Audio-Technica Limited, Leeds, UK) and Audacity software (version 2.3.0, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">https://www.audacityteam.org/</ext-link>), similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paasonen et al., 2020</xref>, and reproduced at equivalent sound pressure through a loudspeaker.</p><p>To habituate the rats for the fMRI experiments, a procedure based on a previous study was followed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stenroos et al., 2018</xref>). Restraint parts compatible with standard Bruker rat bed and suitable for stimulation leads were designed using 123D CAD software (Autodesk, San Rafael, CA, USA) and 3D-printed with Ultimaker 2 (Utrecht, Netherlands) using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The rats’ bodies were restrained with a soft and elastic foamed plastic, hind legs were taped together, and front legs were taped loosely together to the side of the body. Front teeth were secured with a carbon fiber teeth bar, head with a nose cone, and neck and shoulders with a neck and shoulder bars, respectively. Silicone ear plugs were used to minimize experienced noise. Rats were habituated to restraint and MRI ZTE gradient noises by gradually increasing session times from 15 to 60 min per day for 8 days before the first fMRI experiments. The length of habituation period was selected based on pilot experiments to provide low-motion data therefore giving rats a better chance to be in a low-stress state and thus produce absence seizures inside the magnet. Pressure pillow and video camera were used to estimate physiological state, via breathing rate, and motion level, respectively. During the last habituation session, EEG was measured to confirm that the rats produced a sufficient amount of absence seizures (10 or more per session). Total of three to five fMRI experiments were conducted per rat within a 1- to 3-week period. In case rats were re-imaged more than 1 week after the preceding experiment, an additional 2-day habituation period was conducted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Before and after each habituation session, rats were given a treat of 1% sugar water and/or three chocolate cereals as positive reinforcement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>EEG-MRI protocol</title><p>MRI acquisitions were carried out at 9.4 T (Biospec Avance III HD, Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany; IRMaGe facility) using Paravision 7. In-house-made transmit-receive loop coil with a 22 mm inner diameter was designed to host the EEG lead and to be compatible with the rat restraining cradle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). 3D-printed sledge was designed to cover the circuit board of the coil and partly stabilize coaxial cable and the loop. Before connecting carbon fiber electrode leads, the loop was placed around the implant and sledge was fastened to the animal cradle with masking tape. Next, electrode leads were connected to the other end of the EEG cable. The cable was carefully secured on top of 3D-holder, without touching the animal to avoid breathing and motion artifacts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>fMRI optimization</title><p>To select the optimal fMRI sequence for the study design, standard GE-EPI, and ZTE imaging (see section &quot;EEG-MRI acquistion and stimulations parameters&quot; for details) were compared. Peak acoustic noise levels produced by the MRI scanner during the sequence run, level of spatial distortions on MRI images caused by electrodes, gradient switching artifacts on EEG, and functional contrast were evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Motion incidences between this study and previous study using EPI sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stenroos et al., 2018</xref>) were compared. ZTE was selected over EPI sequence as it was quieter, produced less susceptibility artifacts, had less noise on EEG recordings, and led to less animal motion (see Results section). Low noise level of ZTE is particularly important factor for seizure appearance, as GAERS rats only experience seizures when they are awake and in a calm state. Eventually, the ZTE parameters were adapted to optimize the functional contrast to noise ratio together with the temporal and spatial resolutions, based on previous reports (MacKinnon et al., ISMRM 2021) and our own pilot acquisitions. Note that ZTE is sensitive to change in blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lehto et al., 2017</xref>) and not to BOLD contrast as in EPI, and therefore also more direct measure of neuronal activation. To assess the overall data quality and functionality of the transceiver loop coil, spatial and temporal SNRs were assessed in one representative rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Spatial SNR was obtained as the ratio between the mean signal intensity in an area of interest (the cortex) and the standard deviation of the background signal, whereas temporal SNR was obtained voxel-wise by dividing the mean by the standard deviation of the normalized fMRI signal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Animal installation</title><p>Before awake EEG-fMRI measurements, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 2% maintenance in 30% O<sub>2</sub>/70% N<sub>2</sub>). Next, animals were wrapped and taped for awake imaging (see section &quot;Animal habituation for awake imaging&quot;) and the animals were moved to the MRI scanner and restrained to the 3D-printed holder. The respiration rate was measured with a pressure pillow placed under animals and a Biopac amplifier system (Goleta, CA, USA). Temperature was not measured in awake condition to avoid causing any harms to the rectum due to motion. We relied on pilot calibration of the temperature of heated water circulating inside the animal bed to maintain the normal body temperature of ~37°C. Lastly, EEG leads were connected, and animals were pushed to the center of the magnet bore. After routine preparation steps in the MRI console were done, isoflurane was turned off. Once animals woke up from anesthesia, they were left to rest in a quiet bore for 5–15 min so that spontaneous seizures started to emerge, after which functional imaging was started.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>EEG-MRI acquisition and stimulations parameters</title><p>Anatomical imaging was conducted with a T1-FLASH sequence (repetition time: 530 ms, echo time: 4 ms, flip angle 18°, bandwidth 39,682 kHz, matrix size 128×128, 51 slices, field-of-view 32×32 mm², spatial resolution 0.25×0.25×0.5 mm<sup>3</sup>). fMRI was performed with a 3D ZTE sequence (repetition time: 0.971 ms, echo time: 0 ms, flip angle 4°, pulse length 1 µs, bandwidth 150 kHz, oversampling 4, matrix size 60×60×60, field-of-view 30×30×60 mm<sup>3</sup>, spatial resolution of 0.5×0.5×1 mm<sup>3</sup>, polar under sampling factor 5.64, number of projections 2060 resulting to a volume acquisition time of about 2 s) (look <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wiesinger and Ho, 2022</xref> for parameter explanations). A total of 1350 volumes (45 min) were acquired.</p><p>Visual (n=14 sessions, 5 rats) and somatosensory whisker (n=14 sessions, 4 rats) stimulations fMRI measurements were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Stimulus duration, frequency, and pulse lengths were automatically controlled by an Arduino chip (Arduino Uno Rev3). For the visual stimulation, light pulses (3 Hz, 6 s total length, pulse length 166 ms) were produced by a blue led (wavelength of 470 nm) and light was guided through two optical fibers to the front of the rat’s eyes.</p><p>For the somatosensory stimulation, an air pressure valve (PMI-200 pressure micro-injector, Dagan Corporation, Minneapolis, MN, USA) controlled by the Arduino chip produced air flow pulses (2 Hz, 6 s total length, pulse length 250 ms) with a pressure of 2.3 bar. Air flow was guided through polyethylene tubes, ending with a plastic tip, in front of the rat’s whiskers, which were maintained together with a piece of tape.</p><p>Stimulation parameters were based on previous rat stimulation fMRI studies and chosen to activate voxels widely in visual and somatosensory pathways, correspondingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Van Camp et al., 2006</xref>). Both sets of stimulations were initiated manually using the live EEG recording as a guide, either during ictal or interictal state, to pursue equal sampling of both states across each 45 min fMRI session. A delay of at least 20 s was maintained between each stimulation block, to allow hemodynamic responses to settle to baseline between each block. EEG was recorded with a sampling rate of 1024 Hz (Micromed, SD MRI amplifier, Treviso, Italy). EEG recording software received a TTL trigger from the MRI scanner to mark the MRI sequence onset and TTL triggers from the stimulator to mark each stimulation period onset. During the live monitoring, a 50 Hz notch filter, and a low pass filter of 12 Hz facilitated online visual detection of seizures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Motion analysis during fMRI</title><p>Motion occurrences were analyzed by visually inspecting image volumes through each scan and average motions per minute were calculated. Motion correction parameters given by advanced normalizing tools (ANTs) (see section &quot;fMRI analysis&quot;) were also used and maximum value was taken to estimate maximum displacement of the head from each session. Framewise displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) was calculated as follows. First, the differential of successive motion parameters (x, y, z translation, roll, pitch, yaw rotation) was calculated. Then absolute value was taken from each parameter, and rotational parameters were divided by 5 mm (as estimate of the rat brain radius) to convert degrees to millimeters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Power et al., 2012</xref>). Lastly all the parameters were summed together.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>EEG analysis</title><p>EEG data was converted from native Micromed TRC-file format to mat- and dat-files using statistical parametric mapping (SPM), version 12 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/">https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/doc/spm12_manual.pdf">https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/doc/spm12_manual.pdf</ext-link>) toolbox ImaGIN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/manikbh/ImaGIN2">https://github.com/manikbh/ImaGIN2</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">manikbh, 2022</xref>). Data were filtered with a 50 Hz notch and 1–90 Hz Butterworth band pass filters using SPM and ImaGIN. Absence seizures were manually inspected from a filtered signal and spectrogram. Seizures were confirmed as SWDs if they had a typical regular spike-and-wave pattern with 7–12 Hz frequency range and had at least double the amplitude compared to baseline signal. All other signals were classified as baseline, i.e., signal absent of a distinctive 7–12 Hz frequency power but spread within frequencies from 1 to 90 Hz. Two successive seizures were counted as one if there was less than 1 s of baseline signal between them. Seizure was counted as absence seizure only if it lasted at least 2 s, since behavioral deficits are not obvious in shorter seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blumenfeld, 2012</xref>). Seizure initiation and ending time points as well as stimulation onsets were marked in seconds and converted to MRI time in volumes.</p><p>Temporal registration between EEG and fMRI was performed using TTL triggers delivered by the MRI sequence and registered as the same time as fMRI signals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-3"><title>fMRI analysis</title><p>To prepare the fMRI data for analysis, data were motion corrected, co-registered with anatomical MRI, and spatially smoothed to reduce noise level. The preprocessing steps were performed using ANTs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/">http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avants et al., 2024</xref>) and Python-based graphical user interphase mri_works (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://montigno.github.io/mri_works/Home/index.html">https://montigno.github.io/mri_works/Home/index.html</ext-link>, version 20.08.21a). The first 5 volumes from each fMRI data were removed to allow signal to reach steady state. For motion correction, all volumes were transformed to an average image taken from first 10 volumes by using antsMotionCorr. Normalization was performed indirectly and using the T1-FLASH images, as ZTE images lack anatomical contrast. First, the T1-FLASH images of each animal were corrected from intensity non-uniformity using N4BiasFieldCorrection from ANTs. Next, brain was extracted with MP3 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brossard et al., 2020</xref>). T1-FLASH images of animals were then co-registered on top of reference T1-FLASH image (taken from a representative animal from our study) with ANTs using rigid, affine (linear) and SYN (non-linear) registrations. Transformation matrices were applied to ZTE images by ANTsApplyTransform so that ZTE images were eventually aligned with the reference T1-FLASH image. Finally, ZTE images were smoothed with a Gaussian filter (1 mm full width at half maximum).</p><p>Post hoc, stimulation periods were classified into different inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), based on the relative position in time of the stimulation period with respect to the absence seizure. Stimulation fully applied during an ictal period and those during an interictal period were used for the ictal-interictal comparison analysis. The effects of the periods when stimulation was ending a seizure (stimulation was considered to end a seizure when there was 0–2 s between stimulation start and seizure end) and the effect of the seizures itself, in absence of stimulation, were also studied. The periods when stimulation ended a seizure are particularly interesting for studying the spatial and temporal aspects explaining shift from ictal, to interictal, i.e., potential non-responsiveness state, to responsiveness state. Intermediate cases, where the seizure started or ended during the stimulation block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), were considered as confounds of no-interest in the SPM general linear model analysis of fMRI data and the explained variance caused by the confounds were reduced from the main effects of interests. Translational and rotational motion parameters, obtained from a motion correction step, were used also as confounds of no-interest. The variance caused by the confounds of no-interests was reduced from the main effects of interests in the linear model. Stimulations that coincided with a motion above 0.3% of the voxel size were not considered as stimulation inputs. To account for temporal and dispersion variations in the hemodynamic response, stimulation and seizure inputs were convolved with three gamma distribution basis functions (i.e. third-order gamma) in SPM (option: basis functions, gamma functions, order: 3). The choice of third-order gamma was based on the expectation that time-to-peak and shape of HRFs of seizure could vary across voxels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>By convolving each stimulation and seizure inputs with three gamma functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), three regressors from each condition were obtained, and those were used to estimate the regression coefficient values (beta-values) for every voxel in the brain. Next, contrasts were applied to the beta-values as a function of the studied stimulation type. For example, to compare the effect of interictal-ictal stimulations, the beta-values corresponding to interictal stimulation were given a contrast of 1, and those corresponding to ictal stimulation were given a contrast of –1. As a result, for each stimulation and seizure condition, three contrast estimates were obtained. From these contrast estimates, statistical F-contrast maps (look for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friston et al., 1994</xref>) were created and corrected for multiple comparisons by cluster-level correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). F-contrast was used to test differences of any of the three contrast estimates. For difference maps between interictal-ictal stimulations, F-contrast maps were masked with a T-contrast map, where only first-order basis derivative was used, to reveal brain areas where interictal stimulation provided higher amplitude response than ictal stimulation.</p><p>HRFs were estimated in ROIs in response to ictal and interictal stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Anatomical ROIs, based on Paxinos atlas (Paxinos and Watson rat brain atlas 7th edition), were drawn on the brain areas where statistical differences were seen in activation maps. Also, HRFs were estimated in response to stimulation that ended a seizure and were compared to the response when stimulation did not end a seizure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Three gamma basis functions, for each condition, were multiplied with their corresponding average beta-values over a selected ROI, resulting in three functions, and the sum of these functions was taken. The shape and time-to-peak of HRFs during an interictal condition were in line with previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lambers et al., 2020</xref>) thereby confirming the selection of the third-order gamma basis function to model HRF. For statistical comparison, extreme beta-values (maximum or minimum) in a selected ROI between different conditions were compared using a two-tailed t-test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Modeling and simulations</title><p>Whole-brain simulations of the rat brain during sensory stimulation were performed. Each region of the rat brain was modeled via a recently developed mean-field model of AdEx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Volo et al., 2019</xref>), which describes the activity of a population of neurons made by excitatory and inhibitory cells (for details on the model, see Sup. Information and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Volo et al., 2019</xref>). This model has been widely tested and used for the simulation of different brain states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldman et al., 2022</xref>), neuronal responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Volo et al., 2019</xref>), and whole-brain dynamics in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sacha et al., 2024</xref>). In addition, modeling tools to calculate brain signals (such as LFP and BOLD-fMRI) from this type of mean-fields have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tesler et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tesler et al., 2023</xref>). The AdEx mean-field model is capable of producing different neuronal dynamics that can be associated with brain activity during interictal and ictal periods (see Results section). The interictal periods were modeled by an AI type of dynamics, while ictal periods were modeled by an oscillatory dynamic which resembles the SWDs observed during absence epilepsy. The mean-field model was combined with a connectivity matrix of the rat brain (BAMS rat connectome, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bota et al., 2012</xref>) to build a realistic whole-brain simulation of the stimulus propagation during ictal and interictal periods.

methodological considerations</title><p>As P<sub>O2</sub>, P<sub>CO2</sub>, and arterial blood pressure were not measured during the fMRI, there is a possibility that they affect the ZTE-fMRI readout, which is sensitive to blood flow changes. However, as animals were awake and given the fine cerebral autoregulation, blood flow values can be expected to be in the normal range. Another concern is whether blood flow remains stable during the seizure, e.g., increases to a level that could hinder stimulus detection. However, previous Doppler flowmetry studies have shown rather decreased than increased blood velocities during an absence seizure in both humans and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bode, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Simone et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nehlig et al., 1996</xref>). Also, our HRF results measured during a seizure in absence of stimulation suggest a similar finding of reduced CBF especially in cortical regions. Even then, we cannot rule out the possibility of CBF changes influencing the results, especially if there are CBF changes caused by non-neuronal origins. We note a caution that presented maps and time courses showing fMRI changes from visual or whisker stimulation during seizures may contain a mixture of both sensory stimulation-related signals and seizure-related signals. To minimize this contamination in the linear model used, we considered both stimulation and seizure-only states as regressors of interest and used seizure-only responses as nuisance regressors to account for error variance. Thereby, the effects caused by the stimulation should be separated as much as possible from the effects caused by the seizure itself.</p><p>As the used awake habituation and imaging protocol didn’t allow us to avoid the usage of isoflurane during the preparation steps, we cannot rule out the possible effect of using repetitive anesthesia on brain function. However, duration (~15 min) and concentration of anesthesia (~1.5%) during these steps were still moderate, whereas extended durations (1–3 hr) of either single or repetitive isoflurane exposures have been used in previous studies where long-term effects on brain function have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Long Ii et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stenroos et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, there was a 5–15 min waiting period between the cessation of anesthesia and initiation of fMRI scan, to avoid the potential short-term effects of isoflurane that has been found to be most prominent during the 5 min after isoflurane cessation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dvořáková et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>AdEx mean-field model</title><p>The mean-field equations for the AdEx network are given to a first-order by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Volo et al., 2019</xref>:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mtable columnalign="left left" rowspacing="4pt" columnspacing="1em"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where ν<sub>e,i</sub> is the mean neuronal firing rate of the excitatory and inhibitory population, respectively, W is the mean value of the adaptation variable, F is the neuron transfer function, i.e., output firing rate of a neuron when receiving excitatory and inhibitory inputs with mean rates ν<sub>e</sub> and ν<sub>i</sub> and with a level of adaptation W, a and b are the sub-threshold and spike-triggered adaptation constants, respectively, t<sub>w</sub> is the characteristic time of the adaptation variable, T is a characteristic time for neuronal response, µ<sub>V</sub> is the average membrane voltage, and E<sub>L</sub> is the leakage reversal potential. The simulations presented in this paper correspond to the parameters: a=0; b=0 for AI state and b=300 pA for SWD dynamics (b=0 for inhibitory neurons); t<sub>w</sub> = 200 ms; T=5 ms; E<sub>L</sub>=–63 mV for excitatory neurons and –65 mV for inhibitory neurons. The main assumption of the model concerns the size of the neuronal population and the characteristic time of the neuronal dynamics. The size of the neuronal populations must be large enough to ensure the validity of a statistical description (starting in the order of thousands of neurons), and the characteristic time of the population dynamics must be slow enough to be captured by the mean-field formalism (with a lower bound in the order of the few milliseconds). These two conditions are satisfied for the system studied in this paper (for further details on the model, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Volo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>This model has been widely tested and used for the simulation of different brain states, i.e., asynchronous-irregular vs slow-waves sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldman et al., 2022</xref>), neuronal responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Volo et al., 2019</xref>), and whole-brain dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldman et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, modeling tools to calculate brain signals (such as LFP and BOLD-fMRI) from this type of mean-fields have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tesler et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tesler et al., 2023</xref>). For further validation, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> the comparison of the SWD type of dynamics in the mean-field and in the corresponding spiking-neural network of AdEx. We see that, although the amplitude of the oscillations is larger in the spiking network, the mean-field can correctly capture the general dynamics and frequency of the SWD pattern.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>Single region activity during stimulation in whole-brain simulation</title><p>For a better illustration of the response to external stimulation during the different states we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> the response of single brain regions during the stimulation protocol for each state. In particular we show the stimulated area (primary visual cortex, V1) and a neighboring region (mediolateral visual area) with strong structural connectivity to V1 (see caption of the figure for details). The stimulation of a specific region is simulated as an increase in the excitatory input to the specific node. In particular, we use a square function for representing the stimulus (see panel A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). As we can see in the figure, during the interictal period (panels A, B, C) the activity is strongly driven by external stimulation and the firing rates follow the stimulation pattern. On the other hand, during the ictal period (panels D, E, F) the activity is mainly driven by the global oscillatory dynamics even during stimulation. We see in panels E, F that the stimulation can lead to a certain variation on the amplitude of the oscillations during some of the cycles, but the neuronal activity remains predominantly dominated by the global ongoing activity (SWD dynamics). This difference in responsiveness between the two states is captured in the statistical maps shown in the main text. To build the statistical maps, an ANOVA (analysis of variance) test was used. This test is originally thought to assess the significance of the change in the mean between two samples and is calculated via an F-test as the ratio of the variance between and within samples. In our case, it allowed us to assess the impact of the stimulation on the ongoing neuronal activity by performing a comparison of the timeseries of the firing rate with and without stimulation (this was performed independently for each state). For the results presented in this paper, the ANOVA was performed using the ‘f_oneway’ function of the scipy.stats. module in Python.</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90318.4.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>eLife assessment</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Scharfman</surname><given-names>Helen E</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Nathan Kline Institute</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="evidence-strength"><kwd>Solid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="claim-importance"><kwd>Valuable</kwd></kwd-group></front-stub><body><p>This study conducted fMRI experiments in an inbred rat model of absence seizures.

The results are potentially important for the field and do suggest that sensory stimulation may not activate brain regions normally during absence seizures. However the findings are limited by substantial methodological issues that do not enable fMRI signals related to absence seizures to be fully disentangled from fMRI signals related to the sensory stimuli.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Investigating fMRI brain responses to sensory stimuli during absence seizures in an animal model is a novel approach with potential to yield important insights.</p><p>Use of an awake, habituated model is a valid and potentially powerful approach.</p><p>The major difficulty with interpreting the results of this study is that the duration of the visual and tactile stimuli were 6 seconds, which is very close to the mean seizure duration per Table 1. Therefore the HRF model looking at fMRI responses to visual or auditory stimuli occurring during seizures was simultaneously weighting both seizure activity and the sensory (visual or auditory) stimuli over the same time intervals on average. The resulting maps and time courses claiming to show fMRI changes from visual or auditory stimulation during seizures will therefore in reality contain some mix of both sensory stimulation-related signals and seizure-related signals. The main claim that the sensory stimuli do not elicit the same activations during seizures as they do in the interictal period may still be true. However the attempts to localize these differences in space or time will be contaminated by the seizure related signals.</p><p>In their repeated responses to this comment the authors have stated that some seizures had longer than average duration, and that they have attempted to model the effects of both seizures and sensory stimulation. However these factors do not mitigate the concern because the mean duration of seizures and sensory stimulation remain nearly identical, and the models used therefore will not be able to effectively separate signals related to seizures and related to sensory stimulation. Hemodynamic models can never in reality represent underlying signals in an orthogonal manner, and are only indirectly related to neural activity.</p><p>The only way to truly address the important weakness of this study would be to repeat the experiments using stimulus durations that do not match mean seizure duration, e.g. with much shorter duration stimuli.</p><p>The authors have clarified and improved the figure images and their description in the text based on previous specific comments. However, the main weakness in the results remains as summarized above.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Aside from the concerns listed as weaknesses above which were not addressed, most of the more minor comments were addressed by the authors in the resubmissions. However, the comment made twice previously regarding Figure 6-figure supplement 1 was not addressed. It remains impossible to see any firing rate changes elicited by sensory stimuli during the ictal period in parts E and F of the figure vs. parts B and C (interictal), due to the very different scales used. The seizure signals should be removed or accounted for by the model so that any possible sensory stimulus-related signals could be seen, and/or displayed on the same scale as firing rates without seizures. The authors have simply restated their opinion that it is better to include the SWD dynamics in these figures parts, however this makes the figure wholly unconvincing. It is also concerning that part D (ictal), which is in fact shown on the same scale as part A (interictal), actually shows larger firing rates for both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in visual cortex for sensory stimulation during seizures. This contradicts the claims in the rest of the paper that neural activity and fMRI signals are smaller or are even decreased in visual cortex with sensory stimulation during seizures compared to the interictal period.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90318.4.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Stenroos</surname><given-names>Petteri</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Univ.

Therefore, we have made a following changes in the section 3.3.: “There were more voxels with significant changes of activity during interictal state compared to ictal state (136% more). Comparing the statistical responses between interictal and ictal states revealed significant changes (p&lt;0.05, cluster-level corrected) in the visual, somatosensory, and medial frontal cortices. In the ictal state, these regions showed significant hemodynamic decreases when comparing to interictal state, and these polarity changes can be seen the hemodynamic response functions (Figure 4).”</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that there are no data showing slowing of the pathways in response to stimulus. However, we are a bit confused about this comment, as to what part in conclusion section it refers to. We did not intentionally claim that stimulation slows the activated pathways in the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer is right that strong claims cannot be made from HRF by itself. Therefore, we have avoided to such phrasing throughout the manuscript. In the conclusion section, we speculate that HRF decreases “could play a role in decreased sensory perception” but also state that “further studies are required”. The observed HRF decreases (rather than increases) in the cortex when stimulation was applied during SWD, was discussed in section 4.4., where we speculated that neuronal suppression (possible apparent in negative HRFs) caused by SWD can prevent responsiveness. Conclusion now states the following: “Moreover, the detected decreases in the cortical HRF when sensory stimulation was applied during spike-and-wave discharges, could play a role in decreased sensory perception. Further studies are required to evaluate whether this HRF change is a cause or a consequence of the reduced neuronal response.”</p><p>We point out that the main validation of the model and its details were provided in the previous answer to the reviewer and added to the manuscript. The model presented in the paper is based on a mean-field formalism that captures neuronal activity at the mesoscale level. This mean-field formalism is derived via a detailed statistical description of the activity of a spiking neuronal population of excitatory and inhibitory with conductance-based synaptic interactions. Thus, the validation of the mean-field model is performed via direct comparison between the dynamics obtained from the mean-field model and the dynamics obtained from the underlying spiking neural network model. This comparison is shown in the supplementary material of the manuscript, where the transition studied in the paper between interictal (asynchronous irregular activity) and ictal (SWD dynamics) activity, which is predicted by the mean-field model, is indeed observed in the underlying spiking neuronal model. The existence of these two types of dynamics and the transition between them is the main component of the model used to build the analysis of the responsiveness performed in the paper (which has been properly validated).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting paper investigating fMRI changes during sensory (visual, tactile) stimulation and absence seizures in the GAERS model. The results are potentially important for the field and do suggest that sensory stimulation may not activate brain regions normally during absence seizures. But the findings are limited by substantial methodological issues that do not enable fMRI signals related to absence seizures to be fully disentangled from fMRI signals related to the sensory stimuli.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Investigating fMRI brain responses to sensory stimuli during absence seizures in an animal model is a novel approach with potential to yield important insights.</p><p>Use of an awake, habituated model is a valid and potentially powerful approach.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The major difficulty with interpreting the results of this study is that the duration of the visual and tactile stimuli were 6 seconds, which is very close to the mean seizure duration per Table 1. Therefore the HRF model looking at fMRI responses to visual or auditory stimuli occurring during seizures was simultaneously weighting both seizure activity and the sensory (visual or auditory) stimuli over the same time intervals on average. The resulting maps and time courses claiming to show fMRI changes from visual or auditory stimulation during seizures will therefore in reality contain some mix of both sensory stimulation-related signals and seizure-related signals. The main claim that the sensory stimuli do not elicit the same activations during seizures as they do in the interictal period may still be true. But the attempts to localize these differences in space or time will be contaminated by the seizure related signals.</p><p>In their response to this comment the authors state that some seizures had longer than average duration, and that they attempted to model the effects of both seizures and sensory stimulation. However these factors do not mitigate the concern because the mean duration of seizures and sensory stimulation remain nearly identical, and the models used therefore will not be able to effectively separate signals related to seizures and related to sensory stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Regressors for seizures were formed by including periods of seizures without any stimulation present. In theory, if seizures were perfectly modeled by the regressor, the left variance is completely orthogonal to the main effect of the stimulus. Furthermore, only the cases where the seizures are longer than the stimulus are used to calculate the responsiveness of the stimulus (while the cases where the seizures are shorter than the stimulus are used as nuisance regressors to account for error variance). However, we agree with the reviewer that in practice all effects of the seizure cannot be removed completely from the effect of stimulus. We have addressed this concern in the “physiologic and methodology consideration” section: “We note a caution that presented maps and time courses showing fMRI changes from visual or whisker stimulation during seizures may contain a mixture of both sensory stimulation-related signals and seizure-related signals. To minimize this contamination in the linear model used, we considered both stimulation and seizure-only states as regressors of interest and used seizure-only responses as nuisance regressors to account for error variance. Thereby, the effects caused by the stimulation should be separated as much as possible from the effects caused by the seizure itself.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The claims that differences were observed for example between visual cortex and superior colliculus signals with visual stim during seizures vs interictal remain unconvincing due to above.</p><p>Maps shown in Figure 3 do not show clear changes in the areas claimed to be involved.</p><p>In their response the authors enlarged the cross sections. However there are still discrepancies between the images and the way they are described in the text. For example, in the Results text the authors say that comparing the interictal and ictal states revealed less activation in the somatosensory cortex during the ictal than during the interictal state, yet Figure 3 bottom row left shows greater activation in somatosensory cortex in this contrast.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that the direction of activation change between groups can be misinterpreted based on statistical maps itself (Figure 3) where only statistical changes are visible and not the polarity of response (can be seen in Figure 4).

Animals were maintained in a non-curarized awake state allowing for naturally occurring seizures to be produced inside the magnet. They were imaged continuously using a quiet zero-echo-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sequence. Sensory stimulations were applied during interictal and ictal periods. Whole brain responsiveness and hemodynamic responses were compared between these two states. Additionally, a mean-field simulation model was used to mechanistically explain the changes of neural responsiveness to visual stimulation between interictal and ictal states.</p><p>Results showed that, during a seizure, whole-brain responses to both sensory stimulations were suppressed and spatially hindered. In several cortical regions, hemodynamic responses were negatively polarized during seizures, despite the application of a stimulus. The simulation experiments also showed restricted propagation of spontaneous activity due to stimulation and so agreed well with fMRI findings. These results suggest that sensory processing observed during an interictal state is hindered or even suppressed by the occurrence of an absence seizure, potentially contributing to decreased responsiveness during this absence epileptic process.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also study the hemodynamic response function (HRF) and it is not clear what conclusions can be made from the data.</p><p>The response of the authors did not clarify this issue.

However, the comment below was not addressed because it is impossible to see any firing rate changes elicited by sensory stimuli (if they are present) due to the scale during seizures. The seizure signals should be removed or accounted for by the model so that any possible sensory stimulus-related signals could be seen, and displayed on the same scale as firing rates without seizures. Prior comment (unaddressed) is repeated below:</p><p>Figure 6-figure supplement 1, the scales are very different for many of the plots so they are hard to compare. Especially in the ictal periods (D, E, F) it is hard to see if any changes are happening during ictal stimulation similar to interictal stimulation due to very different scales. The activity related to SWD is so large that it overshadows the rest, and perhaps should be subtracted out.</p></disp-quote><p>These two comments were addressed and replied in the previous round of reviews. Regarding the different scales of the plots from Figure 6-figure supplement 1, we point out that all the plots in the same scale are already presented in Figure 6 of the main-text. Regarding the activity related to SWD and sensory stimulation, we remark that the effect of the stimulation should be (and was) evaluated with respect to the ongoing activity. All the results concerning the neuronal responsiveness presented in the paper evaluate the statistical significance of the changes in activity produced by the stimulation with respect to the ongoing activity (during ictal and interictal states respectively). For this reason, all the plots containing the time series of neuronal activity in the simulations include the ongoing activity (with SWD dynamics when present) for proper comparison and relevant analysis.</p><p>Additional changes:</p><p>In the section 3.2., the sentence: “In addition, responses were observed in the somatosensory cortex during a seizure state.” was removed for clarification purposes as deactivation rather than activation was observed in this brain area during a seizure state.</p></body></sub-article></article>
