This redundancy at the genetic level, where many mutations have similar phenotypic and fitness effects, can make untangling the molecular mechanisms of complex adaptations difficult. Here, we use the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) as a model to address this challenge. To understand how different genomic changes could lead to parallel fitness gains, we characterize the landscape of transcriptional and translational changes across 12 replicate populations evolving in parallel for 50,000 generations. By quantifying absolute changes in mRNA abundances, we show that not only do all evolved lines have more mRNAs but that this increase in mRNA abundance scales with cell size. We also find that despite few shared mutations at the genetic level, clones from replicate populations in the LTEE are remarkably similar in their gene expression patterns at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Furthermore, we show that the majority of the expression changes are due to changes at the transcriptional level with very few translational changes. Finally, we show how mutations in transcriptional regulators lead to consistent and parallel changes in the expression levels of downstream genes. These results deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex adaptations and provide insights into the repeatability of evolution.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The reason we look like our parents is because we inherit their genes. Genes carry the instructions for our cells to make messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which our cells then translate into proteins. Proteins, in turn, determine many of our features. This is true for all living organisms. Any changes – or mutations – in an organism’s genes can lead to variations in its proteins, which can alter the organism’s traits. This is the basis for evolution: mutations can lead to changes that allow an organism to better adapt to a new environment. This increases the organism’s chances of survival and reproduction – its evolutionary ‘fitness’ – and makes it more likely that the mutation that generated the new trait in the first place will be passed on to the organism’s descendants.</p><p>However, just because two organisms have evolved similar traits to adapt to similar environments, it does not mean that the genetic basis for the adaptation is the same. For example, many animals share similar coloring to warn off predators, but the way that coloring is coded genetically is completely different. In species that are related (which share many of the same genes), this type of evolution is called ‘parallel evolution’, and it can make it difficult for scientists to understand how an organism evolved and pinpoint exactly what mutations are linked to which features.</p><p>In 1988, scientists established the ‘long-term evolution experiment’ to tackle questions about how evolution works. The experiment, which has been running for over 30 years, consisted on tracking the evolution of 12 populations of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> bacteria grown in separate flasks containing the same low-nutrient medium. The initial 12 populations were genetically identical, making this an ideal system to study parallel evolution, since all the populations had to evolve to adapt to the same environment, whilst isolated from each other. In previous experiments, scientists had already noted that while the different bacterial populations grew in similar ways, they had mostly different mutations.</p><p>To better understand parallel evolution, Favate et al. analyzed the synthesis rates of RNA and proteins in the <italic>E. coli</italic> populations used in the long-term evolution experiment. They found that 22 years after the start of the experiment, all 12 populations produced more RNA, grew faster and were bigger. Additionally, while the different populations had accumulated few shared mutations after 22 years, they all shared similar patterns of RNA levels and protein synthesis rates. Further probing revealed that parallel evolution may be linked to how genes are regulated: mutations in regulators of related groups of genes involved in the same processes inside the cell can amplify the degree of parallel changes in organisms. This means that mutations in these genes may lead to similar traits.</p><p>These findings provide insight into how parallel evolution arises in the long-term evolution experiment, and provides clues as to how the same traits can evolve several times.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>ribosome profiling</kwd><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ESI-MIRA R35 GM124976</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Premal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI 1936046</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Premal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start-up funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yadavalli</surname><given-names>Srujana S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IRACDA NJ/NY for Science Partnerships in Research and Education Postdoctoral program NIH PAR-19-366</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cope</surname><given-names>Alexander L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Subcontract from R01 DK056645</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Premal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Subcontract from R01 DK109714</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Premal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Subcontract from R01 DK124369</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Premal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parallel changes in organismal evolution can be observed even with disparate genomic changes due to similarity in functional outcomes, such as changes in molecular phenotypes like gene expression patterns.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A key challenge in biology is understanding the relationships between genotype, phenotype, and evolutionary fitness. Comparative genomic approaches and large-scale mutation experiments have allowed us to map genetic changes to phenotypic changes underlying adaptation. For example, mutations that increase the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen are adaptive in high-altitude dwelling deer mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Natarajan et al., 2013</xref>), and mutations to the influenza haemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins increase viral fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Adaptive phenotypes can also result from changes in multiple genes, such as in yeast evolving under nutrient limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gresham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Venkataram et al., 2016</xref>), bacterial adaptation during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lieberman et al., 2011</xref>) or to high temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tenaillon et al., 2012</xref>), and in the evolution of smaller body sizes in Atlantic silversides under a size-selective fishing regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Therkildsen et al., 2019</xref>). In many cases, similar adaptive phenotypes arise from different mutations to the same gene or regulatory region or from combinations of mutations to different genes and regulatory regions. This redundancy, where many genotypes produce similar phenotypes, makes it difficult to understand the molecular mechanisms behind adaptive phenotypes and is exacerbated by potential epistatic interactions among mutations. On the other hand, adaptive changes to expression have been shown to occur during the domestication of eggplants and tomatoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koenig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Page et al., 2019</xref>), and in hybridization events between two weeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kryvokhyzha et al., 2019</xref>). Although not direct observations of adaptive changes to gene expression, recent comparative analyses of across-species gene expression suggest that the expression levels of numerous genes are evolving under directional selection in vertebrates, fish, and butterflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brawand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Catalán et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fukushima and Pollock, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gillard et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use the long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lenski et al., 1991</xref>) as a model to characterize the molecular changes underlying adaptation to a novel environment. In the LTEE, 12 replicate populations of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> have been adapting in parallel to a carbon-limited medium since 1988, growing over 75,000 generations thus far. As is common in lab-based evolution experiments, the replicate populations display similar phenotypic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blount et al., 2018</xref>). Examples include increases in fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wiser et al., 2013</xref>) and cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grant et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Philippe et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, a significant amount of diversity exists at the genomic level across the replicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tenaillon et al., 2016</xref>), with some lines having orders of magnitude more mutations than others due to the development of mutator phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Good et al., 2017</xref>). While few mutations are shared at the nucleotide level, some genes are commonly mutated across evolved lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maddamsetti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Woods et al., 2006</xref>). Still, how most of the mutations affect fitness in the system is unknown.</p><p>Researchers have hypothesized that similar gene expression patterns might contribute to the parallel increases in fitness in the LTEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fox and Lenski, 2015</xref>). An earlier microarray-based study of transcriptional changes in LTEE showed parallel changes in mRNA abundances in clones from two evolved lines (Ara-1 and Ara+1) at 20,000 generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cooper et al., 2003</xref>). However, it remained unclear which mutations were responsible for these parallel changes and whether the remaining 10 lines also had similar expression profiles.</p><p>Moreover, protein-coding mRNAs must be translated to perform their function. The majority of cellular biomass and energy expenditure is devoted to translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernier et al., 2018</xref>), and the role of hierarchical regulation of gene expression in evolutionary processes has been a subject of debate in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Artieri and Fraser, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McManus et al., 2014</xref>). However, we know little of changes in gene expression at the translational level in the LTEE.</p><p>Here, we use both RNA-seq and Ribo-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>) to profile the landscape of transcriptional and translational changes after 22 years (50,000 generations) of evolution in the LTEE to answer five fundamental questions: (i) do evolved lines show similar transcriptomic and translatomic changes after 50,000 generations despite acquiring mostly unique sets of mutations? (ii) how do changes in cell size affect changes in absolute expression levels? (iii) do changes in gene expression at the translational level buffer, augment, or match changes at the transcriptional level?, (iv) what classes of genes or pathways are altered in the evolved lines, and finally, (v) can we identify mutations responsible for parallel changes in gene expression across replicate populations?</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We generated RNA-seq and Ribo-seq datasets for single clones grown in the exponential phase from each of the 12 evolved lines with sequenced genomes in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tenaillon et al., 2016</xref> (see Materials and methods section M1 for specific clone IDs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We aligned each clone’s data to its unique genome and considered expression changes of 4131 transcripts from the ancestor. Due to concerns of contamination in our Ara+6 samples, we removed them from further analysis. We averaged between 151 and 1693 deduplicated reads per transcript across the 52 libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), the distributions of read counts per transcript were similar across lines, replicates, and sequencing methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and correlations between biological replicates were high (Pearson correlation coefficient <italic>R</italic>&gt;0.93, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We also verified the presence of three-nucleotide periodicity in our Ribo-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Previous studies have shown the existence of distinct ecotypes in the Ara-2 population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Plucain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rozen et al., 2009</xref>). Based on an analysis of mutations, our Ara-2 clone comes from the L ecotype (see Appendix A1). Our Ara-3 clone can utilize citrate as a carbon source (Cit+). Finally, we note that both ancestral and evolved lines were grown in standard LTEE media supplemented with additional glucose to obtain enough starting material for paired RNA-seq and Ribo-seq samples. We discuss the potential impacts of this difference in the supplement (Appendix A2).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Parallel changes in mRNA abundances.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the experimental setup.

We find that 22 genes share mutations in two or more evolved lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tenaillon et al., 2016</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether these parallel genetic changes are sufficient to explain the high degree of parallelism in fitness gains over 50,000 generations. We hypothesize that the evolved lines demonstrate a higher degree of parallel transcriptomic changes despite having unique genomes. To test this hypothesis, we compared the ancestors’ and evolved lines’ mRNA abundances (measured in transcripts per million [TPM]). We find that the expression levels of most genes remain unchanged, leading to high correlations between ancestral and evolved strains (Spearman’s correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic>&gt;0.95, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, pairwise correlations between evolved strains were only marginally higher than the correlations between evolved strains and the ancestors. However, these increases were not statistically significant (KS test, p-value = 0.28, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This suggests that transcriptomic changes are likely restricted to a small portion of the genome.</p><p>To more formally test the hypothesis that evolved lines show parallel changes in the transcriptome, we used DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Love et al., 2014</xref>) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and quantify expression changes between each evolved line and the ancestor (for full results, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). A gene was considered differentially expressed between the evolved line and the ancestor if it reached a statistical threshold of q-value ≤0.01. We find that most fold-changes were small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and consistent with our expectations; only a small proportion of the transcriptome was significantly altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). On average, ∼270 genes (out of 4131) were differentially expressed in an evolved line across all 11 pairwise comparisons between each evolved line and the ancestor. In total, 2986 genes were differentially expressed, but this consisted of only 1273 unique genes, indicating that many DEGs are shared across evolved lines. The expression levels of these 1273 DEGs were more similar between evolved lines than between an evolved line and its ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Correlations based on fold-changes for DEGs were higher than those based on all genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Fold-changes for the set of 1273 DEGs were generally in the same direction regardless of their statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Taken together, this is suggestive of parallelism in the evolution of gene expression across the evolved lines.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>Quantifying the degree of parallelism of DEGs</title><p>To test if the number of observed parallel changes in gene expression across evolved lines differs from the number of parallel changes expected by random chance, we estimated the probability distribution representing the expected number of DEGs altered in the same direction given different proportions of up- and downregulated genes in each line.

We find that the number of genes with expression changes in the same direction is significantly higher than expected by chance (KS test, p-value ∼ 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> – bottom panel). For example, if DEGs were randomly distributed across all lines, we would expect three genes to share expression changes in five or more lines.

Consistent with these expectations, we find that pairwise correlations between evolved lines of fold-changes in DEGs were higher than the fold-changes of all genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). While the number of DEGs varies widely across lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), 7 out of 11 evolved lines have more significantly downregulated DEGs than upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>, binomial test, p-value &lt;0.05). Furthermore, the magnitude of fold-changes of downregulated DEGs was significantly higher than fold-changes of upregulated DEGs in all 11 evolved lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>, KS test, p-value &lt;0.0001).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-4"><title>Variation in expression changes across evolved lines</title><p>So far, we have considered the degree of parallelism in expression level changes across the evolved lines. However, the evolved lines differ not only in terms of their underlying mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tenaillon et al., 2016</xref>) but also vary substantially at the phenotypic level. For instance, half of the evolved lines have developed a mutator phenotype, causing them to accumulate orders of magnitude more mutations than the non-mutator lines. Unlike the other 11 evolved lines, Ara-3 can utilize citrate as a carbon source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blount et al., 2012</xref>), and Ara-2 has developed distinct, coexisting ecotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rozen et al., 2009</xref>). We wanted to characterize how phenotypic variation across evolved lines might correlate with variation in expression levels. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on all fold-changes mainly separates Ara-3 from the rest of the lines, whereas PC2 appears to separate at least some of the mutators from the non-mutators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Variation in PC1 and PC2 seems primarily driven by deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>), coded as downregulated genes (log2 fold-change = –10) in this analysis. The magnitude of encoded fold-changes of the deleted genes did not affect the groupings of the PCA between log2(fold-change) –1 and –10.

As a result of these larger sizes, the cells in evolved lines have higher biomass and proportionally higher nucleic acid levels than the ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Turner et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that absolute abundances of mRNA molecules per cell should also increase with cell volume to maintain concentrations and reaction rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Padovan-Merhar et al., 2015</xref>). To get a complete picture of transcriptional changes, we also quantified absolute changes in mRNA abundances.</p><p>We used phase-contrast microscopy to measure cell shape and estimate cell volume to confirm that our clones from evolved lines were larger than their ancestors (see Appendix A3). Consistent with earlier studies, we find that each evolved line is larger in volume compared to its ancestors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Our volume estimates are also consistent with measurements obtained using a Coulter counter from a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grant et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, Pearson correlation coefficient <italic>R</italic>=0.87). Next, we estimated the absolute abundances of transcripts per CFU by comparison to known standards in our sequencing libraries. Specifically, we added the ERCC spike-in controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">External RNA Controls Consortium, 2005</xref>) to our sequencing libraries and used a linear model to relate the number of molecules of a spike-in RNA added to its TPM in each sample.

Finally, we measured the number of cells used in the generation of each sequencing library by counting colony-forming units (CFUs) from each culture and accounting for sampling at each step of the library preparation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Note that due to various factors, our estimates of CFU are likely underestimates (see Appendix A3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Furthermore, the increases in total mRNA abundance scale with cellular volume, with larger evolved lines having more molecules per typical cell volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This suggests that the evolved lines have more mRNA per cell than the ancestors. Such an increase may be needed to maintain reaction rates in the face of increasing cell volumes. Another hypothesis is that stockpiling resources like mRNA and ribosomes might allow evolved lines to reduce the time spent in the lag phase after transfer to fresh medium. Indeed, reduced lag times occur in the LTEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Vasi et al., 1994</xref>), and simulations suggest that bacteria can evolve to ‘anticipate’ the regular transfer to fresh medium in a serial transfer regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Dijk et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Transcriptional changes drive translational changes</title><p>While mRNA abundances are an important molecular phenotype potentially linking genomic changes to adaptations, changes in mRNA abundances can themselves be buffered or augmented at other downstream regulatory processes such as translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Artieri and Fraser, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McManus et al., 2014</xref>).

However, the role of changes in translational regulation during adaptation and speciation remains poorly understood and, at least in yeast, is heavily debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Artieri and Fraser, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McManus et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, because translation occupies the majority of cellular resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernier et al., 2018</xref>), it may be a prime target for evolution in the LTEE. To study translational changes in LTEE, we performed Ribo-seq in the evolved lines and their ancestors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>We find that changes in ribosome densities are highly correlated with changes in mRNA abundances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This is somewhat surprising because changes in environmental conditions and small genetic perturbations usually result in large changes at the translational level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gerashchenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rubio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Woolstenhulme et al., 2015</xref>). Despite the high correlation between mRNA and ribosome footprint fold-changes at the genomic level, individual genes might have altered ribosome densities. We used Riborex to quantify changes in ribosome densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Riborex quantifies changes in footprint densities while accounting for any changes in mRNA abundances. We considered a gene significantly altered if it reached a q-value ≤0.01. Only a handful of genes have altered ribosome densities, and none are shared between three or more lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). This suggests that over the course of the LTEE, most changes happen at the transcriptional level with insufficient evidence for significant changes at the translational level. We note that earlier studies have indicated that Riborex has limited power to detect small to moderate shifts in ribosome densities based on simulated data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Although comparing these simulations to our data is difficult, it is possible that we are failing to detect some of these smaller shifts in gene-specific ribosome densities.

Note that these values represent the population-level fixed effect slope (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.325</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, p&lt;0.05) and population-level fixed effect intercept (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.005</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, p=0.4423), respectively.

In contrast, the population-level fixed slope (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.325</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, p&lt;0.05) indicates that stop codons, on average, experienced a decrease in ribosome density between the evolved and ancestral lines (i.e., the mean log fold-change of stop codon ribosome densities was –0.325 units lower than the mean log fold-change of sense codon). Accounting for line-specific effects, the stop codon effect sizes for each evolved line range from –0.088 to –0.657 log fold-change units (relative to sense codons), indicating that stop codons in all evolved lines have a decreased ribosome density compared to the ancestor. This suggests that the translation termination rate increased across all evolved lines (relative to the ancestral line), but this increase was greater in some evolved lines than others. For Ara-1, the TAG codon shows increased density, unlike other lines. This leads to a near-zero random effect size for this line.</p><p>Translation termination is one of the rate-limiting steps in translation and is typically much slower than codon elongation rates. Therefore, faster termination might increase the ribosome recycling rates and eventually allow faster translation initiation and protein production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson and Kurland, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shah et al., 2013</xref>). We wondered if faster termination was due to changes in the expression of translation termination factors. While some termination factors show increased expression in some lines, no single gene shows a consistent pattern across all lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Notably, while faster translation termination may increase ribosome recycling and enable faster growth, it may come at the expense of altering a key regulatory mechanism in translational control. As a result, it remains unclear if these regulatory changes can evolve in more complex environments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Functional characterization of DEGs</title><p>Thus far, we have only considered the magnitude and source of parallelism in expression changes. In this section, we attempt to functionally characterize the altered genes, identify mutations that might be driving some of these expression changes, and determine how much higher-order entities such as metabolic pathways are altered across the evolved lines. To identify altered functional categories and pathways, we use function and pathway analysis tools such as GO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>), KEGG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kanehisa and Goto, 2000</xref>), and the BioCyc database pathway perturbation score (PPS, higher numbers indicate stronger alterations to a pathway) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Karp et al., 2019</xref>) to assess these features (see Functional analysis in Materials and methods).

Consistent with increased growth rates, we also find that many categories related to biosynthetic and metabolic processes involving sugars or amino acids are upregulated. The biosynthesis of nucleotide sugars appears downregulated mainly due to the deletion of many of the genes involved in creating sugars which eventually lead to O-antigen biosynthesis. Many of these sugars are involved in constructing the cell membrane or walls; this could be related to known changes in cell shape and size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grant et al., 2021</xref>).

The data generated in this study will likely prove to be a rich resource for understanding the metabolic changes that occur over long periods of evolution in a simple environment such as in the LTEE, thereby adding a new dimension to the well-studied mutational changes and gene expression changes described here.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Adaptation to novel environments often takes unique mutational paths even when the tempo and mode of adaptation are similar across populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheng, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Levy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tenaillon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tenaillon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Therkildsen et al., 2019</xref>). This is due, in part, to the fact that most genetic networks are highly redundant and that many mutations have pleiotropic effects. To begin to bridge the gap between parallel fitness gains in a system with mostly unique genetic changes, we wanted to study gene expression – a key link between genotype and fitness. Two key findings from our work are that (i) most of the transcriptome remains unaltered in its relative expression levels and (ii) genes with altered expression levels have remarkably similar changes (magnitude and direction of changes, pathways targeted, etc.) across all evolved lines after 50,000 generations. While parallel changes in expression profiles are perhaps not surprising given the strong selection in a well-specified environment, our work suggests that expression profiles serve as a link between the disparate mutations and similar fitness gains observed in the LTEE. Although our results do not directly implicate these parallel changes in gene expression to improved fitness, the high degree of parallelism across independently evolved populations warrants further investigation into the fitness consequences of these changes. More importantly, this suggests an optimal expression profile in any particular media that supports maximum growth. Expression profile optimization may be a mode of adaptation with each fixed mutation bringing the expression profile closer to this optimum. Nonetheless, the specific mechanisms by which the evolved lines in the LTEE have achieved similar changes in expression remain unclear. Below, we review three key proposed mechanisms that each might contribute partly to the overall story of parallelism in gene expression changes in LTEE: (i) key regulator hypothesis, (ii) chromosomal architecture and DNA supercoiling, and (iii) growth rate-dependent changes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mechanisms driving parallel expression changes</title><p>According to the ‘key regulator’ hypothesis, changes to one or a few genes can regulate the activity of many other genes responsible for most of the expression changes. In an earlier study of expression changes in the LTEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cooper et al., 2003</xref>), it was suggested that mutations to <italic>spoT</italic> observed in 8 out of 12 lines were responsible for many of the observed expression changes. <italic>spoT</italic> is involved in the stringent response pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Traxler et al., 2008</xref>) and regulates the activity of many genes. However, of the two lines whose expression was surveyed, Ara+1 and Ara-1, only Ara-1 contained a <italic>spoT</italic> mutation. When transferred to the ancestor, the Ara-1 <italic>spoT</italic> mutation did increase fitness by reducing the duration of the lag phase and increasing growth rates and caused similar expression changes in 11 of the 59 genes found to be altered in both Ara+1 and Ara-1. This means that other mutations in both lines were necessary to achieve changes in the remaining genes. Like <italic>spoT</italic>, ribosomal proteins and <italic>rpoD</italic> (the beta subunit of RNA polymerase) have also evolved faster than other genes in the LTEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maddamsetti et al., 2017</xref>). Mutations in these genes can have large pleiotropic effects and might contribute substantially to parallelism in observed expression changes.</p><p>DNA supercoiling is known to play a strong role in regulating transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">El Houdaigui et al., 2019</xref>). All the evolved lines have mutations in genes related to chromosomal architecture, such as <italic>fis</italic>, topoisomerase A and B, or other genes which contribute to parallel changes in DNA superhelicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crozat et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Fis</italic> was also part of the set of fast-evolving genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maddamsetti et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that changes to chromosomal architecture are a target of selection in the system. Parallel mutations in genes affecting chromosomal architecture might also explain why we observe parallel expression changes in several pathways, such as sulfur homeostasis, despite the lack of parallel mutations in transcription factors that directly regulate them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>While the above two mechanisms might be driving many parallel changes in expression levels, changes in the expression of some genes might simply be a consequence of faster growth. Expression levels of many genes in bacteria scale with growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klumpp et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Macklin et al., 2020</xref>) to maintain stoichiometric concentrations. As a result, simply increasing the growth rate of replicate cultures of bacteria might produce similar expression profiles. Disentangling the effects of growth rate and genetic changes on gene expression is difficult, and therefore, we need to be cautious in over-interpreting the role of mutations in driving parallel expression changes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>On the lack of observed translational changes</title><p>Given the universality and importance of translation to life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernier et al., 2018</xref>), it is surprising that we detect few translational changes over 50,000 generations of adaptation. Bacteria possess polycistronic genes, where many proteins are translated from a single mRNA, typically belong to the same pathway or protein complex, and are translationally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that any additional translational changes to genes in an operon might disrupt the stoichiometric balance of proteins in a metabolic pathway or protein complex. It is also likely that the dynamic range of translational changes is smaller than transcriptional changes in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cambray et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goodman et al., 2013</xref>) or that it might take much longer than the time scales of LTEE to observe such changes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The LTEE remains a rich source for studies of evolution. Our work suggests that alterations to the global transcriptional profile is a mode of adaptation in the LTEE and that specific categories of genes have undergone similar expression changes across the lines. However, as described above, relating gene expression changes to specific mutations in LTEE is far from perfect. This is further compounded by the fact that half of the evolved lines in LTEE have a hypermutable phenotype. These genotypes have 100-fold higher mutational load than their non-mutator counterparts. It is remarkable that despite a higher mutational burden, expression patterns between mutator and non-mutator lines are highly correlated, suggesting that the bulk of the additional mutations are indeed passenger mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Good et al., 2017</xref>). While our current study has focused on expression patterns in the exponential phase, populations in the LTEE spend a significant amount of time in the stationary phase before serial transfer. However, it remains unclear if we would observe a similar level of parallelism in the stationary growth phase or how similar the expression profiles might be across distinct growth phases. Finally, the analyses undertaken here have focused on single clones from each of the evolved lines. However, each evolved population has many distinct genotypes and segregating mutations. Taking a single-cell sequencing approach, while still challenging in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Imdahl and Saliba, 2020</xref>), should provide a better understanding of gene expression evolution in LTEE. Lab evolution experiments combined with high-throughput multi-level sequencing approaches offer a rich resource for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying complex adaptations and provide insights into the repeatability of evolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial cell culture, recovery, and lysis</title><p>We used the following clones for generating RNA-seq and Ribo-seq datasets: Ara-1 – 11330, Ara+1 – 11392, Ara-2 – 11333, Ara+2 – 11342, Ara-3 – 11364, Ara+3 – 11345, Ara-4 – 11336, Ara+4 – 11348, Ara-5 – 11339, Ara+5 – 11367, Ara-6 – 11389, Ara+6 – 11370. Bacteria were cultured in medium as per the recipe on the LTEE website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/dm25liquid.html">http://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/dm25liquid.html</ext-link>) supplemented with 4 g/L glucose instead of the typical 25 mg/L. Each culture was grown in 50 mL in a shaking incubator at 37°C at 125 rpm until an OD600 of 0.4–0.5 was reached. This took between 1.5 and 4 hr, depending on the line. Cells were recovered via vacuum filtration and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen (LN2). Frozen pellets were stored at –80°C until lysis. A mortar and pestle were chilled to cryogenic temperatures with LN2 for lysis. The pellet was ground to a powder while submerged in LN2. Once pulverized, 650 µL of lysis buffer was added to each sample and ground further. Lysis buffer contained the following: 20 mM Tris pH 8, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM chloramphenicol, 0.1% v/v sodium deoxycholate, 0.4% v/v Triton X-100, 100 U/mL DNase I, 1 µL/mL SUPERase-In (Thermo Fisher Scientific AM2694). The frozen lysate was allowed to thaw until liquid, then incubated for 10 min on ice to allow complete lysis. Afterward, the lysate was centrifuged at 20,000× <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant recovered and transferred to a new tube.

For RNA-seq libraries, 3 µL of a 1:100 dilution of the set 1 oligos was added to the first replicate and 4 µL to the second replicate. The spike-ins were added directly to the lysate destined for RNA-seq before Trizol-based RNA extraction. Two µg of RNA with ERCC controls were subjected to fragmentation in a buffer containing final concentrations of 1 mM EDTA, 6 mM Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and 44 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub> in a 10 µL reaction volume for 15 min at 95°C. Five µL of loading buffer (final concentrations of 32% v/v formamide, 3.3 mM EDTA, 100 µg/mL bromophenol blue) was added to each sample, and the resulting 15 µL mixture was separated by gel electrophoresis with a 15% polyacrylamide TBE-urea gel (Invitrogen EC68852BOX) at 200 V for 30 min. Gels were stained for 3 min with SYBR Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific S11494), and the region corresponding to the 18–50 nucleotide fragments was excised. We excised this region so that we would have similarly sized fragments for both RNA-seq and Ribo-seq libraries. RNA was recovered from the extracted fragments by adding 400 µL a buffer containing 300 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, and.25% w/v SDS, and freezing the samples on dry ice for 30 min. Then, samples were incubated overnight on a shaker at 22°C; 1.5 µL of GlycoBlue (Thermo Fisher Scientific AM9515) was added as a co-precipitant, followed by 500 µL of 100% isopropanol. The samples were chilled on ice for 1 hr and then centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000× <italic>g</italic> at 4°C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was allowed to air dry for 10 min.

Two µL of.5 M EGTA pH 8 was added to quench the reaction, which was then placed on ice.

The file titled ‘data_processing.Rmd’ contains the code for processing the raw sequencing data. Briefly, the following tools were used to remove adapters (cutadapt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Martin, 2011</xref>), deduplicate (BBtools dedupe.sh script), and demultiplex (FASTX-toolkit barcode splitter script) the data. Only reads of at least 24 nucleotides in length after trimming were retained for alignment. Transcript quantification for both sequencing-type datasets was performed with kallisto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bray et al., 2016</xref>). hisat2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2019</xref>) was used to align Ribo-seq data for analyzing changes at specific codons. For this analysis, alignment was performed against a custom transcriptome that padded each coding region with 25 nt on the 3’ and 5’ ends to allow for better mapping of ribosomes at the start and stop codons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Differential expression analysis of gene expression</title><p>Code for this section can be found in the file ‘DEseq2.Rmd’. We used DEseq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Love et al., 2014</xref>) with the ‘apeglm’ normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>) for differential expression. In estimating fold-changes, we compared the four replicates of the ancestors (two each from ancestors of Ara+ and Ara-) to two replicates of each of the evolved lines. Because some genes in some lines contained indels or were deleted entirely, some transcripts were missing from the transcriptome fastas used to create indices for alignment. We added these genes back to Kallisto’s counts with estimated counts of 0 and assigned them fold-changes of NA. Count matrices containing identical complements of transcripts were used in the differential expression analysis for each line, such that all evolved lines had the same complement of genes as the ancestors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Change in ribosomal density analysis</title><p>We used Riborex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2017</xref>) to analyze changes in ribosomal density.

Briefly, we fit linear mixed models using the ‘lme’ function from the R package ‘nlme’ to test if stop codons showed a larger decrease in ribosome densities (relative to the ancestor) as compared to the sense codons. Briefly, linear mixed models perform linear regression allowing for fixed effects (i.e., a population-level effect) and potential random effects (i.e., effects restricted to pre-specified subpopulations of the data). In this case, the random effects correspond to evolved line-specific effects on log2 ribosome density fold-changes. We fit various linear mixed models allowing for different constraints on the random effect slopes and intercepts, as well as an ordinary linear regression (i.e., no random effects across evolved lines) as the null model. Models were compared using the Akaike information criterion (AIC): the model with the lowest AIC score is generally considered the best model. Although we identified three linear mixed model fits that had similar performance based on the AIC score (i.e., the difference in AIC scores was less than 2), we chose to use the simplest model, which allowed for uncorrelated random effect intercepts and slopes. This model also happened to be the model with the lowest AIC score. For comparison, this model was approximately 27 AIC units better than the ordinary linear regression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Codon-specific positioning of Ribo-seq data</title><p>Code for this section can be found in the file ‘codon_specific_densities.Rmd’. It has been shown that mapping bacterial Ribo-seq reads by their 3’ ends is more accurate than 5’ mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mohammad et al., 2019</xref>), so we mapped the A-site position of a read by using a fixed offset of 37 nt (12 nt offset+25 nt addition to transcript ends). To calculate ribosome densities on a codon for a gene, the number of reads mapping to a codon was normalized to the total number of reads mapping to that gene in a replicate and line-specific manner. Genome-wide codon density is calculated by taking genes with at least 100 reads mapping to them and taking the average number of normalized reads mapping to each codon across that set of genes as the genome-wide codon density.

PPS are calculated as follows: each pathway is composed of at least one reaction, and each reaction is completed by at least one enzyme.

Determination of Ara-2 ecotype</title><p>Analysis for determination of Ara-2 ecotype can be found in the file ‘araM2_ecotype.Rmd’. Briefly, we compared mutations in our clones to the mutations determined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Plucain et al., 2014</xref>. Our clone of Ara-2 does not possess mutations in the arcA or gntR genes. We also compared mutations in our clone against the list of mutations unique to the S or L ecotype and found that our clone possesses many mutations unique to the L type but not the S type. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Le Gac et al., 2012</xref>, found two large 35 and 41 kilobase deletions in the S lineage at 40,000 generations, neither of which are present in our clone at 50,000 generations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>A2. The potential effects of increased sugar in the culture medium</title><p>The LTEE media recipe uses 25 mg/L glucose. However, this low glucose environment leads to low cell densities and constrains our ability to generate matched RNA-seq and Ribo-seq samples with sufficient depth to perform genome-wide analyses from the same culture. To overcome limitations of cell densities, we used 4 g/L, the amount of sugar specified in the agar recipe used for solid growth assays on the LTEE website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/dmagar.html">http://myxo.css.msu.edu/ecoli/dmagar.html</ext-link>). The increased glucose level in our medium is expected to affect the final cell density rather than the growth rate during the exponential phase. Additionally, though our experiment takes place 30,000 generations after the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cooper et al., 2003</xref>, study, we observe similar patterns in expression changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This suggests that some patterns may have reached fixation long ago and that bacteria may behave similarly across the two experiments. Finally, even in the case where the increased glucose has altered the physiology of cells in our cultures, the fact that we see parallel patterns of differential expression relative to the ancestor in each evolved line indicates that we are observing heritable differences from the ancestor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>A3. Absolute abundances and CFU counts</title><p>We used CFUs of our cultures as a measure of cell densities to generate each library. However, filamentation of cells in our cultures can bias our estimates of cell densities since it remains unclear whether a colony was initiated from a single cell or a filament. In our data, volume increases are best correlated with length or aspect ratio as opposed to width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This suggests that while some volume increases are truly individual cells getting larger, exceptionally large cells are likely chains. In the absence of absolute changes, simply undercounting the number of cells would also produce the observed results. Removal of large, presumably filamentous cells using the same filtering metric as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grant et al., 2021</xref> (0.21 fL ≤ volume ≤ 5.66 fL, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) has little effect on our median cell volumes and hence does not affect results that use the median volume, such as those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. That said, the amount of transcripts estimated from our data is well over what is believed to be present inside a bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Moran et al., 2013</xref>), so CFUs likely underrepresent the number of cells used to make each library. Moreover, a CFU assay only considers living cells, whereas dead cells, depending on their time of death relative to collection time, could also contribute to RNA abundance but not CFUs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s11"><title>A4. Analysis of altered pathways</title><p>Flagellar assembly was the top category in the KEGG results, and categories relating to motility or flagella were frequent in the PPS and GO analyses. Flagella are used for motility and allow bacteria to move to new environments when necessary. Downregulation of flagellar genes is a common adaptation in laboratory-based evolution experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Edwards et al., 2002</xref>) and was a principle finding in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cooper et al., 2003</xref>. We also observed downregulation of the <italic>flgBCDEFGHIJK</italic>, <italic>flgAMN</italic>, and <italic>flhABE</italic> operons in all but one evolved line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, upper panel). These operons contribute various proteins to the flagellar apparatus and are regulated in part by the transcription factors <italic>flhC</italic> and <italic>flhD</italic>, which themselves have complicated regulation dictated by various environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Soutourina and Bertin, 2003</xref>). <italic>flhC</italic> and <italic>flhD</italic> are downregulated in three of the evolved lines but mostly unaltered in the others. These genes are rarely mutated in the clones used in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, lower panel). Because <italic>E. coli</italic> B is thought to be non-motile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jeong et al., 2009</xref>), it’s likely that the downregulation of these genes is due to the removal of an unnecessary function and was fixed early on in the experiment. The lack of parallel changes in transcriptional regulators <italic>flhCD</italic> suggests that other mechanisms may play a part in causing the downregulation of these genes.</p><p>Terms relating to arginine and other amino acids were common in our results. We found that genes related to arginine synthesis were statistically significant and upregulated in many lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Upregulation of genes in amino acid synthesis pathways could increase intracellular amino acid amounts, allowing faster translation and leading to faster growth. Alternatively, the arginine synthesis pathways have many intermediate molecules which can be fed into other metabolic pathways, one of which could also allow faster growth. <italic>argR</italic>, which represses transcription of these genes when L-arginine is abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caldara et al., 2006</xref>), frequently contains mutations in or around its coding sequence and is unaltered in its expression. As such, some of these mutations may have disabled the repressive ability of <italic>argR</italic>, leading to the increased expression we observe here.</p><p>The glyoxylate bypass system allows <italic>E. coli</italic> to utilize acetate as a carbon source. It is composed of the <italic>aceBAK</italic> operon and is regulated by <italic>iclR</italic> and <italic>arcAB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Okamura-Ikeda et al., 1993</xref>). Acetate is a metabolic by-product but can be returned to central carbon metabolism for biosynthetic reactions by this system. Previous studies have shown that mutations in <italic>iclR</italic> and <italic>arcB</italic> cause derepression of their target genes are beneficial in the LTEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Quandt et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with these results, we found that the <italic>aceBAK</italic> operon was upregulated in 9 of 11 evolved lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This confirms the hypothesis from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Quandt et al., 2015</xref>, that mutations to <italic>iclR</italic> and <italic>arcB</italic> derepress enzymes involved in acetate metabolism.</p><p>Sulfur is a critical component of many biological molecules, like amino acids, and participates in creating other structures like iron-sulfur cluster proteins. Organic sulfur is transported across the cell membrane by proteins from the <italic>cysPUWAM</italic> operon, which encodes for a sulfate/thiosulfate importer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sirko et al., 1995</xref>), the <italic>gsiABCD</italic> operon which encodes for a glutathione importer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Suzuki et al., 2005</xref>), the <italic>tauABCD</italic> operon which codes for a taurine importer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eichhorn et al., 2000</xref>), and <italic>tcyP</italic>, the major L-cysteine importer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chonoles Imlay et al., 2015</xref>). We found that many of these genes were downregulated in many lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The <italic>cysB</italic> gene positively regulates these genes and was downregulated in most lines and contained few mutations. The sources of organic sulfur in the medium used in the LTEE are ammonium and magnesium sulfate, for which the <italic>cysPUWAM</italic> operon functions as the importer. The mechanism and reasons for alterations to these operons remain unclear. One hypothesis is that the amount of organic sulfur in the medium is sufficient to allow the downregulation of sulfur transport systems without impacting downstream pathways that require sulfur and negatively impacting growth, thus saving energy by not transcribing or translating them.</p><p>Glycine plays a role in protein construction and can be a building block for other metabolic pathways such as one-carbon metabolism or serine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Okamura-Ikeda et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wilson et al., 1993</xref>). We found that the <italic>gcvTHP</italic> operon, which encodes for proteins in the glycine cleavage system, was upregulated in many of the evolved lines. Increases in the levels of compounds involved in this set of reactions may directly increase growth rates. Though some mutations exist in and around transcriptional regulators of these genes, their effects are unclear. Whether changes to these genes are due to changes in their transcription factors or other changes, the upregulation of these genes in many lines suggests that it may be beneficial.</p><p>Copper and silver have antibacterial properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ingle et al., 2014</xref>), and bacteria have evolved systems to mitigate toxicity from these elements. The <italic>cusCFBA</italic> operon, regulated by the <italic>cusRS</italic> sensor kinase, codes for proteins that transport copper and silver ions out of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nies, 2003</xref>). Additionally, the cytoplasmic copper chaperone <italic>copA</italic>, regulated by <italic>cueR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Meydan et al., 2017</xref>), and <italic>cueO</italic> (multicopper oxidase; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grass and Rensing, 2001</xref>) regulate copper homeostasis in the cell. These genes contained deletions in five of our clones and were downregulated in three of the six lines where they remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Overall, eight of the eleven lines surveyed here had defects in these systems. This suggests that these genes may be selected for removal or downregulation. In contrast to natural environments, the laboratory environment is likely free of copper and silver, rendering these systems dispensable. That said, because many of these genes are casualties of large deletions, it’s not obvious which genes, if any, provide a fitness benefit in the system.</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81979.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>Editor's evaluation</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Weigel</surname><given-names>Detlef</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0243gzr89</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biology Tübingen</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This paper comprehensively analyzes how gene expression has changed in eleven <italic>E. coli</italic> strains after 50,000 generations of laboratory evolution.

Your initial submission has been assessed by a Senior Editor in consultation with a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors. Although the work is of interest, we are not convinced that the findings presented have the potential significance that we require for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, this work describes expression changes that have occurred in long-term evolution lines. The data are interesting and the analyses well-performed. As you will see in the reviewers' comments below, they anticipate that this work will be an excellent resource for the field, but also felt that the manuscript failed to provide the advance in biological insight required for publication in this particular journal. I think these three reviews, collectively, do a good job of articulating the primary concerns. I'll also note that in the post-review discussion, even the reviewer with the most positive originally submitted review (shown below) agreed with concerns raised by the other reviewers in their individual comments. At the same time, we all agreed there was more potential in these data than realized in the current manuscript, so would be happy to consider a substantially revised paper that focuses more clearly on biological insights that can be comprehensively and cleanly addressed with these data. Determining which mutation(s) are driving the expression changes was also identified as something that would increase the impact of this work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors present a detailed analysis of transcriptional (RNA-seq) and translational (Ribo-seq) changes occurring during the LTEE. The manuscript is generally well written and organized, and analyses seem to be appropriate. I have two general comments. First, it would help for the large amount of data to be presented with more focus to the motivating biological question. Second, which of the observed changes are cause, and which consequence, of changes in fitness.</p><p>1. I found it hard to pin down the overarching goal of the work. A lot of data is presented, and it would be helpful for readers to understand the motivating questions that are being addressed. There are certainly many candidates. For example, 'bridging the gap between disparate genomic changes and parallel fitness gains' (L14), '[characterization of] the mechanistic basis of adaptation' (L39), '[exploration of] the role that transcription and translation play in increasing growth rates' (45). To me, some points seem difficult to pin down (what does 'bridging the gap' really entail?) while others oversell actual results (relatively little mechanism is presented, and, as far as I can see, nothing that directly connects any observed molecular phenotype change to a change in fitness/growth rate). I think the Introduction, and the manuscript generally, would be improved by identifying and presenting clear goals of the work, ideally related to significant biological questions that the work allows to be addressed. It is telling that the Discussion is very short, presenting almost no relationship between results presented here and previous work.</p><p>2. Many bacterial genes have growth rate-dependent expression – due, for example, to effects of cell growth on regulator concentrations (e.g., Cell 2009 139:1366). Such dependence will tend to create parallel gene expression changes in faster growing strains relative to a slower growing reference. Clearly, this effect doesn't explain all the changes observed in this study, but it is not clear how many it does explain, and, perhaps more importantly, how to interpret the possibility that a fraction of all expression changes are an effect rather than a cause of fitness increases. At minimum, I'd like the authors to present and discuss this point generally and, where appropriate, to discuss how it effects the specific conclusions they make (and the kind of questions that can reasonably be asked – e.g., growth rate dependent expression changes make it much more difficult to work back from expression changes to causal mutations).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper describes a systems biology study of how RNA expression levels and mRNA translation rates (ribosomal occupancy) changed as eleven <italic>E. coli</italic> populations adapted to laboratory conditions over 50,000 generations during the Lenski long-term evolution experiment (LTEE). The main finding is that the molecular phenotype-that is, which genes had altered expression and by how much-of the eleven independently evolved bacterial strains was more conserved than the underlying genetic changes-that is, which genes directly sustained mutations in the lineage leading to that strain during adaptation. Nearly all changes were at the level of transcriptional control of gene expression, with very few changes in how mRNAs were translated. These findings should be of broad interest because they inform theories about how gene expression evolves during adaptation.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>This study combines RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq to look at changes in RNA abundance and mRNA translation rates. It represents a substantial advance, both in the techniques used and the scope in terms number of <italic>E. coli</italic> strains analyzed, relative to prior work that had analyzed two strains at 20,000 generations using an array-based technology close to twenty years ago. Other positive aspects of the study are that it uses spike-in controls for determining absolute RNA abundance and makes an effort to account for changes in the sizes of evolved cells. Changes in gene regulation are examined at the level of cellular processes but also profiled for specific regulons (e.g., malT and nadR). The finding of an apparent increase in the rate of translation termination is novel. Overall, the methods display a high degree of rigor. Finally, the citation and description of past results from the LTEE is thorough and appropriate. The authors should be commended for this, since this is a rather large amount of history to take into consideration, and they do not appear to have worked on this system before.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>There are some potential limitations/caveats related to the exact growth conditions used by the authors, which have a much higher concentration of the limiting nutrient (glucose) than was present during evolution of these strains in the LTEE. Some interpretation and analysis of how gene expression changes are related to fitness evolution could be improved. The correlation between large deletions and reduced gene expression of the genes contained within them could be examined in a different way that might lead to a significant effect. Inferences about the importance of how increases versus decreases in gene expression contribute to fitness evolution are indirect and do not appear to be completely justified.</p><p>1) Given that this was a major result, we felt that the paper could be improved by including a simple figure illustrating the similarity of the evolved strains to one another compared to how different they all are from the ancestor. We believe it would be easy to show this using a PCA plot. It is also possible that this analysis would show that some of the evolved lines are more like one another than others are, which may be interesting in light of some of our other recommendations.</p><p>2) The manuscript largely assumes that fitness is the same across the eleven LTEE populations. While it is true that the fitness improvements in each population are very similar, both the Wiser et al. 2013 Science paper cited in the Introduction and the follow-up Lenski et al. 2015 Proc Royal Soc B paper, do show that there are also systematic differences between some populations. For example, the hypermutators do tend to have higher fitness than the others, on average. There is also the case of population Ara+1, which appears to be lagging in fitness because it sustained an unusually large number of transposon-mediated mutations (Consuegra et al. 2021 Nat Comm). Eleven clones are probably not enough to try to start predicting fitness from gene expression profiles, but it would be interesting if any global analysis of the data found that outliers in terms of gene expression were also outliers in terms of fitness.</p><p>3) We think it is important to change the plotted per CFU values in Figure 1 to be per typical single cell volume. The filamentation observed in several of the evolved lineages dramatically affects the estimates of RNA abundance per CFU. While this is factually correct according to the methods and noted in a supplementary analysis paragraph, it would be much better to correct Figure 1 to use a different basis than CFUs, so that it does not give the impression that the per cell mRNA levels changed by &gt;10-fold for some evolved strains. We believe the authors could correct this to be &quot;per evolved cell volume&quot;, by estimating how many typical cell equivalents there are on average per CFU (filamented or not).</p><p>4) The observation that downregulated versus upregulated genes are more likely to show the same change in other lines is interesting (Line 208-212). However, we don't understand why these results indicate that there are &quot;fewer genes and pathways whose downregulation increases fitness&quot; necessarily. What is the connection to fitness?</p><p>5) The test of the hypothesis that genes that were deleted in some lineages would be downregulated in other lineages in which they were not deleted gave a negative result. As the authors suggest, it may be that downregulation of just one of the deleted genes yields the fitness benefit for the entire deletion. In addition to the current analysis, we would recommend repeating the analysis in a way that tests this refined hypothesis that at least one deleted gene is downregulated in the other lines. It may be possible to identify which gene or genes &quot;drove&quot; the deletion and which genes were collateral deletions.</p><p>6) <italic>E. coli</italic> cells used for RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq were cultured in a slightly different medium than was used for the evolution experiment. The base media is the same, but a much higher concentrations of glucose was used (4,000 µg/mL versus 25 µg/mL). Presumably, this was necessary in order to be able to harvest enough cells for the RNAseq and ribosomal profiling experiment. Still, this difference should be noted and any affect that it might have on interpreting the data should be discussed. There also appears to be another minor difference in that the Lenski website recipe calls for thiamine supplementation.</p><p>7) There are some deep genetic divergences and large phenotypic changes in some of the LTEE populations that make it important to know which type of clonal isolate was analyzed here to interpret the results. Most importantly, population Ara-3 evolved citrate utilization, which enables it to grow to a higher cell density. Is the clone that was analyzed Cit+ or Cit-? Also, population Ara-2 diverged into &quot;large&quot; and &quot;small&quot; colony types. What is the type of the clone that was analyzed from each of these populations? If a Cit+ clone was used, were cells harvested at an early enough point that gene expression reflects growth of these cells on glucose (or a glucose/citrate mixture) rather than solely on citrate?</p><p>8) The Methods section should be revised. Currently, the quality and level of detail is very uneven. There are placeholders and mixed citation styles that make it look like some of this section was still in rough draft form. Certain sections may give too much information. For example, the RNAseq library preparation methods seem to be exactly from a standard NEBnext kit? It may be better to state the differences from the standard protocol, if any, in this section. Other sections seem to leave out important information. The cell size section discusses measuring the length of the cells, but the Results on line 98 focus on cell volume, not length. As another example, perhaps too much detail is given in terms of the gel run time on Line 537, but the key detail of what the fragment size range of the &quot;region corresponding to the expected product size&quot; that was excised from this gel is not provided on Line 538.</p><p>9) Several of the earlier Results subsections mention that a result from the RNA-Seq data was similar for the Ribo-Seq data before the Ribo-Seq data is fully described.

As an evolutionary biologist (not a microbiologist), my primary interest is what does this study of expression add to our understanding of evolution within the LTEE. This work is descriptive rather than testing well-motivated hypotheses but the authors have unearthed some intriguing patterns.</p><p>1) Much of the emphasis in this work is on the extent to which changes in expression are parallel. I have several concerns on this front.</p><p>a) What is the expectation about the degree of parallelism? In several places the authors refer to there being a &quot;high&quot; degree of parallelism. &quot;High&quot; compared to what? Zero? Is their null expectation for populations evolving in identical environments to have zero parallel expression changes? In Figure 3, they make a comparison of shared expression changes to shared genetic changes. Of course, a single genetic change (for example, in a transcription factor) could cause expression changes in many downstream genes so should not a higher number of shared expression changes than genetic changes be expected? I find it bothersome to be told that there is a &quot;high&quot; degree of parallelism when there is no expectation. Was it possible to observe 5 times more parallelism than they observed? Compared to that possibility, they observed a &quot;low&quot; degree of parallelism.</p><p>b) A practical issue with parallelism is statistical power. Though statistical details are annoyingly scant throughout, it appears the authors have typically required a gene to exhibit &quot;significant&quot; evolutionary change in two (or more) lines to be considered parallel. Because statistical power to detect change in any one line is less than 100% (and for many changes will probably be more like 10%), the power to observe parallelism will be limited, perhaps severely, in many cases. Unfortunately, I have no sense of the extent to which parallelism in this study is underestimated because of this problem.</p><p>So what are we left with? In many cases throughout the manuscript we can say there is some parallelism. I do not find the observation of some degree of parallelism particularly interesting or surprising, especially given what we already know about the LTEE. To me, the question is whether the degree of parallelism meets expectation or is remarkable and that question is not addressed.</p><p>2) The negative correlation between evolved change and ancestral expression level.</p><p>This pattern shown in Figure 2C and D and Figure S6 is surprising to me. To me, this was one of the most important results and should have been more prominently featured. My a priori expectation would be no correlation, yet they observe this negative correlation in every line (Figure S6). The authors hypothesize that this may be because of a biophysical constraint (&quot;maximally expressed&quot; genes can only evolve lower expression and &quot;minimally expressed&quot; genes can only evolve increased expression). That hypothesis should certainly be considered. I have no better hypothesis but I find it surprising if there are enough genes close to these limits to drive this pattern. From Figure S6 it does not appear this pattern is driven by genes at the range limits of ancestral expression. Is there work in <italic>E. coli</italic> about whether a reasonable fraction of genes are at an expression limit? (For genes at the high expression limit, presumably gene duplication can occur as a means to increase expression. I realize such mutations would be rare relative to point mutations and small indels.) The reported pattern would be even more compelling if they had some additional means to evaluate the biophysical constraint hypothesis.</p><p>3) Parallelism of up- vs. down-regulated expression</p><p>Though there are problems with expectations for the extent of &quot;parallelism&quot;, this issue is avoided in some cases. One intriguing case is for parallelism in genes that evolve up- vs. down-regulated expression. The authors report that &quot;more downregulations were shared across lines than upregulations&quot;. To me, this was one of the most interesting patterns they reported because there is a simple expectation of equality between up and down regulation. However, I have several concerns.</p><p>a) It wasn't clear to me there was any statistical test of this claim.</p><p>b) It seems that one should control for the number of down vs- up regulated genes (i.e., if there are 500 down regulated genes and 200 up-regulated ones in Line 1, then it would not be particularly interesting we found that Line 2 shared 50 of the down-regulated ones but only 20 of the up-regulated ones</p><p>c) The authors also report that down-regulated changes tend to larger in magnitude than up-regulated ones. This is a key piece of information. With respect to the power comment above (1b) this means that there will be greater power to detect parallel changes for up-regulated vs. down-regulated changes.</p><p>I suggest using a statistical model that attempts to account for these issues.</p><p>4) Importance of transcription vs translation to expression evolution</p><p>a) The authors find highly correlated values between RNAseq and Riboseq data. This is not at all surprising. Such correlations at the genome level are not useful because the among-gene variation in expression is so large (I have a similar complaint with lines 150-153).</p><p>b) The authors use Riborex to test for evolved differences in ribosomal densities and find very few changes. They use this as a basis for arguing that transcription is far more important than translation for expression evolution. They may well be correct. However, I suspect that the statistical power to detect changes in ribosomal density is much lower than for detecting transcription changes (e.g., ribosomal density changes are hampered by measurement error in BOTH RNAseq and RIBOseq data). Given that the power to detect ribosomal density changes is almost certainly much lower than for transcription changes, it seems premature to make much of a claim about transcription vs. translation.</p><p>5) Faster translation termination</p><p>Figure 4C is quite dramatic. That is a very interesting result.</p><p>a) This another example where too few information is provided. What is the statistical test behind the p-value shown? Based on the figure, there is a highly significant difference but I suspect the test they did was wrong. Did they run a model that accounts for both &quot;line&quot; and the same codon represented in every line? I suspect they did a two-sample t-test and thus have an inflated degrees of freedom.</p><p>b) Naively, I would have thought there would always be selection favouring faster translation termination (not just in the LTEE). Is there some plausible reason for why there should selection for faster translation termination in the LTEE than in the many millions of years prior to the start of the experiment?</p><p>In summary, this is a descriptive study. While this work adds to our understanding of the LTEE, its importance for evolutionary biology is less clear. The impact of this manuscript will be determined by the authors making clear what they view as the most important patterns and the interpretation of those patterns.</p><p>With respect to my comment 3, here is a potential way to improve these issues: Using all genes that have evolved significantly in at least 1 line, run something like the following statistical model:</p><p>model &lt;- glm(cbind(Nsig, 11 – Nsig) ~ UpOrDown + Magnitude + AncExpression, family = binomial)</p><p>where Nsig is the number of lines where it significant</p><p>UpOrDown is an indicator whether expression evolved up or down</p><p>Magnitude is the |Log2FC| averaged over only the lines where it evolved significantly (because those are the lines that determined the genes inclusion in the set for this analysis)</p><p>AncExpression is the Log(TPM) in the ancestor.</p><p>The last two terms are an attempt to control for power to detect parallelism. It won't be perfect but it will be a considerable improvement over the current version.</p><p>Figure 2C. &quot;…only statistically significant&quot; genes. Significant in what comparison?

Please do add the PCA, as suggested by Reviewer 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The current draft of this article is improved, though it still feels a little disjointed and meandering. It lacks the razor focus that takes one from a research question in the introduction, to the most relevant results addressing that question, and finally to a discussion of those results in the context of the field and other studies. That said, these are very interesting and complex datasets. The article communicates a number of interesting findings clearly, and it makes the datasets available so that others can continue to analyze them.</p><p>1) I found the paragraph beginning on Line 146 describing the negative relationship between fold-change in evolved gene expression and gene expression level in the ancestor to be problematic in two ways.</p><p>First, I worry about how possible limitations in what types of expression changes can be detected may affect the regressions in Figure 1—figure supplement 3b. For highly expressed genes, I don't doubt that there is more downregulation than upregulation. But, for lowly expressed genes, a smaller initial number of counts will limit how large of a negative fold-change could be observed at some point and whether such a change can be judged as statistically significant (and therefore included in the regression). It seems like a non-negligible number of genes only have &lt;10 counts per sample to begin with, if I am interpreting Figure 1—figure supplement 1b correctly. I believe this means that DESeq2 is unlikely to be able to assign statistical significance for lower expression for these genes and that if it did, it would be prone to underestimating the fold-change if there are observations of zero counts. This &quot;missing&quot; or &quot;misplaced&quot; data in the lower left quadrant of the graphs could contribute to a (somewhat spurious) negative relationship and overemphasize this result.</p><p>(Related: Figure 1—figure supplement 3b has two p-values shown in red and black on each graph. I assume those are for two mutually exclusive subsets of the data. It should be explained in the legend.)</p><p>Second, the explanations and discussion given here are somewhat plausible and interesting, but they also seem incomplete and insufficient. For example, &quot;This negative relationship is likely a by-product of increased mRNA abundances.&quot; Why is this? – I genuinely don't understand. As another example, &quot;biophysical constraints&quot; is a rather vague term. Are we talking about physical space inside cells? RNA polymerase abundance? DNA accessibility? I think at least an example or two of what the authors mean would need to be included. These additions would lead to much more discussion than this result probably warrants in terms of its overall importance to the manuscript (esp. if my statistical concerns are justified).</p><p>My recommendation is to remove this regression result from the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have adequately addressed the few comments I made in my initial review. I remain of the view that the results are somewhat oversold, especially with the several implied and direct references to the work establishing a mechanistic link to fitness (e.g., &quot;To *understand* how different genomic changes lead to parallel fitness gains …&quot; L74). I suggest the authors read through the work carefully to make sure that all promises are kept.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study explores the role of parallel gene expression change (both transcriptional and translational) in the long-term evolution experiment (LTEE).

I appreciate that the authors have explored parallelism from transcription, translation, and pathway levels down to nucleotide changes, and have included a phenotypic angle in the study.</p><p>I have read the manuscript first and then looked at the reviewer comments/responses to the reviewers. In my opinion, the authors have done a good job of addressing the previous reviewer's comments and the current version of this manuscript is well written and represents a significant contribution to the field. My only comment is that I wanted to see a 2D scatterplot of the lines in PC space in figure 1. Currently, Figure 1D summarises this analysis, but it could be made 50% smaller and a scatterplot of lines in PC space added (rather than putting it in the supplement).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81979.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors present a detailed analysis of transcriptional (RNA-seq) and translational (Ribo-seq) changes occurring during the LTEE. The manuscript is generally well written and organized, and analyses seem to be appropriate. I have two general comments. First, it would help for the large amount of data to be presented with more focus to the motivating biological question. Second, which of the observed changes are cause, and which consequence, of changes in fitness.</p><p>1. I found it hard to pin down the overarching goal of the work. A lot of data is presented, and it would be helpful for readers to understand the motivating questions that are being addressed. There are certainly many candidates. For example, 'bridging the gap between disparate genomic changes and parallel fitness gains' (L14), '[characterization of] the mechanistic basis of adaptation' (L39), '[exploration of] the role that transcription and translation play in increasing growth rates' (45). To me, some points seem difficult to pin down (what does 'bridging the gap' really entail?) while others oversell actual results (relatively little mechanism is presented, and, as far as I can see, nothing that directly connects any observed molecular phenotype change to a change in fitness/growth rate). I think the Introduction, and the manuscript generally, would be improved by identifying and presenting clear goals of the work, ideally related to significant biological questions that the work allows to be addressed. It is telling that the Discussion is very short, presenting almost no relationship between results presented here and previous work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their critical reading of our work and their constructive suggestions. We have rewritten and rearranged significant portions of the paper in order to present a clearer idea of the main goals of the work, as well as better partition the large amounts of data presented. We now have a section towards the end of the introduction detailing the specific questions we plan to address in the manuscript. We have also reworded ambiguous phrases such as “bridging the gap” to be more specific so the intent of the sentence is clear. Finally, we have also significantly expanded the Discussion section and added additional points in the Results section that contextualize our findings with other published work on the LTEE. We believe these changes have significantly improved the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Many bacterial genes have growth rate-dependent expression – due, for example, to effects of cell growth on regulator concentrations (e.g., Cell 2009 139:1366). Such dependence will tend to create parallel gene expression changes in faster growing strains relative to a slower growing reference. Clearly, this effect doesn't explain all the changes observed in this study, but it is not clear how many it does explain, and, perhaps more importantly, how to interpret the possibility that a fraction of all expression changes are an effect rather than a cause of fitness increases. At minimum, I'd like the authors to present and discuss this point generally and, where appropriate, to discuss how it effects the specific conclusions they make (and the kind of questions that can reasonably be asked – e.g., growth rate dependent expression changes make it much more difficult to work back from expression changes to causal mutations).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and agree that this is an extremely important point that we had initially ignored. We have added a section in the Discussion that addresses this point. In short, we acknowledge the fact that some proportion of the differentially expressed genes observed in our datasets are going to be consequential to the fact that lines in LTEE are growing faster.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This paper describes a systems biology study of how RNA expression levels and mRNA translation rates (ribosomal occupancy) changed as eleven <italic>E. coli</italic> populations adapted to laboratory conditions over 50,000 generations during the Lenski long-term evolution experiment (LTEE). The main finding is that the molecular phenotype-that is, which genes had altered expression and by how much-of the eleven independently evolved bacterial strains was more conserved than the underlying genetic changes-that is, which genes directly sustained mutations in the lineage leading to that strain during adaptation. Nearly all changes were at the level of transcriptional control of gene expression, with very few changes in how mRNAs were translated. These findings should be of broad interest because they inform theories about how gene expression evolves during adaptation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their overall positive impression of our manuscript and it’s appeal to a broad audience.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths</p><p>This study combines RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq to look at changes in RNA abundance and mRNA translation rates. It represents a substantial advance, both in the techniques used and the scope in terms number of <italic>E. coli</italic> strains analyzed, relative to prior work that had analyzed two strains at 20,000 generations using an array-based technology close to twenty years ago. Other positive aspects of the study are that it uses spike-in controls for determining absolute RNA abundance and makes an effort to account for changes in the sizes of evolved cells. Changes in gene regulation are examined at the level of cellular processes but also profiled for specific regulons (e.g., malT and nadR). The finding of an apparent increase in the rate of translation termination is novel. Overall, the methods display a high degree of rigor. Finally, the citation and description of past results from the LTEE is thorough and appropriate. The authors should be commended for this, since this is a rather large amount of history to take into consideration, and they do not appear to have worked on this system before.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for their acknowledgement of the tremendous amount of effort that has gone into this manuscript, the novelty of our findings, and the attention to rigor and details employed in reaching the final conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses</p><p>There are some potential limitations/caveats related to the exact growth conditions used by the authors, which have a much higher concentration of the limiting nutrient (glucose) than was present during evolution of these strains in the LTEE. Some interpretation and analysis of how gene expression changes are related to fitness evolution could be improved. The correlation between large deletions and reduced gene expression of the genes contained within them could be examined in a different way that might lead to a significant effect. Inferences about the importance of how increases versus decreases in gene expression contribute to fitness evolution are indirect and do not appear to be completely justified.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for a critical reading of the manuscript and their feedback. We hope a significant rewriting and rearrangement of the manuscript has addressed many of their concerns. We address the specific concerns raised by the reviewer below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Given that this was a major result, we felt that the paper could be improved by including a simple figure illustrating the similarity of the evolved strains to one another compared to how different they all are from the ancestor. We believe it would be easy to show this using a PCA plot. It is also possible that this analysis would show that some of the evolved lines are more like one another than others are, which may be interesting in light of some of our other recommendations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that figures showing the relationship between evolved lines would be a valuable addition manuscript. We performed PCA based on fold-changes in mRNA levels across all evolved lines and describe the findings in Figure S2 and accompanying text in the results. Briefly, the PCA reveals that evolved lines Ara-2 and Ara-3 show the largest distance in principal components relative to other lines. This is, perhaps, unsurprising given that Ara-3 has evolved the ability to aerobically metabolize citrate as a carbon source (Blount et al., 2012), and Ara-2 has developed distinct, coexisting ecotypes (Rozen et al., 2009). However, despite some changes in expression levels unique to these two lineages, the high overall correlation in fold-changes in mRNA expression levels suggest that most changes are shared and have occurred in parallel across evolved lineages (Figure 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The manuscript largely assumes that fitness is the same across the eleven LTEE populations. While it is true that the fitness improvements in each population are very similar, both the Wiser et al. 2013 Science paper cited in the Introduction and the follow-up Lenski et al. 2015 Proc Royal Soc B paper, do show that there are also systematic differences between some populations. For example, the hypermutators do tend to have higher fitness than the others, on average. There is also the case of population Ara+1, which appears to be lagging in fitness because it sustained an unusually large number of transposon-mediated mutations (Consuegra et al. 2021 Nat Comm). Eleven clones are probably not enough to try to start predicting fitness from gene expression profiles, but it would be interesting if any global analysis of the data found that outliers in terms of gene expression were also outliers in terms of fitness.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting to identify expression drivers of fitness differences between individual lines. While a complete analysis and prediction of fitness effects from gene expression profiles will require a detailed whole-cell mechanistic model (Macklin et al., 2020), PCA of fold-changes in expression levels can provide crude insights into whether there exist a set of genes whose expression changes while drive differences in growth rates. We find that while the PCA does separate some of the mutators from the non-mutators, the first two principal components are largely driven by expression profiles of Ara-3 and Ara-2, likely due to their unique phenotypes of citrate metabolism and distinct ecotypes, respectively. We’ve added this to the text in the Results subsection “Variation in expression changes across evolved lines”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) We think it is important to change the plotted per CFU values in Figure 1 to be per typical single cell volume. The filamentation observed in several of the evolved lineages dramatically affects the estimates of RNA abundance per CFU. While this is factually correct according to the methods and noted in a supplementary analysis paragraph, it would be much better to correct Figure 1 to use a different basis than CFUs, so that it does not give the impression that the per cell mRNA levels changed by &gt;10-fold for some evolved strains. We believe the authors could correct this to be &quot;per evolved cell volume&quot;, by estimating how many typical cell equivalents there are on average per CFU (filamented or not).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this note about CFU and our metrics on estimating RNA abundance per CFU. While we agree with the reviewer that using CFU as a basis might give an incorrect impression on “per cell” estimates of RNA, using “per evolved cell volume” introduces additional challenges. Firstly, some colonies may have been formed by multiple cells and the number of cells per filament vary widely across lines. As a result, taking a median or mean cell-volume for each line can be misleading. This is evidenced by the fact that the median cell volume changes by ~3 fold but RNAs/CFU has a ~100 fold range. Therefore, dividing RNAs/typical-cell-volume will indicate that the density of RNAs per volume has increased dramatically. While we do expect an increase in density of RNAs, as not all macromolecules scale with cell-size, this apparent increase might be artificial due to our CFU measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The observation that downregulated versus upregulated genes are more likely to show the same change in other lines is interesting (Line 208-212). However, we don't understand why these results indicate that there are &quot;fewer genes and pathways whose downregulation increases fitness&quot; necessarily. What is the connection to fitness?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the poor phrasing of the sentence that led to confusion. The key observation here is that pathways that are downregulated are shared across lines more often than pathways that are upregulated. Assuming that changes in genes/pathways are adaptive, there might be a smaller set of genes/pathways whose downregulation consistently increases fitness thereby leading to higher observed parallelism in these pathways. On the other hand, since pathways that are upregulated tend to be somewhat unique to each line, indicating that there might be more diverse pathways whose upregulation might be adaptive. Due to the speculative nature of this analysis, we have removed it from the revised manuscript..</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The test of the hypothesis that genes that were deleted in some lineages would be downregulated in other lineages in which they were not deleted gave a negative result. As the authors suggest, it may be that downregulation of just one of the deleted genes yields the fitness benefit for the entire deletion. In addition to the current analysis, we would recommend repeating the analysis in a way that tests this refined hypothesis that at least one deleted gene is downregulated in the other lines. It may be possible to identify which gene or genes &quot;drove&quot; the deletion and which genes were collateral deletions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting a test to identify deletions that might be the driver of large deletions observed in LTEE. However, based on comments from other reviewers, and in an effort to present a coherent narrative in this work, we’ve chosen to remove this section of the paper. We have, however, worked hard to share the data and code in a machine-readable format with detailed documentation with the hope that other groups will be able to utilize them to test this and other interesting hypotheses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) <italic>E. coli</italic> cells used for RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq were cultured in a slightly different medium than was used for the evolution experiment. The base media is the same, but a much higher concentrations of glucose was used (4,000 µg/mL versus 25 µg/mL). Presumably, this was necessary in order to be able to harvest enough cells for the RNAseq and ribosomal profiling experiment. Still, this difference should be noted and any affect that it might have on interpreting the data should be discussed. There also appears to be another minor difference in that the Lenski website recipe calls for thiamine supplementation.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer that a higher concentration of glucose used here could in principle introduce artifacts that might be hard to identify. The reviewer is correct in pointing out that this higher concentration was necessary to obtain enough cells for ribo-seq experiments. We have now added a section in the supplement “The potential effects of increased sugar in the culture medium” to highlight potential caveats. With regards to thiamine supplementation, all our media were supplemented with thiamine. This detail was inadvertently left out in the methods section and has been corrected in the revised version where we explicitly state that the bacteria were cultured in medium as per the recipe on the LTEE website (with the added note about glucose supplementation).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) There are some deep genetic divergences and large phenotypic changes in some of the LTEE populations that make it important to know which type of clonal isolate was analyzed here to interpret the results. Most importantly, population Ara-3 evolved citrate utilization, which enables it to grow to a higher cell density. Is the clone that was analyzed Cit+ or Cit-? Also, population Ara-2 diverged into &quot;large&quot; and &quot;small&quot; colony types. What is the type of the clone that was analyzed from each of these populations? If a Cit+ clone was used, were cells harvested at an early enough point that gene expression reflects growth of these cells on glucose (or a glucose/citrate mixture) rather than solely on citrate?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the details of the strains used in this study in the revised text. Briefly, We have a Cit+ Ara-3 and based on comparing mutations in our clone to those described in Plucain et al. 2014, our Ara-2 is of the L ecotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The Methods section should be revised. Currently, the quality and level of detail is very uneven. There are placeholders and mixed citation styles that make it look like some of this section was still in rough draft form. Certain sections may give too much information. For example, the RNAseq library preparation methods seem to be exactly from a standard NEBnext kit? It may be better to state the differences from the standard protocol, if any, in this section. Other sections seem to leave out important information. The cell size section discusses measuring the length of the cells, but the Results on line 98 focus on cell volume, not length. As another example, perhaps too much detail is given in terms of the gel run time on Line 537, but the key detail of what the fragment size range of the &quot;region corresponding to the expected product size&quot; that was excised from this gel is not provided on Line 538.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the unevenness of details in our methods section.

As an evolutionary biologist (not a microbiologist), my primary interest is what does this study of expression add to our understanding of evolution within the LTEE. This work is descriptive rather than testing well-motivated hypotheses but the authors have unearthed some intriguing patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their detailed comments and suggestions on the manuscript. We agree with the reviewer that one of the primary goals of our work was to provide a valuable resource to enable testing of specific hypotheses in evolutionary biology. We have uncovered interesting patterns in these high-throughput datasets and tested several specific hypotheses. However, we agree that the writing, and the presentation of the hypotheses/data did not always make it obvious what was being tested. We have revised the manuscript from the ground-up and hope this revised version helps alleviate concerns that the reviewer brought up here. We address specific comments below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Much of the emphasis in this work is on the extent to which changes in expression are parallel. I have several concerns on this front.</p><p>a) What is the expectation about the degree of parallelism? In several places the authors refer to there being a &quot;high&quot; degree of parallelism. &quot;High&quot; compared to what? Zero? Is their null expectation for populations evolving in identical environments to have zero parallel expression changes? In Figure 3, they make a comparison of shared expression changes to shared genetic changes. Of course, a single genetic change (for example, in a transcription factor) could cause expression changes in many downstream genes so should not a higher number of shared expression changes than genetic changes be expected? I find it bothersome to be told that there is a &quot;high&quot; degree of parallelism when there is no expectation. Was it possible to observe 5 times more parallelism than they observed? Compared to that possibility, they observed a &quot;low&quot; degree of parallelism.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this critique and completely agree with their points regarding the need for an appropriate null model to compare against the observed degree of parallelism in gene expression. In the revised manuscript we have added detailed analyses based on both standard statistical models and simulation results to address this issue. We first show that the null distribution of shared differentially expressed genes across evolved lines is well approximated by the Sum of Independent Non-Identical Binomial (SINIB) random variables (Liu and Quertermous, 2018) We show that the observed degree of parallelism in expression changes is truly remarkable. For instance, if differentially expressed genes were randomly distributed across all lines, we would expect ~3 altered genes to be shared across five or more lines. Instead we find that 117 genes have significant and consistent altered expression levels in at least five evolved lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) A practical issue with parallelism is statistical power. Though statistical details are annoyingly scant throughout, it appears the authors have typically required a gene to exhibit &quot;significant&quot; evolutionary change in two (or more) lines to be considered parallel. Because statistical power to detect change in any one line is less than 100% (and for many changes will probably be more like 10%), the power to observe parallelism will be limited, perhaps severely, in many cases. Unfortunately, I have no sense of the extent to which parallelism in this study is underestimated because of this problem.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure what the reviewer means by the “statistical power to detect change in any one line is less than 100%” The statistical power in classifying any single gene to be differentially expressed is a direct function of read coverage for that gene. There are two points we would like to highlight here. First, the read coverage per gene in our sequencing data is quite high even after removing PCR duplicates (Figure S1). This is one of the reasons for the high correlation between biological replicates. Second, we designate a gene as differentially expressed at a stringent False Discovery Rate (FDR) cutoff (q-value &lt; 0.01). Despite these stringent cutoffs, we find that about 270 genes are differentially expressed on average across all evolved lines. We have highlighted these details in the revised manuscript, and hope that this alleviates some of the concerns that the reviewer had regarding statistical power in our analysis.</p><p>With regards to when a gene should be considered to be parallely changed across lines, any threshold on the number of lines is going to be arbitrary. In the revised manuscript, we have refrained from calling anything as parallely altered unless it was observed in at least 4 lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>So what are we left with? In many cases throughout the manuscript we can say there is some parallelism. I do not find the observation of some degree of parallelism particularly interesting or surprising, especially given what we already know about the LTEE. To me, the question is whether the degree of parallelism meets expectation or is remarkable and that question is not addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sympathetic to the reviewer’s sentiments and hope that the revised manuscript has sufficiently addressed these concerns, and convinced the reviewer that the degree of parallelism in gene expression changes is quite remarkable (Figures 1E, and S2C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The negative correlation between evolved change and ancestral expression level.</p><p>This pattern shown in Figure 2C and D and Figure S6 is surprising to me. To me, this was one of the most important results and should have been more prominently featured. My a priori expectation would be no correlation, yet they observe this negative correlation in every line (Figure S6). The authors hypothesize that this may be because of a biophysical constraint (&quot;maximally expressed&quot; genes can only evolve lower expression and &quot;minimally expressed&quot; genes can only evolve increased expression). That hypothesis should certainly be considered. I have no better hypothesis but I find it surprising if there are enough genes close to these limits to drive this pattern. From Figure S6 it does not appear this pattern is driven by genes at the range limits of ancestral expression. Is there work in <italic>E. coli</italic> about whether a reasonable fraction of genes are at an expression limit? (For genes at the high expression limit, presumably gene duplication can occur as a means to increase expression. I realize such mutations would be rare relative to point mutations and small indels.) The reported pattern would be even more compelling if they had some additional means to evaluate the biophysical constraint hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer that this is indeed a very interesting pattern, and one that we hadn’t anticipated prior to this analysis. In the revised manuscript, we have significantly expanded the discussion on biophysical constraints on gene expression in the Results subsection “Magnitude and direction of expression changes”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Parallelism of up- vs. down-regulated expression</p><p>Though there are problems with expectations for the extent of &quot;parallelism&quot;, this issue is avoided in some cases. One intriguing case is for parallelism in genes that evolve up- vs. down-regulated expression. The authors report that &quot;more downregulations were shared across lines than upregulations&quot;. To me, this was one of the most interesting patterns they reported because there is a simple expectation of equality between up and down regulation. However, I have several concerns.</p><p>a) It wasn't clear to me there was any statistical test of this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have added the following text along with the appropriate statistical tests for these claims.</p><p>“While the number of DEGs vary widely across lines (Figure S2B), we find that in 7 out of 11 evolved lines, significantly more genes were downregulated than upregulated (Binomial test, p-value &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the magnitude of fold-changes of downregulated DEGs were significantly higher than fold-changes of upregulated DEGs in all 11 evolved lineages (KS-test, p-value &lt; 0.0001) (Figure S2D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) It seems that one should control for the number of down vs- up regulated genes (i.e., if there are 500 down regulated genes and 200 up-regulated ones in Line 1, then it would not be particularly interesting we found that Line 2 shared 50 of the down-regulated ones but only 20 of the up-regulated ones</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this important point to our attention. In the revised statistical tests for parallelism in expression changes, we use the SINIB model that explicitly takes into account the differences in the number of up/down-regulated genes in each line (Figure 1D, S2C).</p><p>We hope that this alleviates the reviewer’s concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The authors also report that down-regulated changes tend to larger in magnitude than up-regulated ones. This is a key piece of information. With respect to the power comment above (1b) this means that there will be greater power to detect parallel changes for up-regulated vs. down-regulated changes.</p><p>I suggest using a statistical model that attempts to account for these issues.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that given the smaller magnitude of up-regulated genes, we might be able to identify a smaller set of significantly altered genes at a particular statistical threshold (q-value &lt; 0.01). To address this issue, we quantify the degree of parallelism using the SINIB model in both down- and up-regulated genes separately. Despite the differences in effect sizes and number of differentially expressed genes, for both these groups of genes, we find a significantly higher number of shared DEGs than expected by chance (Figure 1E and S2C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Importance of transcription vs translation to expression evolution</p><p>a) The authors find highly correlated values between RNAseq and Riboseq data. This is not at all surprising. Such correlations at the genome level are not useful because the among-gene variation in expression is so large (I have a similar complaint with lines 150-153).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and following the reviewer’s advice, we have removed correlations between RNA-seq and Riboseq expression levels (transcript-per-million (TPM) correlations). We now report correlations in fold-changes in these two datasets instead, which removes the effects of among-gene variation in expression levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The authors use Riborex to test for evolved differences in ribosomal densities and find very few changes. They use this as a basis for arguing that transcription is far more important than translation for expression evolution. They may well be correct. However, I suspect that the statistical power to detect changes in ribosomal density is much lower than for detecting transcription changes (e.g., ribosomal density changes are hampered by measurement error in BOTH RNAseq and RIBOseq data). Given that the power to detect ribosomal density changes is almost certainly much lower than for transcription changes, it seems premature to make much of a claim about transcription vs. translation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, in principle, that the statistical power in detecting changes in ribosomal densities is lower than detecting changes at either scales independently. However, in our experience of working with riboseq data across a wide-range of species with similar sequencing depth (and in some cases lower depths), we still find hundreds of genes with altered ribosome-densities. In that sense, the very small number of altered genes here is surprising. Nonetheless, we have rewritten this section to moderate this claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Faster translation termination</p><p>Figure 4C is quite dramatic. That is a very interesting result.</p><p>a) This another example where too few information is provided. What is the statistical test behind the p-value shown? Based on the figure, there is a highly significant difference but I suspect the test they did was wrong. Did they run a model that accounts for both &quot;line&quot; and the same codon represented in every line? I suspect they did a two-sample t-test and thus have an inflated degrees of freedom.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this incorrect statistical test. Originally, we did employ a two-sample t-test, which does not account for the non-independence between lines. We have updated this analysis to compare changes (i.e. evolved vs. ancestral lines) between the ribosome-densities of sense-codons and stop-codons using a linear mixed model with random (i.e. line-specific) effects. We find that these new results are consistent with our original claim that stop-codons have significantly lower ribosome-densities compared to the sense codon ribosome-densities Nonetheless, the magnitude of this effect is variable across lines (decreases ranged from -0.088 to -0.657 log fold change in ribosome densities relative to the sense codons). This indicates that all evolved lines experienced an increased translation termination rate (relative to the ancestral line), but some evolved lines experienced a greater increase in termination rate than others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Naively, I would have thought there would always be selection favouring faster translation termination (not just in the LTEE). Is there some plausible reason for why there should selection for faster translation termination in the LTEE than in the many millions of years prior to the start of the experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>While faster translation termination may increase ribosome recycling and enable faster growth, it comes at the expense of a loss of a key regulatory mechanism in translational control. As a result, it remains unclear if these regulatory changes can evolve in more complex environments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With respect to my comment 3, here is a potential way to improve these issues: Using all genes that have evolved significantly in at least 1 line, run something like the following statistical model:</p><p>model &lt;- glm(cbind(Nsig, 11 – Nsig) ~ UpOrDown + Magnitude + AncExpression, family = binomial)</p><p>where Nsig is the number of lines where it significant</p><p>UpOrDown is an indicator whether expression evolved up or down</p><p>Magnitude is the |Log2FC| averaged over only the lines where it evolved significantly (because those are the lines that determined the genes inclusion in the set for this analysis)</p><p>AncExpression is the Log(TPM) in the ancestor.</p><p>The last two terms are an attempt to control for power to detect parallelism. It won't be perfect but it will be a considerable improvement over the current version.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting a possible solution to test for significant parallelism. We have employed a different approach as outlined earlier (SINIB) that we hope will prove sufficient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2C. &quot;…only statistically significant&quot; genes.

We have made all the edits suggested by the reviewers and look forward to the manuscript’s acceptance for publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The current draft of this article is improved, though it still feels a little disjointed and meandering. It lacks the razor focus that takes one from a research question in the introduction, to the most relevant results addressing that question, and finally to a discussion of those results in the context of the field and other studies. That said, these are very interesting and complex datasets. The article communicates a number of interesting findings clearly, and it makes the datasets available so that others can continue to analyze them.</p><p>1) I found the paragraph beginning on Line 146 describing the negative relationship between fold-change in evolved gene expression and gene expression level in the ancestor to be problematic in two ways.</p><p>First, I worry about how possible limitations in what types of expression changes can be detected may affect the regressions in Figure 1—figure supplement 3b. For highly expressed genes, I don't doubt that there is more downregulation than upregulation. But, for lowly expressed genes, a smaller initial number of counts will limit how large of a negative fold-change could be observed at some point and whether such a change can be judged as statistically significant (and therefore included in the regression). It seems like a non-negligible number of genes only have &lt;10 counts per sample to begin with, if I am interpreting Figure 1—figure supplement 1b correctly. I believe this means that DESeq2 is unlikely to be able to assign statistical significance for lower expression for these genes and that if it did, it would be prone to underestimating the fold-change if there are observations of zero counts. This &quot;missing&quot; or &quot;misplaced&quot; data in the lower left quadrant of the graphs could contribute to a (somewhat spurious) negative relationship and overemphasize this result.</p><p>(Related: Figure 1—figure supplement 3b has two p-values shown in red and black on each graph. I assume those are for two mutually exclusive subsets of the data. It should be explained in the legend.)</p><p>Second, the explanations and discussion given here are somewhat plausible and interesting, but they also seem incomplete and insufficient. For example, &quot;This negative relationship is likely a by-product of increased mRNA abundances.&quot; Why is this? – I genuinely don't understand. As another example, &quot;biophysical constraints&quot; is a rather vague term. Are we talking about physical space inside cells? RNA polymerase abundance? DNA accessibility? I think at least an example or two of what the authors mean would need to be included. These additions would lead to much more discussion than this result probably warrants in terms of its overall importance to the manuscript (esp. if my statistical concerns are justified).</p><p>My recommendation is to remove this regression result from the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their detailed explanation regarding concerns about power to detect negative fold-changes for lowly expressed genes. We agree that low read counts of poorly-expressed genes hamper our ability to perform this analysis and this is at least partially responsible for the relationship we observe. Following the reviewer’s recommendation, we removed this analysis from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have adequately addressed the few comments I made in my initial review. I remain of the view that the results are somewhat oversold, especially with the several implied and direct references to the work establishing a mechanistic link to fitness (e.g., &quot;To *understand* how different genomic changes lead to parallel fitness gains …&quot; L74). I suggest the authors read through the work carefully to make sure that all promises are kept.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. We have softened the language around some of our results and tried to clarify when we are speculating a relationship versus claiming the existence of one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study explores the role of parallel gene expression change (both transcriptional and translational) in the long-term evolution experiment (LTEE). The study represents an interesting look at parallel adaptation, helping contribute to our larger understanding of the biological level at which parallel changes take place and the predictability of adaptation to novel environments. I appreciate that the authors have explored parallelism from transcription, translation, and pathway levels down to nucleotide changes, and have included a phenotypic angle in the study.</p><p>I have read the manuscript first and then looked at the reviewer comments/responses to the reviewers. In my opinion, the authors have done a good job of addressing the previous reviewer's comments and the current version of this manuscript is well written and represents a significant contribution to the field. My only comment is that I wanted to see a 2D scatterplot of the lines in PC space in figure 1. Currently, Figure 1D summarises this analysis, but it could be made 50% smaller and a scatterplot of lines in PC space added (rather than putting it in the supplement).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their supportive comments. Following reviewer’s suggestion, we have moved the PCA plot from the supplement to figure 1F.</p></body></sub-article></article>
