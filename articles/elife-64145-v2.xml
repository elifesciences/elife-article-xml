Partial knockdown of some translation-related genes reduced growth rates and led to out-competition. Media composition led some knockdowns to compete differentially as biofilm versus non-biofilm colonies. Cells depleted for the alanine racemase AlrA died in monoculture but survived in a biofilm colony co-culture via nutrient sharing. Rescue was enhanced in biofilm colony co-culture with a matrix-deficient parent due to a mutualism involving nutrient and matrix sharing. We identified several examples of mutualism involving matrix sharing that occurred in three-dimensional biofilm colonies but not when cultured in two dimensions. Thus, growth in a three-dimensional colony can promote genetic diversity through sharing of secreted factors and may drive evolution of mutualistic behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>essential genes</kwd><kwd>CRISPRi</kwd><kwd>AlrA</kwd><kwd>D-alanine</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>surface growth</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000952</institution-id><institution>Paul G.

Biofilms have widespread clinical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2015</xref>), industrial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lappin‐Scott and Costerton, 1989</xref>), and biotechnological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morikawa, 2006</xref>) implications. Biofilms allow for genetic differentiation and division of labor that can mutually benefit distinct genotypes. For instance, in a dual-species biofilm, extracellular matrix components were functionally exploited by multiple species to drive emergent structural and mechanical properties of the biofilm that affected viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yannarell et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, the amount of mutations that are supported in a population of a given size is higher in microbial colonies compared to well-shaken, liquid cultures that allow beneficial mutations to sweep the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fusco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Habets et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that spatial confinement supports an increase in genetic variation. Spatial confinement dramatically increases the frequency of interactions between nearby cells and thus the potential for linked evolutionary outcomes, coupling random genetic drift events in these subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kayser et al., 2018</xref>). However, mechanisms that support genetic diversity in the context of a three-dimensional bacterial colony or biofilm remain underexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The model organism <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> is a soil-dwelling species that adheres to plant roots as a biofilm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beauregard et al., 2013</xref>). In laboratory conditions, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> grows on surfaces in biofilm or non-biofilm colonies depending on the growth medium. In the commonly used rich medium lysogeny broth (LB), <italic>B. subtilis</italic> grows as a colony with limited biofilm characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shemesh and Chai, 2013</xref>). By contrast, when cultured on the biofilm-promoting minimal medium MSgg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Branda et al., 2001</xref>), <italic>B. subtilis</italic> natural isolates produce extracellular matrix composed of secreted polysaccharides and proteinaceous components that hold cells together and enhance biofilm colony expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Seminara et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">van Gestel et al., 2015</xref>). The extracellular matrix also establishes colony architecture through the three-dimensional pattern of growth and wrinkling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asally et al., 2012</xref>). This architecture creates a variety of contexts for genetically identical cells to differentially express genes depending on their location, and indeed biofilms contain functionally distinct subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">López et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vlamakis et al., 2013</xref>): living cells differentiate into extracellular matrix producers, sporulating cells, and motile cells, while dead cells may be cannibalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blair et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cairns et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vlamakis et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, biofilms are an environment with heightened potential for interactions among cells in distinct transcriptional states and/or genetic backgrounds. Furthermore, biofilm-specific interactions can be identified and characterized by comparing biofilm and non-biofilm growth conditions.</p><p>The explosion of interest in microbial communities in recent years has stimulated a variety of approaches for identifying interspecies interactions. Liquid co-cultures have been used to quantify interaction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Venturelli et al., 2018</xref>) and dissect changes in antibiotic sensitivity in co-cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aranda-Díaz et al., 2020</xref>), but liquid growth cannot be used to identify biofilm or colony-specific interactions as it removes the spatial context of community growth and likely prioritizes long-range interactions over short-range physical contacts. Moreover, determining the amount of each strain in a co-culture often relies on laborious methods such as dilution plating and colony counting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aranda-Díaz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arjes et al., 2020</xref>), which may be complicated if cells adhere to each other. Microfluidics has facilitated the production and high-throughput analysis of picoliter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohan et al., 2019</xref>) and nanoliter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kehe et al., 2019</xref>) droplets with mixed species, but these approaches again rely on liquid growth and the resulting communities contain very few cells compared to many natural communities, especially those that grow in colonies adhered to a surface, making it difficult to study complex fitness phenotypes beyond those affecting initial growth. The production of antibiotics by certain species has been investigated using the inhibition of colony growth of other species at a distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stubbendieck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Temkin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang and Straight, 2019</xref>), and a colony-based screen identified interspecies interactions between <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and other soil bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shank et al., 2011</xref>). While powerful, these methods are not amenable to investigating genetically distinct strains growing together in a three-dimensional structure. The increased availability of mutant libraries across organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baba et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peters et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rousset et al., 2018</xref>) motivates the development of a colony-based strategy for high-throughput screening of the fitness of strains within co-cultures.</p><p>Both non-essential and essential genes (so defined based on survival in a typical laboratory environment such as liquid growth in LB) may impact fitness in any environment. While chemical genetic screens of ordered libraries of deletions of non-essential genes have revealed novel phenotypes and elucidated the mechanism of action of drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brochado and Typas, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nichols et al., 2011</xref>), and phenotypic screens of transposon libraries have identified sporulation- and biofilm-related non-essential genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meeske et al., 2016</xref>), essential genes have traditionally been challenging to address. CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) utilizes an endonuclease-dead version of Cas9 (dCas9) to inhibit transcription from a gene of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Qi et al., 2013</xref>), facilitating tunable expression of any gene. Previously, we created a library of CRISPRi knockdowns of each essential gene in the non-biofilm-forming strain <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 168, which we used to uncover essential gene networks and identify functional classes of genes based on growth and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peters et al., 2016</xref>). In each strain of this library, the level of an essential gene can be titrated, from basal knockdown that allows robust growth of cells in liquid cultures, to full knockdown that inhibits the growth of many strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peters et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, CRISPRi targeting of essential genes provides the potential for a wide distribution of phenotypes, enabling determination of the effects of essential gene disruption without completely inhibiting growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larson et al., 2013</xref>). This ability to achieve tunable knockdown is particularly appealing for quantifying interstrain interactions, by contrast to the lethal phenotype of complete removal of essential genes. CRISPRi was recently used to identify genes that regulate biofilm formation in <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Noirot-Gros et al., 2019</xref>); the efficacy of CRISPRi for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> in a colony/biofilm environment has yet to be ascertained.</p><p>Here, we created Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-labeled libraries of CRISPRi essential gene knockdowns in the biofilm-forming strain <italic>B. subtilis</italic> NCIB 3610 to investigate the fitness consequences of gene knockdowns and interstrain interactions within three-dimensional biofilm and non-biofilm colonies. We demonstrated that the level of CRISPRi knockdown is tunable during colony growth on LB and biofilm-promoting MSgg agar. We developed a high-throughput method for screening monocultures and co-culture colonies on agar plates, and applied this method to quantify growth and fitness when CRISPRi knockdowns were co-cultured with a wild-type-like parent strain. We observed a wide range of fitness phenotypes across media and knockdown levels, with partial knockdowns of translation-related genes producing the lowest fitness, likely due to their negative impact on growth rate. We discovered that full knockdown of <italic>alrA</italic>, which encodes an alanine racemase required for cell wall synthesis, was rescued by the presence of wild-type cells in a co-culture biofilm colony but not in liquid. This rescue was enhanced and stable over time when parent cells were unable to produce extracellular matrix, revealing a mutualistic interaction between these strains. Finally, we identified several other knockdowns with higher competitive fitness when the parent cells are deficient in extracellular matrix production as long as biofilm colony growth occurs in three dimensions, suggesting that these genes have mutualistic potential via nutrient and matrix sharing. These findings highlight the importance of colony geometry and matrix production in determining gene essentiality and interstrain genetic interactions, and provide foundational knowledge of mechanisms that support genetic diversity in pathogenic and environmental biofilms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Construction of a knockdown library for probing gene essentiality in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 3610</title><p>To study genetic interactions involving critical cellular processes within a biofilm colony, we constructed a CRISPRi knockdown library in the biofilm-forming <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strain 3610 ('Materials and methods'). The library contains 302 strains: the 252 known essential genes in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strain 168, 47 genes that were initially classified as essential in 168 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kobayashi et al., 2003</xref>) but later revealed to be non-essential or conditionally essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koo et al., 2017</xref>), and three internal controls expressing dCas9 without any guide RNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peters et al., 2016</xref>). Each strain in the library contains a xylose-inducible copy of <italic>dcas9</italic> and an sgRNA targeting the gene of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, <italic>gfp</italic> is incorporated at the <italic>sacA</italic> locus to allow visualization and quantification of the knockdown strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The <italic>sacA::gfp</italic> strain exhibited similar colony growth and biofilm wrinkling as a parental unlabeled control on both non-biofilm LB agar and biofilm-promoting MSgg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Branda et al., 2001</xref>) agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We refer to colonies on LB and MSgg as ‘non-biofilm’ colonies and ‘biofilm’ colonies, respectively. However, it is important to note that the biofilm definition is nuanced; colonies on LB may have some biofilm characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shemesh and Chai, 2013</xref>), and biofilm pellicles formed at air–liquid interfaces may have distinct properties from MSgg colonies.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A high-throughput screening strategy to measure colony-based competition within bacterial colonies.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) We constructed a GFP-labeled library of CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) knockdowns of all known essential and conditionally essential genes (top left). In the library, the nuclease-deactivated Cas9 gene (<italic>dcas9</italic>) is inducible with xylose and the single-guide RNA (<italic>sgRNA</italic>) is constitutively expressed. dCas9 binds the sgRNA and blocks transcription by physically impeding RNA polymerase (right).

The monoculture plates contained parent controls in wells along an outer column and row (solid box).

A recent study showed that biofilm colony expansion in three dimensions depends heavily on extracellular matrix, while two-dimensional growth relies more on cell growth and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>).

For each strain, we calculated a mutualism score defined as the fitness increase due to deletion of matrix components from the parent at 48 hr compared with the fitness increase at 16 hr; a positive score reflects a growing benefit of being the sole matrix provider, and hence implies relatively stable fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

The other essential gene knockdowns with high mutualism scores encode proteins that bind DNA (<italic>scpA</italic> and <italic>hbs</italic>) or are related to translation (<italic>rnz</italic> and <italic>frr</italic>); these genes likely either play an indirect role in regulating biosynthesis of a shared nutrient to support the mutualism or employ other mechanisms outside of nutrient sharing.

First, we showed that basal knockdown of some ribosomal proteins reduces competitive fitness with a wild-type-like strain in co-culture colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting a high degree of selection on these genes during colony growth. Second, we found that medium composition can dramatically alter competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), highlighting the role of the extracellular environment on fitness in a multicellular context. Third, we discovered that knockdown of <italic>alrA</italic> can be rescued through sharing of D-alanine in a three-dimensional colony, a context in which the gene is ‘less essential,’ but not in liquid or when growth is confined to two dimensions between an agar surface and a coverslip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Finally, we uncovered a mutualism between <italic>alrA</italic> knockdown cells and a parent deficient in extracellular matrix production based on sharing of nutrients and matrix components, and used this finding to identify several other essential gene knockdowns exhibiting similar mutualistic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These findings illustrate how growth in a biofilm colony can alter natural selection by supporting mutant cells that are less likely to survive on their own through short-range interactions.</p><p>Despite previous studies showing that D-alanine levels are undetectable in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 168 liquid culture supernatants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lam et al., 2009</xref>), we found that D-alanine sharing in a colony can rescue <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 3610 mutants that cannot synthesize their own D-alanine. Thus, D-alanine is produced and secreted by wild-type cells at sufficient levels to support growth of the mutant in a colony on biofilm-promoting media. Since full knockdown of <italic>alrA</italic> causes cells to bulge and die in liquid culture within hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, E</xref>), we infer that rescue likely occurs early in biofilm development prior to the period of substantial cell death that is thought to drive wrinkling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asally et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that rescue is not due to the release of D-alanine by dying cells. The close proximity of cells within the colony may aid in rescue, even if secreted D-alanine levels are low. Regardless, this rescue demonstrates that cell wall synthesis mutants can be supported in native environments through sharing of cell wall components, which could be provided by many other bacterial species in a multispecies community due to the common chemical makeup of peptidoglycan cell walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cava et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our observation that rescue of <italic>alrA</italic>-depleted cells did not occur when growth was constrained to two dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), combined with the finding that rescue occurred in co-culture colonies when both the <italic>alrA</italic> knockdown and the parent were matrix-deficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>), indicates that some aspect of three-dimensional growth beyond matrix production is fundamental to the rescue. One possibility is liquid uptake facilitated by colony architecture, which has been hypothesized to act like a sponge and thereby drive colony expansion (even more so when extracellular matrix is present) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Seminara et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yan et al., 2017</xref>). It is also possible that cellular differentiation and development are disrupted by limiting growth to a thin layer. Irrespective, our findings highlight the importance of future high-throughput genetic screens that embrace the natural context of three-dimensional colony growth on surfaces.</p><p>The stable mutualism that we discovered between the <italic>alrA</italic> knockdown and a matrix-deficient parent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) resembles the initial behavior of ∆<italic>tasA</italic> and ∆<italic>epsH</italic> mutants grown together as pellicle biofilms on liquid surfaces, in which the pellicle architecture is preserved by cross-complementation for many passages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dragoš et al., 2018</xref>). Our discovery of matrix-based mutualisms involving multiple genes with a range of cellular functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) motivates future studies to probe the nature of the <italic>tasA-espH</italic> interaction in these interactions, specifically to examine which matrix components are most important and whether mutualisms can be sustained through repeated passages or with different starting ratios of the strains in the co-culture. We expect the genes involved in nutrient-sharing mechanisms (e.g., with D-alanine and menaquinone) to stably interact in passaging experiments as cross-complementation is important for the fitness of both strains. Importantly, our observation that these mutualisms appear to generally require growth in three dimensions further highlights the importance of the geometry of the native environment during evolution.</p><p>Together, our results demonstrate that growth in a biofilm colony can drive genetic diversity and illustrate the potential for mutualism between nutrient and matrix sharing in native biofilms. Such mutualisms may occur during plant root colonization, when the bacterial extracellular matrix is particularly important and may serve to pull nutrients from the root and surrounding soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beauregard et al., 2013</xref>).

For nutrient addition assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we supplemented LB with one of the following: 0.5% (w/v) monosodium glutamate, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>•6H<sub>2</sub>O, 50 μM MnCl<sub>2</sub>•4H<sub>2</sub>O, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>•6H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.5% (w/v) L-asparagine, 0.5% (w/v) L-aspartic acid, 0.5% (w/v) L-lysine, or 0.5% (w/v) D-glutamic acid, and we supplemented MSgg with one of the following: 0.5% (w/v) L-cysteine, 0.5% (w/v) L-glutamine, 0.5% (w/v) L-glycine, 0.5% (w/v) L-serine, or 0.5% (w/v) L-tryptophan. Where indicated, L-threonine was added to MSgg at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. D-amino acids (D-alanine, D-methionine, D-glutamate, D-leucine, D-serine, D-valine) were each used at a concentration of 0.04 mg/mL. We made TY medium for phage transduction using the LB recipe above supplemented with 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> and 0.1 mM MnSO<sub>4</sub>.</p><p>Antibiotics for selection of mutant strains were used as follows: kanamycin (kan, 5 μg/mL), MLS (a combination of erythromycin at 0.5 μg/mL and lincomycin at 12.5 μg/mL), chloramphenicol (cm, 5 μg/mL), tetracycline (tet, 12.5 μg/mL), and spectinomycin (spc, 100 μg/mL).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Strain construction</title><p>All strains and their genotypes are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. For library construction, we used SPP1 phage transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yasbin and Young, 1974</xref>). We used a 168 -strain containing <italic>P<sub>xyl</sub>-dCas9</italic> at the <italic>lacA</italic> locus (CAG74399) as a donor and wild-type strain 3610 (a gift from Dan Kearns) as the recipient to create the 3610-dCas9 parent strain (CAG74331) using MLS for selection. We then used this 3610-dCas9 parent as the recipient and a strain with <italic>P<sub>hyper-spank</sub>-gfp</italic> at the <italic>sacA</italic> locus (NRS1473, a gift from Nicola Stanley Wall) or a strain with <italic>P<sub>veg</sub>-gfp</italic> at the <italic>thrC</italic> locus as the donor strain to create the parent-GFP strain expressing <italic>dCas9</italic> and <italic>gfp</italic> (HA773 is the <italic>sacA::gfp</italic> parent and HA47 is the <italic>thrC::gfp</italic> parent; phage transduction described below), using kanamycin and tetracycline for selection, respectively.</p><p>For construction of mutant strains, we used either the <italic>sacA::gfp</italic> parent or the <italic>thrC::gfp</italic> parent as the recipient strain and strains from a 168 CRISPRi library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peters et al., 2016</xref>) as the donor. We amended the phage transduction protocol to increase the throughput of strain construction as follows. We grew donor strains in 96-well deep-well plates (1 mL cultures in TY medium in 2 mL wells) for at least 5 hr shaking at 37°C with a Breath-easy (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) film covering the plate. We then aliquoted 0.1 mL of 10<sup>−5</sup> dilutions of fresh phage stocks grown on strain 3610 cells (10<sup>−5</sup> was chosen as the dilution factor because it provided the appropriate level of lysis for our phage stock in a trial transduction) into 77 or 71 glass test tubes (each plate of the library contains 77 strains, except the fourth plate contains 71 strains). We added 0.2 mL of each culture to the tubes and incubated the entire rack at 37°C for 15 min. Then, working quickly in batches of 11, we added 4 mL of TY molten soft agar (~55°C) to each phage-cells mixture, mixed gently, and poured onto TY plates so that the soft agar covered the entire plate. We incubated these plates at 37°C overnight in a single layer (not stacked). The next day we examined the plates for lysis and added 5 mL TY broth with 250 ng DNase to each plate and scraped the top agar with a 1 mL filter tip to liberate phage. We then pipetted the TY broth into a syringe attached to a 0.45 µm filter and carefully filtered into a 5 mL conical vial. After filtering, 1 mL of lysate was added to the appropriate well of a deep-well 96-well plate. Once all of the phage was isolated, we arrayed 10 µL of each phage stock into 96-well microtiter plates. We aliquoted 100 µL of a saturated (&gt;5 hr of culturing, OD<sub>600</sub> &gt;1.5) culture into the wells containing phage and incubated for 25 min at 37°C without shaking. We plated the phage/cell mixtures onto selection plates (LB with chloramphenicol and citrate to select for the sgRNA locus) and incubated the plates for 18 hr at 37°C. Any plates that did not have visible colonies after this incubation were incubated further at room temperature, and colonies generally appeared within a day. We streaked transductant colonies for single colonies onto LB+chloramphenicol plates and stocked a single colony for each strain in the library by growing in 5 mL LB on a roller drum at 37°C to mid- to late-log phase and then adding the culture to the appropriate well of 96-well plate with a final concentration of 15% glycerol. The library was stocked at −80°C.</p><p>The GFP-labeled ∆<italic>epsH</italic> ∆<italic>tasA alrA</italic> knockdown strain (HA823) and the parent-RFP ∆<italic>epsH</italic> ∆<italic>tasA</italic> strain (HA825) were constructed using phage transduction as described above using DS9259 and DS3323 (gifts from Dan Kearns) as donor strains for <italic>epsH::tet</italic> and <italic>tasA::tn10spc</italic>, respectively, and the <italic>sacA::gfp alrA</italic> knockdown strain (HA761) or parent-RFP (HA12) as the recipient.

The amplicon and pDG1731 were both digested with HindIII and AgeI and ligated together. The ligation was used to transform chemically competent <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. We transformed <italic>B. subtilis</italic> 168 with pDG1731-gfp to create HA45 and confirmed double crossover (spc<sup>R</sup>, MLS<sup>S</sup>), then used HA45 as the donor and HA2 as the recipient in phage transduction to create the <italic>thrC</italic> parent-GFP strain (<italic>P<sub>xyl</sub>-dCas9 thrC::P<sub>veg</sub>-gfp</italic>, HA47).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Growth conditions for library screens of growth on agar plates</title><p>To grow the library for monocultures and co-cultures, we inserted a sterile 96-well Singer pin (Singer Instruments, Somerset, UK) into frozen glycerol stocks and applied pressure and agitation so that each pin picked up some of the frozen glycerol stock from the appropriate well. The Singer pin was used to spot onto LB agar in a rectangular Singer plus plate, and the plate was incubated overnight at 37°C. A sterile 96-well Singer pin was used to pick up cells from each colony and inoculate 200 μL of LB in a 96-well plate. The parent-GFP strain was inoculated in some of the empty wells on the edge of each plate as controls. The plate was covered with an AeraSeal breathable film (Sigma-Aldrich) and grown on a plate shaker at 37°C for 4–5 hr until all wells were cloudy (OD<sub>600</sub> ~1.0).</p><p>One hundred microliters of each culture were pipetted into a separate 96-well plate with 100 μL of a parent-RFP culture in each well. This plate was used as the inoculum for the competitive fitness screen. The remainder of the cultures in the original 96-well plate were used as the inoculum for the monoculture screen. To quantify competitive fitness, a titration row of parent-RFP and parent-GFP mixtures in 10% increments (100% parent-RFP+0% parent-GFP; 90% parent-RFP+10% parent-GFP, etc.) was added to each plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Since the oxygen limitation that results in stationary cultures causes cell death in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arjes et al., 2020</xref>), we ensured that the library was aliquoted and spotted within 1 hr. For most assays, a Singer ROTOR HDA pinning robot (Singer Instruments) was used to pin ~1 μL of liquid cultures onto LB or MSgg agar Singer PlusPlates (with 35 mL of medium poured on a level surface for co-cultures, or 50 mL of medium for monocultures), without and with xylose. We used the ‘spot many’ protocol of the Singer ROTOR HDA to mix the wells before spotting and transferred 12 times from the source liquid plate to the target agar plate. For some assays, a RAININ Benchsmart 96-well pipetting robot was used rather than the Singer ROTOR HDA to pipet 1 μL onto the agar plates. Agar plates were incubated at 30°C and placed in a box or were loosely covered in plastic to reduce drying.</p><p>When screen outliers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>) were replicated, strains were streaked for single colonies, which were inoculated into 200 μL of medium in the interior wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. The exterior wells were inoculated with the parent-GFP control strain, leaving the top for the parent-GFP+parent-RFP titration. To replicate findings regarding <italic>alrA</italic>, fresh colonies of the <italic>alrA</italic> knockdown strain and the parent-RFP strain were inoculated into 5 mL LB in test tubes and cultured on a roller drum at 37°C to an OD<sub>600</sub> ~1.0. Equal-volume mixtures of the cultures were spotted along with a parent-GFP+parent-RFP titration in 12- or 6-well plates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Imaging and image analysis of monoculture colonies in the library</title><p>Monoculture colonies were imaged using a Canon EOS Rebel T5i EF-S with a Canon Ef-S 60 mm f/2.8 Macro USM fixed lens. The DSLR camera was set up at a fixed height in a light box with diffuse lighting from three sides. The lighting and camera settings were maintained for the duration of the experiment using the ‘manual’ mode on the camera. The EOS Utility software was used to run the camera. Plates were imaged colony side up to avoid imaging through the agar. Images were analyzed using FIJI and scored as ‘grew outside original spot,’ ‘did not grow outside original spot,’ or ‘died and/or threw off suppressors.’ The ones classified as ‘died and/or threw off suppressors’ were assigned a colony size of 0. Suppressors were identified based on off-center colonies, often in flower petal-like arrangements in which one or a few cells within the original spot eventually grew but the majority of the cells did not. Colony size was measured manually in FIJI by drawing a diagonal line across the diameter of the colony.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Imaging and image analysis of biofilm colony co-cultures</title><p>A Typhoon FLA 9500 scanner was used to image colonies using the multi-plate drawer. We used ~35 mL of medium with agar on a Singer rectangular plate to be near the plane of focus when imaging through agar. GFP (473 nm laser, Long Pass Blue filter) and RFP (532 nm laser, Long Pass Green filter) signals were acquired.</p><p>For image analysis, Typhoon RFP and GFP images were cropped to contain only one plate and the image was rotated so that A1 was in the top left corner. Custom Matlab code was used to read in the image of each plate, divide it into a grid in which each grid cell contained one colony, and extract the fluorescence level across the grid. The ratio of the extracted GFP and RFP values was computed for every colony, and the ratio values for the titration row against the fraction GFP were fitted using the function <italic>I</italic>=α<italic>G</italic>/(1–β<italic>G</italic>), where <italic>I</italic> is the GFP/RFP ratio, <italic>G</italic> is the fraction GFP, and α and β are fit parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The fit parameters from the titration row were used to map the library data and assign GFP fractions; the data were normalized so that the average of the internal parent-RFP and parent-GFP co-culture controls was 1.

After 24 hr, colonies were imaged to quantify RFP and GFP fluorescence as described above. Individual colonies were scraped into 1 mL of 1× phosphate buffered saline using a sterile stick. Colonies were then sonicated using a Vibra-Cell sonicator (Sonics and Materials, Inc, Newtown, CT, USA) using cycles consisting of 12 1-s pulses with 20% amplitude. LB colonies were sonicated with 1–2 cycles, and MSgg colonies were sonicated with 5–7 cycles to disrupt the matrix and liberate individual cells. Cultures were visualized under a microscope to ensure that all cell clumps had been disrupted. Cell suspensions were serially diluted 10-fold and plated on LB.

interactions of cells within a biofilm. They observed that several genes have different fitness effects in biofilm colonies compared to no-biofilm colonies, as well as in monoculture versus co-culture.

Their findings add to our understanding of the presence and consequences of intercellular interactions within biofilm colonies.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Three-dimensional biofilm growth supports a mutualism involving matrix and nutrient sharing&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Babak Momeni as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Aleksandra Walczak as the Senior Editor.

What is missing in this current manuscript is nicely summarized by the authors: &quot;some aspect of three-dimensional growth beyond matrix production is fundamental to the rescue.&quot; This aspect could have been explored more by using microscopy to show the distribution of different genotypes. The reviewers identified this as a weakness. At the same time, the reviewers are cognizant of the substantial contribution of this manuscript and current COVID limitations in running experiments.

First, the reviewers suggest that “This aspect could have been explored more by using microscopy to show the distribution of different genotypes.” In the text, we have now expanded on our data regarding the spatial distributions of phenotypes within colonies, which suggest that matrix-capable mutants support growth of the matrix-deficient parent strain (see Figure 5A).</p><p>Second, air-liquid biofilms are tricky to achieve with our mutants, as we cannot ensure that the biofilm forms and is stable enough before essential-gene depletions die. This issue is especially the case for <italic>alrA</italic> depletion, as <italic>alrA</italic> knockdown results in cell death within hours in liquid cultures (Figure 4E). Moreover, any suppressors present at the onset of the experiment would grow and spread, making it impossible to tell whether GFP signal is from suppressors or non-suppressor mutants; suppressors are obvious on a surface due to petal-like colonies arising from single mutants in the initial spot. As the reviewers suggested, we have modified the claim regarding biofilms and three-dimensional context to state “three-dimensional colony”.</p><p>Lastly, the reference to “mechanistic insights” is not totally clear to us; we assume it relates to the precise nature of how spatial structure dictates survival. While there is certainly more to be discovered in this regard, we would like to point out that we show that the mechanism of mutualism between matrix-proficient <italic>alrA</italic> cells and matrix-deficient parent cells is due to D-alanine sharing (from the parent to <italic>alrA</italic>) and matrix sharing (from the <italic>alrA</italic> depletion to the parent). The spatial distribution of both mutants throughout the entire colony suggests that matrix is shared between the strains (since the strains are not spatially segregated, Figure 5A). We suspect that some other mutualism candidates in Figure 5E also involve nutrient/matrix sharing mechanisms, especially the menaquinone synthesis and glutamate racemase genes. It remains unclear whether all the other genes identified in the screen (<italic>scpA</italic>, <italic>hbs</italic>, <italic>rnz</italic>, <italic>frr</italic>) involve nutrient sharing or another as of yet unidentified mechanism that is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. At the reviewer’s suggestions, we have clarified and expanded the appropriate Results and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another issue raised by one of the reviewers is a concern about the experimental protocol: none of the fluorescence-based fitness measurements are validated with CFU assays.

The colonies should be also assayed as described in L330 to 336 of planktonic cultures. The reviewers recommend that the authors include additional evidence that would justify their approach.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion, we have investigated the spatial organization for the <italic>alrA</italic> mutants as well as the other mutualism candidates (see Figure 4A, 5A, 5E). When matrix production was normal, <italic>alrA</italic> mutants grew to fill the initial inoculum and were able to grow radially outward from the initial spot but were eventually outcompeted by parent-RFP (Figure 5A). By contrast, when the <italic>alrA</italic> mutant was the sole provider of matrix, the spatial organization was highly different, with both <italic>alrA</italic> cells and the parent occupying the entire colony, suggesting that extracellular matrix was shared between these strains. We have clarified these points in the Results section.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to validate our fluorescence-based data with CFU counts. To obtain accurate CFU counts from a colony, it is necessary to resuspend the colony and sonicate to disrupt the biofilm matrix and liberate individual cells. We were concerned that <italic>alrA</italic>-depletion strains would be more sensitive to sonication as we demonstrated that the mutation disrupts the cell wall, so we instead validated our fluorescence assay with CFU counting of different mixtures of the parent-GFP and parent-RFP strains. Both CFU counting and colony fluorescence methods mapped well to our predicted ratio function fit line, and thus colony fluorescence is validated as a useful and more efficient tool to compare competition in colonies in high throughput (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). CFU counting is the current standard and widely used assay for measuring competition in liquid cultures, and that is why we used it for our liquid co-culture measurements. We did not verify our liquid experiments with fluorescence because the cultures were highly dilute in the initial few hours when our CFU data indicated that cells die, and hence the fluorescence signals would be too weak to compare to our CFU data.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved and the majority of reviewers comments have been addressed.

We have endeavored to change the text in a way that will satisfy the reviewer, but still maintain clarity about our results, as we describe below – we are not tied to any of the terminology, and if there are other options that would be acceptable to the reviewer, we would be happy to further modify the text.</p><p>In terms of clarity, we feel that to change all instances of biofilm simply to “colony” would create confusion, as many of our results are about the distinction between MSgg and LB colonies, and we chose the media specifically because of their promotion of what are generally thought of as biofilms, or lack thereof. Indeed, colonies on MSgg have long been referred to as biofilms or biofilm colonies; in the book Biofilm Development with an Emphasis on <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, Roberto Kolter and colleagues write on page 3 of Chapter 1 that “the colonies that grow on the surface of agar dishes and demonstrate macroscopically complex architectures are now widely recognized as a form of biofilm (reviewed in Branda et al., 2005).” We considered changing the terminology to “MSgg colonies” and “LB colonies,” but such terminology would be inscrutable in the title and abstract and also feel that this would make the manuscript difficult to read for anyone not an expert in the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> biofilm field.</p><p>Thus, we have ensured that throughout our manuscript, all mentions of biofilms have been changed to “biofilm colony” rather than “biofilms,” which we hope the reviewer will feel is clearly distinguished between the “non-biofilm colonies” grown on LB and “biofilm colonies” grown on MSgg. We have made sure that this point is emphasized in the manuscript, as we write:</p><p>“However, it is important to note that the biofilm definition is nuanced; colonies on LB may have some biofilm characteristics [10], and biofilm pellicles formed at air–liquid interfaces may have distinct properties from MSgg colonies.”</p><p>(It appears to be standard for the field to reserve the use of “community” for when there is a stable culture of multiple species, so we avoided this term.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We also suggest a minor revision in the “Media” subsection: please correct to &quot;note that original description of the MSgg medium includes KOH for adjusting the pH, thus it does not contain Na+&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to satisfy the reviewer (who noted that these details have no impact on the results in our study), but we were unable to confirm the validity of their statement about the original description including KOH for adjusting the pH. When searching for the original description for this, we found this recipe for MSgg in Branda et al., 2001 “Fruiting body formation by <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>”:</p><p>“Minimal medium (MSgg): 5 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7)/100 mM Mops (pH 7)/2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>/700 μM CaCl<sub>2</sub>/50 μM MnCl<sub>2</sub>/50 μM FeCl<sub>3</sub>/1 μM ZnCl<sub>2</sub>/2 μM thiamine/0.5% glycerol/0.5% glutamate/50 μg/ml tryptophan/50 μg/ml phenylalanine (adapted from ref. 10)”</p><p>Reference 10 is: “Partial Purine Deprivation Causes Sporulation of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> in the Presence of Excess Ammonia, Glucose, and Phosphate” by E. Freese, J.E. Heinze, and E.M. Galliers (1979).</p><p>They state:</p><p>“Media. A synthetic medium was used which contained 10 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 mM morpholinopropanesulphonate (adjusted to pH 7 with NaOH), 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.7 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 μM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 μM FeCl<sub>3</sub>, 1 μM ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 μM thiamin, and the stated amounts of D-glucose and L-glutamate (adjusted to pH 7.0 with KOH) as carbon sources. (<italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> metabolizes glucose rapidly and glutamate very slowly.) Added to this medium were the compounds required by auxotrophs (each at 50 μg ml<sup>-1</sup>) except where otherwise stated. Adenine, AICA, guanine, guanosine, hypoxanthine and xanthine stock solutions were prepared in dilute KOH.”</p><p>Therefore, it appears the original media used in Branda et al., 2001 contains Na<sup>+</sup>, thus it would be improper to state otherwise in our manuscript.</p><p>We additionally checked a handful of papers from the Losick, Kolter, and Shank laboratories and there is no mention of what they used to adjust the pH of their MOPS buffer, so it is unclear if they use KOH or NaOH, and thus the statement stands as written.</p><p>Therefore, we think that the text in our revised manuscript (“note that some laboratories adjust the pH of MSgg with KOH”) is sufficient. If the reviewer can provide a reference to the recipe of MSgg that states the authors use KOH, we would be happy to include it as a reference. (To be entirely clear, we replaced “MSgg” with “MOPS” buffer in this line in our new revision, as the MOPS buffer is what is adjusted for pH.)</p></body></sub-article></article>
