protein complex that converts inactive cytokine precursors into active forms of IL-1β and IL-18. The NLRP3 inflammasome is frequently associated with the damaging inflammation of non-communicable disease states and is considered an attractive therapeutic target. However, there is much regarding the mechanism of NLRP3 activation that remains unknown. Chloride efflux is suggested as an important step in NLRP3 activation, but which chloride channels are involved is still unknown. We used chemical, biochemical, and genetic approaches to establish the importance of chloride channels in the regulation of NLRP3 in murine macrophages. Specifically, we identify LRRC8A, an essential component of volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC), as a vital regulator of hypotonicity-induced, but not DAMP-induced, NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Although LRRC8A was dispensable for canonical DAMP-dependent NLRP3 activation, this was still sensitive to chloride channel inhibitors, suggesting there are additional and specific chloride sensing and regulating mechanisms controlling NLRP3.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inflammation is a critical part of a healthy immune system, which protects us against harmful pathogens (such as bacteria or viruses) and works to restore damaged tissues. In the immune cells of our body, the inflammatory process can be activated through a group of inflammatory proteins that together are known as the NLRP3 inflammasome complex.</p><p>While inflammation is a powerful mechanism that protects the human body, persistent or uncontrolled inflammation can cause serious, long-term damage. The inappropriate activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has been implicated in several diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, and diabetes. The NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated by different stimuli, including changes in cell volume and exposure to either molecules produced by damaged cells or toxins from bacteria. However, the precise mechanism through which the NLRP3 becomes activated in response to these stimuli was not clear.</p><p>The exit of chloride ions from immune cells is known to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Chloride ions exit the cell through proteins called anion channels, including volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs), which respond to changes in cell volume. Green et al. have found that, in immune cells from mice grown in the lab called macrophages, VRACs are the only chloride channels involved in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome when the cell’s volume changes. However, when the macrophages are exposed to molecules produced by damaged cells or toxins from bacteria, Green et al. discovered that other previously unidentified chloride channels are involved in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome.</p><p>These results suggest that it might be possible to develop drugs to prevent the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome that selectively target specific sets of chloride channels depending on which stimuli are causing the inflammation. Such a selective approach would minimise the side effects associated with drugs that generically suppress all NLRP3 activity by directly binding to NLRP3 itself. Ultimately, this may help guide the development of new, targeted anti-inflammatory drugs that can help treat the symptoms of a variety of diseases in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>NLRP3 inflammasome</kwd><kwd>interleukin-1β</kwd><kwd>chloride</kwd><kwd>VRAC</kwd><kwd>RVD</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N029992/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brough</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/T0116515/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brough</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000143</institution-id><institution>Alzheimer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AS‐PhD‐16‐002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brough</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000770</institution-id><institution>University of Manchester</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Presidential Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>Jack P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Depletion of LRRC8A provides genetic evidence for the importance of Cl<sup>-</sup> channels in NLRP3 activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inflammation is an important protective host-response to infection and injury, and yet is also detrimental during non-communicable diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dinarello et al., 2012</xref>). Inflammasomes are at the heart of inflammatory responses. Inflammasomes are formed by a soluble pattern recognition receptor (PRR), in many cases the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), and the protease caspase-1 (2). Inflammasomes form in macrophages in response to a specific stimulus to drive the activation of caspase-1, facilitating the processing of the cytokines pro-interleukin (IL)1β and pro-IL-18 to mature secreted forms, and the cleavage of gasdermin D to cause pyroptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evavold and Kagan, 2019</xref>). A number of different inflammasomes have been described, but potentially the inflammasome of greatest interest to non-communicable disease is formed by NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mangan et al., 2018</xref>). The mechanisms of NLRP3 activation remain poorly understood.</p><p>The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated through several routes which have been termed the canonical, non-canonical, and the alternative pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mangan et al., 2018</xref>). Activation of the canonical NLRP3 pathway, which has received greatest attention thus far, typically requires two stimuli; an initial priming step involving a pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP), typically bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), to induce expression of pro-IL-1β and NLRP3, and a second activation step usually involving a damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP), such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mariathasan et al., 2006</xref>). In 1996, Perregaux and colleagues discovered that hypotonic shock was effective at inducing the release of mature IL-1β when applied to LPS-treated human monocytes and suggested the importance of a volume-regulated response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Perregaux et al., 1996</xref>). It was later discovered that hypotonicity induced release of IL-1β via activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Compan et al., 2012</xref>), and that this was linked to the regulatory volume decrease (RVD), which is a regulated reduction in cell volume in response to hypo-osmotic-induced cell swelling, and was inhibited by the chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) channel blocker NPPB (5-nitro-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Compan et al., 2012</xref>). The RVD is regulated by the Cl<sup>-</sup> channel VRAC (volume regulated anion channel). The molecular composition of the VRAC channel was established to consist of an essential LRRC8A sub-unit in combination with other (B-E) LRRC8 sub-units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Voss et al., 2014</xref>). We recently reported that fenamate NSAIDs could inhibit the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome by blocking a Cl<sup>-</sup> channel, which we suggested could be VRAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daniels et al., 2016</xref>). We also further characterised the importance of Cl<sup>-</sup> flux in the regulation of NLRP3, showing that Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux facilitated NLRP3-dependent ASC oligomerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Green et al., 2018</xref>). Given the poor specificity of many Cl<sup>-</sup> channel inhibitors, we set out to systematically determine the importance of VRAC and the RVD to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Given that hypertonic buffers inhibit ATP and other NLRP3 activating stimuli-induced IL-1β release from macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Perregaux et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Compan et al., 2012</xref>), we hypothesised that cell swelling, and the RVD, would be central to all NLRP3 activating stimuli. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we discovered that VRAC exclusively regulated RVD-dependent NLRP3 activation in response to hypotonicity, and not NLRP3 activation in response to other canonical stimuli. Thus, we provide genetic evidence for the importance of Cl<sup>-</sup> in regulating NLRP3 via the VRAC dependence of the hypotonicity response, and suggest the presence of additional Cl<sup>-</sup> sensing mechanisms regulating NLRP3 in response to DAMPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Following publication of the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of VRAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deneka et al., 2018</xref>) with inhibitor 4-(2-butyl-6,7-dichloro-2-cyclopentyl-indan-1-on-5-yl)oxobutyric acid (DCPIB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kern et al., 2019</xref>), we were able to investigate the interaction of established VRAC inhibitors with the channel using molecular modelling. DCPIB was first computationally redocked using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE 2015.08, Chemical Computing Group, Canada) into the homohexameric VRAC structure (PDB code 6NZW, resolution 3.2 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kern et al., 2019</xref>). The resulting pose produced a reasonable overlay with the cryo-EM conformation of DCPIB, giving a root-mean-square deviation in atomic position of 2.6 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). DCPIB exhibits an ionic interaction of its carboxylate group with the cationic side-chain of one of the Arg103 residues comprising the electropositive selectivity filter of VRAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kern et al., 2019</xref>). Known VRAC inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daniels et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hélix et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Droogmans et al., 1999</xref>) possessing carboxylic acid groups (flufenamic acid (FFA)), mefenamic acid (MFA) and <italic>N-</italic>((4-methoxy)−2-naphthyl)−5-nitroanthranilic acid (MONNA), the tetrazole moiety (NS3728) and sulfonic acid groups (4-sulfonic calix[6]arene) were then docked into the DCPIB site of VRAC. The most favourably bound poses of these ligands were similarly found to block the pore in a cork-in-bottle manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kern et al., 2019</xref>) at the selectivity filter; the ligands’ ionised acidic groups formed strong electrostatic interactions with Arg103 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–H</xref>). Tamoxifen, a basic inhibitor of VRAC was also docked into the cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Accordingly, tamoxifen docked with its cationic tertiary amino group remote to the Arg103 side-chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>); these side-chains instead formed cation-π interactions with the phenyl group of tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l</xref>). The interaction of the tamoxifen pose was computed as having a calculated ligand-binding affinity of −6.5 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> via the molecular mechanics/generalised Born volume integration (MM/GBVI) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Labute, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galli et al., 2014</xref>). The binding energies of the anionic ligands were also predicted as favourable, ranging from −5.1 (DCPIB) to −5.8 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> (MONNA). This range excludes the larger 4-sulfonic calix[6]arene (calixarene), which gave a binding energy of −9.9 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>; we note that the GBVI implicit solvent model may be underestimating the high desolvation cost of this polyanionic ligand and therefore overestimating the magnitude of the corresponding binding energy of this compound.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Modelling of proposed VRAC inhibitors on the Cryo-EM structure of LRRC8 channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two orthogonal views: a side view with two chains removed from the hexameric LRRC8A protein with bound DCPIB and a top view for the hexameric VRAC channel (PDB:6NZW).

In this model, I<sup>-</sup> enters the cell through open Cl<sup>-</sup> channels to induce quenching of a mutant EYFP. In response to hypotonic shock to induce VRAC opening, YFP fluorescence was immediately quenched, which was significantly inhibited by tamoxifen (10 µM), MONNA (50 µM), DCPIB (10 µM), FFA (100 µM), and NS3728 (10 µM), but not calixarene (100 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).

We measured the RVD by measuring the change in cellular fluorescence in calcein-loaded primary mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) in response to hypotonicity.

Thus, to conclusively determine the role of VRAC in NLRP3 inflammasome activation we generated a macrophage specific LRRC8A knockout (KO) mouse using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The generation of a macrophage-specific LRRC8A KO was required as whole animal LRRC8A KO mice do not survive beyond 4 weeks and have retarded growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Lrrc8a<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were bred with mice constitutively expressing Cre under the <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> promoter, as previously shown to be expressed in monocyte and macrophage populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yona et al., 2013</xref>).

Functional loss of LRRC8A was confirmed using the calcein RVD assay described above. BMDMs were subjected to a hypotonic shock and changes in calcein fluorescence measured over time.

Knocking out LRRC8A had no effect on the release of IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) or cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We then used western blotting to determine ASC oligomerisation and caspase-1 activation.

Furthermore, IL-1β release in response to ATP or nigericin was still inhibited by the VRAC inhibitors flufenamic acid (FFA, 100 µM), and NS3728 (10 µM) in the <italic>Lrrc8a</italic> KO BMDMs, confirming that these inhibitors are inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation by a VRAC-independent mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

We then used a murine peritonitis model described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daniels et al., 2016</xref>) to investigate the role of LRRC8A in vivo. First, we tested if the VRAC inhibitor NS3728 was effective at blocking NLRP3 in vivo. Wild-type C57BL6/J mice were injected intraperitoneally with NS3728 (50 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>), the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 (50 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>), or vehicle control, at the same time as LPS (1 µg, 4 hr). NLRP3 was then further activated by intraperitoneal injection of ATP (100 mM, 500 µL, 15 min) and IL-1β release was measured by ELISA of the peritoneal lavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) and plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Addition of ATP induced a significant increase in the release of IL-1β into peritoneal lavage and this was inhibited by MCC950 and NS3728, indicating an NLRP3-dependent response. IL-6 levels were unaltered in both peritoneal lavage and plasma by addition of NS3728 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). These data show that NS3728 was able to inhibit NLRP3 in vivo. To determine the role of VRAC in this model, we repeated this experiment in our macrophage <italic>Lrrc8a</italic> KO mice and their littermate controls. Macrophage <italic>Lrrc8a</italic> KO mice exhibited normal proportions of myeloid cells in the peritoneum as assessed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–G</xref>).

The promiscuous nature of many Cl<sup>-</sup> channel inhibiting drugs, and an unresolved molecular identity of major Cl<sup>-</sup> channels, have prevented the emergence of conclusive genetic proof. However, the discovery that the Cl<sup>-</sup> channel regulating the RVD (VRAC) was composed of LRRC8 sub-units, and that LRRC8A was essential for channel activity, offered us the opportunity to investigate the direct importance of VRAC in the regulation of NLRP3. Hypotonicity induces cell swelling which is corrected by the VRAC-dependent RVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Voss et al., 2014</xref>). The RVD was previously linked to NLRP3 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Compan et al., 2012</xref>). Thus by knocking out LRRC8A, and thus VRAC, we would discover that VRAC was essential for RVD-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, providing strong evidence for the direct requirement of a Cl<sup>-</sup> channel in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Given that there are a number of inflammatory conditions and models that can be targeted by administration of a hyper-tonic solution (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Theobaldo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schreibman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shields et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petroni et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that the VRAC-dependent regulation of NLRP3 in response to hypotonicity could represent a therapeutic target.</p><p>However, VRAC was only essential for RVD-induced NLRP3 activation and was not involved in the NLRP3 response to DAMP stimulation. The fact that our VRAC channel-inhibiting drugs block DAMP-induced NLRP3 activation suggests that additional Cl<sup>-</sup> channels (or alternative targets) are involved in coordinating NLRP3 responses to other stimuli. Chloride intracellular channel proteins (CLICs 1–6) form anion channels and regulate a variety of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Littler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Argenzio and Moolenaar, 2016</xref>). Localisation of CLIC1 and 4 to membrane fractions in macrophages is increased by LPS stimulation, and RNAi knockdown of both CLIC1 and 4 impaired LPS and ATP-induced IL-1β release from macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Domingo-Fernández et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to CLICs 1 and 4, CLIC5 is also implicated in NLRP3-dependent IL-1β release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). Knockdown of CLICs 1, 4, and 5 inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to the soluble agonists ATP and nigericin, and also the particulate DAMP monosodium urate crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, it appears that multiple Cl<sup>-</sup> channels encode diverse signals arising from DAMP stimulation, or from altered cellular homeostasis, to trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Importantly our data suggest that Cl<sup>-</sup> channels are only important to NLRP3 activation dependent upon K<sup>+</sup> efflux, highlighting the further potential for selective pathway modulation and therapeutic development. The relationship between K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux requires further investigation, and whether, in RVD, Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux is a pre-requisite for K<sup>+</sup> efflux.</p><p>Although activation of VRAC is best understood under hypotonic conditions, VRAC activation has also been reported to occur in response to a variety of stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Osei-Owusu et al., 2018</xref>). It is also possible that VRAC may regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to stimuli other than hypotonicity that were not tested here. For example, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) activates VRAC in mouse macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burow et al., 2015</xref>), and we previously reported that sphingosine, and S1P, could activate NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luheshi et al., 2012</xref>). VRAC is also thought to be important for cell death induced by apoptosis inducing drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sørensen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Planells-Cases et al., 2015</xref>), and we also previously reported that apoptosis inducing drugs could activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">England et al., 2014</xref>) suggesting another potential area of relevance. While VRAC is directly permeable to Cl<sup>-</sup> it is also possible that additional Cl<sup>-</sup> channels are involved in the hypotonicity-induced swelling response. For example, VRAC activation caused by swelling can activate other Cl<sup>-</sup> channels, notably anoctamin 1 (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benedetto et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, whilst our research suggests an importance of Cl<sup>-</sup>, VRAC is also permeable to small molecules including cGAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>) and ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunn et al., 2020</xref>), highlighting additional ways through which VRAC could contribute to inflammation.</p><p>Inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome has become an area of intense research interest due to the multiple indications of its role in disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mangan et al., 2018</xref>). The inhibitor MCC950 is now thought to bind directly to NLRP3 to cause inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Coll et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tapia-Abellán et al., 2019</xref>), although it has also been reported to inhibit Cl<sup>-</sup> flux from macrophages treated with nigericin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>), and was found to bind directly to CLIC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laliberte et al., 2003</xref>), so it is possible that some of its inhibitory activity may be attributable to an effect on Cl<sup>-</sup>. We found that Cl<sup>-</sup> channel inhibition blocked IL-1β release in a NLRP3-dependent model of peritonitis, and previously reported protective effects of the fenamate NSAIDs in rodent models of Alzheimer’s disease that we attributed to an effect on Cl<sup>-</sup> channel inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daniels et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, it is possible that targeting Cl<sup>-</sup> channels offers an additional route to inhibit NLRP3-dependent inflammation in disease.</p><p>In summary, we have reported that hypotonicity-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation depends exclusively on the Cl<sup>-</sup> channel VRAC, and that different Cl<sup>-</sup> sensing and regulating systems coordinate the activation of NLRP3 in response to DAMPs. This opens the possibility of discrete Cl<sup>-</sup> regulating mechanisms conferring selectivity and information about the nature of the NLRP3 activating stimulus. Thus, this investigation has opened the door to further studies on Cl<sup>-</sup> regulation of NLRP3 and identified the possibility of selective therapeutic intervention strategies informed by the nature of the disease or DAMP stimulus, potentially minimising complications of immunosuppression caused by a blanket NLRP3 inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

For both steps, we used the Sanger WTSI website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/htgt/wge/">http://www.sanger.ac.uk/htgt/wge/</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hodgkins et al., 2015</xref>) to design sgRNA that adhered to our criteria for off target predictions (guides with mismatch (MM) of 0, 1 or two for elsewhere in the genome were discounted, and MM3 were tolerated if predicted off targets were not exonic). sgRNA sequences were purchased as crRNA oligos, which were annealed with tracrRNA (both oligos supplied IDT; Coralville, USA) in sterile, RNase-free injection buffer (TrisHCl 1 mM, pH 7.5, EDTA 0.1 mM) by combining 2.5 µg crRNA with 5 µg tracrRNA and heating to 95°C, which was allowed to slowly cool to room temperature.</p><p>For 5’ targeting the sgRNA <named-content content-type="sequence">GTCTAGTTAGGGACTCCTGG-<italic>GGG</italic></named-content> was used, with the ssODN repair template 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">tccttgacttgctgtttaccgctctcttccccacaccacagttatccacaggaagttacccataacctccctcgtgcacccctacccccaATAACTTCGTATAGCATACATTATACGAAGTTATGGTACCggagtccctaactagacctgctgtctctccatagccctgtctacacct</named-content>-3’, where capitals indicate the LoxP sequence with a KpnI site, and lower case the homology arms. For embryo microinjection, the annealed sgRNA was complexed with Cas9 protein (New England Biolabs) at room temperature for 10 min, before addition of ssODN (IDT) donor (final concentrations; sgRNA 20 ng µL<sup>−1</sup>, Cas9 protein 20 ng µL<sup>−1</sup>, ssODN 50 ng µL<sup>−1</sup>). CRISPR reagents were directly microinjected into C57BL6/J (Envigo) zygote pronuclei using standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Demayo et al., 2012</xref>). Zygotes were cultured overnight and the resulting two-cell embryos surgically implanted into the oviduct of day 0.5 post-coitum pseudopregnant mice. Potential founder mice were identified by extraction of genomic DNA from ear clips, followed by PCR using primers that flank the homology arms and sgRNA sites (Geno F1 <named-content content-type="sequence">tcagatggcgaaccagaagtc</named-content> and Geno R1 <named-content content-type="sequence">tacaatgtagtcaggtgtgacg</named-content>). WT sequences produced a 833 bp band, and loxP knock in 873 bp, which is also susceptible to KpnI digest. Pups with a larger band were reserved, the band isolated and amplified using high fidelity Phusion polymerase (NEB), gel extracted and subcloned into pCRblunt (Invitrogen). Colonies were mini-prepped and Sanger sequenced with M13 Forward and Reverse primers, and aligned to predicted knock-in sequence. Positive pups were bred with a WT C57BL6/J to confirm germline transmission and a colony established. To integrate the 3’ LoxP we used sgRNA <named-content content-type="sequence">ACTACCCCATTACCTCTTGG-<italic>TGG</italic></named-content> with the ssODN repair template 5’- <named-content content-type="sequence">gagggccaaaactgtggaaagcaacacccttgaagtgtaggtggcccctgtgcaccagctctgtgtgtgactgcaaagcccccaccaagaATAACTTCGTATAGCATACATTATACGAAGTTATGGTACCggtaatggggtagttagacgggctgagggcagagcacttgtgtggctt</named-content>-3’. Again, capitals indicate the LoxP sequence with a KpnI site, and lower case the homology arms.</p><p>For this second round of targeting, we generated embryos from the LRRC8A-5’fl colony by IVF using homozygous LRRC8A-5’fl mice, and used electroporation (Nepa21 electroporator, Sonidel) to deliver the sgRNA:Cas9 RNP complex and ssODN to the embryos, AltR crRNA:tracrRNA:Cas9 complex (200 ng μL<sup>−1</sup>; 200 ng μL<sup>−1</sup>; 200 ng μL<sup>−1</sup> respectively) and ssDNA HDR template (500 ng μL<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaneko, 2017</xref>). Zygotes were cultured overnight and the resulting two-cell embryos surgically implanted into the oviduct of day 0.5 post-coitum pseudopregnant mice.

WT sequences produced a 371 bp band, and loxP knock in 411 bp, which is also susceptible to KpnI digest. As before, Pups with a larger band were reserved, the band isolated and amplified using high fidelity Phusion polymerase (NEB), gel extracted and subcloned into pCRblunt (Invitrogen). Colonies were mini-prepped and Sanger sequenced with M13 Forward and Reverse primers, and aligned to predicted knock-in sequence.

in response to hypotonic shock. A specific channel component is shown, using complementary genetic and pharmacological methods, to play a critical role in regulating the inflammatory response to hypotonic shock. The study thus helps provide a molecular basis for a longstanding inflammatory stimulus that may have relevance in diverse human diseases.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;LRRC8A regulates hypotonicity-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Stephen Graf Brohawn (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>In their manuscript &quot;LRRC8A regulates hypotonicity-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation&quot; Green et al., investigate the role of VRACs in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. They confirm previously published observations (including from the author's group) that several VRAC (and other Cl<sup>-</sup> channel) inhibitor can block NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Intriguingly, the authors report that the ability to block VRAC does not correlate with the ability to block NLRP3 inflammasome activation. They conclude that off target effects have to account for NLRP3 blocking activity by VRAC inhibitors. Next, the authors provide genetic tools to study the role of VRAC in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and find that canonical NLRP3 activators do not require VRAC. However, regulated volume decrease (RVD)-mediated NLRP3 activation in hypo-osmolar conditions does require VRAC. Overall, the consensus opinion of the reviewers is that the work addresses an important question and is overall well done. The following points are requested to be addressed in a revised version of the manuscript:</p><p>** Note that consistent with the <italic>eLife</italic> COVID revision policy, the below experimental suggestions are not required, though the reviewers feel they would improve the manuscript if adding data is possible. If adding data is not possible, then revisions to the text will suffice **</p><p>Points requiring additional experimentation:</p><p>1) The pharmacological analysis of VRAC inhibition is done entirely in Hela cells whereas the rest of the paper is about NLRP3 activation in macrophages.</p><p>a) Given that subunit composition could be different between HeLa cells and macrophages and this could play a role in differing pharmacology, it is imperative that the analysis of VRAC inhibition should be performed on macrophages, not the endogenous channels in Hela cells.</p><p>b) In addition, the authors should confirm that the VRAC KOs are completely deficient in RVD by using their VRAC inhibitors in VRAC KOs. In other words Figure 4C should include several of the VRAC inhibitors in both WT and VRAC KO cells.</p><p>2) The cell culture experiments showing hypotonicty-induced NLRP3 activation are convincing, but raise the question: under what circumstance(s) is this physiologically relevant?</p><p>a) There seems to be an underlying implication or assumption that DAMP stimulation evokes VRAC activation. Is this the intendend implication? If so, this needs to be explicitly tested.</p><p>b) Alternatively, the authors should provide another physiologically relevant scenario in which hypotonicity might naturally be encountered by a cell, leading to NLRP3 activation. Do the authors think that the extreme (though typical in the literature) hypotonic conditions used in culture experiments (using a switch from ~340to ~120 mOsm solutions) are likely to occur in vivo? Under what circumstances?</p><p>c) VRAC and LRRC8-contianing channels have been proposed to be activated by stimuli other than reduced intracellular ionic strength. Could these alternatives be involved in LRRC8-mediated NLRP3 activation?</p><p>d) Finally, can the authors speculate on whether it is Cl<sup>-</sup> flux per se through LRRC8 or other Cl<sup>-</sup> channels that is important for NLRP3 activation? Other possibilities include voltage changes, RVD, and flux of other permeant ions like ATP or cyclic dinucleotides.</p><p>e) In addition to the above (or as a result of addressing the above), the authors should expand on the discussion of potential physiological implications.</p><p>3) The analysis of VRAC channel function based solely on the YFP-quenching assay is technically inadequate. The differential effects on NLRP3 activation of the different inhibitors is a potentially important finding, but this claim cannot be made solely on this one indirect readout. The YFP quenching method is unlikely to have sufficient temporal resolution and dynamic range to detect smaller changes (or lack of changes) in ionic currents. Direct electrophysiological analysis of the chloride currents is required to test if there are differences in the mechanism or time course of inhibition that could explain the lack of effects on DAMP mediated inflammasome activation.</p><p>4) The authors should investigate if VRAC-mediated Cl<sup>-</sup>efflux enables K<sup>+</sup> efflux to drive NLRP3 inflammasome activation during hypo-osmolar conditions. They should determine the intracellular K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> content in presence of pharmacological NLRP3 inhibition in WT vs VRAC KO cells. I think it'll be important to correlate the efflux of K<sup>+</sup> with NLRP3 activation during RVD, especially in light of PMID: 22981536, which claims otherwise (using pharmacological inhibition).</p><p>Points requiring textual revisions to the manuscript:</p><p>1) The title should be reworked to include the key finding that LRRC8a does not regulate canonical NLRP3 inflammsome activation as this is a central part of the paper. The title only reflects Figure 6 while most of the work shows that LRRC8a does not regulate the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome.</p><p>2) There is an underlying assumption that the inhibitors that inhibit canonical (ATP for instance) NLRP3 activation (MON, FFA, NS3) likely inhibit another Cl<sup>-</sup> channel. This is part of the discussion and interpretation of their data and it appears there is no rational basis for this conclusion. The mechanism for how these compounds block NLRP3 remains a mystery and could very likely include other unknown targets.</p><p>3) The authors are suggested to modify the presentation of Figure 1 for clarity.</p><p>a) In (A), two orthogonal views (a side view with one or two LRRC8A subunits in the front removed and a top view) and the addition of lines indicating membrane boundaries would give better perspective.</p><p>b) The legend states B-I are colored with &quot;hydrophilic (blue), hydrophobic regions (red) and neutral regions (white).&quot; It is recommended to change the coloring in B-I are colored to the more typical blue (electropositive) to white (electroneutral) to red (electronegative) as in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Or to a green-purple hydrophobic/hydrophilic color scheme as red/white/blue is typically used for electronegative-electropositive coloring. In either case, please add a key to the figure with the color scale.</p><p>c) Consider adding labels for each drug in the panels.</p><p>4) While the docking was performed on LRRC8A homomers as that is the only available structure, in cells most (if not all) LRRC8-containing channels are heteromeric and contain B-E subunits. If there are good data on LRRC8 subunit expression in BMDMs it would be informative to discuss the likely subunit composition of channels in these cells. Can the authors speculate on whether any of the small molecules would interact less well with heteromeric channels from the docking and sequence differences between LRRC8 subunits? Could this also explain the discrepancy between apparent affinity in HeLa cells and effect on BMDMs for some compounds?</p><p>5) Please change &quot;crystal structure&quot; to cryo-EM structure&quot; in the legend for Figure 1.</p><p>6) The experiments in Figure 3D-F are a fantastic control that brings clarity to the confusing observation that Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux is sometimes required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. It shows that only stimuli that rely on potassium efflux (ATP, Nigericin) are sensitive to Cl<sup>-</sup>channel inhibitors whereas R837, which activates NLRP3 independently of potassium efflux cannot be inhibited by Cl<sup>-</sup>channel inhibitors. This suggests that the Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux might be linked to K<sup>+</sup> efflux. For example, it could allow efficient electro-neutral flux. The authors are encouraged to discuss this important experiment and its interpretation more prominently.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;LRRC8A is essential for hypotonicity-, but not for DAMP-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We thank you for submitting your outstanding work to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I have gone through the authors responses and the revised manuscript. The authors have revised the emphasis of the paper including the title and the Discussion section sufficiently to address my previous concerns. It would have been nice to include some electrophysiology on LRRC8A but as this is not a major point of the paper, I am satisfied with the revision of the results. I have no further comments or concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I am satisfied with the replies and additions made in response to reviewer comments. I have no further concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I think the authors have adequately addressed most of the reviewer's comments and I'd recommend the manuscript for publication.</p><p>However, there is one point that is still of concern that was not properly addressed by the authors (bullet point 4 in the previous consolidated review). It seems that the authors agree that potassium efflux is the driving force of hypotonicity-induced NLRP3 activation because blocking potassium efflux prevents NLRP3 activation (PMID:22981536). The question is how this relates to VRAC-mediated Cl flux. I think it's an appealing hypothesis that Cl flux needs to happen to allow potassium efflux while maintaining electro-neutrality. The authors make the point that during ATP/Nigericin stimulation this might not be the case, but I'd like to argue that these two situations are likely to differ. It's conceivable that Cl efflux is required for potassium efflux during RVD while Cl efflux is not required for potassium efflux by Nigericin (potassium/proton antiporter) and P2X7 (cation-channel).</p><p>Unless the authors provide experimental evidence against the interpretation of their data that Cl efflux during RVD is required to allow potassium efflux, I'd recommend to the authors to mention this hypothesis in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59704.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Points requiring additional experimentation:</p><p>1) The pharmacological analysis of VRAC inhibition is done entirely in Hela cells whereas the rest of the paper is about NLRP3 activation in macrophages.</p><p>a) Given that subunit composition could be different between HeLa cells and macrophages and this could play a role in differing pharmacology, it is imperative that the analysis of VRAC inhibition should be performed on macrophages, not the endogenous channels in Hela cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2C and D are data from primary bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs). In this experiment we show that the inhibitors (except for 4-sulfonic[6]calixarene) inhibit the regulated volume decrease (RVD) caused by hypotonic buffer. The original papers characterising the effect of LRRC8A knockdown on VRAC function showed that it was essential for both iodide quenching of YFP fluorescence and for RVD (PMIDs: 24725410, 24790029). In Figure 2 all inhibitors except calixarene blocked RVD in both cell types. Calixarene was identified as a potential VRAC inhibitor from the modelling presented in Figure 1. Thus, the assays in either respective cell type reflect the same effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In addition, the authors should confirm that the VRAC KOs are completely deficient in RVD by using their VRAC inhibitors in VRAC KOs. In other words Figure 4C should include several of the VRAC inhibitors in both WT and VRAC KO cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted the experiment as suggested by the reviewers. We measured the RVD response in BMDMs from WT and VRAC KO cells in the presence or absence of the established VRAC inhibitor DCPIB. These data show that WT cells treated with the VRAC inhibitor exhibit a similar RVD response to vehicle treated KO BMDMs. Interestingly KO BMDMs appear to exhibit a further swelling response in presence of DCPIB suggesting that in the absence of VRAC other Cl<sup>-</sup> channels act to constrain cell volume when an RVD is inhibited. These data suggest that DCPIB also inhibits other Cl<sup>-</sup> channels consistent with our overall observation that VRAC inhibitors block DAMP-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation by channels other than those dependent on LRRC8A. These data are now provided as Figure 4—figure supplement 1. The text of the manuscript has been amended to reflect these new findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The cell culture experiments showing hypotonicty-induced NLRP3 activation are convincing, but raise the question: under what circumstance(s) is this physiologically relevant?</p></disp-quote><p>Hypo-osmolarity has not been studied extensively in in vivo disease models, but treatment with hypertonic solutions is known to be effective at alleviating inflammation, including in LPS-induced sepsis (PMID: 23295602), intracerebral haemorrhage (PMID: 29700692), pulmonary injury due to ischaemia-reperfusion (PMID: 12511143), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (PMID: 25962375). The reasons for the therapeutic effects of hypertonic fluid treatment are poorly defined, but could be at least in part due to NLRP3 inhibition. Other pathological conditions that cause cell swelling including hypoxia/ischaemia, hyponatremia, hypothermia, and others (PMID: 19126758). Furthermore, animal cell membranes are highly permeable to water and in PMID: 22981536, cell volume regulation is described as a primitive response to alterations in environmental osmolarity. Under physiological conditions cell volume is perturbed by transepithelial transport, accumulation of nutrients and metabolic waste products, and intestinal epithelial cells and blood in intestinal capillaries can be exposed to low extracellular osmolarity after water or hypotonic food intake (reviewed in PMID: 19126758). We have modified the text of the discussion to highlight the potential of hypotonicity induced signalling to disease based on the treatment by hypertonic solutions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) There seems to be an underlying implication or assumption that DAMP stimulation evokes VRAC activation. Is this the intendend implication? If so, this needs to be explicitly tested.</p></disp-quote><p>Within the literature there was an acceptance that DAMP stimulation could cause changes in cell volume. For example, in 1996 PMID: 8939922 first reported hypotonicity induced IL-1β release, and also showed that ATP (via P2X7 activation)-induced IL-1β release could be inhibited by a hypertonic buffer. In his 2012 paper Pelegrin showed that hypertonic buffer inhibited NLRP3 activation to a range of DAMPs and to hypotonicity. Thus, we assumed that DAMP stimulation would regulate NLRP3 activation via VRAC. We show clearly that this was not the case. This rationale is now clearly explained within the final paragraph of the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Alternatively, the authors should provide another physiologically relevant scenario in which hypotonicity might naturally be encountered by a cell, leading to NLRP3 activation. Do the authors think that the extreme (though typical in the literature) hypotonic conditions used in culture experiments (using a switch from ~340to ~120 mOsm solutions) are likely to occur in vivo?

Could these alternatives be involved in LRRC8-mediated NLRP3 activation?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, for example sphongosine-1-phosphate (S1P) activates VRAC in mouse macrophages (PMID: 24965069). We previously reported that sphingosine, and S1P, could activate NLRP3 (PMID: 22105559). VRAC is also thought to be important for cell death induced by apoptosis inducing drugs (e.g. PMIDs: 26984736, 26530471), and we also previously reported that apoptosis inducing drugs could activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in activated macrophages (PMID: 24790078) suggesting another area of relevance. This has been added to the discussion. LRRC8A was also recently shown to have an important role in anti-viral signalling in response to HSV-1 infection alone by allowing the import and export of the STING activator 2’-3’-cGAMP (PMID: 32277911), suggesting VRAC is activated in these conditions. Several viruses have been speculated to promote activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Reviewed by PMID: 30209070), including HSV-1 (PMID: 32101570, 23427152).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Finally, can the authors speculate on whether it is Cl<sup>-</sup> flux per se through LRRC8 or other Cl<sup>-</sup> channels that is important for NLRP3 activation? Other possibilities include voltage changes, RVD, and flux of other permeant ions like ATP or cyclic dinucleotides.</p></disp-quote><p>VRAC is directly permeable to Cl<sup>-</sup> and we previously provided some mechanistic insight into direct effects of Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux on NLRP3 dependent ASC oligomerisation (PMID: 30232264). VRAC activation caused by swelling can also activate other Cl<sup>-</sup> channels, notably anoctamin 1 (e.g. PMIDs: 31242393, 27514381), and we cannot rule out the possibility that other VRAC activated Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance is involved. Moreover, other studies have also implicated a role for Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance in NLRP3 activation (PMID 28576828, 28779175, 32523112). VRAC is also permeable to some small molecules, and recently VRAC was reported to act as a conduit for cGAMP and contribute to antiviral immune responses in bystander cells as a result (PMID: 32277911). VRAC can also regulate the release of ATP (PMID: 31988241) which could activate P2X7, although hypotonicity induced NLRP3 activation was established to be independent of P2X7 (PMID: 22981536).
