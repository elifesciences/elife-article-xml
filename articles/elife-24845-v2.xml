To identify factors modulating SV movements, we performed real-time imaging analysis of fluorescently labeled SVs in giant calyceal and conventional hippocampal terminals. Compared with small hippocampal terminals, SV movements in giant calyceal terminals were faster, longer and kinetically more heterogeneous. Morphological maturation of giant calyceal terminals was associated with an overall reduction in SV mobility and displacement heterogeneity. At the molecular level, SVs over-expressing vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) showed higher mobility than VGLUT2-expressing SVs. Pharmacological disruption of the presynaptic microtubule network preferentially reduced long directional movements of SVs between release sites. Functionally, synaptic stimulation appeared to recruit SVs to active zones without significantly altering their mobility. Hence, the morphological features of nerve terminals and the molecular signature of vesicles are key elements determining vesicular dynamics and movements in central synapses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24845.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24845.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24845.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the brains of mammals, communication between cells called neurons is vital for learning and memory. Pairs of neurons communicate at junctions called synapses. At a synapse, the first neuron releases chemical messengers into the gap between the cells, which then bind to and activate receptor proteins on the surface of the second neuron. The chemical messengers are released from bubble-like packages called synaptic vesicles that fuse with the first neuron’s membrane and empty their contents into the synapse. This same neuron then retrieves and reassembles the components of the vesicle, ready to be filled again with the chemical messengers.</p><p>Neurons must continually retrieve and refill vesicles in order to continue transmitting information at synapses. But while the mechanisms of vesicle fusion and retrieval are well characterized, it remains unclear what triggers the movement and supply of vesicles inside synapses or how these processed are regulated. Deciphering these mechanisms will help us better understand how synapses work in healthy as well as diseased brains.</p><p>Using high-resolution microscopy, Guillaud et al. have now studied the movements of fluorescently labeled vesicles inside mouse brain synapses grown in the laboratory. This revealed that synaptic vesicles move in much more varied and complex ways than previously thought. The movement of vesicles changed depending on the type and developmental stage of the synapses. It also depended on the identity of particular proteins within the membranes of the vesicles themselves. These proteins, known as transporters, enable vesicles to take up the chemical messengers. Vesicles with different transporters showed different patterns of movement. Disrupting components of the internal skeleton of the neuron – specifically protein filaments called microtubules – also disrupted vesicle movement. By contrast, changes in the activity level of the synapse had no such effect.</p><p>The next step is to determine exactly how these factors regulate the movement of vesicles at synapses. Studies can then examine whether these processes are disrupted in neurological disorders, in which communication at synapses is often impaired.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24845.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24845.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>presynaptic terminal</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle</kwd><kwd>mobility</kwd><kwd>morphology</kwd><kwd>vesicular glutamate transporter</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004199</institution-id><institution>Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>Tomoyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In central synapses, the mobility and supply of synaptic vesicles are determined by two independent biological factors: the morphological and structural organization of nerve terminals and the molecular signature of vesicles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>At chemical synapses, neurotransmitters such as glutamate are contained in synaptic vesicles (SVs) and released by exocytosis. After exocytosis, SVs are retrieved by endocytosis, refilled with neurotransmitter, and transported to release sites to be reused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heuser and Reese, 1973</xref>). Although cellular and molecular mechanisms of exocytosis and endocytosis have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sudhof, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</xref>), movements of SVs between endocytosis and exocytosis are least understood. Previous studies have reported a wide range of SV mobility, several orders of magnitude different in their diffusion coefficient (D), between different types or even in the same type of presynaptic terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rea et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jordan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Westphal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kamin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Within nerve terminals, at both hippocampal and neuromuscular synapses, SVs reportedly display low mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lemke and Klingauf, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaffield and Betz, 2007</xref>), whereas SVs traveling across distant hippocampal presynaptic boutons show higher mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Darcy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernandez-Alfonso and Ryan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Staras et al., 2010</xref>). It is also controversial whether stimulation can affect SV mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaffield et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peng et al., 2012</xref>) or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betz and Bewick, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Westphal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kamin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In spite of the wealth of molecular and cellular knowledge on neurotransmission, much less is known about the mechanisms regulating SV trafficking and supply in nerve terminals, and only few factors, modulating SV movements, have been identified thus far. Synapsin-1 has long been identified as a tether anchoring and releasing SVs in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Llinás et al., 1985</xref>) and is thought to regulate SV mobility in various nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jordan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaffield et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rothman et al., 2016</xref>). Actin network has also been implicated in the regulation of fast trafficking of SVs between synaptic sites in central synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Darcy et al., 2006</xref>). The roles of another cytosketal element, microtubules (MTs) and their associated molecular motors are well established for axonal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2010</xref>), but their contribution in the regulation of SV dynamics within nerve terminals remains to be elucidated. Mechanical factors such as membrane tensions are proposed to promote accumulation of SVs in nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Siechen et al., 2009</xref>) or to increase their mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, experimentally constrained models suggested that physical determinants such as hydrodynamic interaction and vesicle collision influence SV movements in presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rothman et al., 2016</xref>). However, biological factors and mechanisms underlying the diversity of SV mobility in nerve terminals remain poorly understood.</p><p>In mammalian central synapses, imaging studies of SV mobility have been restricted to small hippocampal synapses. Here, by taking advantage of our newly developed giant glutamatergic synapses formed in primary culture between mouse auditory brainstem neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dimitrov et al., 2016</xref>), we visualized SVs using real-time confocal microscopy, and analyzed their movements by automatically tracking large populations of fluorescently labelled vesicles within presynaptic terminals. We then performed spatio-temporal analyses of more than 35,000 vesicle trajectories to quantify their intrinsic dynamic properties (i.e. maximum speed and track length), their modalities of displacement (i.e. diffusive or active motions), and their overall mobility (i.e. diffusion coefficient). We compared these parameters between giant calyceal terminals and small hippocampal presynaptic boutons, between morphologically mature and immature calyceal terminals, and between calyceal terminals over-expressing two distinct vesicular proteins, VGLUT1 or VGLUT2. We also tested the effects of pharmacological disruption of the microtubule (MT) network, as well as of various stimulation protocols on SV movements within calyceal terminals. Altogether, our results revealed several factors influencing SV mobility and trafficking in the CNS: the type of synapse (giant calyceal or small conventional terminals), the spatial localization of vesicles within a terminal (intra-swelling or inter-swelling), and the molecular composition of vesicles (vesicular glutamate transporter subtypes). Our results also suggest that MTs play essential roles in inter-synaptic movements of SVs and that synaptic stimulation does not induce any appreciable increase in SV mobility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mobility of synaptic vesicles in giant calyceal terminals</title><p>To visualize SVs by fluorescence confocal microscopy, primary cultures over-expressing GFP in presynaptic neurons were incubated in the presence of Q655-labeled synaptotagmin-2 antibody (Q655-Syt2) from 1 hr to overnight to allow spontaneous uptake of the fluorescent marker into SVs. After image acquisition, automatic spot detection of individual SVs, on 2D confocal section, was performed using IMARIS software (see Materials and methods). Q655-Syt2 fluorescent spots distributed throughout the entire calyceal terminal over-expressing GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

The diffusion coefficient (D), calculated from the mean square displacement (MSD) curves of trajectories identified with the autoregressive algorithm (D = 0.065 ± 0.004 µm<sup>2</sup>/s), was seven times greater than that calculated from the MSD determined by the Brownian algorithm (D = 0.009 ± 0.001 µm<sup>2</sup>/s).

The proportion of slow and short vesicles movements increased from immature (50%) to mature (70%) terminals, whereas fast, long directional movements decreased from 50% to 30% during morphological maturation of terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). As the calyceal terminal morphology advanced, diffusive motions relative to active directional motions increased by ~1.8 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Consistently, SV mobility was significantly reduced after morphological development of calyceal terminals, from immature stage 2 (D = 0.072 ± 0.005 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) to mature stage 4 (D = 0.052 ± 0.003 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). SV mobility transiently increases from stage 1 (D = 0.062 ± 0.002 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) to stage 2 (D = 0.075 ± 0.004 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) and stage 3 (D = 0.071 ± 0.002 µm<sup>2</sup>/s), to finally decrease in stage 4 (D = 0.055 ± 0.001 µm<sup>2</sup>/s). These results indicate that after a transient increase, SV mobility is globally down-regulated after the morphological maturation of giant calyceal terminals.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24845.024</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>SV mobility decreases after morphological maturation of giant terminals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Live confocal imaging of a giant immature terminal expressing cytosolic GFP and Q655-Syt2-labeled vesicles, with SV tracking color-coded over time, or sorted according to trajectory length (Blue &lt;2 µm, Green 2–4 µm and red &gt;4 µm).

As giant calyceal terminals in culture express both VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dimitrov et al., 2016</xref>), we questioned whether expression of different VGLUT subtypes might affect dynamic properties of SVs in nerve terminals. Venus-VGLUT1 and Venus-VGLUT2 were overexpressed in different presynaptic neurons and both localized on SVs throughout giant calyceal terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>), similar to the distribution of endogenous VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). After 21 days in culture, expression levels of Venus-VGLUT1 and Venus-VGLUT2, deduced from their fluorescence intensity in the terminals, were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Venus-VGLUT1- or Venus-VGLUT2-expressing SVs were visualized and their movements tracked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and analyzed, as described for vesicles labeled with Q655-Syt2. The distribution of trajectories, according to their maximum speed and length, showed higher heterogeneity in movements of SVs expressing Venus-VGLUT1 than of SVs expressing Venus-VGLUT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Analysis of trajectories, displacement modalities, and diffusion coefficients of vesicles pooled from six terminals over-expressing Venus-VGLTU1 and 6 terminals over-expressing Venus-VGLUT2 remarkably revealed that VGLUT1-containing SVs had wider ranges and faster movements than VGLUT2-containing SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Surprisingly, the generally observed positive correlation between trajectory length and maximum speed was absent in VGLUT2-containing SVs, but was retained in VGLUT1-containing SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). VGLUT1-containing SVs displayed ~1.6 times (28.9%) more active displacements than VGLUT2-containing SVs (18.2%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Furthermore, the mobility of vesicles expressing Venus-VGLUT1 (D = 0.072 ± 0.005 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) was ~1.7 times higher than that of those expressing Venus-VGLUT2 (D = 0.043 ± 0.008 µm<sup>2</sup>/s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Assuming a one-to-one expression ratio in calyceal terminals, the average diffusion coefficient of Venus-VGLUT1 and Venus-VGLUT2 expressing SVs (D = 0.058 ± 0.006 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) was similar to those of Q655-Syt2-labeled SVs (D = 0.065 ± 0.004 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) or C5E-Syt2-labeled SVs (D = 0.063 ± 0.003 µm<sup>2</sup>/s).

Our data indicate that a significant number of vesicles move within giant terminals with speed comparable to that of molecular motors along MTs involved in intracellular organelle transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2010</xref>). Synaptic growth involves reorganization of the neuronal cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roos et al., 2000</xref>), which in turn could affect SV mobility. Hence, we examined whether cytoskeletal elements such as MTs and kinesins could be involved in transport of SVs in giant calyceal terminals. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that giant presynaptic terminals were enriched in de-tyrosinated α-tubulin-containing polymers that interconnect neighboring and distant presynaptic swellings filled with SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The molecular motor, KIF1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Okada et al., 1995</xref>), was also found in calyceal terminals and partially co-localized with the vesicular protein, synaptophysin, within swellings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). KIF1A also co-localized with VGLUT1-containing SVs in regions that interconnect swellings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>), suggesting that KIF1A might carry SVs along MTs within and between swellings. To test the possible involvement of MT-based transport in SV mobility, we disrupted presynaptic MT networks by bath application of 30 µM nocodazole. Fluorescence intensity of Silicon-Rhodamine (SiR)-tubulin-containing polymers decreased by ~30% after 90 min incubation with nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>), indicating that a significant fraction of MTs in calyceal terminals were depolymerized. Depolymerization of one third of MT networks was sufficient to significantly impair fast, long directional SV movements within terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). The distribution of trajectories according to their maximum speed and length (from eight untreated and eight nocodazole-treated terminals) showed that MT disruption reduced the proportion of SVs with long directional trajectories and concurrently increased the proportion of SVs with short displacements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). However, the apparently lower mobility observed after nocodazole treatment (D = 0.057 ± 0.004 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) was not significant compared to controls before treatment (D = 0.066 ± 0.005 µm<sup>2</sup>/s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). On the other hand, disruption of actin network, which essentially localized within discreet regions of presynaptic swellings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), did not affect the movement of SVs between swellings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These results indicate that MT depolymerization selectively reduces the maximum speed and the proportion of SVs travelling long distances, suggesting a dominant role of MT-based transport for SVs undergoing inter-swelling trafficking in giant terminals.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24845.031</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Presynaptic MT network regulates long and rapid directional SV movements.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal z-stack imaging of a calyceal terminal labelled with antibodies against de-tyrosinated α-tubulin (Red), VGLUT1 (Green) and DAPI (Blue).

Thus, we investigated whether SVs, labeled spontaneously or during electrical stimulation, might show different dynamic properties. Electrical stimulation in the presence of C5E-Syt2, significantly increased the number of C5E-loaded vesicles in terminals, as well as their fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), as reported previously in KCl-stimulated hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kraszewski et al., 1995</xref>). However, the mobility of SVs loaded upon electrical stimulation (D = 0.052 ± 0.003 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) was not different from that of those loaded spontaneously for 1 hr before stimulation (D = 0.048 ± 0.005 µm<sup>2</sup>/s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). The mobility of SVs loaded with Syt2-C5E spontaneously or during synaptic stimulation was also consistent with the reduced mobility of newly endocytosed Q585-loaded SVs observed after 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>), suggesting that the mobility of SVs labeled spontaneously or during stimulation were similar. Thus, while the number of moving vesicles might vary, neither chemical nor electrical stimulation significantly increased their dynamic properties and mobility in giant calyceal terminals.</p><p>Finally, we tested whether stimulation might affect SV dynamics near active zones (AZs). We labeled surface GluR1/2 on post-synaptic neurons to localize the release sites on the pre-synaptic terminal previously loaded with syt2-C5E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), and compared SV movements within and outside from putative AZs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). We showed that during field electrical stimulation at 1 Hz, the proportion of SVs significantly increased by ~1.8 times near release sites (from 21% to 38%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). However, the mobility of SVs inside (D<sub>in</sub> = 0.027 ± 0.008 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) and outside (D<sub>out</sub> = 0.044 ± 0.003 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) of AZs remained largely unaffected during stimulation (D<sub>in</sub> = 0.024 ± 0.007 µm<sup>2</sup>/s and D<sub>out</sub> = 0.037 ± 0.005 µm<sup>2</sup>/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). The apparent lower mobility of SVs within AZs compared to SVs outside AZs was also not statistically significant before (p=0.08, n = 6) and during stimulation (p=0.18, n = 6). Thus, our data indicate that electrical stimulation recruits SVs to AZs without altering their overall mobility.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24845.039</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Electrical stimulation does not affect SV mobility within or outside of active zone.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Live confocal imaging of surface GluR1/2-Cy3 and Syt2-C5E-loaded SVs in GFP over-expressing giant calyceal terminal.

Comparative analyses of SV trajectories between (i) giant calyceal and small hippocampal terminals, (ii) morphologically mature and immature calyceal terminals and (iii) SVs over-expressing VGLUT1 or VGLUT2, together with analyses of the effects of cytoskeletal perturbation and various types of synaptic stimulation, revealed fast and heterogeneous SV movements in giant terminals, involvement of the MT cytoskeleton in inter-swelling trafficking, unchanged SV mobility in response to stimulation, and an influence of presynaptic morphology and vesicular protein composition on SV dynamics and movements.</p><p>Imaging and tracking methods, as well as various analytical approaches used in this study, permitted a detailed analysis of SV movements in nerve terminals. Automated tracking of large numbers of SVs, based on an autoregressive motion algorithm, enabled characterization of complex vesicle movements, complexity that could not be assessed by simple Brownian motion analysis. Characterization of SV dynamic properties, such as maximum speed or track length, and SV displacement modalities along individual trajectories, substantially enhanced the analysis of SV movements compared with analyses based solely on diffusion coefficients (D), where subtle changes in active vesicle dynamics may simply escape detection. In calyceal giant terminals, the diffusion coefficients calculated from MSD curves were comparable to those calculated from FRAP experiments. However, we speculate that the discrepancy between the diffusion coefficients in swelling estimated from MSD and FRAP experiments might result from the different number of interconnected fingers/swellings between terminals analyzed in each experiment that would significantly influence the proportion of long and fast SV movements. This indicates minimal bias of our automated tracking method, and allowed us to compare SV mobility in calyceal terminals with those previously reported in other types of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rea et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lemke and Klingauf, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaffield and Betz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shtrahman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rothman et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our present analysis revealed at least three groups of SVs with different dynamic properties and trajectories: intra-swelling trafficking (slow and short (S) trajectories), intermediate trafficking (moderate speed and medium (M) trajectories), and inter-swelling trafficking (fast and long (L) trajectories). We showed that SV movements are highly heterogeneous in giant calyceals, combining both diffusional and active motions. These data are in agreement with recent study showing heterogeneous SV motions in rat hippocampal neuron culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joensuu et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together Joensuu et al. and our current work demonstrated that SV movements in CNS terminals are much more heterogeneous than previously thought. Among all the individual trajectories analyzed in our study, we observed a clear, positive correlation between SV trajectory length and SV traveling speed, implying that the time required for SVs to move over short or long distances could be normalized by this mechanism. This suggests that SVs remote from active zones (AZs) could potentially reach their release sites with the same efficiency as SVs closer to AZs. These findings are complementary to a report showing that recycling SVs undergoing release at neuromuscular junctions do not have preferential spatial distributions, but are scattered randomly within nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rizzoli and Betz, 2004</xref>).</p><p>To date, numerous publications have reported a wide range of SV mobility based on analyses of diffusion coefficients obtained by different methodologies at physiological or non-physiological temperatures, and/or at different types of synapses, such as in mouse hippocampal terminals (D ~ 1×10<sup>−2</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s at RT, D = 4–9×10<sup>−4</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lemke and Klingauf, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shtrahman et al., 2005</xref>), goldfish retinal bipolar cells (D = 1.5×10<sup>−2</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s at RT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holt et al., 2004</xref>), lizard retinal cone cells (D = 0.1 µm<sup>2</sup>/s at RT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rea et al., 2004</xref>), or in frog (D = 2.6×10<sup>−3</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaffield et al., 2006</xref>) or mouse (D = 5×10<sup>−3</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaffield and Betz, 2007</xref>) neuromuscular junctions. Although these data might suggest that SV mobility varies among terminal types, the lack of direct and consistent comparison between synapses raises the question of whether synapse types or morphologies really influence SV mobility. Hence, we analyzed SV movements between giant calyceal and small hippocampal terminals under the same conditions and imaging methods. We found threefold higher SV mobility in calyceal synapses (D = 6.5×10<sup>−2</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s) than in hippocampal synapses (D = 2×10<sup>−2</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s). SV mobility tended to be higher at larger calyceal swellings, but this tendency was absent at hippocampal boutons. Thus, terminal size is clearly one of the biological factors influencing SV mobility.</p><p>Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peng et al. (2012)</xref> suggested that discrepancies in SV mobility reported thus far might arise from differences in molecular composition of SVs between and/or within synapses. SV proteins are commonly divided into two classes, based on their functions: transport proteins (proton pump, VGLUT, etc.) that mediate neurotransmitter uptake, and trafficking proteins (rab, synaptotagmin, etc.) involved in SV intracellular transport and movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sudhof, 1999</xref>). VGLUT isoforms have different regional and developmental expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liguz-Lecznar and Skangiel-Kramska, 2007</xref>), and reportedly produce different release probabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weston et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we showed that over-expression of VGLUT1 or VLGUT2 also confers different dynamic properties upon SVs and influences their mobility in calyceal presynaptic terminals. Particularly, VGLUT1-expressing SVs moved faster and traveled farther than VGLUT2-expressing SVs. Remarkably, VGLUT2-expressing vesicles lost the positive correlation between speed and distance, suggesting that their capacity to reach the AZ might be less than of VGLUT1-expressing SVs, when their initial position is distant from the AZ. Speculatively, dynamic properties of VGLUT1- and VGLUT2-expressing vesicles might result from different affinities for tethering/scaffolding proteins or molecular motors. It is likely that the ratio between SVs containing specific molecular markers, as well as their distribution and positioning within terminals, explain differences in SV mobility observed at various synapses.</p><p>We have identified a large population, ~15% of labeled vesicles, moving between presynaptic swellings at high speeds and with long, directional trajectories. This population of SVs undergoing inter-swelling exchange in giant calyceal terminals appears to be three times larger than that observed in conventional-sized hippocampal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alabi and Tsien, 2012</xref>) and previously designated as the ‘super pool.’ In hippocampal terminals, actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Darcy et al., 2006</xref>) and BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Staras et al., 2010</xref>) are reportedly involved in SV movements from the super pool. In contrast, our data in calyceal terminals revealed a significant contribution of MT networks to the transport and movements of SVs between swellings. We speculate that a large ‘super pool’ and presynaptic MTs may be required to coordinate fast and efficient cycling of SVs among the numerous release sites present in single giant terminals, compared to the constitutive sharing and replenishment of SVs observed in multiple individual conventional boutons.</p><p>Our data show that presynaptic morphology can significantly influence SV dynamics and movements. During development, giant terminals in culture undergo significant reorganization of their presynaptic compartments (i.e. increased surface, volume, and complexity), leading to formation of mature synaptic connections and associated with a 1.5-fold reduction in SV dynamics and movements. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that other molecular mechanisms occurring during synaptic growth and maturation regulate SV movements, the high SV mobility observed in immature terminals might arise from two independent, but integrative factors: (i) co-transport of AZ components and other synaptic proteins with SV precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Okada et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yonekawa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stagi et al., 2005</xref>) and (ii) changes in mechanical tension during synaptic development. In immature terminals, SV mobility is high and transiently increases from stage 1 to stage 2 in parallel with increased presynaptic volume, whereas in mature terminals, SV mobility decreases significantly from stage 3 to stage 4 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This high and increasing SV mobility observed in immature terminals could result from the necessity to coordinate vesicle trafficking with rapid transport and delivery of synaptic components prior to establishment of stable synaptic contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bury and Sabo, 2011</xref>). On another hand, the rise in mechanical tension associated with expansion of the presynaptic area during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Siechen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2012</xref>) could increase the probability of fast active motions, as observed in <italic>Aplysia</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed and Saif, 2014</xref>). After formation of stable and mature synaptic contacts during stages 3 and 4, coordinated trafficking of SVs and AZ components may diminish and mechanical tensions may lessen, simultaneously reducing active transport and SV mobility. These factors, in addition to the structural organization of the MT cytoskeleton, might also account for the decrease (1.4 times) in SV mobility observed between finger-like processes and swellings.</p><p>In giant calyceal terminals, neither chemical nor electrical stimulation increased SV mobility, in agreement with previous reports at the neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betz and Bewick, 1992</xref>) or at hippocampal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lemke and Klingauf, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kamin et al., 2010</xref>). These results imply that SV trafficking between endocytosis and exocytosis remain largely unchanged upon stimulation. However, our results do not exclude the possibility that SVs, undergoing exocytosis, might transiently change their mobility during stimulation, and image analysis at higher spatial and temporal resolution might resolve putative changes in SV movements involved in neurotransmitter release. Nevertheless, our analysis has revealed some alterations of SV dynamics after KCl stimulation, inducing clustering of SVs in calyeceal swellings, and a marked reduction in long trajectory SV movements. Presumably, after KCl stimulation, SVs were immobilized near release sites. Likewise, hypertonic sucrose stimulation, which depletes SVs from the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stevens and Tsujimoto, 1995</xref>) significantly reduced the number of actively moving SVs, suggesting that SVs depleted from the RRP during exocytosis were replenished from a recycling pool of SVs previously moving with active displacements. Direct support of synaptic transmission might be provided by fast diffusive and subtle local changes in SV mobility near release sites as recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rothman et al., 2016</xref>), rather than diverse and heterogenous SV movements prior to release. The latter may contribute to distribute SVs in optimal locations for the functional and structural maintenance of presynaptic terminals. In this regard, during the process of SV labeling, newly endocytosed SVs had low mobility with their distribution confined near endocytic regions for the first hour. Low SV mobility near exo/endocytic regions is likely caused by tethering of SVs around release sites. Classically, synapsin-1 is thought to tether SVs in its dephosphorylated form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Llinás et al., 1985</xref>). The broad-spectrum phosphatase inhibitor OA increases SV mobility by ~10 times in hippocampal terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jordan et al., 2005</xref>) or at the neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaffield et al., 2006</xref>). In calyceal terminals, OA only increased SV mobility by ~1.4 times, similar to that recently reported at cerebellar mossy fiber terminals (~2 times; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rothman et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting higher abundancy of untethered SVs in these terminals and/or phosphorylation independent SV tethering with molecules such as Basson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hallermann et al., 2010</xref>) or Unc analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Böhme et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We have also demonstrated that SVs accumulate at release sites during electrical stimulation without significantly changing their mobility compared to resting condition. Although we do not exclude the possibility that SV dynamics at release sites might be affected by synaptic activity, higher temporal and spatial resolution imaging methods would be required to assess putative changes in the mobility of SVs associated with neurotransmitter release.</p><p>Altogether, our data indicate that in central nervous system, SV movements are highly heterogenous and that large synapses possess higher basal SV mobility than smaller synapses. Our results also suggest that SV movements and supply can be influenced by morphological characteristics of presynaptic terminals and by molecular signatures of vesicles. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be characterized, presynaptic morphology and vesicular composition appeared to be major biological determinants characterizing SV dynamics and trafficking in central synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Primary neuronal cultures</title><p>Giant synapse primary cultures were established as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dimitrov et al., 2016</xref>).

After localizing giant presynaptic terminals over-expressing cytosolic GFP, a region of interest (ROI) containing several interconnected presynaptic swellings, located in the upper region of the calyceal terminal (z = 10–15 µm), was identified in order to achieve an effective scanning speed of 1–1.25 frame per second for up to 120 s, on single 2D optical section (initial image resolution 512 × 512 pixels, pixel dwell time 3.15 µs). For 3D tracking, four optical sections (~300 nm) covering the height of presynaptic swellings (~1.5 µm) were acquired with a pixel dwell time of 1.27 µs. Raw confocal images were filtered using the median filter algorithm in ZEN 2.1 (Carl Zeiss) before further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image analysis and vesicle tracking</title><p>Accurate automatic and simultaneous tracking of a large population of objects, such as vesicles, requires robust and sophisticated algorithms that can identify independent objects, predict their future positions based on their previous speed, directionality, and weighted intensity. Here, IMARIS 8.1 with IMARIS Track, Measurement Pro and Vantage plugins (Bitplane, Switzerland), commonly used to analyze organelle movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wong and Munro, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grassart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maucort et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Varela et al., 2015</xref>), was used to track SV movements and to perform spatio-temporal analyses of several thousand vesicle trajectories. Spot detection and tracking was performed on 30 s sequences using either the autoregressive or Brownian motion algorithm with an initial spot size of 150 nm (Gaussian fitted), a maximum distance between spots on two consecutive frames of 0.8 µm without frame gap. The distance between spots on two consecutive frames was set to 0.8 µm because kinesin-driven transport in mammalian neurons has an average speed of 0.7–1 µm/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guillaud et al., 2003</xref>); thus, we conservatively estimated the maximum distance travelled by a vesicle associated with kinesin within a 1 s interval would be ~0.8 µm. For rendering and visualization, synaptic vesicles were color-coded according to their respective speeds, and tracks were color-coded according to time or to their trajectory length. Analysis and comparison of SV trajectories and dynamic properties were performed in mature terminals unless stated otherwise. Statistical data sets regarding pre-synaptic volume and surface, vesicle speed and track length, etc. were exported from IMARIS Measurement Pro to Prism 6 (Graphpad software Inc., USA) and MS Excel (Microsoft, USA). The mean square displacement (MSD) analysis and estimation of the diffusion coefficient (D) from vesicle trajectories was performed using the MSD Matlab plugin for IMARIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tarantino et al., 2014</xref>). The diffusion coefficient from FRAP experiments was calculated as D = [0.224x(ω<sup>2</sup>/T<sub>1/2</sub>)], where ω represents the length of the bleached region of interest and T<sub>1/2</sub>, the time to recover half of the fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axelrod et al., 1976</xref>). The Pearson coefficient (P) for co-localization was calculated in IMARIS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Live imaging of microtubule, actin networks and AMPA receptors</title><p>Labeling of microtubule and actin networks in live terminals was performed with SiR-tubulin and SiR-actin (Cytoskeleton Inc., USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, primary cultures were exposed to 1 µM SiR-Tubulin or SiR-Actin in Tyrode’s solution for 30 min at 37°C. Labeling solution was replaced with fresh Tyrode’s solution without SiR-Tubulin or SiR-Actin before imaging.</p><p>Surface labeling of AMPA receptors in giant calyceal culture was performed by incubation with 10 µg/ml mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of GluR1/2 tagged with Cy3, for 15 min at room temperature before live imaging. Projection of the surface area labeled with GluR1/2-Cy3 on to the pre-synaptic terminal was used to delineate release sites and compare SV mobility inside and outside putative active zones.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Drug treatments and field stimulation</title><p>De-polymerization of microtubules and disruption of actin filaments were performed by bath application of 30 µM nocodazole (Tocris, USA) or 10 µM latrunculin-A (Focus Biomolecules, USA), respectively.

The study is very detailed, and resulted in a substantial amount of descriptive observations. Movement in calyceal terminals was faster with a surprisingly high diffusion coefficient of about 0.06 µm<sup>2</sup>/s, and over longer stretches, than in small hippocampal synapses; this changed during calyceal maturation; vesicles expressing VGLUT1 were more mobile than vesicles expressing the similar transporter VGLUT2; removal of microtubules resulted in a loss of long-distance movement, in agreement with the current literature. Neither chemical, nor electrical stimulation ever increased the synaptic vesicle movement, again in agreement with the current literature. The work is of high technical quality (but see one concern below). It contains several interesting findings, and some results that are novel. The strongest points of the study are the direct comparison of two types of synapses within one study, the developmental analysis, and the comparison of vGlut1 and vGlut2 expressing vesicles.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One reviewer was concerned about the absolute size of the diffusion coefficient. This value seems to critically depend on the used tracking algorithm (0.06 µm<sup>2</sup>/s with autoregressive algorithm but 0.01 µm<sup>2</sup>/s with Brownian motion algorithm). The image acquisition rate is about 1 Hz. One worry is that the two different vesicles moving through a single optical section are erroneously tracked as one vesicle. This would also predict the longer tracks associated with faster diffusion coefficients (which is only not the case in vGlut2 expressing vesicles). The authors argue that the FRAP experiments are consistent, but (1) there are significant differences (in swellings: D = 0.022 µm<sup>2</sup>/s with FRAP but D = 0.041 µm<sup>2</sup>/s with vesicle tracking) and (2) a reliable dissection of diffusion speed and immobile fraction seems difficult (cf. increasing florescence at end of trace for swellings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>2) One additional experiment would substantially enhance the output of the manuscript: an experiment in which the vesicle motion is described in relation to active zones. Since the pre- and postsynaptic active zones tend to be aligned, it is irrelevant whether the former or the latter are labeled. The authors should try to label postsynaptic glutamate receptors using antibodies directed against their extracellular domains, which are commercially available, and perform some vesicle imaging experiments, with or without stimulation. This type of experiment would add quite important information, relating to the behavior of vesicles near active zones, or away from them. For example, it is conceivable that the movement near active zones is quite different during stimulation, in comparison to the resting state. Such information would make this manuscript even more interesting and useful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24845.042</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) One reviewer was concerned about the absolute size of the diffusion coefficient.

We have limited our data acquisition to a maximum of 0.5 s per image in order to maintain the size of the ROI and to maintain the quality of the spot detection. Acquisition faster than 0.5 s per image substantially reduced the spatial resolution and detection of individual spots unless reducing the ROI significantly, which would in turn compromise the detection of inter-swelling movements. These new results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, and reported in the third paragraph of the subsection “Fast and heterogenous vesicles mobility in giant calyceal terminals”. We showed that the proportions of slow/short (S), medium (M) and fast/long (L) trajectories were not significantly affected by the data acquisition rate, indicating that the long and fast directional runs are not likely resulting from the erroneous detection of different SVs moving through the focal plan during image intervals.</p><p>We also previously thought about the possibility that 2 different SVs moving in and out of the focal plan could also be tracked as one, and affected the detection and accuracy of SV trajectories. We thus compared SV movements from 2D (xy) and 3D (xyz) data and showed that SV trajectories and mobility were not affected either. These results are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2H</xref> and more explicitly described in the aforementioned paragraph.</p><p>Although we cannot exclude the possibility of erroneous detection in our automatic tracking algorithm, the population of fast/long directional movements is highly specific as these trajectories were not only absent from VGLUT2 expressing SVs, but also significantly reduced in mature calyceal terminals, in calyceal terminal treated with nocodazole as well as in hippocampal terminals. These long and fast trajectories were also absent from the movements of SVs newly endocytosed either spontaneously or during electrical stimulation. Thus, if the proportion of these fast/long trajectories was solely due to the erroneous detection of 2 different SVs as one, one would argue that the probability of such events would occur in all conditions and thus would fail to detect the significant differences mentioned above.</p><p>In addition we would like to mention that the tracking algorithm used in IMARIS, discriminate SV based on a quality index estimated from Gaussian fitting of the fluorescence spot. If the quality indexes of 2 neighboring spots are significantly different, these 2 spots will not be traced as one.</p><p><italic>The authors argue that the FRAP experiments are consistent, but (1) there are significant differences (in swellings: D = 0.022 µm<sup>2</sup>/s with FRAP but D = 0.041 µm<sup>2</sup>/s with vesicle tracking) and (2) a reliable dissection of diffusion speed and immobile fraction seems difficult (cf. increasing florescence at end of trace for swellings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</italic></p><p>A) We have also noticed and acknowledged this discrepancy between the diffusion coefficient of SVs in swellings estimated from MSD curves and calculated from FRAP experiments in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “Mobility of synaptic vesicles in giant calyceal terminals”. We speculate that the morphological features of the terminals used in FRAP experiments and tracking experiments might have been different. A difference in the number of interconnected fingers/swelling could potentially affect the proportion of fast/long trajectories in the ROI in FRAP or tracking experiments, and might result in the observed differences in the estimation of D. Such morphological differences could rarely be found in fingers-like areas, thus reducing the possible discrepancy between FRAP and tracking experiments. We have included this discussion in the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>B) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> was truncated to the first 30 s of the recovery experiments preventing the clear visualization of the full fluorescence recovery in the swelling areas. However, we calculated T<sub>1/2</sub> of the fluorescence recovery and estimated the mobile/immobile fractions in swelling after the fluorescence recovered to its maximum (plateau). Thus, we replaced the truncated figure with the full time-scale fluorescence profile on new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) One additional experiment would substantially enhance the output of the manuscript: an experiment in which the vesicle motion is described in relation to active zones.

We positioned putative AZs by projecting a mask corresponding to the surface area of GluR1/2-Cy3 onto the presynaptic terminal. Number and mobility of SVs within and outside of AZs were analyzed in control and during electrical stimulation. Our data showed that electrical stimulation significantly increased the number of SVs detected near AZ compared to resting condition (p = 0.018, n = 3 terminals). The mobility of SVs at AZ appeared to be reduced compared to SVs away from AZ, however this decrease was not statistically significant between control (p = 0.078, n = 6 terminals) and electrical stimulation (p = 0.179, n = 6). Similarly, SV mobility at AZ in resting condition (D = 0.027 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) or under electrical stimulation (D = 0.024 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) remained largely unchanged (p = 0.803, n = 6). These results are presented in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, in the last paragraph of the subsection “Effects of various stimulations on SV movements in giant calyceal terminals” and in the ninth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>Although we did not observe significant change in SV dynamics at AZ in our current imaging setup, we do not exclude the possibility that the mobility of SVs undergoing release at AZ may be affect by synaptic stimulation. Imaging at higher temporal and spatial resolution would likely be required to analyze SV motions at AZ more accurately.</p></body></sub-article></article>
