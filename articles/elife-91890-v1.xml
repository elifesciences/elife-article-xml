How such variations arise and the role of various neuromodulators in achieving flexible neural-to-behavioral mapping is not fully understood. In this study, we examined how serotonin modulates the neural and behavioral responses to odorants in locusts (<italic>Schistocerca americana</italic>). Our results indicated that serotonin can increase or decrease appetitive behavior in an odor-specific manner. On the other hand, in the antennal lobe, serotonergic modulation enhanced odor-evoked response strength but left the temporal features or the combinatorial response profiles unperturbed. This result suggests that serotonin allows for sensitive and robust recognition of odorants. Nevertheless, the uniform neural response amplification appeared to be at odds with the observed stimulus-specific behavioral modulation. We show that a simple linear model with neural ensembles segregated based on behavioral relevance is sufficient to explain the serotonin-mediated flexible mapping between neural and behavioral responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>serotonergic modulation</kwd><kwd>neural robustness</kwd><kwd>behavioral flexibility</kwd><kwd>computational model</kwd><kwd>appetitive behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021795</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raman</surname><given-names>Baranidharan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiological and behavioral analyses of odor-evoked responses in the locust olfactory system reveal how serotonin uniformly modifies spontaneous and odor-evoked neural activity and yet drive odor-specific changes in behavioral outcomes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Often the same sensory stimulus can trigger different behavioral responses within a single organism. For example, appetitive odorants that are attractive while hungry may not drive the same behavioral response after feeding to satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vogt et al., 2021</xref>). How neural circuits process sensory stimuli to flexibly drive varying outcomes is not fully understood. It is hypothesized that different neuromodulators should be involved in mediating state-dependent changes in neural and behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lizbinski and Dacks, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sayin et al., 2018</xref>). However, whether neuromodulation globally changes responses to sensory cues (i.e., nonspecific increases or decreases) or mediates selective alterations in sensory input-driven behavior, and how this is achieved, is not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton and Rössler, 2021</xref>).</p><p>In insects, serotonin (5HT) is a key neuromodulator that is linked with the regulation of many behaviors, including feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tierney, 2020</xref>), socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ries et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anstey et al., 2009</xref>), aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rillich and Stevenson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dierick and Greenspan, 2007</xref>), and mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pooryasin and Fiala, 2015</xref>). Food intake is known to be highly dependent on the serotonin levels in the brain of an organism. Elevated levels of serotonin have been shown to decrease the time spent feeding and the amount of consumed food in blowflies and flesh flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dacks et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Long and Murdock, 1983</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae and adults, inhibition of neural serotonin synthesis or global increase of serotonin levels increases or suppresses food intake, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Neckameyer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eriksson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Majeed et al., 2016</xref>). In locusts, serotonin is linked to triggering phenotypical plasticity. A spike in serotonin levels in the locust brain is highly correlated with the solitary stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2013</xref>), whereas high levels of serotonin in the locust thoracic ganglion are known to trigger the transformation of solitary animals into gregarious ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anstey et al., 2009</xref>). Serotonin modulation has also been linked with increased activity and aggression in crickets and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dierick and Greenspan, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Boer et al., 2016</xref>), as well as a reduction in courtship behaviors, like male wing extension toward females and mating in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pooryasin and Fiala, 2015</xref>).</p><p>How serotonin alters sensory processing to drive these behavioral changes is yet to be completely resolved. In olfaction, serotonin is known to modify the processing of odor-driven neural signals right from the periphery. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, the serotonergic release is known to reduce olfactory sensory neuron output to the following circuit through presynaptic GABAergic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaudry, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Petzold et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lv et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast, exogenous serotonin is known to increase the odor-evoked responses of second-order neurons in the insect antennal lobe and vertebrate olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaudry, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brill et al., 2016</xref>). The serotonin-mediated increase in odor-evoked responses has been reported to be odor-specific and hypothesized to enhance the sensitivity to odorants in a state-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dacks et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>How are odor-evoked neural responses modulated to produce flexible, odor-specific changes in behavioral outcomes? In this study, we examined this question in the locust olfactory system. We show that serotonin can increase or decrease innate appetitive behavioral responses in an odor-specific manner. In contrast, exogenous serotonin increased the strength of odor-evoked neural responses for all odorants without altering the temporal processing features or the ensemble response fidelity. We present a simple model to map the serotonin-mediated amplification of neural responses onto odor-specific changes in behavioral outcomes. Finally, we examine the relevance of these findings for modulating hunger-state-dependent modulation of appetitive responses in locusts. In sum, our results provide a more systems-level view of how a specific neuromodulator (serotonin) alters neural circuits to produce flexible behavioral outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Serotonin modulates appetitive behavior in an odor-specific manner</title><p>We began by examining how serotonin modulates odor-driven innate behavioral responses in locusts (<italic>Schistocerca americana</italic>). In this assay, starved locusts opened their sensory appendages close to the mouth, called maxillary palps, when encountering certain food-related odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Simões et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saha et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nizampatnam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandak and Raman, 2021</xref>). We examined the palp-opening responses (POR) for an odor panel including four odorants: hexanol (HEX), benzaldehyde (BZA), linalool (LOOL), and ammonium (AMN). Note that hexanol (green) is a green-leaf volatile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertrand et al., 2021</xref>), and benzaldehyde (blue) is a putative locust aggregation pheromone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Torto et al., 1994</xref>. Whereas linalool (red) is used in many pesticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beier et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, this panel included odorants that have diverse behavioral preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandak and Raman, 2021</xref>). Each odorant was delivered at 1% v/v concentration and presented for 10 trials or repetitions in a pseudorandomized order (see ‘Methods’).</p><p>We used a binary metric to categorize the presence or absence of PORs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The response matrix across locusts (rows) and trials (columns) is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. It is worth noting that HEX evoked supra-median (0.62) PORs, while BZA and LOOL have a response close to the median (0.4) POR level (mean POR = 0.43 across odorants and locusts). In contrast, AMN elicited sub-median (0.29) PORs across locusts. We also examined the PORs before and after serotonin (5HT) injection for each locust (see ‘Methods’). Notably, we found that the probability of PORs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) changed after 5HT injection but only for a subset of odorants (HEX and BZA). Intriguingly, the PORs to LOOL decreased after 5HT injection. Injection of saline or merely repeating the same set of odorants after a 3-hr time window (similar time frame as before and after 5HT injection) did not produce any significant change in the PORs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref> show PORs to paraffin oil before and after 5HT application). These results suggest that 5HT altered appetitive behavioral responses in an odor-specific manner.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Serotonin modulates innate appetitive behavioral responses in an odor-specific manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic of the locust palp-opening response (POR) is shown.

Each locust was presented with 10 trials of each odorant. The odor pulse duration was 4 s, and the time between two consecutive odor exposures (inter-trial interval [ITI]) was 56 s.

To examine this, we recorded PORs to the same four odorants at widely different concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; spanning four log units of concentration). First, even without serotonin application, it can be noted that PORs to the odorants tended to increase as a function of odor intensity. Further, the increase was more significant for HEX and BZA, two odorants that generally elicited more PORs. However, note that there was a detectable decrease in PORs at the highest concentration of HEX and BZA.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Serotonin alters the dose–response relationship for select odorants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>).

In contrast, changes in PORs elicited by LOOL and AMN were only modestly modified after 5HT introduction. Hence, these findings imply that serotonin enhanced appetitive behavioral responses over a wide range of concentrations but only for a subset of odorants (HEX and BZA). Furthermore, the reductions in behavioral responses at the highest intensity of HEX and BZA were no longer detectable or significant after 5HT treatment. In sum, these results indicate that the overall arousal to appetitive odorants is enhanced after serotonin application, and increases in behavioral response are maintained over a wide range of concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Serotonin alters the spontaneous activity of projection neurons in the antennal lobe</title><p>Next, we investigated the neural basis of the observed serotonergic modulation of behavioral outcomes. To assess this, we intracellularly monitored the spiking activity of projection neurons (PNs) in the antennal lobe. We first compared the spontaneous spiking activities of the same neuron before and after <italic>(</italic>5HT<italic>)</italic> serotonin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Note that the baseline spontaneous firing patterns in individual projection neurons changed after bath application of serotonin. The PNs fired spontaneous bursts of spikes after serotonin exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> [before 5HT] vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> [after 5HT]). To quantify these differences, we computed the inter-spike interval (ISI) distributions across all PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>; n = 82 PNs). The ISI distributions after 5HT application showed a left shift, indicating that pairs of consecutive spikes occurred in quick succession (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Consistent with these results, the median values for the ISI distribution reduced significantly for each PN recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Finally, we plotted the median ISI before 5HT (control; along the x-axis) against median ISI values after 5HT application (y-axis) for each PN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). As can be noted, each point represents a single PN. Clustering closer to the X-axis indicates that serotonin altered the excitability of PNs and induced bursts of spikes.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Exogenous serotonin induces bursting behavior in antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative intracellular recordings showing membrane potential fluctuations as a function of time for two separate PNs in the locust antennal lobe.

However, after serotonin injection we found that the spiking activity remained relatively stable and did not systematically vary with the magnitude of the current injection. While the changes in odor-evoked responses may incorporate both excitability changes in individual PNs and recurrent feedback inhibition through GABAergic LNs, these results from our current injection experiments unambiguously indicate that there are changes in excitability at the level of individual PNs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Serotonin modulates odor-evoked response intensity but not timing</title><p>As noted, serotonin modulated the excitability of all individual PNs we recorded.

In addition to the four odorants examined in behavioral experiments, the odor panel used included three additional odorants (4-vinyl anisole, 1-nonanol, and octanoic acid). Consistent with previous observations, PNs responded to odorants by increasing their spiking activity either during odor presentation (ON response) or after stimulus termination (OFF response) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Therefore, we wondered whether serotonin modulates the behavioral appetitive responses of locusts in a hunger-state-dependent manner. To understand this, we first examined the PORs in locusts that were fed grass blades before the experiments (satiated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) Compared to the hungry locusts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the fed locusts responded less to HEX and BZA. However, consistent with results from the hungry locusts, the introduction of serotonin increased the appetitive PORs to HEX and BZA. Intriguingly, the appetitive responses of fed locusts treated with 5HT were comparable or slightly higher than the responses of hungry locusts to the same set of odorants. It is worth noting that responses to LOOL and AMN, non-food-related odorants with weaker PORs, reduced or remained unchanged in the fed locusts treated with 5HT. Therefore, we conclude that, like in many species, serotonin influences food-driven behaviors in locusts. However, since 5HT increased behavioral responses in both fed and hungry locusts, the precise role of 5HT modulation and whether it underlies hunger-state-dependent modulation of appetitive behavior still remains to be determined.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Hunger-state-dependent serotonergic modulation of appetitive behavioral responses.</title><p>Left: a summary of trial-by-trial palp-opening responses (PORs) to the same four odorants used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

Our behavioral results revealed that serotonin increased innate appetitive responses to a subset of odorants (HEX and BZA). In contrast, responses to aversive or neutral odorants like LOOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beier et al., 2014</xref>) or AMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delventhal et al., 2017</xref>) decreased or had no significant change in their response levels. Consistent with the behavioral result, we found that the strength of the stimulus-driven responses increased in several PNs in the antennal lobe. However, the overall combination of neurons activated, and their temporal patterns of activation (ON vs. OFF responses), remained consistent. As a direct consequence, the identity of the odorant could be robustly maintained after exogenous serotonin introduction. Finally, fed locusts injected with serotonin generated similar appetitive PORs to odorants as observed in starved locusts.</p><p>Prior results from a number of invertebrate and vertebrate models have shown similar changes in odor-evoked neural responses in the antennal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaudry, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dacks et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kloppenburg and Hildebrand, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kloppenburg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dacks et al., 2008</xref>). The increase in the spiking activity of second-order neurons seems inconsistent with the serotonergic gating of sensory input through presynaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Petzold et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lv et al., 2023</xref>). Our results indicate that serotonin also modified the overall excitability of individual PNs and made them fire action potentials in bursts. Hence, it is possible that the increased neural sensitivity could compensate for the decreased input from sensory neurons. The change in input–output mapping as a result of serotonin introduction resulted in an increase in the behavioral response to different concentrations of HEX and BZA.</p><p>In contrast to the changes in the response strength, our results indicate that the timing of odor-evoked spiking activity was robustly maintained. As a result, the combination of neurons activated during and immediately after the presentation of the odorant remained similar before and after the introduction of serotonin. Hence, serotonergic modulation altered sensitivity to some odorants without altering the identity of the odorant. These results are consistent with prior imaging studies in flies that reported odor-specific changes in glomerular activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dacks et al., 2009</xref>). Further, this interpretation of our physiological results is consistent with the behavioral observation that serotonin altered response levels in an odor-specific manner.</p><p>However, behavioral responses could both increase or decrease depending on the odor identity. In contrast, our neural data indicated an enhancement for all odorants examined. This apparent mismatch between neural and behavioral responses could be resolved using a very simple linear regression model. In the model, a subset of neurons that were activated strongly by odorants with stronger PORs received positive weights. In contrast, the subset of neurons that responded to odorants that evoked fewer PORs received negative weights. Notably, the segregation of neural subsets based on the behavioral relevance and the opposing weights assigned to them was sufficient to produce odor-specific increase or decrease in behavioral PORs as observed during serotonergic modulation.</p><p>The model used for mapping neural responses onto behavior only required that odorants that evoke or suppress PORs activate distinct sets of neurons. It is worth noting that such segregation of neural responses could happen at any neural circuit along the olfactory pathway. Our extracellular recording data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) indicate that hexanol (high PORs) and linalool (low PORs) do indeed activate highly nonoverlapping sets of PNs in the antennal lobe. Hence, our results suggest that the segregation of neural activity based on behavioral relevance begins very early along the olfactory pathway.</p><p>While serotonin is implicated in a range of behaviors, the modulation of feeding behavior is widely conserved across invertebrates and vertebrates. Hence, we finally explored whether this role is conserved in locusts as well. We found that the appetitive response evoked by a food-related odorant (HEX; green-leaf volatile; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertrand et al., 2021</xref>) was reduced in animals that were fed. Notably, we found that serotonin application in locusts that were fed recovered back their appetitive response to HEX. Earlier studies have shown that serotonergic neurons could mediate a hunger-state-dependent switch in behavioral response preference (attraction vs. repulsion) to the same food-related odorant in fruit fly larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vogt et al., 2021</xref>).

Each recording was preprocessed and converted into a response matrix. MATLAB built-in function ‘findpeaks’ was used for identifying action potentials. In total, our dataset includes recordings from 19 PNs. Seven PNs were tested on a panel of seven odorants (4-vinyl anisole, 1-nonanol, octanoic acid, HEX, BZA, LOOL, and AMN) and the remaining 12 were tested with the four main odorants used in the study (HEX, BZA, LOOL, and AMN). Note that in the locust antennal lobe only PNs fire full-blown sodium spikes. GABAergic local neurons only fire calcium spikelets and can be easily distinguished from PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>PN response classification</title><p>We defined 4 s of odor presentation as an ON period, and the 4 s immediately following odor termination as an OFF period. For each PN, we used the mean baseline response during the pre-stimulus time period + 6.5 standard deviations of baseline activity as the threshold that needs to be exceeded to be classified as a response.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-4"><title>Dimensionality reduction analysis</title><p>We used PCA to visualize ensemble PN activity. The spiking activity for each PN during 4 s of odor presentation was averaged across all five trials and binned in 200 ms nonoverlapping time bins. In this manner, we obtained a 164 PN × 200 time bin matrix for all odorants. The first 82 rows included PN responses before serotonin introduction and the other 82 rows included the responses of the same set of neurons after exogenous serotonin application. The response covariance matrix was calculated, and the data was projected onto the top two eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-5"><title>Correlation analysis</title><p>Similar to the PCA, the data matrix used for this analysis was 164 PN × 200 time bins (40 s; 200 ms time bins).

The authors recapitulate a classic olfactory behavioral phenomenon where higher odor concentrations evoke weaker responses which is indicative of the odors becoming aversive. If serotonin enhanced the sensitivity to odors, then the dose-response curve should have shifted to the left, resulting in a more pronounced aversion to high odor concentrations. However, the authors show an increase in response magnitude across all odor concentrations. I don't think the authors can claim that serotonin enhances the behavioral sensitivity to odors because the locusts no longer show concentration-dependent aversion. Instead, I think the authors can claim that serotonin induces increased olfactory arousal.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes a valid point. Bath application of serotonin increased POR behavioral responses across all odor concentrations, and concentration-dependent aversion was also not observed. Furthermore, the monotonic relationship between projection neuron responses and the intensity of current injection is altered when serotonin is exogenously introduced (see Author response image 1; see below for more explanation). Hence, our data suggests that serotonin alters the dose-response relationship between neural/behavioral responses and odor intensity. As recommended, we have followed what the reviewer has suggested and revised our claim to serotonin inducing increase in olfactory arousal. The new physiology data has been added as Supplementary Figure 3 to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The authors report that 5-HT causes PNs to change from tonic to bursting and conclude that this stems from a change in excitability.

In these experiments, we monitored the spiking activities in individual PNs as we injected different levels of current injections (200 – 1000 pico Amperes). Note that locust LNs that provide recurrent inhibition arborize and integrate inputs from a large number of sensory neurons and projection neurons. Therefore, activating a single PN should not activate the local neurons and therefore the antennal lobe network.</p><p>We found that the total spiking activity monotonically increased with the magnitude of the current injection in all four PNs recorded (Author response image 1). However, after serotonin injection, we found that the spiking activity remained relatively stable and did not systematically vary with the magnitude of the current injection. While the changes in odor-evoked responses may incorporate both excitability changes in individual PNs and recurrent feedback inhibition through GABAergic LNs, these results from our current injection experiments unambiguously indicate that there are changes in excitability at the level of individual PNs.

For our model of neural mapping onto behavior to work, we only need the odorant that evokes or suppresses PORs to activate a distinct set of neurons.

This is especially important as behavioral responses to different concentrations of odors are differently modulated after serotonin injection (Figure 2: Linalool and Ammonium).</p></disp-quote><p>POR protocol: Sixth instar locusts (Schistocera americana) of either sex were starved for 24-48 hours before the experiment or taken straight from the colony and fed blades of grass for the satiated condition. Locusts were immobilized by placing them in the plastic tube and securing their body with black electric tape (see Author response image 2). Locusts were given 20 - 30 minutes to acclimatize after placement in the immobilization tube. As can be noted, the head of the locusts along with the antenna and maxillary palps protruded out of this immobilization tube so they can be freely moved by the locusts. Note that the maxillary palps are sensory organs close to the mouth parts that are used to grab food and help with the feeding process.</p><p>It is worth noting that our earlier studies had shown that the presentation of ‘appetitive odorants’ triggers the locust to open their maxillary palps even when no food is presented (Saha et al., 2017; Nizampatnam et al., 2018; Nizampatnam et al., 2022; Chandak and Raman, 2023.) Furthermore, our earlies results indicate that the probability of palp opening varies across different odorants (Chandak and Raman, 2023). We chose four odorants that had a diverse range of palp-opening: supra-median (hexanol), median (benzaldehyde), and sub-median (linaool). Therefore, each locust in our experiments was presented with one concentration of four odorants (hexanol, benzaldehyde, linalool, and ammonium) in a pseudorandomized order. The odorants were chosen based on our physiology results such that they evoked different levels of spiking activities.</p><p>The odor pulse was 4 s in duration and the inter-pulse interval was set to 60 s. The experiments were recorded using a web camera (Microsoft) placed right in front of the locusts. The camera was fully automated with the custom MATLAB script to start recording 2 seconds before the odor pulse and end recording at odor termination. An LED was used to track the stimulus onset/offset. The POR responses were manually scored offline. Responses to each odorant were scored a 0 or 1 depending on if the palps remained closed or opened. A positive POR was defined as a movement of the maxillary palps during the odor presentation time window as shown on the locust schematic (Main Paper Figure 1).</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Pictures showing the behavior experiment setup and representative palp-opening responses in a locust.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91890-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>As the reviewer inquired, we performed a new series of POR experiments, where we explored POR responses to mineral oil and hexanol, before and after serotonin injection. For this study, we used 10 locusts that were starved 24-48 hours before the experiment. Note that hexanol was diluted at 1% (v/v) concentration in mineral oil. Our results reveal that locusts PORs to hexanol (~ 50% PORs) were significantly higher than those triggered by mineral oil (~10% PORs). Injection of serotonin increased the POR response rate to hexanol but did not alter the PORs evoked by mineral oil (Author response image 3).</p><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Serotonin does not alter the palp-opening responses evoked by paraffin oil.</title><p>The PORs before and after (5HT) serotonin injection are summarized and shown as a bar plot for hexanol and paraffin oil.

The GABAergic local neurons only fire calcium ‘spikelets’ (Laurent, TINS, 1996; Stopfer et al., 2003; see Author response image 4 for an example). Hence, we are pretty confident that we are only recording from PNs. Furthermore, due to the physiological properties of the LNs, their signals being too small, they are also not detected in the extracellular recordings from the locust antennal lobe.

Could the presented model also explain a shift in behavior from aversion to attraction - such as seen in locusts when they switch from a solitarious to a gregarious state? The authors might want to discuss other possible scenarios, such as that odor evaluation and decision-making take place in higher brain regions, or that other neuromodulators might affect behavioral output. Serotonin injections could affect behavior via modulation of other cell types than antennal lobe neurons. This should also be discussed - the same is true for potential PNs - serotonin might not directly affect this cell type, but might rather shut down local inhibitory neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>There are multiple questions here. First, regarding solitary vs. gregarious states, we are currently repeating these experiments on solitary locusts. Our preliminary results (not included in the manuscript) indicate that the solitary animals have increased olfactory arousal and respond with a higher POR but are less selective and respond similarly to multiple odorants. We are examining the physiology to determine whether the model for mapping neural responses onto behavior could also explain observations in solitary animals.</p><p>Second, this reviewer makes the point raised by Reviewer 1. We agree that odor evaluation and decisionmaking might take place in higher brain regions. All we could conclude based on our data is that a segregation of neural activity based on behavioral relevance might provide the simplest approach to map non-specific increase in stimulus-evoked neural responses onto odor-specific changes in behavioral outcome. Furthermore, our results indicate that hexanol and linalool, two odorants that had an increase and decrease in PORs after serotonin injection, had only minimal neural response overlap in the antennal lobe. These results suggest that the formatting of neural activity to support varying behavioral outcomes might already begin in the antennal lobe. We have added this to our discussion.</p><p>Third, regarding serotonin impacting PNs, we performed a new set of current-clamp experiments to examine this issue (Author response image 1). Our results clearly show that projection neuron activity in response to current injections (that should not incorporate feedback inhibition through local neurons) was altered after serotonin injection. Therefore, the observed changes in the odor-evoked neural ensemble activity should incorporate modulation at both individual PN level and at the network level. We have added this to our discussion as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors claim that serotonin injection can mimic the starved state behavioral response. However, this is only shown for one of the four odors that are tested for behavior (HEX), thus the data does not support this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that Hex is the only appetitive odorant in the panel. But, as reviewer 1 has also brought up a similar point, we have toned down our claims and will investigate this carefully in a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Was the POR of the locusts towards linalool and ammonium higher than towards a blank odor cartridge? I ask because the locusts appear to be less likely to respond to these odors and so I am concerned that this assay is not relevant to the ecological context of these odors. In other words, perhaps serotonin did not enhance the responses to these odors in this assay, because this is not a context in which locusts would normally respond to these odors.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>The POR response to linalool and ammonium is lower and comparable to that of paraffin oil.

The authors make claims about this figure that require the reader to guess as to the aspect of the figure to which they are referring.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes an astute observation. Yes, the spontaneous activity in the antennal lobe network before serotonin introduction is not correlated with the ensemble spontaneous activity after serotonin bath application. Remarkably, the odor-evoked responses were highly similar, both in the reduced PCA space and when assayed using high-dimensional ensemble neural activity vectors. Whether the changes in network spontaneous activity have a function in odor detection and recognition is not fully understood and cannot be convincingly answered using our data.

The logic behind this was to have a very diverse odor panel that consisted of food odorant – Hexanol, aggregation pheromone – 4-vinyl anisole, sex pheromone – benzaldehyde, acid – octanoic acid, base – ammonium, and alcohol – 1-nonanol. Additionally, we selected these odors based on previous neural and behavioral data on these odorants (Chandak and Raman, 2023, Traner and Raman, 2023, Nizampatnam et al, 2022 &amp; 2018; Saha et al., 2017 &amp; 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The electrophysiology dataset combines all performed experiments across all tested different PN-odor pairs.

Seven PNs were tested on a panel of seven odorants (4-vinyl anisole, 1-nonanol, octanoic acid, Hex, Bza, Lool, and Amn), and the remaining twelve were tested with the four main odorants used in the study (Hex, Bza, Lool, and Amn).

For the behavioral experiments, we increased the concentration (0.1 M) due to the presence of anatomical structures in the locust's head such as air sacks, sheath as well as hemolymph which causes some degree of dilution that we cannot control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Behavior experiments were performed 3 hours after injection - ephys experiments 5-10 minutes following bath application.
