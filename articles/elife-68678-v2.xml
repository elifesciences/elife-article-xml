How Src induces this trafficking event is unknown. Golgi to ER transport depends on the GTP exchange factor (GEF) GBF1 and small GTPase Arf1. Here, we show that Src induces the formation of tubular transport carriers containing GALNTs. The kinase phosphorylates GBF1 on 10 tyrosine residues; two of them, Y876 and Y898, are located near the C-terminus of the Sec7 GEF domain. Their phosphorylation promotes GBF1 binding to the GTPase; molecular modeling suggests partial melting of the Sec7 domain and intramolecular rearrangement. GBF1 mutants defective for these rearrangements prevent binding, carrier formation, and GALNTs relocation, while phosphomimetic GBF1 mutants induce tubules. In sum, Src promotes GALNTs relocation by promoting GBF1 binding to Arf1. Based on residue conservation, similar regulation of GEF-Arf complexes by tyrosine phosphorylation could be a conserved and widespread mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>membrane traffic</kwd><kwd>signalling</kwd><kwd>golgi</kwd><kwd>GBF1</kwd><kwd>Src</kwd><kwd>Arf1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Astar</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Core fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bard</surname><given-names>Frederic A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Src phosphorylates GBF1, promoting binding of the Sec7 domain to Arf1 and the formation of GALNTs containing tubules emanating from the Golgi.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic cells constantly regulate membrane trafficking between compartments to adjust their physiology. Thus, signaling pathways impinge on trafficking pathways at many different levels. For instance, the Src tyrosine kinase has been shown to regulate Golgi membranes, in part to adjust trafficking rates in response to change in cargo load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pulvirenti et al., 2008</xref>). Changes in Src activity have major effects on the morphology of the Golgi apparatus, with compaction after Src depletion or fragmentation upon Src hyper-activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weller et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>A specific role of the Src kinase at the Golgi is to regulate protein O-glycosylation. Src activation induces the relocation of polypeptide GalNAc transferases (GALNTs) from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard and Chia, 2016</xref>). GALNTs initiate GalNAc type O-glycosylation and their relocation leads to a marked increase in glycosylation, which can be measured with the levels of the Tn glycan (a single GalNac residue). Increase in Tn can be detected by lectins such as HPL and <italic>Vicia villosa</italic> lectin (VVL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gill et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gill et al., 2010</xref>). The Tn levels’ increase corresponds to multiple cell surface and ER resident proteins becoming hyper-O-glycosylated; such as MMP14, PDIA4, and Calnexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ros et al., 2020</xref>). In short, GALNTs relocation upregulates GalNac type O-glycosylation of many proteins.</p><p>This <italic>GAL</italic>NTs <italic>A</italic>ctivation (GALA) pathway is strongly activated in breast, lung, and liver cancers and presumably in most high Tn-expressing tumors. GALA markedly promotes tumor growth and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ros et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to Src, the pathway can be stimulated by the cell surface receptors EGFR or PDGFR and is controlled by a complex signaling network, including a constitutive negative regulation by the kinase ERK8 in some cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chia et al., 2014</xref>). Src has long been implicated in tumorigenesis and tumor invasiveness, and GALA is likely an important mediator of Src oncogenic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chia et al., 2019</xref>). It is unclear how Src stimulates the transport of GALNTs from the Golgi to the ER apart from the fact that the process involves the Arf1 small GTPase and can be blocked by a dominant negative form of Arf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gill et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Arf1 is part of a family of small GTPases involved in many aspects of intracellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D’Souza-Schorey and Chavrier, 2006</xref>). Arfs function in conjunction with larger proteins called GTP exchange factors (GEFs) that mediate the transfer from GDP to GTP-bound form of the small GTPase. GEFs bind to the GDP-bound form of Arfs and not the GTP-bound form. All GEFs have in common a Sec7 domain (Sec7d) that specifically mediates displacement of GDP from Arf-GDP and loading with GTP. Thus, Arfs function like molecular timers, oscillating between GDP- and GTP-bound forms and binding different partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cherfils, 2014</xref>).</p><p>There are seven subfamilies of Arf GEFs in eukaryotes, with two subfamilies operating at the Golgi: BIG1/2 and GBF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox et al., 2004</xref>). While the BIGs primarily function at the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network and endosomal compartments, GBF1 functions at the early <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and regulates Golgi to ER retrograde traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kawamoto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhao et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>GBF1 functions mostly with Arf1. GBF1 contains five other conserved domains, two in N-terminal of the Sec7d (DCB and HUS) and three in C-terminal (HDS1 to 3). These domains are thought to mediate GBF1 recruitment to membranes and/or regulate membrane transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>). Work by Melançon’s group has identified membrane-bound Arf-GDP as a factor regulating GBF1 recruitment to <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Quilty et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quilty et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, they propose that the C-terminal domains HDS1 and 2 are required to bind to an unidentified Golgi receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Quilty et al., 2018</xref>). More recently, HDS1 has been shown to bind to phosphoinositides such as PIP3, PI4P, and PI(4,5)P2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meissner et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the setup of an inducible Src activation system to rapidly and reliably activate the relocation of GALNTs to the ER. Acute activation of Src stimulates the formation of tubular-shaped, GALNTs-containing transport carriers and results in increased O-glycosylation levels. Src activation induces the recruitment of GBF1 at the Golgi, increased binding of GBF1 to Arf1, and a transient upregulation of Arf1-GTP levels. By mass spectrometry, we found that Src directly phosphorylates GBF1 on 10 residues, including residues Y876 and Y898, located within and close to the C-terminus of the Sec7d, respectively. In silico modeling and directed mutagenesis suggest important conformational changes that promote binding to Arf1. As supported by additional mutants, Y876 phosphorylation induces partial melting of an alpha-helix in Sec7d, increasing binding affinity to Arf1. Y898 phosphorylation appears to release an interaction between Sec7d and the linker domain in C-terminal. We propose that tyrosine phosphorylation increases GBF1 affinity for Arf-GDP on Golgi membranes and promotes the relocation of GALNTs through tubular transport intermediates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Src8A7F chemical activation induces rapid GALNTs relocation to the ER</title><p>ER relocation of GALNTs correlates well in solid tumors with total Tn levels, measured using staining with <italic>Helix pomatia</italic> lectin (HPL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gill et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hammarström et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

A more marked relocation can be induced in cell lines by transfecting a plasmid expressing an active form of Src. However, this approach implies an uncontrolled increase of Src activity over several hours and tends to result in fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bard et al., 2003</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Src8A7F chemical activation induces GALNTs relocation to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in tubular carriers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the GALA pathway, the red coloring represents the anti-Tn lectin staining.

The Cole group has demonstrated that a mutant form of Src, Src(R388A,Y527F) or Src8A7F for short, is a mostly inactive kinase that can be chemically rescued and activated by imidazole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qiao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). After generating a stable HeLa cell line expressing this <italic>I</italic>nducible <italic>S</italic>rc, HeLa-IS, we verified that imidazole treatment induces an increase in total tyrosine phosphorylation. By comparison with the overexpression of constitutively active point mutant SrcE378G (SrcEG), the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation remained moderate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>In terms of GALA, imidazole treatment induced a twofold increase in total Tn levels after 2 hr with a pattern of Tn staining a mix of Golgi and ER, suggesting a measured GALNT relocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Staining pattern of the Golgi marker Giantin was not affected, indicating that the Golgi organization was not overly perturbed. Tn increase was relatively modest compared to the expression of SrcEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) or ERK8 depletion in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chia et al., 2014</xref>). Imidazole treatment in wild-type HeLa cells had no effect on Tn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We also observed that the effects of Src8A7F activation were reversible: imidazole washout after 24 hr of treatment resulted in a significant reduction of Tn levels within 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the physiological relevance of the inducible Src activation system, we compared it to a stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). PDGF binding to the PDGF receptor usually results in Src activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thomas and Brugge, 1997</xref>). Stimulation with 50 ng/ml PDGF yielded around a twofold increase in total Tn levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H and I</xref>), similar to that observed with imidazole treatment. Hence, Src8A7F rescue recapitulates the levels of response to growth factor stimulation. The advantage of imidazole rescue is a reliable Src activation, whereas the effect of PDGF stimulation tends to be influenced by cell culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chia et al., 2019</xref>). Similar data were obtained in another cell line HEK293 that stably expresses Src8A7F (HEK-IS). HEK-IS recapitulated the results obtained with HeLa-IS, providing an alternative model for biochemical experiments.</p><p>We further verified whether increased Tn levels were due to relocation of GALNTs to the ER. Direct observation of GALNTs in the ER is technically challenging because of the dilution and dispersion factor involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chia et al., 2019</xref>). However, GALNTs presence in the ER results in O-glycosylation of ER resident proteins such as PDIA4, which is more readily quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>). We measured the effects of Src8A7F imidazole rescue on the glycosylation of PDIA4 using VVL immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by PDIA4 blotting and quantified a fivefold increase of PDIA4 glycosylation after 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Overall, the Src8A7F system provides a measured activation of the GALA pathway, without breakdown of the Golgi structure and with tight kinetic control.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Acute activation of Src induces GALNTs-containing tubules at the Golgi</title><p>To visualize GALNTs relocation, HeLa-IS cells stably expressing GALNT2-GFP were imaged by time-lapse microscopy after imidazole stimulation. In unstimulated conditions, GALNT2 was mostly confined at the Golgi. Upon imidazole addition, GFP-positive tubules started to emanate from the Golgi as soon as 10 min after stimulation, their numbers reaching peak around 20–30 min, then decreasing to slightly above unstimulated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). The tubules often detached and moved away from the Golgi, suggesting effective transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>This phenomenon was also observed after PDGF stimulation where GALNT2 tubules emerged from the Golgi after ~15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). In some particularly responsive cells, the tubules were forming at a high rate and eventually led to a marked reduction of GALNT2 levels in the Golgi.

We wondered if Arf1 was present on GALNT2 tubules; however, antibody staining was too faint to be conclusive. We thus generated HeLa-IS stably coexpressing GALNT2-GFP and C-terminal V5-tagged Arf1 (Arf1-V5). The small V5 tag was selected to minimize functional interference, and we picked a clone that expresses moderate levels of Arf1-V5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jian et al., 2010</xref>). We found that in unstimulated cells Arf1-V5 localizes both at the Golgi and in peripheral cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Upon Src8A7F activation, Arf1-V5 appeared to be recruited at the Golgi and localized on the GALNT2 tubules, almost throughout the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To confirm the membrane recruitment of Arf1, we isolated cytosolic and membrane proteins to measure the levels of membrane-bound Arf1 and found Arf1 membrane-association increased within 5 min, peaked at 10 min, and began to fall after 20 min while the cytosolic pool remained relatively constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>The results so far suggested that Arf1 is activated by Src, suggesting an effect on Arf1-GTP levels.

GBF1 knockdown affects cell adhesion and Golgi morphology, but these effects occur progressively after siRNA transfection. To capture recently GBF1-depleted cells, we harvested them at 48 hr instead of 72 hr. In these conditions, GBF1 levels were already significantly lowered; imidazole stimulation did not result in significant Arf-GTP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Averaging three independent experiments resulted in over 90% reduction of Arf activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>Since GBF1 is involved in Arf-GTP production after Src activation, we reasoned it might be recruited to Golgi membranes. Strikingly, the GBF1 membrane pool in HEK-IS increased by roughly threefold within 5–10 min, while total GBF1 remained constant. This increase was partially transient, peaking at 10 min of imidazole treatment, but remained elevated for up to 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). Using time-lapse microscopy of GFP-GBF1 in HeLa-IS, we observed GBF1 recruitment at the Golgi complex. In sync with the biochemical experiment, GBF1 Golgi levels increased rapidly, peaking at ~10 min, decreasing after ~20 min but not to baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>).</p><p>GBF1 recruitment at the Golgi depends on binding to membrane-bound Arf-GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quilty et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we wondered whether phosphorylation by Src might increase GBF1 affinity for Arf1. To test this idea, we isolated Arf1-V5 from a cell lysate and added, in the presence of GDP, GFP-GBF1 immunoprecipitated on beads from cells expressing also active or inactive Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). After 1 hr incubation, beads were washed and the amount of Arf1 bound to beads quantified by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). By comparison with inactive SrcKM, SrcEG induced a twofold increase in binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Given this net increase, we next tested binding of immunoprecipitated GFP-GBF1 with bacterially produced and purified Arf1-del17-His in the presence of GDP. Arf1-del17-His, a recombinant protein deleted of the first 17 amino acids, is able to bind GDP in the absence of phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kahn et al., 1992</xref>).

As the signals both for GBF1 and its phosphorylation were not very marked, we also tested GFP-GBF1-expressing HEK-IS cells, obtaining similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Y898 is located in the linker region between the Sec7d and HDS1 domains of GBF1. While the Sec7d structure of GBF1 has not been resolved, GBF1 Sec7d shares at least 65% homology with several other GEFs, so it can be modeled relatively accurately. Unfortunately, this is not the case for HDS1 for which there is no structural information. We could model the Sec7d and the linker domain using the GBF1 sequence and the resolved structures of the GEFs ARNO, Cytohesin-1, and Grp1. In this model, the linker is located close to a pocket of negatively charged residues in the Sec7d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Molecular dynamics (MD) revealed a repulsion of the linker away from Sec7d after phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>). This suggests that phosphorylation could relieve an intramolecular interaction between the Sec7 domain and the HDS1 domain. ARNO/Grp1/Cytohesin and BIG family contain Pleckstrin Homology (PH) and HDS domains, respectively, in C-term of Sec7d that interacts and inhibits the GEF activity for ARNO by about 14-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stalder et al., 2011</xref>) and about 7-fold for BIG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that the HDS1 of GBF1 could similarly inhibit the Sec7d and phosphorylation at Y898 would alleviate this Sec7d-HDS1 inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Phosphorylation of Y876 partially unfolds GBF1 Sec7d domain, increasing affinity for Arf1</title><p>By contrast with Y898, Y876 is located within the Sec7d. There are 10 alpha helices in Sec7d, and Y876 is present on helix J (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cherfils et al., 1998</xref>). We modeled the interaction of GBF1 with Arf1 based on available structures and observed that helix J is protruding in the interface between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6—video 2</xref>). When we simulated Y876 phosphorylation, the negative charge was attracted by the positively charged residues arginine 843 (R843) and lysine 844 (K844) at the end of helix H. This, in turn, led to a partial unwinding of helix H, leading to an extension of the loop between helices H and I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This partial unfolding and loop extension would result in better bond formation between Sec7d and Arf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This translates into a reduced free binding energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and an increased probability of buried surface area (BSA) between the Sec7d and Arf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) in the phosphorylated state. Higher BSA indicates tighter packing interactions, and thus, higher affinity between the molecules. Thus, the loop extension induced by phosphorylation is predicted to favor the interaction with Arf1, a result consistent with our in vitro binding assay results with phospho-GBF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation on Y876 increases GBF1 Sec7d affinity for Arf1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structural basis for the binding of unphosphorylated GBF1 Sec7d and Y876-phosphorylated GBF1 Sec7d with Arf1.

This is partly because GBF1 protein levels are relatively low, almost 50 times less abundant than Arf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Itzhak et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, others have reported that GBF1 is an unstable protein, which we have also observed with recombinant GBF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhatt et al., 2016</xref>). These characteristics might be evolutionary linked to the ‘toxicity’ of GBF1, whose overexpression affects Golgi organization and cell adhesion. While being a quantitatively minor Src substrate, GBF1 might be a critical substrate for the oncogenic activity of the kinase, transducing Src activation into changes in cell surface protein glycosylation. Specific inhibitors of Src/GBF1 interaction might thus have a therapeutic interest.</p><p>While phospho-GBF1 is not very abundant, Src can phosphorylate multiple sites on the GEF. GBF1 is a large protein with multiple domains, which can interact with one another. For instance, the N-terminal Dimerization and Cyclophilin Domain (DBS) interacts with the Homology Upstream of Sec7 domain (HUS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ramaen et al., 2007</xref>). The phosphorylation of the tyrosines in positions 317, 377, and 515 could alter this intramolecular interaction; while the five tyrosines in the Homology Downstream of Sec 7 domain 2 and 3 (HDS2/3) could affect other intra- or intermolecular interactions.</p><p>Mass spectrometry data and residue conservation analysis suggest that Y876 and Y898, located at and near the C-terminus of Sec7 domain, are particularly important. Based on the modeling efforts, Y876 phosphorylation induces the partial melting of an alpha-helix within the Sec7d, allowing for better binding to Arf. Partial melting is dependent on the phospho group interacting with either residues R843 or K844. Consistently, an R843A.K844A double mutant does not increase binding to Arf1 nor Arf1-GTP levels following Src activation. The R843E.K844E mutant is also unable to respond to Src, and in addition, it induces a reduced basal Arf-GTP level. This is consistent with the Sec7d of this mutant being locked into a low Arf-binding conformation. Y876 is conserved in all the Sec7d proteins we looked at. For several other GEFs, phosphorylation of the corresponding residue has been reported in various high-throughput databases. These findings suggest that the helix melting regulation is shared by other GEF proteins and could be a widespread mechanism for tyrosine kinases to regulate the GEF family of proteins.</p><p>The effect of Y898 phosphorylation is more hypothetical; it might release an inhibitory interaction between the Sec7d and the HDS1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). However, to our knowledge, such interaction has not been reported. Notwithstanding, the data suggest that phosphorylation on both residues synergize to stimulate binding of GBF1 to Arf1-GDP. Y898 residue is highly conserved among vertebrates and invertebrates homologues of GBF1, suggesting that its phosphorylation is an ancient, conserved mechanism of regulation.</p><p>The importance of Y876 and Y898 phosphorylation is confirmed by the induction of tubules by the double phosphomimetic mutant. The tubules could only be observed at early time points after transfection of the mutant expression. At later time points, we observed a fragmentation of the Golgi and reduction of COPI staining. Similarly, we observed a peak of tubules formation shortly after Src activation (20–30 min). This kinetic control of Src allows distinguishing its short- to long-term effects on the Golgi. Like the phosphomimetic GBF1, Src activation tends to fragment the Golgi and reduce COPI staining.</p><p>The tubules are individually transient but extended, often measuring several micrometers long. Tubules are enriched in GALNT but depleted in the Golgi enzyme B4GAL-T1 and Giantin. By contrast, we did not observe an increase in COPI-enriched structures or vesicles in the Golgi vicinity after Src activation. The data thus suggest that GALNTs relocation is mediated by tubular transport carriers. Several groups have reported tubules-derived transport carriers emanating from the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bottanelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sengupta et al., 2015</xref>). In a recent study, live super-resolution microscopy revealed COPI cups on Golgi membranes with surprisingly no evidence of COPI vesicles detaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bottanelli et al., 2017</xref>). Perhaps these results are to be compared with the proposal that ER to Golgi traffic is mediated by tubular transport carriers rather than COPII-coated vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raote and Malhotra, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shomron et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weigel et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>How GBF1 phosphorylation might induce these tubules remains to be established. Our results indicate an increase in GBF1 affinity for Arf1-GDP, and mutagenesis of GBF1 suggests that this affinity increase is critical for the relocation (e.g., mutant R843A,K844A effect on Tn increase). GBF1 is recruited to Golgi membranes at the time of tubule formation. As shown previously, GBF1 Golgi membrane binding recruitment is dependent on Arf-GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Quilty et al., 2018</xref>). So, a possible model is that a membrane-tethered GBF1-Arf-GDP complex could recruit motors to pull on the membrane. Interestingly, the GBF1/Arf1 complex has been shown to interact with the microtubule motor Miro at mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Walch et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>GBF1 is involved in different physiological situations in addition to the regulation of GALNTs activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaczmarek et al., 2017</xref>). The axis Src-GBF1-Arf might also be involved in the regulation of Golgi organization based on the work by Luini’s group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Consoli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luini and Parashuraman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pulvirenti et al., 2008</xref>). GBF1-Arf are also involved in the positioning of mitochondria, a locale where Src kinase has also been detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackema et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hebert-Chatelain, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Walch et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We observed a wave of Arf-GTP production after Src activation. This burst of Arf-GTP could, alternatively, drive GALNT-containing tubule formation as it was previously shown that Arf-GTP can deform membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krauss et al., 2008</xref>). We interpret the increase in Arf-GTP as phosphorylation facilitating the formation of a GBF1-Arf-GDP complex, while, based on the simulation, phosphorylation may not affect the GTP exchange catalytic reaction. The nucleotide exchange reaction can indeed be described with a K<sub>D</sub> for the binding of both proteins and a k<sub>cat</sub> for the conversion. Phosphorylation might regulate the K<sub>D</sub> without affecting the k<sub>cat.</sub> To note, overexpression of GBF1 alone increases Arf-GTP levels, indicating that GBF1 is a limiting factor and supporting the idea that an increase in affinity would result in higher Arf-GTP level.</p><p>Similarly to tubule formation, Arf1 and GBF1 recruitment on membranes and Arf1-GTP levels peak within 10–30 min after Src activation, suggesting a self-limiting mechanism. GBF1 phosphorylation itself is sustained over hours. Membrane-bound Arf-GDP, which is important for GBF1 recruitment, is probably also not the limiting factor because total membrane-bound Arf increases significantly after Src activation. The limiting factor may arise from the export of GALNTs-containing carriers, resulting in the depletion of an unidentified receptor on Golgi membranes. Indeed, Arf-GDP requires a protein receptor to bind to Golgi membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donaldson and Jackson, 2011</xref>). Two candidates have even been proposed, the p23 protein and the SNARE membrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gommel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Honda et al., 2005</xref>). GBF1 also appears to require an additional receptor to bind efficiently to Golgi membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Quilty et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that after Src activation either of these receptors (or both) are transported from Golgi membranes by the tubules-derived carriers. This could explain the peak in Arf-GTP levels and why overnight Src expression, while inducing a marked GALNT relocation, also results in a reduction of Arf-GTP levels: the Arf receptor may have been markedly depleted at the Golgi. By contrast, wild-type GBF1 overexpression, not promoting GALNTs relocation, would not induce this depletion and can thus stably increase Arf-GTP levels.</p><p>To sum up, our study reveals a key mechanistic insight into how Src regulates Golgi to ER retrograde traffic. It suggests that GBF1 binding to Arf-GDP plays a driving role in the formation of transport carriers. The understanding of this complex transport mechanism might help interfere therapeutically with a process driving the invasiveness of solid tumor cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning and cell culture</title><p>Wild-type HeLa cells were from V.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Src activates retrograde membrane traffic through phosphorylation of GBF1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor (Suzanne Pfeffer). The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at this stage.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers were excited by the hypothesis that Src activation and phosphorylation of GBF1 control specialized retrograde Golgi-ER trafficking. That being said, they raised a number of issues that would take some time to address, to support fully the conclusions of the present study. One of the reviewers provided the following comments that would be important to consider in regard to your model.</p><p>&quot;It seems that the authors are claiming that the phospho-GBF1-Arf1-GDP complex is more stable (which their data do suggest). But their data do not clearly discriminate between positive or negative regulation…. If Src is a positive regulator of GBF1, then why does phospho-GBF1 form stable complexes with Arf1-GDP? A GEF that binds *more* stably to Arf1-GDP is actually *less* active. This may be counterintuitive, but this is how GEFs work: the action of BFA and the catalytic E-&gt;K mutations in Sec7 domains are both good examples of how when the GEF domain binds more strongly to Arf1-GDP, they become worse GEFs…If they were trying to demonstrate that Src is a positive regulator of GBF1, the data are not convincing. They have shown that *cellular* levels of Arf1-GTP transiently increase, but they have not shown that Golgi-localized Arf1-GTP increases, and there are other ArfGEFs in cells. The reduction of COPI localization provides further evidence that Arf1-GTP is not increasing at the Golgi.</p><p>The key concept is that if a GEF bound strongly to GTPase-GDP, it would actually inhibit activation by GTP binding. Here is a reference from Antonny and Cherfils (and Chabre) for the specific example of a Sec7 domain mutant that binds to Arf-GDP better and therefore is a worse GEF: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9649435/</p><p>Here is a review from Wittenhofer: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17540168/</p><p>in which he key part about affinities is: &quot;the affinities of the binary complexes between the G protein and either the nucleotide or its GEF are very high. In contrast, the affinities of the exchange factor for the nucleotide-bound G protein and of the nucleotide for the exchange-factor-bound G protein (the ternary complexes) are much lower.</p><p>This is consistent with the energetics of how all enzymes work – enzymes bind best not to their substrates or products, but to their transition states (otherwise enzymes would simply stabilize their substrates rather than performing catalysis). The nucleotide-free state of GTPases is the intermediate that is closest to the transition state of the exchange reaction. There is a general misconception that GEFs bind best to GDP-bound GTPases, but this is not true and has arisen because the so-called &quot;GDP-locked&quot; mutants that people have used actually have a reduced affinity for nucleotides (both GDP and GTP) and therefore tend towards being nucleotide free. Anyway, it's a common misconception and usually one that is not too important but in this case it matters for their mechanism.&quot;</p><p>Another reviewer wrote, &quot;Since simply seeing more Arf1 at the Golgi does not necessarily mean that it is active, perhaps they could perform a FRAP experiment? Given that the Golgi is a large organelle, the kinetics of recovery would reflect association of ARF1 to the Golgi. If Src really increases the levels of active Arf1 at the Golgi, then it should affect the on/off-kinetics in a FRAP experiment. Or they could do Trp-fluorescence assays with recombinant Arf1 and GBF1.&quot;<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study from the Bard lab, the authors explore the mechanism behind Src activation induced relocalization of GALNTs enzymes from Golgi to ER. They use an imidazole-inducible Src model, which generates increased O-GALNacylation. In response to Src activation, they observe GFP-GALNTs in tubules emanating from the Golgi. They also observe more Arf1-GTP in Src-activated cells. They Identify Y-phosphorylation sites in GBF1 induced by Src phosphorylation. They can confirm Src-induced phosphorylation at one of these sites (Y876) by phospho-specific antibody. They find that expression of the Y876F GBF1 mutant blocked the Src-activation induced increase in cellular Arf1-GTP levels. Expression of the Y876E/Y898E mutant dramatically reduced the amount of basal Arf1-GTP. They perform modeling studies suggesting that phosphorylation of Y876 should increase the affinity of the GBF1 Sec7d for Arf1.</p><p>Their observations of Src activation are similar to the acute effects of BFA. BFA triggers formation of stable, complexes between GBF1 and Arf1-GDP. These complexes bind stably to the Golgi, but are inactive and effectively poison the GEF, reducing the amount of Arf1-GTP generated at that site. Indeed, Src activation results in slight depletion of COPI at the Golgi, and increase in GBF1 at the Golgi, similar to effects of BFA.

Either of these situations could cause the observed response to Src activation assuming the GALNTs normally cycle between the Golgi and ER.<italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Chia et al. tried to provide a first glimpse of the molecular machinery driving the GALNTs Activation (GALA) pathway, which was proposed by the Bard group ten years ago. The major claim of the paper is that the regulated Src-dependent phosphorylation of GBF1 (specifically on Y876 and Y898) is the primary molecular switch that drives formation Golgi-originated membrane tubules that serve to deliver GALNT enzymes to ER. The experiments performed in the manuscript are appreciable and abundant. However, the presentation and writing are sloppy, which has made comprehension tiresome and also tricky. The discussions are shallow, and the authors have conveniently avoided rationalizing interesting/surprising findings. Overall, the hypothesis that Src activation and phosphorylation of GBF1 control specialized retrograde Golgi-ER trafficking looks exciting and valid, but this needs to be supported by more robust data, which is unfortunately not presented in this manuscript. A substantial revision would be required for this manuscript to be published.</p><p>1. A major assertion throughout this manuscript is the regulated relocalization of the enzymes GALNTs from Golgi to ER, and corresponding HPL staining has been used as a readout of GANLT activity. Unfortunately, all the images of HPL staining throughout the paper are of low quality and have inconsistencies in the staining pattern and intensity. It is essential to provide high-resolution images and quantify colocalization of HPL signal with ER and Golgi markers. Colocalization of the endogenous GALNT1 with these markers will be a more accurate measure of the relocalization of the enzyme to the ER. PDI IP with VVL was a smart approach and indeed suggest GALNT activity in the ER but could also indicate minor relocalization of PDI4A to the Golgi compartment. The effect of the imidazole treatment on intracellular localization of PDI should be tested.</p><p>In F1b, colocalization of GALNT with an ER marker will substantiate this finding. This figure also shows a noticeable increase in the perinuclear (Golgi?) staining intensity of HPL, which seems to have been ignored. Does the relocalization of the enzyme to the ER have anything to do with its increased activity in the Golgi?</p><p>2. Another major inconsistency in the manuscript is related to the imidazole-inducible activity of Src8A7F. This activity is depicted as pY 4G10 blots, but these blots (Figures2E, 3A, 4A, S1B) are all different and inconclusive. Random blot parts ( 40-180 kDa, 70-180 kDa, 60-120 kDa) are shown. It is imperative to quantify Src activity. Hopefully, careful Src quantification will shed some light on the unexplainable temporal activation of Arf1 protein.</p><p>3. The third major problem is related to the use of overexpressed tagged proteins utilized thought the study. This approach was more or less valid ten years ago, but now with advances of CRISPR and other gene-editing tools, it is possible to avoid (or at least control for) artifacts connected with protein overexpression and tagging. Authors show that overexpressed GALNT2-GFP and Arf1-V5 entering into the tubular compartment emerging from the Golgi (F2C), but they failed to show a similar pattern for the endogenous GALNT1 (S1L). Moreover, the activation pattern of the endogenous Arf1 (F2E) is very different from the activation dynamic of Arf1-V5 (F3A). All these inconsistencies should be adequately addressed in the text.</p><p>4. In S1F, how was the experiment performed? What is &quot;control 0h&quot; and what are the other time points grouped as &quot;24h Imdz wash&quot;? This figure needs to be properly labeled.</p><p>5. The localization of Src in S1D is different than that of Src8A7F. Does this mutation affect its localization?</p><p>6. S1H has cells missing ManII. Is there any effect of Src activation on ManII?</p><p>7. In F1D is a smart approach to measure GALNT activity in the ER. An increase in glycosylation of PDI with time upon Src activation, but in later, it is shown that Aft-GTP bursts occur within 5-10mins after Src activation and in SrcEG mutant, Arf is depleted. This data is at odds with the prolonged effect of Src activation on the HPL staining intensity and GALNT relocalization. Moreover, the burst of GBF1 phosphorylation is seen at 120 mins in F4AandB. How do all this fit in into the prolonged effect on GALNT activity and increased HPL staining?</p><p>8. Overexpressed GALNT2 indeed shows tubules, but the endogenous GALNT1 tubules are absent in S1L. In this figure, βCOP staining is also very odd. The localization of βCOP to the Golgi is well established, and there are quite a few suitable antibodies that work well (https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00724.x). Such poorly quality staining cannot be used to rule out the involvement of COPI in GALNT relocalization.</p><p>9. For F2, which shows GALNT1+2, Arf1 and Afr3 KDs provide data on the efficiency of the KD. Also, look at the effect of Afr1 KD on the localization of active GBF1. Is Arf1-GDP required for the membrane recruitment of GBF1?</p><p>10. Arf-V5 and endogenous Afr do not follow the same trend. Please repeat GGA IP in F3A and probe for endogenous Arf.</p><p>11. Is GBF1 the only Arf GEF that is phosphorylated upon Src activation? Is it not likely that BIGI, ARNO and BRAG2's conserved tyrosine residues would be phosphorylated too once Src is activated and these activated GEFs would have some contribution to Golgi trafficking?</p><p>12. In F4E, Src has been claimed to directly phosphorylate GBF1. However, during the purification of GFP-GBF1 there could be other associated proteins that may be effectors of activated Src. This needs to be acknowledged and before claiming that Src kinase directly phosphorylated GBF1.</p><p>13. Another significant discrepancy in this study is the effect of the different Src mutants on the HPL staining and Src localization/profile itself. The model in figure 7 fails to explain how the short burst of pGBF1 and AFR1-GTP triggers prolonged relocalization of GALNT. The final model is unclear and somewhat misleading. It seems to indicate that tubule formation is caused by the tight Arf1-GBF1 complex, but the data show a transient burst of Arf1-GTP (not bound to GBF1) as a major cause of tubule formation. What selects GALNTs into these tubules<italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Chia et al. is one of a series of elegant manuscripts by the Bard lab on the GALA pathway. The topic is very interesting and I think it fits to the scope of the journal. The data are mostly of very high quality and the finding is novel, as it explains the role of Src in retrograde transport.</p><p>Apart from some technical and minor comments that I mention below, I am mainly concerned with one point: the authors claim that Src induces retrograde transport that is dependent on Arf1 and GBF1. However, the claim that it is COPI-independent. The evidence for this is relatively weak. Regardless of this, there is no evidence that the tubules that the tubules observed in response to Src activation are directed towards the ER. I did not see evidence that these tubules move towards the ER, or whether they passage through the ERGIC. Maybe these tubules detach from the Golgi to form a carrier that moves to the ER.</p><p>I am happy to drop this point, if the editor and/or the other reviewers think that this is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>1. The images in Figures 1B and S1C are identical. This should be clearly indicated. The authors should state that S1C shows the very same cells as 1B, only with a co-staining for Giantin.</p><p>2. I noticed that the size of the Golgi (and the cell) is bigger in imidazole-treated cells (with Src activation). Since the increase of fluorescence is mostly apparent in the Golgi region, I think that the HPL intensity should be normalized by the size of the cell.</p><p>3. Figure 1G: I think that the authors should image more than just 4 cells. It is also not indicated how many experiments were performed.</p><p>4. Figure 2C: this result requires some form of quantification. How many tubules were observed and in how many cells? How many of the tubules were Arf1-positive?</p><p>5. The conservation of tyrosines (in GBF1) from yeast to mammals is meaningless. Yeast (and fungi in general) have no tyrosine kinases (there are very few exotic exceptions, but <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is definitively negative). The fact that yeast has no tyrosine kinases actually should prompt to investigate the tyrosine residues that are not conserved. I think this passage should be re-written. As it is scientifically not accurate and misleading.</p><p>6. Figure 5: the authors state that the stimulus was &quot;nearly abolished&quot;. This is not correct. Looking at the blot, I would. Re-word this and rather use &quot;reduced&quot;. The double mutant is also still phosphorylated</p><p>7. Figure 5F is missing.

They also suggest that you should consider alternative explanations for the data.

The main changes in the text are within the discussion and the authors are mainly to argue against the criticism raised by the reviewers.</p><p>I find the following points confusing:</p><p>1. The authors state that they don't think that it is a key point that Arf1-GTP is at the Golgi. They propose that it is the complex between GBF1 and Arf1-GDP that is relevant for tubule formation. I am not sure that the experimental evidence that is provided is convincingly showing this.</p><p>2. The authors argue that it is irrelevant to talk about COPI, because Arf1 could generate tubule itself. They cite a paper by Francesca Bottanelli. I would like to stress that the Botallei paper showed Arf1 tubules that are directed to the cell periphery and NOT retrograde transport to the ER. In addition, the Botanelli paper did not suggest that these are tubules generated with Arf1-GDP. Therefore, I find the argumentation used in the rebuttal a bit confusing.</p><p>3. I think that the point that the complex of Arf1-GDP and GBF1 generates tubules should be demonstrated experimentally.</p><p>4. The argument about the conservation of the tyrosine residue in yeast is confusing. Firstly, there is very little tyrosine phosphorylation in yeast. There are dual-specificity kinases in yeast that can perform tyrosine phosphorylation. However, there kinases are conserved in humans. So why do mammalian cells then use Src, and not the ancestral dual-specificity kinase. I find it confusing why the authors are insisting on keeping a piece of text that is so speculative and most likely wrong. Anyhow, this is just a minor point.</p><p>I think that the point that the complex of Arf1-GDP and GBF1 generates tubules should be demonstrated experimentally. Based on the new discussion and the rebuttal letter, I see that the authors themself consider this very important. I think this point deserves to be tested experimentally.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Signaling pathways modify intracellular membrane trafficking and protein modifications on different levels. In this study, the authors investigate the mechanism behind Src activation-induced relocalization of a subset of Golgi enzymes, GALNTs, from Golgi to ER. In response to Src activation, authors observe GALNT2-GFP in Golgi-derived tubular structures. They also observed temporal activation of small GTPase Arf1 and phosphorylation of Arf1 GTP exchange factor, GBF1. The authors propose the model in which phosphorylation of GBF1 by Src results in GBF1-Arf1 complexes that generate membrane tubules for traffic GALNTs from Golgi to ER.</p><p>In the revised submission, Chia et al. have fixed the many errors in the manuscript, which has indeed improved its presentation. They also provided two new experiments and significantly updated the Discussion section. At the same time, authors mostly responded to our and other critiques not by performing requested experiments/controls but by referencing their own previously published work and by modifying the text. We believe that this kind of response is not adequate.</p><p>My main concerns are as follows:</p><p>1. As I have stated in the first round of review, to quantify Src-dependent Golgi-ER relocalization of Golgi enzymes, it is essential to provide reproducible, high-quality images quantify colocalization of HPL signal with ER and Golgi markers. The ratio of ER to Golgi signal is the most important parameter here. The work should be reproducible, and therefore mere references to previously published work are not sufficient. The model system (HeLa cells with inducible Src) is not adequately characterized in terms of relocalization of GALNTs from Golgi to ER. Specifically, images presented in Figure 1B and, even more strikingly, in Supplementary Figure 1C, H are not supporting the notion that ER/Golgi ratio of HPL signal (i.e. relocalization of GALNTs) has been changed significantly. Without proper verification that retrograde trafficking of Golgi enzymes is increased in a Src/GBF1-dependent manner, the title of the manuscript is not supported by the data since the direction of movement of GALNT-GFP-positive tubular structures is unknown.</p><p>2. Endogenous Golgi cargo has not been detected in Golgi-derived tubules, suggesting that tubule formation could be an artifact of protein overexpression. Authors' arguments that &quot;tubules are transient in nature… it makes it harder to observe…chemical fixation significantly disrupts tubule integrity&quot; are valid in general, but not at the level of <italic>eLife</italic> quality paper. Moreover, for the majority of tubule imaging in the manuscript (Figures 1G, 2C, S1K, S2A), the authors successfully used chemical fixation to demonstrate the association of overexpressed proteins with tubular structures. If necessary, consider live cell microscopy.</p><p>3. Authors clearly shown that Src phosphorylates GBF1, and they identified target phosphorylation sites on GBF1. Authors are suggesting that upon Src activation, GBF1 binds to Arf1-GDP, and this complex stimulates the formation of GALNT carrying tubules. However, I still have a hard time aligning this hypothesis with the data presented in the manuscript. During the burst of Arf-GTP, one would assume that k-on exceeds k-off resulting in Arf-GTP levels peaking and Afr-GTP exceeding GBF1-Arf-GDP. However, starting from 10 min following Src activation, the GALNT tubules emanating from the Golgi are significantly increased. This would indicate that tubule formation is not really driven by GBF1-Arf-GDP because it peaks at 20-30 min, when GBF1-Afr-GDP would be at its lowest. In S2B they show that Arf-GTP levels are lower than the controls. In S5AandB, Afr-GTP level as low as the control condition. Authors conclude that constitutively active SrcEG has the same effect on Arf-GTP levels as phosphor-mimetic GBF1 resulting in low levels of Afr-GTP. One can imagine a hypothetical scenario where the entire pool of GBF1 is engaged with Arf-GDP. But, SrcEG cells do have increased HPL staining in the ER and Golgi which, as the authors claim, is due to GALNTs transported to the ER in GBF1-Arf dependent tubules. This would indicate that the transport of GALNTs to the Golgi is independent of Arf-GTP, which is at odds with the kinetics of tubule formation and Arf-GTP levels in Figure 2.</p><p>4. As suggested by other reviewers, to validate the model that Src-dependent phosphorylation of GBF1 is causing relocalization of Golgi enzymes, it will be essential to show that inducible expression of GBF1 phospho-mimetic mutants Y876E and Y898E would drive Golgi to ER localization of GALNTs in the absence of Src activation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors model is now more clear, but still not convincing. They are proposing that GBF1-Arf1-GDP complexes are tubulating membranes. There is no precedent for such an activity and other plausible explanations have not been ruled out. As stated in the previous review, an alternative explanation is that their observations are similar to those observed under BFA treatment. The Hsu and Luini groups explored one possibility for why BFA induces Golgi tubulation: (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21725317)</p><p>The authors model and cartoon for the GEF reaction in Figure 7A is too simplistic, as the step they label with &quot;kcat&quot; actually represents more than one step: first GDP must dissociate before GTP can dissociate. This is absolutely essential as GDP and GTP occupy the same binding site. Also, the use of &quot;kcat&quot; generally refers to the rate-limiting step, and this is exactly the point I am making – an increase in k<sub>on</sub> (which appears to be the consequence of phosphorylation) is irrelevant to the overall reaction rate constant if k<sub>on</sub> is not the rate-limiting step. The step labeled &quot;kcat&quot; could very well be rate-limiting (and at the very least there is no reason to conclude that it is not rate-limiting, which is what the authors appear to be claiming). Therefore, my original concern still stands: their data are most consistent with phospho-GBF1 forming a stable complex with Arf1-GDP, which will reduce, rather than enhance the kinetics of exchange.</p><p>I also note that in Figure 7, the authors have incorrectly used upper case 'K's, which are used for equilibrium constants, rather than lower case 'k's, which should be used for the rate constants that they are referring to. Furthermore, by convention kcat is used to refer to the overall rate constant of the reaction.</p><p>The authors claim in the rebuttal letter that the &quot;kcat&quot; step is unlikely to be rate-limiting because this is the case for &quot;most enzymes in metabolic pathways acting on small molecules&quot; is both unfounded and probably irrelevant to an exchange factor.</p><p>The authors claim that the Antonny, Chabre, and Cherfils paper supports their model but I strongly disagree. Yes, the mutant they used blocks exchange, and also stabilizes binding to Arf-GDP. The authors appear to be ignoring the fact that GDP must dissociate before GTP can bind. Strong binding to Arf-GDP will slow GDP dissociation, and therefore also slow the rate of exchange. The authors' strong language on these points does not make their logic any more correct.</p><p>The authors are twisting themselves in knots by explaining that their in vitro binding assay does not include GTP, rather than performing an actual exchange assay in which GTP is included. Rather than trying to argue with reviewers, they could simply perform an actual nucleotide exchange experiment to see whether phosphorylated GBF1 is a better GEF or not. Based on their proposed model for how tyrosine-phosphorylation within the Sec7-domain enhances GEF activity, this should be straightforward to perform using the Sec7-domain of GBF1, rather than the full-length protein which the authors note is difficult to purify.</p><p>Finally, from my perspective, I still don't understand why on the one hand, the authors are arguing that phosphorylation makes GBF1 a better GEF, yet on the other hand, the authors' model invokes a functional role for a stable GBF1-Arf1-GDP complex. Neither of these two possibilities is fully supported by the data.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Src activates retrograde membrane traffic through phosphorylation of GBF1&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

A GEF that binds *more* stably to Arf1-GDP is actually *less* active. This may be counterintuitive, but this is how GEFs work: the action of BFA and the catalytic E-&gt;K mutations in Sec7 domains are both good examples of how when the GEF domain binds more strongly to Arf1-GDP, they become worse GEFs…If they were trying to demonstrate that Src is a positive regulator of GBF1, the data are not convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the confusion and acknowledge that perhaps the use of the word “stable” was not appropriate. We meant more “stable” in the sense of phospho-GBF1 having a higher affinity for Arf1-GDP than non-modified GBF1. This fact is supported by data from the binding assays as noted by the reviewer. One has to note that the binding assay is done in the presence of Arf-GDP, but there is no GTP so no opportunity for GEF catalysis to occur. Thus, we are only looking at the Kd (k<sub>off</sub> /k<sub>on</sub>) of the complex.</p><p>For an enzyme, a binding affinity to the substrate is required to engage the right substrate and an increase in binding affinity does not mechanically imply a loss of catalytic activity.

If k<sub>on</sub> is larger than k<sub>cat</sub>, complexes can last for some time on average before the complex is being dissociated after nucleotide exchange.</p><p>If k<sub>cat</sub> is larger than k<sub>on</sub> (as for most enzymes in metabolic pathways acting on small molecules), the complex enzyme-substrate is very transient and barely detectable, which we believe might be what the reviewers were referring to.</p><p>The fact that GBF1 appears to form complexes with Arf-GDP, which may drive its recruitment to Golgi membranes has been proposed and documented (Quilty et al., 2014, 2018). This suggests that in the case of GBF1/Arf-GDP complex, k<sub>on</sub> is larger than k<sub>cat</sub> and the complex has a non-negligible half-life. But of course, this remains to be fully established.</p><p>As mentioned above, in the in vitro assay we used, the conversion to Arf-GTP is not possible, so it is mostly an increase in k<sub>on</sub> / k<sub>off</sub> that is measured. in vivo, we observed an increase in GBF1 recruitment at the Golgi, which is consistent with an increase in binding affinity. The decrease in Kd results in more complexes being formed and, assuming the k<sub>cat</sub> is unaffected, it will also result in more Arf-GTP produced.</p><p>It is true that a loss of catalytic activity can result in an increase in binding. The difference is that in the examples cited by the reviewer, E-&gt;K mutation or BFA engagement, increased binding is not due to an increase in binding affinity but a decrease or block of catalytic activity. In other words, k<sub>cat</sub> is strongly impaired or null while k<sub>on</sub> is not affected.</p><p>In the modeling that was done for our study, we did not see a clear indication of stimulated catalytic activity, but rather an increase in binding affinity. Thus, our interpretation is that GBF1 phosphorylation increases the k<sub>on</sub> without affecting k<sub>cat.</sub> Of course, it is hard to be affirmative about this without a full biochemical characterisation.</p><p>Testing this hypothesis biochemically is beyond the scope of this study. While we have attempted it, GBF1 protein is difficult to purify in significant amounts and it has not been possible to measure its GEF activity in vitro. GBF1 is a large protein prone to proteolytic degradation. It would also require various biochemical techniques for which we are not really equipped nor experts. Furthermore, and very importantly, it is likely that another protein (and maybe more) is involved in the GBF1-Arf-GDP complex formation. That protein is the receptor for Arf-GDP at the Golgi. There are also reports in the literature that other domains of GBF1 and other receptors are involved in GBF1 recruitment at the Golgi. Without identifying these additional players, the biochemical characterisation in vitro might be impossible or at least not representative.</p><p>In sum, the key message is that the scenario we propose is consistent with our data so far and there is no fundamental or conceptual incoherence in our model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They have shown that *cellular* levels of Arf1-GTP transiently increase, but they have not shown that Golgi-localized Arf1-GTP increases, and there are other ArfGEFs in cells. The reduction of COPI localization provides further evidence that Arf1-GTP is not increasing at the Golgi.</p></disp-quote><p>As you may note, the presence of Arf1-GTP at the Golgi is actually not a central point of our proposal: we focus on GBF1, its phosphorylation and its role in GALNTs relocation. Nonetheless, the hypothesis that Arf-GTP is formed somewhere other than the Golgi disregards a lot of evidence and existing literature. It has been abundantly shown that Arf and GBF1 are involved in retrograde Golgi to ER traffic and that GBF1 induces the formation of Arf-GTP. Here, we show that GBF1 is recruited at the Golgi after Src activation.</p><p>We have also shown previously that Src is present at the Golgi, that its activation induces an increase of phospho-Y at the Golgi, that it induces the relocation of Golgi enzymes, the GALNTs, from the Golgi and that Arf1 is involved in the process (Bard et al., 2003; Chia et al., 2014, 2019; Gill et al., 2010). So, the data would overwhelmingly indicate that Arf1-GTP increases at the Golgi.</p><p>There are other GEF in the cell, but we show that phospho-deficient mutant forms of GBF1 are not able to induce an increase in Arf-GTP (Figure 5A). If other GEFs were involved, mutant GBF1 should not affect Arf1-GTP levels.</p><p>The fact that COPI at the Golgi is not increasing is not at all a proof that Arf-GTP is not increasing at the Golgi. While there is ample evidence that Arf-GTP can recruit COPI subunits to membranes in vitro, there is to our knowledge no proof that Arf1-GTP is sufficient to induce COPI vesicle formation in vivo. In addition, Arf-GTP has been proposed to be involved in reactions independent of COPI, see for instance (Bottanelli et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The key concept is that if a GEF bound strongly to GTPase-GDP, it would actually inhibit activation by GTP binding. Here is a reference from Antonny and Cherfils (and Chabre) for the specific example of a Sec7 domain mutant that binds to Arf-GDP better and therefore is a worse GEF: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9649435/</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is similar to the objection raised above. This “key concept” is a misinterpretation of the solid and beautiful data presented in this paper. The ARNO mutant presented is unable to convert Arf-GDP in Arf-GTP (k<sub>cat</sub> is virtually null), which means it remains bound to Arf-GDP and can dissociate with a certain k<sub>off</sub>, presumably quite low. This is why it is more strongly bound to Arf-GDP, as already mentioned above. There is no experiment in the paper in conditions where the conversion is blocked for both wild-type and mutant, so there is no way to say whether the affinity, the Kd for Arf-GDP has been affected.</p><p>Admittedly, in this paper, the k<sub>cat</sub> is estimated at &gt;10/sec, which is not consistent with the formation of a GEF/Arf-GDP complex lasting for several seconds. But the study is done with ARNO and the value is derived from experiments done in vitro, so the situation could be quite different for GBF1 in an in vivo context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Here is a review from Wittenhofer: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17540168/</p><p>in which he key part about affinities is: &quot;the affinities of the binary complexes between the G protein and either the nucleotide or its GEF are very high. In contrast, the affinities of the exchange factor for the nucleotide-bound G protein and of the nucleotide for the exchange-factor-bound G protein (the ternary complexes) are much lower.</p></disp-quote><p>This citation has limited to no bearing on our model: we are simply stating that the affinity of the phosphorylated GEF for Arf-GDP is higher than the non-phosphorylated one; we are not making a comparison between various forms of Arf.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is consistent with the energetics of how all enzymes work – enzymes bind best not to their substrates or products, but to their transition states (otherwise enzymes would simply stabilize their substrates rather than performing catalysis). The nucleotide-free state of GTPases is the intermediate that is closest to the transition state of the exchange reaction. There is a general misconception that GEFs bind best to GDP-bound GTPases, but this is not true and has arisen because the so-called &quot;GDP-locked&quot; mutants that people have used actually have a reduced affinity for nucleotides (both GDP and GTP) and therefore tend towards being nucleotide free. Anyway, it's a common misconception and usually one that is not too important but in this case it matters for their mechanism.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we are not disputing the fact that GBF1 needs to bind more efficiently to the transition state, nucleotide free form in order to function as a GEF. We are, however, strongly disputing the notion that an increased affinity for the GDP-bound form will necessarily result in a less efficient GEF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another reviewer wrote, &quot;Since simply seeing more Arf1 at the Golgi does not necessarily mean that it is active, perhaps they could perform a FRAP experiment? Given that the Golgi is a large organelle, the kinetics of recovery would reflect association of ARF1 to the Golgi. If Src really increases the levels of active Arf1 at the Golgi, then it should affect the on/off-kinetics in a FRAP experiment. Or they could do Trp-fluorescence assays with recombinant Arf1 and GBF1.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>The fraction of Arf-GTP and Arf amount at the Golgi increase and decrease in sync, which strongly suggest that the two processes are linked. The FRAP experiment or related ones are challenging for us at this time in part due to the public health situation, because access to the right microscope and required training is not possible.</p><p>Also, please see above the comments made above and in the Discussion about Arf-GTP. The question of whether Arf-GTP is present at the Golgi is not a key point of our model at this stage. We are not proposing that Arf-GTP specifically plays an active role in the relocation of GALNTs. In the presence of increased GBF1 expression (not phosphorylated), we observe an increase in Arf-GTP but little or no effect on GALNT relocation.</p><p>This observation led us to propose instead that GBF1 plays a key role and more specifically that the complex GBF1/Arf-GDP is critical in the formation of tubules and transport carriers. This is why the increase in affinity without an increase in catalytic activity would be important: it would allow the formation of more GBF1/Arf-GDP complexes on Golgi membranes.</p><p>We hypothesise that the catalytic exchange to GTP is a mechanism to deactivate the GBF1/Arf-GDP complex. Please note that this last part is an hypothesis at this stage. We are fully aware that we do not have sufficient data to fully support it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this study from the Bard lab, the authors explore the mechanism behind Src activation induced relocalization of GALNTs enzymes from Golgi to ER. They use an imidazole-inducible Src model, which generates increased O-GALNacylation. In response to Src activation, they observe GFP-GALNTs in tubules emanating from the Golgi. They also observe more Arf1-GTP in Src-activated cells. They Identify Y-phosphorylation sites in GBF1 induced by Src phosphorylation. They can confirm Src-induced phosphorylation at one of these sites (Y876) by phospho-specific antibody. They find that expression of the Y876F GBF1 mutant blocked the Src-activation induced increase in cellular Arf1-GTP levels. Expression of the Y876E/Y898E mutant dramatically reduced the amount of basal Arf1-GTP. They perform modeling studies suggesting that phosphorylation of Y876 should increase the affinity of the GBF1 Sec7d for Arf1.</p><p>Their observations of Src activation are similar to the acute effects of BFA. BFA triggers formation of stable, complexes between GBF1 and Arf1-GDP. These complexes bind stably to the Golgi, but are inactive and effectively poison the GEF, reducing the amount of Arf1-GTP generated at that site. Indeed, Src activation results in slight depletion of COPI at the Golgi, and increase in GBF1 at the Golgi, similar to effects of BFA. BFA also triggers tubules emanating from the Golgi.</p><p>The authors conclude with a model in which Src phosphorylation of GBF1 results in stable GBF1-Arf1 complexes that somehow generate tubules from the Golgi that traffic GALNTs enzymes back to the ER.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the summary and the parallel made with the effects of BFA treatment. We agree with the similarities pointed out, however the analogy has its limits. We do not claim that phosphorylation induces a complex as stable as in the case of BFA treatment, but rather increases the affinity of GBF1 for Arf-GDP. The complex still dissociates after some time after conversion of Arf to GTP binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I do not find the overall mechanistic explanation of the observations to be convincing, and in my mind the authors have not ruled out alternative explanations.

Please find the data in Figure 3C-D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim that Src activation increases the amount of Arf1 at the Golgi but the fluorescence images do not appear to support this claim. Although Arf1 is observed on the resulting tubules, this could represent its presence in non-productive membrane-bound complexes with GBF1.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is unclear to us. Maybe the reviewer assumes that Arf-GTP is the key driver in tubules formation? What are “non-productive membrane-bound complexes with GBF1”?

Similarly, it would be even more convincing if they could also determine whether GBF1 is required for BFA-induced tubules (if this has not already been demonstrated in the literature).</p></disp-quote><p>First, we would like to point out that the sentence presented in brackets was not present in our text. We did not present this idea as a conclusion but as a working hypothesis in the Discussion section. The sentence read instead: “Instead, the BFA experiments and our results suggest that the GBF1-Arf1 complex induces the formation of tubules, albeit it is not clear how”.</p><p>Nonetheless, this was an interesting suggestion and we have now performed the imaging of GBF1-depleted cells and indeed we observe a much reduced formation of tubules (Figure S3G-H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the authors need to test the effects of GBF1 Y/F and Y/E mutants on Src-induced tubule formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have documented the effect of the GBF1 Y/F mutants on the relocation of GALNTs.

We think our model is much simpler and explain the data satisfactorily.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors make the claim &quot;Altogether, these results indicate that phosphorylation on Tyrosines Y876 and Y898 drives an increase of affinity of GBF1 for Arf1-GDP, in turn increasing Arf1-GTP levels and promoting GALNTs relocation.&quot; Yet the phosphomimetic mutants have reduced Arf1-GTP levels! It appears more likely that phosphorylation is inducing a BFA-like effect, and not actually increasing GBF1 activation of Arf1.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the lowered levels of Arf-GTP are initially a surprising result. However, active Src expression results after 12-18h in exactly the same effect: a reduction of Arf-GTP levels. Src activation results in a transient burst of Arf-GTP, followed by a slow decrease to levels below that of the control cells. It is not clear at present what is the mechanism at play, but we have proposed the following explanation:</p><p>“Perhaps after Src activation, either the Arf-GDP or GBF1 receptors (or both) are removed from Golgi membranes by tubules-derived carriers. This would explain why overnight Src expression, while inducing a marked GALNT relocation, also results in a reduction of Arf-GTP levels.”</p><p>As for the phosphomimetic mutants, we cannot observe the effect of their expression at short time points; but we expect they would behave similarly to a Src activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors results, both experimental and modeling, strongly suggest that phosphorylation results in stable, non-productive GBF1-Arf1 complexes that would not lead to an increase in Arf1 activation.

Either of these situations could cause the observed response to Src activation assuming the GALNTs normally cycle between the Golgi and ER.</p></disp-quote><p>This is not correct. At steady state and at t=0 in the Src induction experiment, the amount of GALNTs in the ER is negligible, so blocking ER export could not have a major effect on their intracellular localisation unless there is a very rapid cycling from the Golgi to the ER. Our imaging experiment does not reveal any such transport at steady state. Finally, in addition to GBF1, all the regulators of the pathway we have identified, such as Src and ERK8, are clearly located at the Golgi (Chia et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript, Chia et al. tried to provide a first glimpse of the molecular machinery driving the GALNTs Activation (GALA) pathway, which was proposed by the Bard group ten years ago. The major claim of the paper is that the regulated Src-dependent phosphorylation of GBF1 (specifically on Y876 and Y898) is the primary molecular switch that drives formation Golgi-originated membrane tubules that serve to deliver GALNT enzymes to ER. The experiments performed in the manuscript are appreciable and abundant. However, the presentation and writing are sloppy, which has made comprehension tiresome and also tricky. The discussions are shallow, and the authors have conveniently avoided rationalizing interesting/surprising findings. Overall, the hypothesis that Src activation and phosphorylation of GBF1 control specialized retrograde Golgi-ER trafficking looks exciting and valid, but this needs to be supported by more robust data, which is unfortunately not presented in this manuscript. A substantial revision would be required for this manuscript to be published.</p><p>1. A major assertion throughout this manuscript is the regulated relocalization of the enzymes GALNTs from Golgi to ER, and corresponding HPL staining has been used as a readout of GANLT activity. Unfortunately, all the images of HPL staining throughout the paper are of low quality and have inconsistencies in the staining pattern and intensity. It is essential to provide high-resolution images and quantify colocalization of HPL signal with ER and Golgi markers. Colocalization of the endogenous GALNT1 with these markers will be a more accurate measure of the relocalization of the enzyme to the ER. PDI IP with VVL was a smart approach and indeed suggest GALNT activity in the ER but could also indicate minor relocalization of PDI4A to the Golgi compartment. The effect of the imidazole treatment on intracellular localization of PDI should be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer has noted, we have characterised the pathway for the last 10 years and published several studies about it. The facts that GALNTs are relocated to the ER or that the increased HPL staining is at the ER have been established before several times (Chia et al., 2014, 2019; Gill et al., 2010, 2013). They are not the focus of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In F1b, colocalization of GALNT with an ER marker will substantiate this finding. This figure also shows a noticeable increase in the perinuclear (Golgi?) staining intensity of HPL, which seems to have been ignored. Does the relocalization of the enzyme to the ER have anything to do with its increased activity in the Golgi?</p></disp-quote><p>We have indeed observed that HPL staining also increases in the Golgi area. One likely explanation is that substrates that are O-glycosylated in the ER are trafficked to and concentrated at the cis-Golgi, leading to this staining increase. Consistent with this interpretation the HPL pattern around at the Golgi is reminiscent of ERGIC markers, that is partially ER and partially Golgi.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Another major inconsistency in the manuscript is related to the imidazole-inducible activity of Src8A7F. This activity is depicted as pY 4G10 blots, but these blots (Figures2E, 3A, 4A, S1B) are all different and inconclusive. Random blot parts ( 40-180 kDa, 70-180 kDa, 60-120 kDa) are shown. It is imperative to quantify Src activity. Hopefully, careful Src quantification will shed some light on the unexplainable temporal activation of Arf1 protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We mostly present pY 4G10 blots &gt;40kDa to reduce the size of the blots so as to save space in the figure. We have presented the whole blots in the source data images. The increase in Src activity is reflected by the general increase in pY staining levels and is apparent in the blots presented.</p><p>The temporal activity of Arf1-GTP has nothing to do as far as we can see with Src activity.</p><p>Indeed, general phosphotyrosine levels and GBF1 phosphorylation are pretty stable over time. We have provided an alternative explanation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The third major problem is related to the use of overexpressed tagged proteins utilized thought the study. This approach was more or less valid ten years ago, but now with advances of CRISPR and other gene-editing tools, it is possible to avoid (or at least control for) artifacts connected with protein overexpression and tagging. Authors show that overexpressed GALNT2-GFP and Arf1-V5 entering into the tubular compartment emerging from the Golgi (F2C), but they failed to show a similar pattern for the endogenous GALNT1 (S1L). Moreover, the activation pattern of the endogenous Arf1 (F2E) is very different from the activation dynamic of Arf1-V5 (F3A). All these inconsistencies should be adequately addressed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>While we appreciate the importance of CRISPR based genome editing, this study was indeed started 10 years ago, so some approaches are indeed not absolutely ideal. But we have confirmed all the main points with endogenous proteins: the phosphorylation of GBF1 by Src for instance is exhaustively confirmed. We have also shown extensively that endogenous GALNT1 is relocated out of the Golgi to the ER upon growth factor stimulation in our previous publications (Chia et al., 2019; Gill et al., 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In S1F, how was the experiment performed? What is &quot;control 0h&quot; and what are the other time points grouped as &quot;24h Imdz wash&quot;?

In S1F, Hela-IS cells were treated with 5mM imidazole (imdz) for 24 hours; See “24 hour imdz treatment” for the corresponding HPL staining. The imdz was subsequently washed out for various durations from 0.5hours to 8hours; See “imdz washout'' for the corresponding HPL staining after washout for 2hours and 8hours. The HPL staining intensities was quantified in Figure S1G where the green bars represent the HPL intensity levels of cells at various durations of washout after 24 hours of imdz treatment. The blue bars represent imdz treatment over various time points. The legend was re-written to improve on the clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The localization of Src in S1D is different than that of Src8A7F. Does this mutation affect its localization?</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown previously that a fraction of Src is present at the Golgi (Bard et al., 2003). The localisation of Src and Src8A7F are cytoplasmic with some Golgi fraction. If you compare the images in S1D and S 1F, they look similar.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. S1H has cells missing ManII. Is there any effect of Src activation on ManII?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the observations from our paper in 2010 (Gill et al., 2010), we did not observe relocation of Mann II in presence of active Src. These cells are stable cell lines derived from antibiotic selection for more than 2 weeks against cells that do not express MannII-GFP. It is possible that some wildtype cells that did not express MannII-GFP managed to escape antibiotic selection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In F1D is a smart approach to measure GALNT activity in the ER. An increase in glycosylation of PDI with time upon Src activation, but in later, it is shown that Aft-GTP bursts occur within 5-10mins after Src activation and in SrcEG mutant, Arf is depleted. This data is at odds with the prolonged effect of Src activation on the HPL staining intensity and GALNT relocalization. Moreover, the burst of GBF1 phosphorylation is seen at 120 mins in F4AandB. How do all this fit in into the prolonged effect on GALNT activity and increased HPL staining?</p></disp-quote><p>There is indeed a complex kinetic effect, we first observe a burst of GALNTs relocalisation and Arf-GTP levels. While the numbers of tubules then decrease, they do not return to normal, indicating that relocalisation continues but at a slower pace. Indeed, as we have described, the amount of GALNTs being relocated is not equivalent to the whole pool in the Golgi, but only a fraction of it. As GALNTs are enzymes, they continuously catalyse the addition of GalNAc sugar on substrates in the ER. This results in the increased HPL (staining O-GalNAc glycan) over time after GALNTs have started relocating. Regarding Arf-GTP, as we have mentioned, the levels of Arf-GTP may not be essential for relocation. We found GBF1 phosphorylation dependent on the Src activity and phosphorylation levels remain high with Src activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Overexpressed GALNT2 indeed shows tubules, but the endogenous GALNT1 tubules are absent in S1L. In this figure, βCOP staining is also very odd. The localization of βCOP to the Golgi is well established, and there are quite a few suitable antibodies that work well (https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2008.00724.x). Such poorly quality staining cannot be used to rule out the involvement of COPI in GALNT relocalization.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiment requires fixed cells and co-staining βCOP and GALNT2. However, due to a number of technical difficulties, it is difficult to observe endogenous GALNT tubules on fixed cells:</p><p>1. Tubules are transient in nature, as one can observe from the live imaging. This makes it harder to observe with endogenous levels of proteins.</p><p>2. The GALNT antibody that we have has weak immunofluorescence staining and is not as robust as with overexpressed GALNT2-GFP.</p><p>3. Chemical fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) significantly disrupts tubule integrity and this was also reported in (Bottanelli et al., 2017).</p><p>The lack of involvement of COPI is not the main point of our study and we are not “ruling out” COPI. We show that we are just not observing any Golgi recruitment. We are not the first ones to make this disturbing observation: a carefully crafted study does not report any COPI coated vesicles involved in retrograde transport (Bottanelli et al., 2017). We have added some representative BCOP images from the automated high throughput microscopy that was used for quantification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. For F2, which shows GALNT1+2, Arf1 and Afr3 KDs provide data on the efficiency of the KD. Also, look at the effect of Afr1 KD on the localization of active GBF1. Is Arf1-GDP required for the membrane recruitment of GBF1?</p></disp-quote><p>It has been proposed and documented that it is Arf-GDP and a Golgi receptor that drives GBF1 recruitment to Golgi membranes by forming a complex at the Golgi (Quilty et al., 2014, 2018). With increased affinity of phosphorylated GBF1 for Arf1-GDP, it results in the increased recruitment of GBF1 to the Golgi. This is the likely explanation for what we observed upon Src induction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Arf-V5 and endogenous Afr do not follow the same trend.

Is GBF1 the only Arf GEF that is phosphorylated upon Src activation? Is it not likely that BIGI, ARNO and BRAG2's conserved tyrosine residues would be phosphorylated too once Src is activated and these activated GEFs would have some contribution to Golgi trafficking?</p></disp-quote><p>It is possible that Src could phosphorylate other ARFGEFs as it is a promiscuous kinase and there are pY sites on BIGs curated on the phosphosite database. Testing if Src phosphorylates other ARFGEFs is beyond the scope of the paper. We focused on GBF1 as the primary GEF regulating ER-Golgi traffic. Depletion of GBF1 blocks GALNTs relocation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. In F4E, Src has been claimed to directly phosphorylate GBF1. However, during the purification of GFP-GBF1 there could be other associated proteins that may be effectors of activated Src. This needs to be acknowledged and before claiming that Src kinase directly phosphorylated GBF1.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree as we have several lines of evidence to show the directness of the phosphorylation. In Figure 4E, we have performed an in vitro kinase assay where recombinant Src was added to immunoprecipitated GBF1. The coomassie gel (Figure S4C) and pY antibody staining (Figure 4K) clearly reflects the immunoprecipitated GFP-GBF1 band on western blot and no other band. We have also verified by mass spectrometry that GBF1 is phosphorylated by active Src (Figure 4F). In cells, Src co-immunoprecipitated with GBF1 (Figure S4A), indicating direct binding between Src and GBF1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Another significant discrepancy in this study is the effect of the different Src mutants on the HPL staining and Src localization/profile itself. The model in figure 7 fails to explain how the short burst of pGBF1 and AFR1-GTP triggers prolonged relocalization of GALNT. The final model is unclear and somewhat misleading. It seems to indicate that tubule formation is caused by the tight Arf1-GBF1 complex, but the data show a transient burst of Arf1-GTP (not bound to GBF1) as a major cause of tubule formation. What selects GALNTs into these tubules.</p></disp-quote><p>The data does not show that ARF-GTP is a major cause of tubule formation.

However, the claim that it is COPI-independent. The evidence for this is relatively weak. Regardless of this, there is no evidence that the tubules that the tubules observed in response to Src activation are directed towards the ER. I did not see evidence that these tubules move towards the ER, or whether they passage through the ERGIC. Maybe these tubules detach from the Golgi to form a carrier that moves to the ER.</p><p>I am happy to drop this point, if the editor and/or the other reviewers think that this is beyond the scope of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that COPI independence is not formally established in our manuscript.

We show that the enzymes relocate from the Golgi to the ER, that they exit the Golgi in tubules and that we cannot detect any vesicles at the time of relocation. The tubules are specific for GALNTs and do not contain another Golgi enzyme, so they are fitting the bill of transport carrier precursors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

They also suggest that you should consider alternative explanations for the data. Specifically, they suggest you load Arf1 with GDP-betaS and add phosphorylated GBF1, then test if the complex drives formation of tubules or carriers out of Golgi membranes.; they note that others have purified GBF1 and it may be possible to immunopurify a FLAG-tagged version of the protein expressed in 293T cells.</p><p>Alternatively, if you can show that inducible expression of GBF1 phospho-mimetic mutants Y876E and Y898E can drive Golgi to ER localization of GALNTs in the absence of Src activation and show the cargo selectivity of such tubules, that would be sufficient to justify presentation in eLife.

The authors state that they don't think that it is a key point that Arf1-GTP is at the Golgi. They propose that it is the complex between GBF1 and Arf1-GDP that is relevant for tubule formation.

The authors argue that it is irrelevant to talk about COPI, because Arf1 could generate tubule itself. They cite a paper by Francesca Bottanelli.

I find it confusing why the authors are insisting on keeping a piece of text that is so speculative and most likely wrong.

In this study, the authors investigate the mechanism behind Src activation-induced relocalization of a subset of Golgi enzymes, GALNTs, from Golgi to ER. In response to Src activation, authors observe GALNT2-GFP in Golgi-derived tubular structures. They also observed temporal activation of small GTPase Arf1 and phosphorylation of Arf1 GTP exchange factor, GBF1. The authors propose the model in which phosphorylation of GBF1 by Src results in GBF1-Arf1 complexes that generate membrane tubules for traffic GALNTs from Golgi to ER.</p><p>In the revised submission, Chia et al. have fixed the many errors in the manuscript, which has indeed improved its presentation. They also provided two new experiments and significantly updated the Discussion section. At the same time, authors mostly responded to our and other critiques not by performing requested experiments/controls but by referencing their own previously published work and by modifying the text. We believe that this kind of response is not adequate.</p><p>My main concerns are as follows:</p><p>1. As I have stated in the first round of review, to quantify Src-dependent Golgi-ER relocalization of Golgi enzymes, it is essential to provide reproducible, high-quality images quantify colocalization of HPL signal with ER and Golgi markers. The ratio of ER to Golgi signal is the most important parameter here. The work should be reproducible, and therefore mere references to previously published work are not sufficient. The model system (HeLa cells with inducible Src) is not adequately characterized in terms of relocalization of GALNTs from Golgi to ER. Specifically, images presented in Figure 1B and, even more strikingly, in Supplementary Figure 1C, H are not supporting the notion that ER/Golgi ratio of HPL signal (i.e. relocalization of GALNTs) has been changed significantly. Without proper verification that retrograde trafficking of Golgi enzymes is increased in a Src/GBF1-dependent manner, the title of the manuscript is not supported by the data since the direction of movement of GALNT-GFP-positive tubular structures is unknown.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for not addressing fully these concerns in the previous round of revision as we had not fully appreciated the concern raised. We understand the reviewer makes reference to the fact that both ER and Golgi Tn staining increases over time after Src stimulation. We have often observed this phenomenon before. The interpretation is that after neo-synthesised proteins are Tn-glycosylated in the ER, they traffic to the Golgi, thus raising the levels of Tn in this organelle as well. (Our unpublished data indicate that over 100 cell-surface proteins are hyper-glycosylated after relocation; we have published the data for MMP14, a well-described cell surface protease.) The ER relocation results in an amplification of total Tn staining in the cell, not just in the ER but also in ERGIC and Golgi. In other words, the “ER/Golgi ratio of HPL signal” is not actually reflecting the degree of relocalisation of GALNTs. As you could see clearly in Figure 1B, we show that VVL staining in the ER increases over time; it is a clear indication that GALNTs have relocated. In addition, we complement this result with the glycosylation of ER resident proteins in Figure 1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Endogenous Golgi cargo has not been detected in Golgi-derived tubules, suggesting that tubule formation could be an artifact of protein overexpression. Authors' arguments that &quot;tubules are transient in nature… it makes it harder to observe…chemical fixation significantly disrupts tubule integrity&quot; are valid in general, but not at the level of eLife quality paper. Moreover, for the majority of tubule imaging in the manuscript (Figures 1G, 2C, S1K, S2A), the authors successfully used chemical fixation to demonstrate the association of overexpressed proteins with tubular structures. If necessary, consider live cell microscopy.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. However, we have attempted to stain endogenous GALNT with antibodies but the immunofluorescence staining with the antibodies we have is inherently weak. Together with the transient nature of tubules (i.e. the cells must be emitting tubules at the time of fixation) and the disruptive nature of chemical fixation, we are unable to clearly observe tubules with endogenous GALNT. The reviewer has suggested live cell microscopy to demonstrate the tubules. In this version of the manuscript, we present more evidence using live microscopy to demonstrate the formation of GALNT2 tubules with the GBF1-YE mutant. Altogether, we have demonstrated tubules in various settings i.e. Src-induced and GBF1-YE mutant induced, using the GALNT2-GFP stable cell line.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Authors clearly shown that Src phosphorylates GBF1, and they identified target phosphorylation sites on GBF1. Authors are suggesting that upon Src activation, GBF1 binds to Arf1-GDP, and this complex stimulates the formation of GALNT carrying tubules. However, I still have a hard time aligning this hypothesis with the data presented in the manuscript. During the burst of Arf-GTP, one would assume that k-on exceeds k-off resulting in Arf-GTP levels peaking and Afr-GTP exceeding GBF1-Arf-GDP. However, starting from 10 min following Src activation, the GALNT tubules emanating from the Golgi are significantly increased. This would indicate that tubule formation is not really driven by GBF1-Arf-GDP because it peaks at 20-30 min, when GBF1-Afr-GDP would be at its lowest. In S2B they show that Arf-GTP levels are lower than the controls. In S5AandB, Afr-GTP level as low as the control condition. Authors conclude that constitutively active SrcEG has the same effect on Arf-GTP levels as phosphor-mimetic GBF1 resulting in low levels of Afr-GTP. One can imagine a hypothetical scenario where the entire pool of GBF1 is engaged with Arf-GDP. But, SrcEG cells do have increased HPL staining in the ER and Golgi which, as the authors claim, is due to GALNTs transported to the ER in GBF1-Arf dependent tubules. This would indicate that the transport of GALNTs to the Golgi is independent of Arf-GTP, which is at odds with the kinetics of tubule formation and Arf-GTP levels in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the interpretation of the kinetics and the levels of Arf-GTP is complicated. As mentioned above, we have markedly reduced the place of the hypothesis of GBF1-Arf-GDP and removed it from the model. A full dissection of the mechanisms at play and the role of the Arf-GTP will require further study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. As suggested by other reviewers, to validate the model that Src-dependent phosphorylation of GBF1 is causing relocalization of Golgi enzymes, it will be essential to show that inducible expression of GBF1 phospho-mimetic mutants Y876E and Y898E would drive Golgi to ER localization of GALNTs in the absence of Src activation.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, this has been done and while it took some optimising (relatively short expression time), we did observe significant tubule formation after GBF1 phosphomimetic expression (Figure 5C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors model is now more clear, but still not convincing. They are proposing that GBF1-Arf1-GDP complexes are tubulating membranes. There is no precedent for such an activity and other plausible explanations have not been ruled out. As stated in the previous review, an alternative explanation is that their observations are similar to those observed under BFA treatment. The Hsu and Luini groups explored one possibility for why BFA induces Golgi tubulation: (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21725317)</p><p>The authors model and cartoon for the GEF reaction in Figure 7A is too simplistic, as the step they label with &quot;kcat&quot; actually represents more than one step: first GDP must dissociate before GTP can dissociate. This is absolutely essential as GDP and GTP occupy the same binding site. Also, the use of &quot;kcat&quot; generally refers to the rate-limiting step, and this is exactly the point I am making – an increase in k<sub>on</sub> (which appears to be the consequence of phosphorylation) is irrelevant to the overall reaction rate constant if k<sub>on</sub> is not the rate-limiting step. The step labeled &quot;kcat&quot; could very well be rate-limiting (and at the very least there is no reason to conclude that it is not rate-limiting, which is what the authors appear to be claiming). Therefore, my original concern still stands: their data are most consistent with phospho-GBF1 forming a stable complex with Arf1-GDP, which will reduce, rather than enhance the kinetics of exchange.</p><p>I also note that in Figure 7, the authors have incorrectly used upper case 'K's, which are used for equilibrium constants, rather than lower case 'k's, which should be used for the rate constants that they are referring to. Furthermore, by convention kcat is used to refer to the overall rate constant of the reaction.</p><p>The authors claim in the rebuttal letter that the &quot;kcat&quot; step is unlikely to be rate-limiting because this is the case for &quot;most enzymes in metabolic pathways acting on small molecules&quot; is both unfounded and probably irrelevant to an exchange factor.</p><p>The authors claim that the Antonny, Chabre, and Cherfils paper supports their model but I strongly disagree. Yes, the mutant they used blocks exchange, and also stabilizes binding to Arf-GDP. The authors appear to be ignoring the fact that GDP must dissociate before GTP can bind. Strong binding to Arf-GDP will slow GDP dissociation, and therefore also slow the rate of exchange. The authors' strong language on these points does not make their logic any more correct.</p><p>The authors are twisting themselves in knots by explaining that their in vitro binding assay does not include GTP, rather than performing an actual exchange assay in which GTP is included. Rather than trying to argue with reviewers, they could simply perform an actual nucleotide exchange experiment to see whether phosphorylated GBF1 is a better GEF or not. Based on their proposed model for how tyrosine-phosphorylation within the Sec7-domain enhances GEF activity, this should be straightforward to perform using the Sec7-domain of GBF1, rather than the full-length protein which the authors note is difficult to purify.</p><p>Finally, from my perspective, I still don't understand why on the one hand, the authors are arguing that phosphorylation makes GBF1 a better GEF, yet on the other hand, the authors' model invokes a functional role for a stable GBF1-Arf1-GDP complex. Neither of these two possibilities is fully supported by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this extensive discussion.

Supporting this idea is the over-expression of GFB1 (wt) resulting in more Arf-GTP (Figure 3A). A simple interpretation is that increasing GBF1 amounts favors complex formation. Another way to increase the rate of complex formation would be to favor a conformation of GBF1 that binds better to Arf1-GDP. This would not prevent the intramolecular rearrangements that “kick” GDP out of Arf1.
