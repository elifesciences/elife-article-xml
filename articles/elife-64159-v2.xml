infection characterized by the inflammation of the leptomeningeal membranes. Many different viral and bacterial pathogens can cause meningitis, with differences in mortality rates, risk of developing neurological sequelae, and treatment options. Here, we constructed a compendium of digital cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome maps to define pathogen-specific host response patterns in meningitis. The results revealed a drastic and pathogen-type specific influx of tissue-, cell-, and plasma proteins in the CSF, where, in particular, a large increase of neutrophil-derived proteins in the CSF correlated with acute bacterial meningitis. Additionally, both acute bacterial and viral meningitis result in marked reduction of brain-enriched proteins. Generation of a multiprotein LASSO regression model resulted in an 18-protein panel of cell- and tissue-associated proteins capable of classifying acute bacterial meningitis and viral meningitis. The same protein panel also enabled classification of tick-borne encephalitis, a subgroup of viral meningitis, with high sensitivity and specificity. The work provides insights into pathogen-specific host response patterns in CSF from different disease etiologies to support future classification of pathogen type based on host response patterns in meningitis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>meningitis</kwd><kwd>cerebrospinal fluid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017.0271</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malmström</surname><given-names>Johan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015-02481</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malmström</surname><given-names>Johan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-05795</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malmström</surname><given-names>Johan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-05973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malmström</surname><given-names>Johan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003173</institution-id><institution>Crafoord Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20100892</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malmström</surname><given-names>Johan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004200</institution-id><institution>Stiftelsen Olle Engkvist Byggmästare</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012.0178</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malmström</surname><given-names>Johan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2012-StG-309831</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malmström</surname><given-names>Johan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004817</institution-id><institution>Lund University Medical Faculty Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malmström</surname><given-names>Johan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Statistical analysis and LASSO regression modeling provide insights into pathogen-specific host response patterns in cerebrospinal fluid from different disease etiologies to support future classification of pathogen type based on host response patterns in meningitis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meningitis is a common condition with an estimated annual prevalence of 8.7 million cases globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kassebaum et al., 2017</xref>). In the majority of cases, meningitis is caused by viruses, such as enteroviruses, and is associated with low mortality rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chadwick, 2005</xref>). Certain subtypes of viral meningitis (VM), such as tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), are in contrast associated with higher mortality rates and risk of developing neurological sequelae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bogovic and Strle, 2015</xref>). Acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) is one of the leading causes of death due to infectious diseases worldwide and is associated with rapid disease progression, increased risk of long-term neurological sequelae in survivors, and high mortality rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van de Beek et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van de Beek et al., 2006</xref>). The different bacterial and viral pathogens are associated with specific virulence mechanisms that impact the molecular phenotype of the host immune response. This information can be used to diagnose patients with meningitis, which routinely involves lumbar punctures to evaluate several parameters in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) such as the number of white blood cells (WBCs) as well as glucose and protein concentrations to differentiate between ABM and VM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ross et al., 1988</xref>). Unfortunately, these parameters are relatively non-specific yielding inconclusive diagnostic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garty et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lindquist et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nigrovic et al., 2002</xref>), and it currently remains unknown if different pathogens and pathogen types can evoke detectable differences in host response proteome.</p><p>Extracellular body fluids such as blood plasma, saliva, and CSF are deficient in the machinery required for de novo protein synthesis. The protein constituents of body fluids are generated via active protein secretion from surrounding tissues or from passive leakage derived from normal protein turnover from cells and tissues. During healthy conditions, the concentration of individual proteins in body fluids is maintained via a tightly controlled balance between protein secretion and clearance. This balance is altered in severe infectious diseases such as sepsis or meningitis due to the host responses triggered by the invading pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Malmström et al., 2016</xref>). In meningitis and sepsis, the immune response normally increases cellular and acellular mediators in the CSF and plasma, which leads to a drastic proteome reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karlsson et al., 2018</xref>). In the most severe stages of disease, host immune response becomes overwhelming, leading to organ damage and impaired prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van de Beek et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van de Beek et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Improved definitions of the pathogen or pathogen-type specific host response patterns in CSF could provide insights into specific virulence mechanisms, subsequently leading to the development of new diagnostic and prognostic information. However, detection of pathogen-specific host response patterns requires the analysis of large sample cohorts to compare host response patterns from a similar group of pathogens to all other pathogen types. As the protein composition of body fluids is produced elsewhere, mRNA transcript profiling is less suitable for the detection of host responses. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based protein quantification has become the preferred method for multiplexed and quantitative analysis of proteomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aebersold and Mann, 2016</xref>). The prevailing MS strategy relies on data-dependent acquisition (DDA), where the mass spectrometer sequentially selects and fragments trypsin-generated peptide ions to generate informative daughter fragment ion spectra used for database searching. Although such proteomics experiments enable identification of thousands of peptide ions, the strategy is associated with lower quantitative reproducibility, as in complex samples the number of available peptides exceeds the cycling time of the DDA method. In contrast, the recent development of sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH)-MS generates fragment ion spectra of all MS-measurable peptides to produce a digital representation of the analyzed proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gillet et al., 2012</xref>). In SWATH-MS, proteome maps are generated based on data-independent acquisition (DIA), followed by protein quantification using a priori established assay libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Teleman et al., 2017</xref>). Different assay libraries can be used to iteratively query the same DIA data in an iterative fashion, which is a considerable advantage as it permits a single data collection step for clinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2015</xref>) and focused reanalysis in future studies. Importantly, DIA is associated with a high degree of reproducibility, making it possible to merge data sets analyzed separately in time to perform cross-study comparisons. In this way, new opportunities emerge to construct compendiums of proteome maps from physical biobanks to identify protein patterns in body fluids associated with, for example, disease progression and treatment options.</p><p>In this study, we developed a compendium of SWATH-MS CSF proteome maps to provide novel insights into central nervous system (CNS) functioning and host response in a cohort of patients with meningitis. We demonstrate how an extendable compendium of proteome maps supports post-acquisition and iterative data analysis using cell- and tissue-derived assay libraries to define discriminatory protein panels associated with ABM or VM. The results revealed how meningitis generates pathogen-specific changes in the CSF proteome. Furthermore, the compendium of CSF proteome maps supported the identification of a protein panel capable of differentiating between ABM, VM, and TBE, a VM subgroup, with high sensitivity and specificity based on the host response patterns in the CSF.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Construction of a compendium of SWATH-MS CSF proteome maps from meningitis patients</title><p>Detection of pathogen-specific host responses in the CSF proteome requires comparative analysis of patient sample cases of meningitis caused by different pathogens. Here, CSF was collected by lumbar puncture from a cohort of 135 patients admitted to the hospital with the suspicion of meningitis. Following confirmed diagnosis, the patients were broadly subdivided into ABM (n = 35), neuroborreliosis (BM, n = 7), VM (n = 21), suspected ABM (n = 5), suspected VM (n = 16), and inflammation without infection (n = 2). In this cohort, ABM was caused by 11 different bacterial pathogens, where the most frequent pathogen was <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae.</italic> VM was caused by seven different viruses with the highest frequency of TBE and enteroviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Patients with suspected meningitis but with normal WBC count (&lt;5 × 10<sup>6</sup>/L) and with no clinical signs of infection/inflammation were regarded as a control group (n = 49). CSF from each sample was digested, and peptides were analyzed by DDA-MS for the construction of a CSF proteome assay library and DIA-MS to produce a compendium of proteome maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The CSF assay library was merged with previously established assay libraries from 28 healthy human organs or primary cells to enable the quantification of proteins enriched in relevant tissues such as brain, plasma, and immune cells. The assay library relied on the protein abundance in the analyzed tissues and provides a statistically significant relationship between proteins and tissues, which was integrated into our results to infer the most likely tissue origin of proteins detected in the CSF. The compendium of SWATH-MS files was subsequently interrogated with the merged human assay library followed by interrogation of assay libraries from the most common pathogens causing meningitis to determine protein profiles correlating with pathogen type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Method flow chart and patient cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Fifty microliters of CSF from each sample were prepared and analyzed using both shotgun mass spectrometry (MS) and sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH-MS) for the construction of CSF proteome assay library and production of a digital compendium of SWATH-MS proteome maps. These SWATH-MS maps were post-acquisition interrogated with previously established assay library from 28 healthy human organs or primary cells to enable the quantification of proteins enriched in relevant tissues such as brain, plasma, or immune cells. The SWATH-MS maps were further interrogated with the CSF assay library for determining protein profiles correlating with acute bacterial meningitis, viral meningitis, neuroborreliosis and control samples.

The sample group containing the largest number of unique proteins was ABM (n = 719 versus n = 544 in controls), followed by VM (n = 550) and BM (n = 478). On average, the total protein intensities in ABM were 2, 2.7, and 4.3 times higher than in BM, VM, and the control group, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This reflects an elevated protein concentration in CSF, associated in particular with bacterial meningitis. Analysis of the subcellular compartment of the detected proteins revealed that the majority of proteins are secreted (between 37% and 48% across all samples), followed by membrane-bound proteins, which comprised 18–24% of the total protein content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). The average intensity for the secreted proteins was 5.9-fold higher in ABM versus control and 2.7–2.9-fold higher in ABM when compared to BM or VM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). The distribution of quantified proteins in relation to sample groups is presented as a heat map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>. The sample clustering clearly subdivides the sample cohort into four distinct clusters representing predominantly the ABM, VM, and control samples. The row-wise color coding indicates inferred tissue origin based on the information from the assay library. The most distant sample cluster includes in principle all the ABM samples. The remaining sample clusters are more similar, but the general trend supports subdivision of most of the VM samples from the control samples. We observe that numerous neutrophil-, plasma-, and brain-associated proteins constitute on average 15–20% of the protein intensity, where, in particular, the neutrophil proteins increased during ABM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Plasma proteins are known to be major constituents of CSF under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guldbrandsen et al., 2014</xref>), and presence of brain-associated proteins in CSF is likely related to protein turnover in the brain. Statistical analysis between sample groups reveals 79 statistically induced or repressed proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–</xref>d). The majority of significantly altered proteins were associated with neutrophils (32% in ABM and 14% in VM), the brain (44% in ABM and 32% in VM), and some plasma proteins including several acute-phase proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4a, b</xref>). In addition, several neutrophil-associated proteins were induced ≥64-fold (yellow dots) but not statistically significant, indicating a large degree of variation associated with these proteins. For each group, the average intensities of all neutrophil proteins show a significant increase only in ABM compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), whereas there is a significant decrease in brain-associated proteins in ABM, VM, and TBE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Among the gene ontology (GO) terms enriched for the repressed proteins in ABM was ‘regulation of synapse maturation and assembly,’ suggesting changes on the cellular level in neuronal circuits during ABM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4c</xref>). Of the induced proteins, notable GO terms were ‘regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway,’ ‘defense response to bacterium,’ and ‘glial cell development.’ These suggest increased apoptotic pathways and enriched molecular processes specialized in combating bacteria in the CSF of patients with ABM, followed by increased development of glial cells, which are involved in maintaining chemical homeostasis and act as the immune cells of the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ransohoff and Brown, 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cerebrospinal fluid proteome analysis.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The quantified proteins (rows) and samples (columns) were clustered and visualized in a heat map.

In total, we included the four broader groups, ABM, BM, VM, and the control group. In addition, we included TBE as this group was associated with a distinct molecular host response. We used fourfold cross-validation to build a model for each of the five groups to distinguish the groups from each other. To assess the stability of our model, we repeated the process 100 times (runs), generating 2000 models in total (4 folds × 5 groups × 100 runs). All of the tested groups had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) above 0.80, and two of them had an AUROC above 0.90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). The protein profiles for ABM and control were reproducible across the 100 runs and specific, with a mean AUROC of 0.96 for ABM and 0.95 for controls. The models for BM and VM had a lower mean AUROC of 0.85 and 0.80, respectively. TBE displayed the most stable and discriminatory AUROC of 0.87 of all specific causative-agent subgroups, indicating that TBE evokes a distinct host response. In total, 18 proteins were detected in ≥90% of the 100 runs in every fold and had a nonzero weight, which were consistently used in the LASSO models for discriminating different sample groups. For these 18 predictive proteins, we visualized the distribution of the respective protein contribution to the models as box plots colored by the average weight (coefficient) over all 100 runs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Proteins with a nonzero coefficient had a positive influence on the model and are regarded as predictive proteins for the disease group as shown by the fill color of the box plots. The average intensity of the 18 proteins shows the differences in the abundance levels in their respective sample group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). 5 of the 18 proteins were in general detected in higher amounts in ABM and BM and include proteins such as gelsolin (GEL), cathepsin D (CATD), and transthyretin (TTHY) that are involved in neutrophil degranulation according to the Reactome Pathway Database. Nine of the proteins were exclusively elevated in ABM and include proteins involved in inflammatory response (A2GL, HPT A1T1), fibrin clot formation (HEP2, PROS), LPS binding (CD14), and regulation of the complement cascade (CFAH). Notably, these proteins are all found in lower concentrations in the control samples, and these proteins were mostly predictive for ABM and/or the control samples. In contrast, BM, VM, and TBE in general have less discriminatory weight coefficient. For TBE, monocyte differentiation antigen CD14 was elevated compared to the controls. Antithrombin-III, a serine protease inhibitor that regulates the blood coagulation cascade, was associated with a high weight coefficient and a relatively high abundance level in the VM group.

To investigate changes of the CSF proteome over time, we extended the compendium of proteome maps with an additional total of 36 CSF samples from ABM (six patients) and from patients with subarachnoidal hemorrhage (SAH, four patients). From these patients, there were multiple CSF samples collected up to 10–13 days after admittance to hospital (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>a). Four LASSO-predicted proteins for ABM remained elevated until the end of the 10-day period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), suggesting that sampling over a longer time period is required to observe the protein levels returning to baseline. The brain proteins with significantly lower levels in ABM started to increase during the extended follow-up times peaking around day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). In contrast, the proteins with significantly lower abundance in ABM compared to control cases show a slight increase over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), whereas the proteins with higher levels in ABM compared to control decreased in ABM over the 10 day-period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>).

In all cases, protein levels were low or absent in SAH. Interestingly, the LASSO-predicted proteins used for discriminating ABM tend to stay elevated even after the patients were released from hospital care. These results indicate an ongoing complex host response process that is unique to infectious neurological disease, such as ABM, and is absent in other types of neurological trauma such as SAH.

The quantified proteins have a median coefficient of variation (CV) for technical replicates below 20% as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2015</xref>). The compendium presented in this study comprised in total 171 CSF samples with different sample- and time-dimensions generated from &lt;50 μL of CSF. In SWATH-MS, the post-acquisition targeted data analysis strategy using previously established assay libraries confirms the presence and relative abundance of proteins. Once acquired, the compendium of SWATH-MS maps can be iteratively reanalyzed in silico to test new hypotheses. In this study, we used a highly curated assay library to search for tissue- or cell-enriched proteins informative for host response patterns associated with ABM, BM, TBE, and VM.</p><p>In severe infectious diseases, several factors may influence the type and magnitude of the host response, such as type of infecting pathogen, host immune status, and time of infection. The dysregulated host responses during sepsis and meningitis can be detrimental to the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iskander et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ward et al., 2008</xref>). At the same time, altered protein composition of CSF provides an opportunity to probe disease status of the complex interplay of factors driving the host response. Damage derived from the infectious process and/or the host response may generate detectable protein changes associated with, for example, organ damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malmström et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we used LASSO regression to define protein patterns capable of discriminating between ABM, BM, VM, TBE, and controls. Based on an assay library containing information of tissue- and cell-enriched proteins, the different disease groups had noticeable differences in protein patterns associated with neutrophils, blood plasma, and proteins predominantly present in the brain. The increased levels of neutrophil proteins are a consequence of infiltrating activated neutrophils, known to occur predominately during ABM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoffman and Weber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tunkel and Scheld, 1993</xref>). Neutrophils may release decondensed extracellular DNA coated with antimicrobial proteins called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moorthy et al., 2016</xref>). A recent study showed high levels of NETs in the CSF of patients with pneumococcal meningitis and that disrupting NETs using DNase I significantly reduces bacterial load, demonstrating that NETs contribute to the pathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mohanty et al., 2019</xref>). It is noteworthy that both ABM and VM introduce reduced levels of brain-specific proteins, although the overlap of the reduced proteins between ABM and VM is small. The reason for this reduction is not clarified, although it was previously reported that brain proteins decrease in CSF during other neurological disorders, such as Huntington's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The large number of disease-causing pathogens in meningitis leads to high heterogeneity in both patients and disease progression, and this variability can be seen in other severe infectious diseases such as sepsis. In order to account for this clinical diversity in medical research, traditional individual biomarker studies can be replaced with multiprotein panels to provide better coverage of the underlying disease. The LASSO regression model resulted in 18 predictive proteins. Proteins predictive of ABM include CATD and complement factor H (CFAH), both of which are known plasma proteins involved in clearance of specifically bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bewley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haapasalo et al., 2012</xref>). Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein (A2GL) has previously been suggested to be an inflammatory marker, and significantly higher levels of A2GL were reported in the CSF of children with ABM compared to febrile controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chong et al., 2018</xref>). Other studies have shown that the CSF levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) were higher in ABM compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoffman et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gutteberg et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, antithrombin-3 (ANT3), one of the predictive proteins for VM, has previously been shown to have a broad-spectrum antiviral activity for various human cytomegaloviruses and herpes simplex viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Quenelle et al., 2014</xref>). These results together indicate that large-scale multiprotein panels can yield biological and clinical insights that are difficult to achieve with traditional statistical analyses.</p><p>The high reproducibility of SWATH-MS is a consequence of the DIA, which generates fragment-ion spectra from all MS-measurable peptides from a proteome. This feature can support extension of the compendium to generate a digital representation of physical biobanks. In total, the sample cohort in this study consists of patients infected with 19 different pathogens, where the three largest groups were <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, enteroviruses, and TBE. Among these pathogen groups, the LASSO regression generated the highest AUC for TBE although the sample size was relatively small. There are currently no biomarkers for detecting and diagnosing TBE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bogovic and Strle, 2015</xref>). Future extension of the compendium will enable further investigations of pathogen-specific host responses for other pathogens in CSF. In addition, the opportunity to reanalyze the compendium in silico based on improved assay libraries will provide opportunities to find new protein patterns correlating with other types of clinical information such as disease outcome or the development of neurological sequelae. This goal can be achieved through either a data-driven process where samples are clustered based on similarities in the proteome changes or in a hypothesis-driven fashion where the compendium is interrogated for protein profiles correlating with, for example, pathogen type, infection time, or disease severity. The increasing efforts to construct complete assay libraries of the human proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matsumoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zolg et al., 2017</xref>) will provide improved definition of proteins enriched in particular cells and tissues and will enable quantification of additional proteins, post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosenberger et al., 2017</xref>), and proteolytically processed proteins from the already established compendiums of proteome maps. Ultimately such a resource can be anticipated to enable improved correlation between host responses and detectable changes in CSF and potentially blood plasma to identify molecular markers that can be used for the development of new diagnostic-, prognostic-, and treatment-decisive information for severe infectious diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patients and CSF samples</title><p>CSF samples (n = 171) from a total of 139 patients from two different cohorts were analyzed.

Secondly, spectra files were clustered through Mass Rarity Clustering approach by MaRaCluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">The and Käll, 2016</xref>). Ursgal package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kremer et al., 2016</xref>) was used as interface for searching the consensus spectra against data’s UniProt reference proteome using five search engines, namely MSGFPlus (version 2019.07.03), MS Amanda (version 2.0.0.17442, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dorfer et al., 2014</xref>), Comet (version 2019.01.rev5, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eng et al., 2015</xref>), X! Tandem (version alanine, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Craig and Beavis, 2004</xref>), and OMSSA (version 2.1.9, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geer et al., 2004</xref>). Optional Met Oxidation (UniMod: 35), Asp and Gln deamidations (UniMod: 7), along with the fixed Cys carbamidomethylation (UniMod: 4) modifications, were considered in this study. Individual engine results were validated by percolator (v3.4.0, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Käll et al., 2007</xref>), while the Combine FDR algorithm was implemented for combining results from all search engines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, a threshold of 1% peptide FDR was set for decisive candidate inclusion. In the final step, GTL database was built by all peptide’s b- and y-ions extraction and adding decoy assays, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Escher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Röst et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schubert et al., 2015</xref>). In this implementation, we use eight ion types: b, y, b(2+), y(2+), b-H<sub>2</sub>O, y-H<sub>2</sub>O, b-NH<sub>3</sub>, and y-NH<sub>3</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Human tissue atlas</title><p>The human tissue atlas was used to statistically assign all detected proteins (n = 771) to human tissue based on abundance. A total of 12 tissue assignments were used, which included the following tissues and cell types: adipose, brain, liver, nerve, erythrocytes, lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, platelets, and plasma. Proteins associated to other tissues that were available via the atlas are depicted here as ‘others.’ A protein was depicted as ‘not classified’ if the abundance could not be statistically associated to only one tissue or if it was missing from the atlas altogether. The tissue assignments of certain proteins used in further analyses in this study were compared and matched against other, publicly available and published protein tissue-assignment repositories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For statistical analyses, a Benjamini–Hochberg-corrected t-test was used. GO annotations were performed by using two unranked lists of proteins with GOrilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eden et al., 2009</xref>). For the LASSO modeling, the proteomic data was first log-transformed, scaled, and centered (i.e., log10 of the abundances, subtraction of the per-protein mean and division by the per-protein standard deviation). This data was then used as the input to the LASSO implementation of the LiblineaR package of the R statistical programming language (R version 3.6.1; LiblineaR version 2.10–8). A fourfold cross-validation approach was used for model building, where the samples were split randomly into four balanced groups (same proportion of pathogen type as the whole cohort). For each of the four groups, the model was trained on 3/4 of the data and the performance was evaluated on the remaining 1/4, and this modeling was performed 100 times. Proteins that received a nonzero weight coefficient (as in the value of that protein has an influence on the model) in ≥90% of all models were selected for further analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Filip Årman for his help with the bioinformatics when generating the pathogen libraries. <italic>Funding</italic>: This work was supported by the Swedish Research Council (project 2015-02481 and project 2018-05795), the Crafoord Foundation (grant 20100892), Stiftelsen Olle Engkvist Byggmästare, the Wallenberg Academy Fellow program KAW (2012.0178 and 2017.0271), European Research Council starting grant (ERC-2012-StG-309831), and the Medical Faculty, Lund University.

They used it to measure a large meningitis patient panel that had been clinically classified into different bacterial and viral pathogens. In particular bacterial infection resulted in an increased protein concentration and neutrophil protein content, while in general brain but i.e. also apoptosis-related proteins were found to be variable. The proteomic profiles of CSF are distinct from a control group and, based on a selected subset of proteins, allow to discriminate the type of pathogen with decent sensitivity and specificity. It is demonstrated to those changes last for a surprisingly long period of time in patients after clinical display.</p><p>The manuscript is technically well done, well written and presented. The strength of this study is that it capitalizes on the strength of swath MS in a biological system where protein quantification is without any alternative. Another strength is the relatively large patient panel, although it breaks down to smaller numbers for some of the less frequent pathogens. The panel described here may be used to assess the disease status of patients and maybe further explored for diagnostic potential in the future.</p><p>In some cases the actual pathogens may have left their peptides in CSF.

Pathogen-specific changes to the CSF proteome was observed. The authors identify specific proteins that could classifying the type of pathogen that caused meningitis. Major strengths of this work include (1) rigorous proteomic analysis, (2) an unusual patient cohort characterized by a diversity of pathogens (bacterial, viral, neuroborreliosis), (3) the ability to perform direct comparisons of distinct pathogen-induced proteomic changes in CSF, and (4) generation of a predictive model based on the proteomics dataset. The data as presented support the conclusion that distinct pathogens induce shared as well as distinct changes to the CSF proteome. No technical weaknesses were noted. However, the likely impact of this work on the field remains limited. There have been many other proteomic studies of the CSF to identify meningitis biomarkers. While this work builds on these previous proteomic datasets, it remains unclear whether this dataset is more robust, reproducible, or representative versus some of the other published datasets (PMID 26040285, 28765563, 20608875, etc.; reviewed in 31404562).</p><p>1.

In fact, at the onset of this project our main aims were to detect both pathogen-specific and -induced host patterns in the CSF as well as peptides from the infecting pathogen directly in these CSF patient samples to increase predictive power of our analysis. To accomplish this goal, we generated 8 different pathogen assay libraries for the most prevalent pathogens; <italic>Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>. The pathogens were by grown in vitro and analyzed by DDA and DIA to generate the libraries. We have now made the source data and the assay libraries publicly available and deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD024904 as a resource for the community. Description of the bacterial sample preparations and data analysis for the library generation is in the &quot;Materials and methods&quot; section. Unfortunately, the samples in this cohort were sterile filtered, which is a possible explanation why we could not detect the proteomes from the microorganisms in these samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Instead, we added a new figure supplement &quot;Figure 4—figure supplement 1&quot; (Visualization of the 18 predictive proteins in volcano plots), where we have reproduced the same volcano plots from Figure 2 in a larger format. In these volcano plots we have included all the protein labels for each of the 18 predictive proteins as requested.
